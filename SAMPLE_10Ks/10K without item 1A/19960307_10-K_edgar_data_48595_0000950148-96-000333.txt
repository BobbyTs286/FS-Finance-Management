 PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

 Starwood Lodging Trust, formerly Hotel Investors Trust (the
"Trust"), was organized in 1969 as a Maryland real estate investment trust, and
has invested in fee, ground leasehold and mortgage loan interests in hotel
properties located throughout the United States.

 In order for the Trust to qualify for favorable tax status as
a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code"), the Trust leases its properties to third party operators. In
1980, Starwood Lodging Corporation, formerly Hotel Investors Corporation (the
"Corporation" and, together with the Trust, "Starwood Lodging"), was organized
as a Maryland corporation and has leased hotel properties from the Trust since
that date.

 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein
to "Starwood Lodging" refer to the Trust and the Corporation, and all
references to the "Trust" and to the "Corporation" include the Trust and the
Corporation, respectively, and those entities respectively owned or controlled
by the Trust or the Corporation, including the Realty Partnership (defined
below) and the Operating Partnership (defined below).

 Since 1980, the shares of beneficial interest of the Trust
("Trust Shares") and the shares of common stock of the Corporation
("Corporation Shares") have been "paired" on a one-for-one basis and may only
be held or transferred in units consisting of one Trust Share and one
Corporation Share ("Paired Shares"). The Code has prohibited the "pairing" of
shares between a REIT and a management company since 1983. This rule does not
apply to the Trust because its Paired Share structure has existed since 1980.

 At December 31, 1995, Starwood Lodging owned equity interests
in 36 hotel properties, including two hotel/casinos, and owned mortgage
interests in another 13 hotel properties. At such date, of the 36 hotels in
which Starwood Lodging owned an equity interest (including the two
hotel/casinos), four hotels were being managed by third-party operators and
three hotels were leased to a third-party operator. For information as to such
interests and properties, see Item 2 of this Joint Annual Report.

 ACQUISITION STRATEGY

 Starwood Lodging intends to continue to expand and diversify
its hotel portfolio through the acquisition of primarily midscale and upscale
hotels in major metropolitan areas. Starwood Lodging believes that hotels
primarily in these segments can be purchased at prices below replacement cost
and offer better potential for cash flow growth than hotels in other market
segments. Starwood Lodging generally seeks investments in hotels where
management believes that such hotels' profits can be increased by the
introduction of more professional and efficient management techniques or the
injection of

1
 5
capital for maintenance and renovations. Properties are targeted throughout
the United States, but Starwood Lodging generally focuses on markets located
near other properties owned and operated by Starwood Lodging, markets with
significant barriers to entry or markets with stable demand generators such as
universities, government agencies or large companies.

 Consistent with this strategy, Starwood Lodging acquired
equity and mortgage interests in the following hotels during 1995:

(1) Represents a mortgage interest. The equity interest was purchased on
 January 4, 1996 for approximately 13.5 million. This hotel is now
 known as the Westin Washington.

 In addition, during the first month of 1996, Starwood Lodging
completed the acquisition of the Grand Hotel in Washington D.C. for an
additional 13.5 million and for approximately 41.6 million, acquired a 58.2 
interest in a joint venture that acquired the 960-room Boston Park Plaza and
related real estate assets in Boston, Massachusetts.

 Starwood Lodging is evaluating numerous other hotel
properties for acquisition, and as of the date of this Joint Annual Report has
entered into agreements to purchase and has made offers on eight properties in
the aggregate amount of approximately 170 million, all but one of which are
subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions prior to closing.
Starwood Lodging has fully performed under such other agreement to purchase;
however, the closing remains subject to certain limited conditions on the part
of the other parties. Starwood Lodging intends to finance the acquisition of
these or other hotel properties through cash flow from operations, through
borrowings under credit facilities and, when market conditions warrant,
through the issuance of debt or equity securities.

 The Trust and the Corporation intend that the Operating
Partnership lease and operate hotels owned or acquired by the Realty
Partnership thereby retaining for shareholders the economic benefits otherwise
retained by third party operators. During 1995, the

2
 6
Operating Partnership assumed management of 13 hotels and in January of 1996
assumed management of the Grand Hotel in Washington, D.C. (now a Westin hotel)
and the Boston Park Plaza. In addition, in early 1996, the Operating
Partnership expects to terminate two of the third-party management agreements
currently in place for three hotels which are currently majority owned by the
Realty Partnership and operated on behalf of the Operating Partnership by
third-party management companies. Upon such termination, the Operating
Partnership intends to assume the management of these hotels.

 THE REORGANIZATION

 On January 31, 1995 (the "Closing Date"), the Trust and the
Corporation consummated a reorganization (the "Reorganization") with Starwood
Capital Group, L.P. ("Starwood Capital") and certain affiliates of Starwood
Capital (the "Starwood Partners") effective January 1, 1995.

 The Reorganization involved a number of related transactions
that occurred simultaneously on the Closing Date. Such transactions included
(i) the contribution by the Trust to SLT Realty Limited Partnership (the
"Realty Partnership"), a newly formed Delaware limited partnership, of
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Trust, subject to
substantially all of the liabilities of the Trust (including the senior debt
(the "Senior Debt") of the Trust), in exchange for an approximate 28.3 
interest as a general partner in the Realty Partnership, (ii) the contribution
by the Starwood Partners to the Realty Partnership of approximately 12.6
million in cash and certain hotel properties and first mortgage notes, in
exchange for limited partnership units representing the remaining approximate
71.7 interest in the Realty Partnership, (iii) the contribution by the
Corporation and its subsidiaries to SLC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership" and together with the Realty Partnership, the
"Partnerships"), a newly formed Delaware limited partnership, of substantially
all of their properties and operating assets (except for their gaming assets,
which are to be contributed upon approval by Nevada gaming authorities),
subject to substantially all of their liabilities, in exchange for an
approximate 28.3 interest as a general partner in the Operating Partnership,
and (iv) the contribution by the Starwood Partners to the Operating Partnership
of approximately 1.4 million in cash and fixtures, furnishings and equipment
of the hotel properties, in exchange for limited partnership units representing
the remaining approximate 71.7 interest in the Operating Partnership. On
March 24, 1995, a Starwood Partner exchanged 12 million of Senior Debt for
additional limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership resulting in the Starwood Partners owning approximately
74.6 of each of the Partnerships.

 The following equity interests and mortgage notes were
contributed to the Realty Partnership by the Starwood Partners in the
Reorganization:

(1) Represent first mortgage notes bearing interest at 8 payable quarterly
 in arrears. The mortgage notes have a 15-year amortization period and a
 balloon payment at maturity. The mortgage notes mature on December 31,
 2002 and are cross-collateralized.

(2) The mortgage notes bear interest at various rates and are payable
 monthly in arrears, except that for the months of November 1994 through
 April 1995, debt service for the Atlantic City Quality Inn was to accrue
 and be paid from excess cash flow. Commencing May 1, 1995 fixed
 payments of debt service were required to be resumed. The mortgages
 mature between 1996 and 2010.

As part of the Reorganization, the Realty Partnership assumed certain mortgage
notes payable, all of which were refinanced during 1995 with the proceeds of
the Prior Credit Agreement (defined below) or the Facilities (defined below).
The terms of the assumed mortgage notes are summarized as follows:

 A 39,013,000 note issued in connection with the acquisition of the
 Harvey mortgage notes receivable under the terms of a Loan Agreement
 with a third party dated October 15, 1993. The note was nonrecourse,
 was to mature on January 31, 2003 and bore interest on a monthly basis
 at variable rates based on the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR")
 plus 3 .

 A 2,122,000 construction loan funded in 1994 and used to renovate the
 Harvey Wichita Hotel. The note bore interest at 7.5 . Principal and
 interest was payable monthly and the note was to mature in the year
 2000.

In addition, as part of the Reorganization, the Realty Partnership assumed
other mortgage notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of 17,750,000,
which notes were refinanced with the proceeds of the Loan (defined below)
pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement.

 THE OFFERING

4
 8
 On July 6, 1995, Starwood Lodging completed a public offering
(the "Offering") of 11,787,500 Paired Shares at a price of 23.00 per Paired
Share. Net proceeds of the Offering of approximately 245.7 million in
aggregate were contributed by the Trust and the Corporation to the Realty
Partnership and the Operating Partnership, respectively, thereby increasing the
general partnership interest of the Trust and the Corporation to approximately
69.9 of the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership, respectively,
with the Starwood Partners' limited partnership interests representing the
remaining approximate 30.1 interest in each of the Partnerships. Proceeds
from the Offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit
Agreement. Shortly prior to the Offering, the Trust and the Corporation
effected a one-for-six reverse stock split of the Paired Shares in which each
six Paired Shares held on the record date for the reverse split were converted
into one Paired Share.

 STRUCTURE

 As of the date of this Joint Annual Report, the structure of
Starwood Lodging is as follows:

Holders of Paired Shares

Starwood Lodging Starwood Lodging
 Trust Shares are Corporation
 Owns 69.9 of SLT ------------------ Owns 69.9 of SLC
 Realty Limited Paired Operating Limited
 Partnership Partnership

 SLT Realty SLT Operating
 Limited Partnership Limited Partnership

 Starwood Partners
 Own 30.1 of each of SLT Realty
 Limited Partnership and SLC Operating
 Limited Partnership

 The limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership held by the Starwood Partners are (subject to the
ownership limit provisions of the Trust and the Corporation) exchangeable by
the Starwood Partners, for, at the option of the Trust and the Corporation,
either cash, Paired Shares of Starwood Lodging representing up to approximately
30.1 of the Paired Shares after such exchange, or a combination of

5
 9
cash and such Paired Shares. The ownership limit provisions of Starwood
Lodging are designed to preserve the status of the Trust as a REIT for tax
purposes by providing that in general no shareholder may own, directly or
indirectly, more than 8 of the outstanding Paired Shares.

 Since the Reorganization, the Trust has conducted substantially
all of its business and operations through the Realty Partnership. As of
December 31, 1995, the Realty Partnership held fee interests, ground leaseholds
and mortgage loan interests in 49 hotel properties containing over 10,500 rooms
located in 21 states throughout the United States and the District of Columbia.
The Trust controls the Realty Partnership as the sole general partner of the
Realty Partnership.

 Since the Reorganization, the Corporation (together with its
wholly-owned subsidiaries) has conducted substantially all of its business and
operations (other than its gaming operations) through the Operating
Partnership. As of December 31, 1995, the Operating Partnership leased from
the Realty Partnership all but four of the 35 hotel properties owned in fee or
held pursuant to long-term leases by the Realty Partnership. In addition, the
Operating Partnership owns a 51 general partnership interest in a joint
venture that owns the Milwaukee Marriott hotel.

 GAMING APPROVALS

 Upon receipt of Nevada gaming regulatory approvals, the
Corporation will control the Operating Partnership as its managing general
partner. Prior to the receipt of such approvals, the Operating Partnership is
being managed by a management committee, the members of which are identical to
the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation that will hold office
upon receipt of Nevada gaming regulatory approvals (see Item 10 of this Joint
Annual Report) and the gaming operations (which consist of two hotel/casinos
located in Las Vegas, Nevada) are being operated through Hotel Investors
Corporation of Nevada ("HICN") a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.
Upon receipt of such approvals (or such time as such approvals are no longer
required), HICN will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating
Partnership. Nevada gaming regulatory approvals are expected to be received by
the end of 1997.

 CREDIT FACILITIES

 On July 25, 1995, the Realty Partnership and the Trust, entered
into a Mortgage Loan Funding Facility Agreement (together with subsequent
amendments the "Repo Facility") with Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ("Lehman
Commercial Paper"). Pursuant to the Repo Facility, Lehman Commercial Paper has
agreed to advance up to 71 million to the Realty Partnership for a period of
18 months ending January 25, 1997. Advances under the Repo Facility bear
interest at a rate based on one month LIBOR plus 150 basis points for the
period ending July 25, 1996 and one month LIBOR plus 175 basis points
thereafter and are secured by certain mortgage notes receivable and other
collateral of the Realty Partnership.

6
 10
 On October 25, 1995, the Realty Partnership and the Trust
entered into a line of credit agreement (together with subsequent amendments,
the "Acquisition Facility") with Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc ("Lehman
Holdings") pursuant to which Lehman Holdings agreed to make advances to the
Realty Partnership of up to 135 million for a period expiring on October 1,
1998. The Acquisition Facility superseded and replaced the Prior Credit
Agreement.

 Advances under the Acquisition Facility bear interest at a rate
based upon one, two or three-month LIBOR plus 162.5 basis points and are
secured by liens on 29 of the hotel equity interests of the Realty Partnership
and may be secured by other properties, all on a cross-collateralized basis. A
 60 million portion of the Acquisition Facility is being syndicated. Up to 58
million of the obligations under the Acquisition Facility has been guaranteed
by the Operating Partnership, in consideration for the cancellation by the
Realty Partnership of intercompany indebtedness in 1994. Such guaranty is
secured by first priority liens on all of the assets of the Operating
Partnership relating to the hotels owned or leased by the Realty Partnership
which are subject to liens under the Acquisition Facility.

 The Repo Facility and the Acquisition Facility (together, the
"Facilities") contain a number of covenants including (i) a requirement that
the Realty Partnership maintain a net worth equal to at least 215 million plus
75 of the net proceeds of equity offerings by the Trust; (ii) a restriction on
the ability of the Realty Partnership and the Trust to incur combined
indebtedness in excess of 55 of the net book value of their combined assets;
and (iii) maintenance of certain loan to value and debt service coverage
ratios. The Facilities also provide a right of the Trust and the Corporation,
subject to certain limitations, to pay distributions to their shareholders.
See Item 5 - Distributions of this Joint Annual Report.

 In addition, on January 17, 1996, the Realty Partnership entered
into 100 million in notional amount Treasury Lock Transactions with Merrill
Lynch and Chemical Bank. The transactions have the effect of fixing the base
interest rate at 5.7 percent for up to 100 million of debt, with an assumed
term of seven years from October 15, 1996, issued by the Realty Partnership on
or before October 15, 1996. The actual rate of interest is expected to be the
base rate plus an amount determined at the time of issuance based on several
factors including, without limitation, any credit enhancements provided by
Starwood Lodging, the terms and conditions of the specific transaction, and
then existing market conditions.

 PRIOR DEBT REFINANCING

 On March 24, 1995, the Realty Partnership and the Trust entered
into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement")
pursuant to which the Realty Partnership borrowed 131.75 million (the "Loan")
primarily to refinance all outstanding Senior Debt and approximately 27
million of first mortgage debt. The Loan was to mature on April 1, 1997 and
bore interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus 300 basis points. All amounts
outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement were repaid with a portion of the
proceeds of the Offering and the Prior Credit Agreement was superseded and
replaced by the Acquisition Facility.

 TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

 The Trust intends to elect to be taxed as a REIT, commencing
with its taxable year ended December 31, 1995. The Trust expects to make this
election for the year ended December 31, 1995 when it files its tax return for
such period, which is due no later than September 15, 1996. The Trust was
taxed as a REIT beginning in 1969 through and including its taxable year ended
December 31, 1990. During 1994, the Trust discovered that it may not have
qualified as a REIT in 1991 through 1994 due to its failure to comply with
certain procedural requirements of the Code. The Trust requested and received
a letter from the Internal Revenue Service providing that the Trust's election
to be taxed as a REIT terminated beginning with the Trust's taxable year ended
December 31, 1991 and permitting the Trust to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT
commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1995. Because the Trust
had net losses for tax purposes for its 1991 through 1994 taxable years, the
Trust does not owe any federal income tax for such years.

 OTHER INFORMATION

 Seasonality and Competition. The hotel industry is seasonal
in nature. Generally, hotel revenues are greater in the second and third
quarters than in the first and fourth quarters due to generally decreased
travel during the winter months.

 The hotel industry is highly competitive. The properties of
the Trust and the Corporation compete with other hotel properties in their
geographic markets. Many of the competitors of the Trust and the Corporation
may have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than Starwood
Lodging.

 The Trust and the Corporation may compete for acquisition
opportunities with entities which have substantially greater financial
resources than the Trust and the Corporation. These entities may generally be
able to accept more risk than the Trust and the Corporation can prudently
manage. Competition may generally reduce the number of suitable investment
opportunities and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to
sell. Further, management of the Trust believes that it will face competition
for acquisition opportunities from entities organized for purposes
substantially similar to the objectives of the Trust.

Environmental Matters. Neither the Trust, the Corporation,
the Realty Partnership nor the Operating Partnership has been identified by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or any similar state agency as a
responsible or potentially responsible party for, nor have they been the
subject of any governmental proceeding with respect to, any hazardous waste
contamination. If the Trust, the Corporation, the Realty Partnership or the
Operating Partnership were to be identified as a responsible party, they would
in most circumstances be strictly liable, jointly and severally with other
responsible parties, for environmental investigation and clean-up costs
incurred by the government and, to a more limited extent, by private persons.

 In connection with the Acquisition Facility, preliminary or
"Phase I" environmental site assessments were prepared with respect to 29 of
the Trust's fee interest and ground leasehold properties. The results of the
Phase I assessments and subsequent "Phase II" assessments performed at six of
the properties led to an assessment by the Trust and its outside consultants
that the Trust's overall potential for environmental impairment was low.

 A release of petroleum from an underground storage tank at the
Bay Valley Hotel and Resort was reported to the appropriate state agency in
1992. After the tank and surrounding soils were removed, additional soils and
groundwater testing was performed, which revealed environmental contamination
in a localized area. Environmental testing has been performed to identify the
vertical and horizontal extent of the contamination released from the tank.
The consultant initially proposed to remedy the contamination through
installation of a groundwater pump and treatment system to capture and treat
impacted groundwater and excavation of about 390 cubic yards of impacted soil.
Recent amendments to the relevant state environmental clean-up laws reduced the
extent of the clean-up required at the site and the Trust is now only required
to monitor the site. Any further remediation costs that are incurred will be
borne by the Realty Partnership.

 With respect to the remaining majority owned fee-interest
properties, a 1991 Phase I environmental assessment and a tank leak test
conducted at the Bourbon Street Hotel in early 1992 and a Phase I environmental
assessment prepared for the Milwaukee Marriott in 1991 revealed no material
impairments. The last six properties acquired by Starwood Lodging (the Doral
Inn in New York, New York, the Terrace Garden Inn and Lenox Inn in Atlanta,
Georgia, the Holiday Inn in Beltsville, Maryland, the Grand Hotel in
Washington, D.C., and the Boston Park Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts) had Phase
I environmental assessments prepared in 1995 which evidenced no material
impairments.

 Based upon the environmental reports described above, the
Trust believes that a substantial number of its hotels incorporate potentially
asbestos-containing materials. Under applicable current Federal, state and
local laws, asbestos need not be removed from or encapsulated in a hotel unless
and until the hotel is renovated or remodeled. The Trust has asbestos
operation and maintenance plans for each property testing positive for
asbestos.

 Based upon the above-described environmental reports and
testing and facts known to the managements of the Trust and the Corporation,
future remediation costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Trust or the
Corporation and compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not
expected to have a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position of the Trust or the Corporation.

 Regulation and Licensing. The ownership and operation of the
casino gaming facilities of the Corporation in Nevada are subject to extensive
licensing and regulatory control by the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada
Sate Gaming Control Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing
Board. See Item 2, "Regulation and Licensing" of this Joint Annual Report.

9
 13
 Employees. As of December 31, 1995, the Trust had four
employees and the Corporation had approximately 3,800 employees.

 The Trust's executive offices are located at 11835 West
Olympic Boulevard, Suite 695, Los Angeles, California 90064 (telephone (310)
575-3900) and the Corporation's executive offices are located at 11835 West
Olympic Boulevard, Suite 675, Los Angeles, California 90064 (telephone (310)
575-3900).

 Financial information with respect to the two segments of the
hospitality industry (hotels and gaming) in which the Corporation operates is
included in Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Joint Annual Report.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

 At December 31, 1995, the Trust owned and the Corporation
operated and managed, a portfolio of hotel assets, including fee, ground
leasehold and first mortgage interests. At such date, all but four of the
Trust's fee and ground leasehold hotels were leased to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries pursuant to leases between the Trust and the Corporation (the
"Intercompany Leases").

 As described in Item 1 of this Joint Annual Report, upon the
closing of the Reorganization, substantially all of the properties and assets
of the Trust were contributed to the Realty Partnership and substantially all
of the properties and assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries (except
for their gaming assets, which are to be contributed upon approval by Nevada
gaming authorities) were contributed to the Operating Partnership.

 Accordingly, since the Reorganization, the Trust has conducted
substantially all of its business and operations through the Realty Partnership
and the Corporation has conducted substantially all of its business and
operations (other than its gaming operations) through the Operating
Partnership. As of the date of this Joint Annual Report, the Trust had an
approximate 69.9 interest in the Realty Partnership and the Corporation had an
approximate 69.9 interest in the Operating Partnership.

 THE TRUST AND THE REALTY PARTNERSHIP

 Equity Investments. As of December 31, 1995, the Trust had
equity investments in 35 properties (including two hotel/casinos) containing a
total of over 7,100 guest rooms. As of that date, the Trust owned fee
interests in 30 hotels (including two hotel/casinos), held three hotels
pursuant to ground leases, owned one hotel partially in fee and partially
pursuant to a ground lease, and also had a 5 equity interest in, and was the
general partner of, a limited partnership that owns the Omaha Marriott Hotel
which contains 303 guestrooms. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Joint Annual Report. Of the 35 hotels in which the
Trust had an equity interest at December 31, 1995, 23 operate under one of the
following nationally recognized names: Sheraton(R),

10
 14
Marriott(R), Doubletree(R), Omni(R), Radisson(R), Embassy Suites(R), Holiday
Inn(R), Residence Inn(R), Days Inn(R), Best Western(R) and Vagabond Inn(R).

 Each of the Intercompany Leases provides for the lessee's
payment of annual minimum rent in a specified amount plus additional rent based
on a percentage of the gross revenues (or items thereof) of the leased
property. The Intercompany Leases have an average remaining term of four
years. The Intercompany Leases are "triple-net" - i.e., the lessee is
generally responsible for paying all operating expenses of the hotel property,
including maintenance and repair costs, insurance premiums and real estate and
personal property taxes, and for making all rental and other payments required
pursuant to any underlying ground leases. As lessee, the Operating Partnership
retains all of the profits, net of rents and other expenses, and bears all risk
of losses, generated by the hotel property's operations.

 In addition to the Intercompany Leases, the three Vagabond
Inns are leased to a third party and such leases expire in 2001, 2007 and 2008,
respectively. The lease expiring in 2001 contains options to extend the term
of the lease for two additional five year periods. Each of these leases
provides for the payment of percentage rent equal to 26 of room revenues
against specified minimum rents. The leases are "triple net."

 The following table sets forth the 1995, 1994, and 1993
average occupancy, room rates, revenue per available room ("REVPAR") and
certain other information concerning the hotels owned by the Trust as of
December 31, 1995:

(8) Property is subject to a ground lease expiring in September 2008,
 which is terminable by the ground lessor after September 1, 1999 upon

 Mortgage and Other Notes Receivables. At December 31, 1995,
in addition to the three promissory notes related to the Milwaukee Marriott
referred to below, the Trust held eighteen promissory notes either contributed
by the Starwood Partners as part of the Reorganization or executed by
third-party purchasers of its hotels, all of which are secured by mortgages
(including deeds of trust) on thirteen hotels in the aggregate. Eleven of the
notes 104.1 million in aggregate principal amount at December 31, 1995) are
secured by first mortgages; five notes 1.6 million in aggregate principal
amount as of December 31, 1995) are secured by second mortgages; one note 1.3 million in principal amount as of December 31, 1995) is secured by a
third mortgage; and one note 173,000 in principal amount as of December 31,
1995) is secured by a fourth mortgage. Ten of the notes have fixed interest
rates that currently range from 7.0 to 10.0 per annum and five of the notes
have variable interest rates that range from 7.16 to 9.75 per annum at
December 31, 1995. The remaining three notes require principal payments only.
Two of the notes also provide for contingent interest based on a percentage of
the gross revenues of the properties securing such notes. The maturity dates
of the notes range from 1996 to 2017.

 For additional information with respect to certain of the third-party
promissory notes and the three promissory notes held by the Trust and issued by
a partnership affiliated with the Corporation in connection with the Milwaukee
Marriott Hotel, see Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Joint Annual Report.

 In December 1987, in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of
the leasehold interest in two Atlanta, Georgia area hotels owned by the Trust
(which have been subsequently sold) from an affiliated partnership, John F.
Rothman, former president and chief executive officer of the Trust and general
partner of the partnership, assumed certain obligations of such partnership,
which obligations are evidenced by an unsecured promissory note to the Trust in
the principal amount of 800,000. Interest on the outstanding principal amount
of this note accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 and is payable annually;
the entire principal amount of the note is due in December 1999.

19
 23
 All of the notes described above were contributed by the Trust or the
Starwood Partners to the Realty Partnership in connection with the
Reorganization.

 THE CORPORATION AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

 At December 31, 1995, 28 of the 31 hotel properties leased by
the Trust to the Corporation were operated directly by the Corporation, and the
remaining three were managed by three independent hotel companies. The
Operating Partnership, the general partner of the partnership that owns the
Milwaukee Marriott, also operates the Milwaukee Marriott.

 The following table sets forth the 1995, 1994 and 1993 average
occupancy and room rates, REVPAR, and certain other information concerning the
hotel in which the Operating Partnership is the general partner, Milwaukee
Marriott Hotel, as of December 31, 1995.

Management Agreements. Each management agreement with a third
party provides that the management company has the exclusive right to direct
the operations of the hotel subject to that agreement. The management company
is responsible for maintaining and making all necessary repairs to the managed
hotel, hiring, training and supervising all hotel employees, and performing all
hotel bookkeeping and other administrative duties.

 Each management company is required to submit to the Operating
Partnership for its approval an annual budget that includes proposed capital
expenditures, and the management company makes only those capital expenditures
that are approved by the

20
 24
Operating Partnership. The Realty Partnership is required to make available to
each management company sufficient working capital to permit that company to
operate the managed property.

 For their services in managing the hotels, each third party
management company receives a management fee equal to a specified percentage
(generally 2 - 2-1/2 of the gross revenues of the managed hotel, plus
additional incentive fees based upon the hotel's operating profits. Two of the
management agreements expire in 1998 and one expires in 1999. Of the remaining
four third-party management agreements currently in place, two are expected to
be terminated in early 1996 and management of the underlying properties assumed
by the Operating Partnership.

 Franchise Agreements. All but twelve of the hotel properties
in which Starwood Lodging had an equity interest at December 31, 1995 are
operated pursuant to franchise or license agreements ("Franchise Agreements").
The Franchise Agreements generally require the payment of a monthly royalty fee
based on gross sales and various other marketing fees associated with certain
marketing or advertising and centralized reservation service funds, usually
based on gross sales. Such fees may vary among individual hotels within a
franchise system based on the type of marks, restaurants or other aspects of
the franchise system used.

 The Franchise Agreements generally contain specific standards
for, and restrictions and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of the
hotels which are established by the franchisors to maintain uniformity in the
system created by each such franchisor. Such standards generally regulate the
appearance of the hotel, quality and type of goods and services offered,
signage, and protection of marks. Compliance with such standards could require
significant expenditures for capital improvements.

 Ongoing training costs, requirements to purchase only from
approved suppliers, financial reporting requirements, insurance requirements
and various covenants not to compete imposed upon the franchisee are other
common terms in the Franchise Agreements. Required insurance usually must
cover both the franchisor and franchisee with respect to certain specified
liabilities, must fall within certain approved coverage limits and be written
by an approved insurance company.

 The Franchise Agreements generally require the consent of the
franchisor to a transfer of an interest in the applicable franchise, and both
the consent of the franchisor and the execution of a new franchise agreement in
the event of a transfer of all or controlling portion of the franchisee under
the relevant Franchise Agreement. In addition, some franchise agreements may
require payment of an initial fee upon establishment of a franchise
relationship.

Mortgage Notes Payable Maturing During 1996

 Six mortgage notes payable secured by two hotels mature in
1996. Five of the mortgage notes, aggregating 31.2 million at December 31,
1995, are secured by the

21
 25
Milwaukee Marriott, in which the Corporation holds a 51 interest. All but
 2.9 million in principal amount of these notes are held by the Trust. The net
book value of the Milwaukee Marriott is 22.1 million at December 31, 1995.
One mortgage note in the amount of 25.1 million at December 31, 1995, is
secured by the Boston Park Plaza, in which the Trust acquired a 58.2 interest
in January 1996.

Regulation and Licensing

 The ownership and operation of the casino gaming facilities of
Starwood Lodging in Nevada are subject to extensive licensing and regulatory
control of the Nevada Gaming Commission (the "Nevada Commission"), the Nevada
State Gaming Control Board (the "Nevada Board") and the Clark County Liquor and
Gaming Licensing Board (the "Clark County Board" and, together with the Nevada
Commission and the Nevada Board, the "Nevada Gaming Authorities").

 The gaming laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of
Nevada seek to (i) prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any
direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (ii)
establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; (iii)
maintain effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including
establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the
safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and
making periodic reports to the Nevada Gaming Authorities; (iv) prevent cheating
and fraudulent practices; and (v) provide a source of state and local revenues
through taxation and licensing fees. Changes in these laws, regulations and
procedures could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's gaming operations.

 The Corporation is registered with the Nevada Commission as a
publicly traded corporation and has been found suitable as a holding company by
the Nevada Gaming Authorities to own all of the outstanding capital stock of
HICN. HICN which operates two hotel/casinos, the King 8 Hotel, Gambling Hall &
Truck Plaza (the "King 8") and the Bourbon Street Hotel & Casino ("Bourbon
Street") is licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Trust was likewise
found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities to be the landlord of the King
8 and Bourbon Street. No person may become a stockholder of, or receive any
percentage of profits from, HICN without first obtaining licenses and approvals
from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Prior approval of the Nevada Commission is
required for the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any
security issued by HICN.

 The licenses and approvals held by HICN are not transferable
and must be renewed periodically upon the payment of appropriate taxes and
license fees. The licensing authorities have broad discretion with regard to
the renewal of the licenses. The issuing agency may at any time revoke,
suspend, condition, limit or restrict a license or approval to own stock in a
corporate licensee for any cause deemed reasonable by the issuing agency.
Substantial fines for each violation of gaming laws or regulations may be
levied against HICN, the Corporation and the individuals involved. A violation
under any one of the

22
 26
licenses held by HICN may be deemed a violation of one or more other licenses
or approvals held by HICN. If HICN's licenses are revoked or suspended or are
not renewed, the Nevada Commission may petition a Nevada district court to
appoint a supervisor to operate the affected property until it is sold. When
sold, the net proceeds would be paid to the Trust. The Trust could, however,
under certain circumstances, receive only the reasonable rental value of any
property earnings under the supervisor's management with any excess in earnings
over the reasonable rental value of the property being forfeited to the State
of Nevada. Suspension or revocation of the license of HICN, disapproval of the
Corporation to own the stock of HICN or court appointment of a supervisor over
operations of the King 8 or Bourbon Street could have a material adverse effect
upon the Trust and the Corporation.

 Directors, officers and certain key employees of HICN must
file license applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Certain
officers, directors and key employees of HICN are licensed by the Nevada Gaming
Authorities, and any required license applications of the remaining officers,
directors or key employees have been filed with the Nevada Board. An
application for licensing may be denied for any cause deemed reasonable by the
issuing agency. Changes in corporate management or executive positions must be
reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. In addition to its authority to
deny an application for a license, the Nevada Commission has jurisdiction to
disapprove a change in a management or executive position with a regulated
corporation. If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find a director, officer
or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a
relationship with HICN or the Corporation, the Corporation and HICN would have
to sever all relationships with that person. The Corporation and HICN would
have similar obligations with regard to any person who refused to file
appropriate applications. Each gaming employee must obtain, and periodically
renew, a work permit, which may be revoked upon the occurrence of certain
specified events.

 HICN must submit detailed financial and operating reports to
the Nevada Commission, which are subject to routine audit by the Nevada Board.
Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing
transactions entered into by HICN must be reported to or approved by the Nevada
Commission. The fiscal stability of HICN must be adequate to satisfy gaming
financial obligations such as state and local government taxes and fees, and
the payment of winning wagers to patrons. Failure to satisfy these gaming
financial obligations is grounds for the Nevada Gaming Authorities to limit,
condition, restrict, suspend or revoke the gaming licenses and approvals of
HICN and the registration and approvals of the Corporation, or to impose
administrative fines against HICN or the Corporation.

 As a registered publicly traded holding company found suitable
as the sole stockholder of HICN, the Corporation is required periodically to
submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and to
furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission or Nevada Board may
require. The Corporation's directors, officers and key employees who are
actively and directly engaged in the administration or supervision of gaming
are subject to licensing and findings of suitability by the Nevada Commission.
Certain directors and officers of the Corporation have filed their license

23
 27
applications as requested by the Nevada Board. The finding of suitability is
comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal
background and personal financial information followed by a thorough
investigation, and payment by the applicant of all investigative costs and
charges. Any individual who is found to have a material relationship to or
material involvement with the Corporation also may be required to be found
suitable or be licensed and may be investigated. Key employees, controlling
persons or others who exercise significant influence upon the management or
affairs of the Corporation, or are actively engaged in the administration or
supervision of gaming activities, may be deemed to have this type of a
relationship or involvement.

 Any beneficial holder of the Corporation's voting securities,
regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an
application, be investigated, and have his suitability as a beneficial holder
of the Corporation's voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has
reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the
declared policies of the state of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of
investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such
investigation.

 Any person who acquires more than 5 of any class of voting
securities of the Corporation must report the acquisition to the Nevada
Commission. Beneficial owners of more than 10 of any class of the
Corporation's voting securities must apply to be found suitable by the Nevada
Commission within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the
written notice requiring such filing, and any beneficial owner of the
Corporation's voting securities, whether or not such person is a controlling
stockholder, may be required to be found suitable if the Nevada Commission has
reason to believe that such ownership would be inconsistent with the declared
policy of the state of Nevada that licensed gaming be conducted honestly and
competitively and that the gaming industry be free from criminal and corruptive
elements.

 An "institutional investor" (as defined by the Regulations of
the Nevada Commission) holding at least 10 , and in certain circumstances up to
15 , of the voting securities of the Corporation may apply for and hold a
waiver of the mandatory suitability determination requirement prescribed by the
Nevada Gaming Control Act. To qualify as an "institutional investor," a person
or entity must satisfy one of several alternative criteria under the federal
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, or state
and federal pension and retirement laws, as well as acquire and hold the voting
securities for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business and not
for the purpose of effecting any change of control in or the management or
policies of the registered holding company or its gaming affiliates.
Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting
securities for investment purposes only include: (i) voting on all matters
voted on by stockholders; (ii) making financial and other inquiries of
management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational
purposes and not to cause a change in its management, policies or operations;
and (iii) such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be
consistent with such investment intent.

24
 28
 A change in investment intent of an institutional investor
must be reported to the Chairman of the Nevada Board within two business days
of such change of intent. The Chairman of the Nevada Board may require an
institutional investor to apply for a finding of suitability upon receipt of
notice of change in investment intent, or at any time deemed necessary to
protect the public interest. An aggrieved institutional investor may apply for
Nevada Commission review of the decision of the Chairman of the Nevada Board
ordering the filing of a suitability determination application. The
Corporation or HICN must promptly report to the Nevada Commission any
information that materially affects the institutional investor's eligibility to
hold a waiver.

 If the stockholder who must be found suitable is a
corporation, partnership or trust, that stockholder must submit detailed
business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. In
addition, the Clark County Board has taken the position that it has the
authority to approve all persons owning or controlling more than two percent of
the stock of a gaming licensee or of any corporation controlling a gaming
licensee. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.

 Any stockholder found unsuitable by the Nevada Commission who
directly or indirectly holds any beneficial or ownership interest in the
Corporation's Common Stock beyond whatever period of time may be prescribed by
the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. Any person who
fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30
days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or Chairman of the
Nevada Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions that apply to a
security holder who is found unsuitable may be held to apply to a beneficial
owner of the Corporation's securities if the record owner, after request, fails
to identify the beneficial owner. The Corporation is subject to disciplinary
action if, after receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a
stockholder or to have any other relations with the Corporation or its gaming
subsidiaries, the Corporation (i) pays the unsuitable person any dividend or
interest upon any voting securities of the Corporation or makes any other
unpermitted payment or distribution of any kind whatsoever; (ii) recognizes the
exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights in the Corporation's
securities by the unsuitable person; (iii) pays the unsuitable person any
remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in certain
limited and specific circumstances; or (iv) fails to pursue all lawful efforts
to require the unsuitable person to divest himself of his voting securities,
including, if necessary, the immediate purchase by the Corporation of the
voting securities for cash at fair market value. In addition, Nevada law
requires that any holder or owner of a voting security who is found unsuitable
by the Nevada Commission immediately offer those securities to the Corporation
for purchase, which securities would be purchased by the Corporation for cash
at fair market value within 10 days from the date the securities are offered.

 The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the
holder of any debt security of a corporation registered under the Nevada Gaming
Control Act to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own
the debt security of a registered corporation. If the Nevada Commission
determines that a person is unsuitable to own such debt security, then pursuant
to the Regulations of the Nevada Commission, the registered

25
 29
corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without
the prior approval of the Nevada Commission it (i) pays to the unsuitable
person any dividend, interest or other distribution whatsoever; (ii) recognizes
any voting right of such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;
(iii) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or (iv) makes any
payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion,
exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction.

 The Corporation is required to maintain a current and
comprehensive stock ledger in the state of Nevada, which ledger may be examined
by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at all reasonable times, but without notice.
If any securities are held in trust, by an agent or by a nominee, the owner of
record of those securities may be required to disclose the identity of the
beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make this
disclosure may be grounds for finding the owner of record unsuitable. The
Corporation must render maximum assistance to the Nevada Gaming Authorities in
determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

 The Nevada Commission has the power at any time to require
that the Corporation's stock certificates bear a legend to the general effect
that the securities of the Corporation are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control
Act and the regulations of the Nevada Commission. However, to date, the Nevada
Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Corporation. The Clark
County Board also claims jurisdiction to approve or disapprove holders of the
Corporation's securities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities, through the power to
regulate licensees and otherwise by Nevada law, have the power to impose
additional restrictions on the holders of the Corporation's securities at any
time.

 The Regulations of the Nevada Commission provide that changes
in the control of the Corporation or HICN through a merger, consolidation,
acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of
takeover cannot occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.
Entities seeking to acquire control of the Corporation must satisfy the Nevada
Board and Nevada Commission in a variety of stringent standards prior to
assuming control of the Corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require
controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a
material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire
control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process
relating to the transaction.

 The Nevada Legislature has declared that some corporate
acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of securities and corporate
defense tactics affecting corporate gaming licensees in Nevada, and publicly
traded corporations affiliated with those licensees may be injurious to stable
and productive corporate gaming operations. The Nevada Commission has
established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potential adverse effects of
these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to advance Nevada's
policy to (i) assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and
their affiliates; (ii) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business
in the corporate form; and (iii) promote a neutral environment for the orderly
governance of corporate affairs. Approvals may be required from the Nevada
Commission before the Corporation may make exceptional

26
 30
repurchases of securities above current market price (commonly referred to as
"greenmail"), and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be
consummated. Nevada's gaming regulations also require prior approval of the
Nevada Commission in the event of a Corporation plan of recapitalization
proposed by the board of directors in opposition to a tender offer made
directly to shareholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the
Corporation.

 Nevada law prohibits the Corporation from making a public
offering of its securities without the approval of the Nevada Commission if any
part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction,
acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend
obligations incurred for one or more such purposes. Approval of the public
offering will not constitute a finding by the Nevada Commission as to the
accuracy, adequacy or investment merit of the securities offered to the public.
Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

 The gaming regulatory requirements discussed above apply to
certain aspects of the Reorganization. The contribution by HICN of the Gaming
Assets (and the transfer of certain liabilities to be retained by HICN) to the
Operating Partnership will occur on receipt of certain licenses or approvals by
the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Likewise, the election of the new members of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation since the Reorganization will be
effective upon receipt of certain licenses or approvals by the Nevada
Commission. Nevada gaming regulatory approvals are expected to be received by
the end of 1997. In conjunction with applying for and obtaining such licenses
and approvals, the Corporation has developed various policies and procedures
subject to review, approval and oversight by the Nevada Board. The purpose of
these corporate policies and procedures is to ensure compliance with the
regulatory requirement that prior approval of the Nevada Commission is obtained
for any transaction that would result in either Starwood Capital or Starwood
Partners acquiring control of the Corporation or its Nevada gaming operations.
The Corporation expects that these policies and procedures will be eliminated
upon receipt of certain licenses and approvals from the Nevada Commission. If
the required licenses or approvals of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are not
received on or before December 31, 1996, then on such date HICN has agreed to
contribute to the Operating Partnership cash equal to the fair value of the
Gaming Assets on such date.

 License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on
the type of gaming involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the
County of Clark where HICN's gaming operations are conducted. Depending upon
the particular fee or tax involved, these assessments are payable either
monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either (i) a percentage of
the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operations; (ii) the number of
slot machines or other gaming devices operated by the casino; or (iii) the
number of table games operated by the casino. A casino entertainment tax is
also paid by the licensees where entertainment is furnished in connection with
the selling of food or refreshments.

27
 31
 The sale of alcoholic beverages by HICN is subject to
licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Board. Such liquor
licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The Clark County Board has
full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any liquor license, and any
disciplinary action of this nature or license revocation would have a material
adverse effect on HICN's gaming operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

 During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Trust and the
Corporation completed settlements of two purported class action complaints and
one complaint which was purportedly brought on behalf of the Trust and the
Corporation (collectively, the "Shareholder Actions"). The Shareholder Actions
were brought in 1991 and 1992 in each case in connection with the Trust's
purchase of the Ramada Inn in Indian Wells, California (which has been
subsequently sold) and its two hotel/casinos.

 The two purported class actions were filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California in August 1991
and February 1992 against the Trust, the Corporation and certain current and
former officers, Directors and Trustees. The complaint alleged fraud,
violations of federal and California securities laws, the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and ERISA. The actions sought
compensatory damages, rescission and/or treble and exemplary damages plus
interest, costs and attorney's fees and statutory damages under ERISA. The
third action was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California for
San Diego County in March 1992 against current and former officers, Directors
and Trustees and alleged breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence and
corporate waste. The action sought compensatory damages, certain remuneration
and costs.

 The plaintiffs and defendants in the Shareholder Actions
entered into stipulations of settlement providing for the release of all claims
that were or might have been made in the Shareholder Actions and provided for a
 3,250,000 cash settlement fund which, after payment of fees and expenses of
plaintiffs' counsel, was distributed to the certified plaintiff classes. The
Trust and the Corporation paid 400,000 into the settlement fund, with the
balance of the settlement being paid by the insurance company that issued the
directors and officers policy applicable to the period to which the Shareholder
Actions relate and by two former officers and Trustees of the Trust. The Trust
and the Corporation paid the legal fees and other costs incurred prior to
October 12, 1993 by the defendants in the Shareholder Actions. Holders of an
aggregate of 199,833 Paired Shares (as adjusted for the one-for-six reverse
stock split in June 1995), all of which were owned by Mr. Leonard Ross and his
affiliates (collectively, "Ross"), opted out of the Shareholder Action and did
not share in the settlement.

 As required by the stipulation, the Trust's Board of Trustees
and the Corporation's Board of Directors established a joint transaction
committee of independent Trustees and Directors to make recommendations to
those Boards with respect to any transaction proposed by management and having
a fair market value of 20 million or more.

28
 32
 In connection with the settlement of the Shareholder Actions,
Messrs. Ronald A. Young and John F. Rothman and certain of their affiliated
partnerships terminated the management agreements (the "Management Contracts")
that existed between those partnerships and the Corporation's subsidiary,
Western Host, Inc. ("Western Host"), and Western Host agreed not to dispute
such action and withdrew as a general partner of two additional affiliated
partnerships. In satisfaction of any damages that the Trust and the
Corporation may incur as a result of the termination of the Management
Contracts, Messrs. Rothman and Young paid 800,000 to the Trust and the
Corporation. They also agreed to be responsible for a percentage of any
retroactive adjustments in worker's compensation insurance premiums. Starwood
Lodging has paid 167,041 for retroactive worker's compensation insurance
premiums and has sought reimbursement from Messrs. Young and Rothman of their
share of that amount (in an aggregate amount of approximately 56,000). In
October 1995, the Corporation commenced litigation against Messrs. Young and
Rothman to collect such amounts (Starwood Lodging Corp. v. Ronald A. Young, et
al., San Diego Superior Court Case No. 693822).

 Ross, who as of December 31, 1994 held approximately 9.8 of
the outstanding Paired Shares of the Trust and Corporation (approximately 1.4 
as of December 31, 1995), opted out of the settlement of the Shareholder
Actions. Ross threatened to bring a separate action alleging similar causes of
action as those alleged in the Shareholder Actions as well as other alleged
causes of action. In November 1994, Ross assigned to Starwood Capital all of
his claims against the Trust and Corporation. In connection with such
assignment, Starwood Capital agreed to purchase all of Ross's Paired Shares at
Ross's election during a 60-day period beginning in December 1995, at a price
of 33.75 per Paired Share subject to certain adjustments. Starwood Capital,
as the assignee of Ross's claims against the Trust and the Corporation, agreed
that the maximum amount Starwood Capital may recover under such claims would
not exceed an aggregate of 1.8 million and the Trust and the Corporation
agreed to toll the statute of limitations respecting such claims until January
31, 1996. The Trust and Corporation also agreed that under certain
circumstances they may be obligated severally to indemnify Starwood Capital
with respect to Starwood Capital's obligations to Ross, up to a maximum of 1.8
million, upon receipt of a full release from Starwood Capital of all of the
claims assigned by Ross.

 Ross elected to sell his Paired Shares, and in January 1996
those Paired Shares were sold to a third party through Merrill Lynch. The
Paired Shares were sold at a price of 29.625 per Paired Share; the Trust and
Corporation paid 1,375,743 in the aggregate pursuant to their indemnity
obligations, and Starwood Capital released the Trust and the Corporation from
all the claims assigned to it by Ross.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

 On December 7, 1995, (i) the Trust held its 1995 annual meeting of
shareholders of the Trust (the "Trust Meeting") to elect two Trustees to the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and to approve a share option plan of the Trust
and (ii) the Corporation held its 1995 annual meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation (the "Corporation Meeting") to elect four

29
 33
Directors to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and to approve a stock
option plan of the Corporation.

 At the Trust Meeting, shareholders of the Trust voted upon and approved
(i) the election as Trustees of the Trust of Messrs. Madison F. Grose and
William E. Simms, and (ii) the adoption of the 1995 Share Option Plan of the
Trust. Messrs. Lapin, Quazzo, Duncan, Stern and Sternlicht continued as
Trustees after the Trust Meeting.

Due to the impact of the Reorganization and other transactions during 1995,

historical information which follows the discussion of the pro forma results of

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED COMBINED PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Trust and the Corporation have unilateral control of the Realty Partnership
and the Operating Partnership, respectively, and, therefore, the historical
financial statements of the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership
are consolidated with those of the Trust and the Corporation.

Due to the impact of the Offering and the acquisition of properties acquired in
connection with the Offering, the historical results of operations and earnings
per share are not indicative of future results of operations and earnings per
share. The Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Statements of Operations for the years
ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 give effect to the Reorganization, the
Offering, and the acquisition of the Sheraton Colony Square in Atlanta,
Georgia, the Embassy Suites in Tempe, Arizona, and the Omni Europa in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina as of the beginning of each period presented. Pro forma
results include the results of the other acquired properties (the Doral Inn in
New York, New York - acquired on September 20, 1995, the Terrace Garden Inn and
Lenox Inn in Atlanta, Georgia - acquired on October 31, 1995, and the Holiday
Inn in Beltsville, Maryland - acquired on November 30, 1995) from their
respective dates of acquisition and exclude the results from properties sold in
1994. Additional pro forma information reflecting the inclusion of the Doral
Inn, Terrace Garden Inn, Lenox Inn and the Beltsville Holiday Inn (the "New
Properties") from the beginning of each respective period is included in Note
18 to the historical financial statements included in Item 8 of this Joint
Annual Report. The pro forma information is based upon historical information
and does not purport to present what actual results would have been had such
transactions, in fact, occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or
to project results for any future period.

Listed below are the combined pro forma adjustments for each contributed and
acquired hotel:

NOTE 2. NET INCOME PER PAIRED SHARE

Net income per Paired Share has been computed using the pro forma weighted
average number of Paired Shares and equivalent Paired Shares outstanding for
the period presented of 13,822,617 Paired Shares.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 As discussed in Item 1 of this Joint Annual Report under the
caption "The Reorganization", the Trust and the Corporation consummated the
Reorganization on the Closing Date effective as of January 1, 1995. Since the
Reorganization, the Trust has conducted substantially all of its business and
operations through the Realty Partnership and the Corporation has conducted
substantially all of its business and operations (other than its gaming
operations) through the Operating Partnership. The Trust controls the Realty
Partnership as its sole general partner. The Corporation controls the
Operating Partnership as its managing general partner, although until the
receipt of required gaming approvals, a management committee of the Operating
Partnership will manage the Operating Partnership.

 As discussed in Item 1 of this Joint Annual Report under the
caption "The Offering", on July 6, 1995, the Trust and Corporation consummated
a public offering of Paired Shares and received aggregate net proceeds of
approximately 245.7 million.

 As discussed in Item 1 of this Joint Annual Report under the
caption, "Credit Facilities" in 1995 the Realty Partnership entered into the
Repo Facility and the Acquisition Facility and, as of December 31, 1995, had
borrowed 119.1 million to acquire hotel assets and for general corporate
purposes.

COMBINED PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PRO FORMA NET INCOME

 On a pro forma basis (see Item 6, Pro Forma Financial
Statements), combined net income for the year ended December 31, 1995 grew by
15.2 to 21.1 million, or 1.53 per Paired Share, on combined revenues of
 176.6 million, compared to combined net income of 18.4 million, or 1.33 per
Paired Share, on combined revenues of 159.2 million for the corresponding
period in 1994. On a year-to-year basis, while occupancy rates

37
 41
remained relatively constant, average daily rate ("ADR") for Starwood Lodging's
owned and operated nongaming hotels for the year ended December 31, 1995
(including the New Properties in each year), increased 11.2 , from 67.43 to
 74.98, and REVPAR for such hotels increased 12.9 , from 47.61 to 53.76.

 The 10.9 increase in pro forma revenues for 1995 resulted
from the impact of revenues from the New Properties together with increases in
ADR for Starwood Lodging's upscale, midscale and economy segment hotels of
14.4 , 4.4 (2.2 excluding the Dallas, Texas property which lost the benefit of
a Marriott franchise in 1994) and 10.0 percent, respectively. Management
believes that ADR increases, particularly in the upscale segment, reflect
increases in demand which continue to exceed increases in supply. The increase
in the economy segment (consisting of two hotels) primarily reflects
management's decision to reposition and flag the formerly independent Portland,
Oregon property in October of 1994.

 The following tables summarize average occupancy, ADR and
REVPAR on a year-to-year basis for Starwood Lodging's owned and operated,
nongaming hotels (including the New Properties for the period beginning with
their respective dates of acquisition and ending at the end of each period) for
the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.

Years Ended
 December 31,
 1995 1994
 ---- ----
 
 All Nongaming Hotels: 
 Occupancy rate 71.7 70.6 
 ADR 74.98 67.43
 REVPAR 53.76 47.61
 REVPAR change 12.9 

 Upscale Hotels:
 Occupancy rate 73.0 71.8 
 ADR 86.39 75.49
 REVPAR 63.78 54.20
 REVPAR change 17.7 

 Midscale Hotels (excluding Dallas
 Park Central):
 Occupancy rate 68.8 68.5 
 ADR 58.44 55.99
 REVPAR 39.92 38.35
 REVPAR change 4.1 

38
 42

Economy Hotels:
 Occupancy rate 79.1 73.6 
 ADR 61.40 55.81
 REVPAR 48.57 41.08

 REVPAR change 18.2 

Management believes that the increases in REVPAR resulted
primarily from increases in demand due to more favorable economic conditions
which have created increased business and leisure travel throughout the United
States, while the supply of hotel rooms has not increased as rapidly. REVPAR
increases were greatest at the upscale hotels (16.3 increase) as well as the
Harvey Hotel in Wichita, Kansas (renovated in 1994) and the Days Inn in
Portland, Oregon, which was flagged a Days Inn in late 1994.

 Management believes that there are several important factors
that have contributed to the improved profitability of Starwood Lodging's hotel
properties, including increased occupancy and average room rate and effective
cost management. Because a substantial portion of the hotels' operating costs
and expenses are generally fixed, Starwood Lodging derives substantial
operating leverage from increases in revenue. Consequently, primarily as a
result of the stronger growth in ADR than in occupancy, gross margins for the
year ended December 31, 1995 rose to 30.6 from 28.9 for the year ended
December 31, 1994.

ACQUISITIONS

 During 1995, excluding the properties contributed as part of
the Reorganization, Starwood Lodging acquired: the 168-room Omni Hotel in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina; the 462-room Sheraton Colony Square Hotel in
Atlanta, Georgia; the 224-room Embassy Suites in Tempe, Arizona; the 652-room
Doral Inn in New York, New York; a 19.5 million mortgage interest in the
263-room Grand Hotel in Washington, D.C.; the 364-room Terrace Garden Inn and
the 180-room Lenox Inn in Atlanta, Georgia; and the 206-room Calverton Holiday
Inn in Beltsville, Maryland. In the first month of 1996, Starwood Lodging
acquired the equity in the Grand Hotel in Washington, D.C., and a 58.2 
interest in a joint venture that acquired the Boston Park Plaza. In total,
Starwood Lodging's growth through acquisitions since the beginning of 1995 has
exceeded 250 million, including the assumption by the Operating Partnership of
the management of eight of these hotels containing over 2,800 rooms.

SELF MANAGEMENT

 Consistent with its business objective to capture the economic
benefits otherwise retained by a third-party operator, the Operating
Partnership has assumed management of eight hotels acquired since the beginning
of 1995 as well as seven properties owned as of January 1, 1995. Of the
remaining four third-party management agreements currently in place, two are
expected to be terminated in early 1996 and management of the

39
 43
underlying properties assumed by the Operating Partnership. Management
believes that the assumption of direct control over the operations of these
hotels will allow Starwood Lodging to effectively use its experience to improve
operations and implement renovations and expansions.

RENOVATIONS AND REPOSITIONING HOTELS

 Starwood Lodging has commenced an estimated 10.0 million
renovation and conversion of the Dallas property to a Radisson. Additionally,
Starwood Lodging has commenced an estimated 6.0 million renovation of the
Atlanta Sheraton Colony Square Hotel and a 2.0 million renovation of the
Portland Riverside Inn. Starwood Lodging reflagged the Grand Hotel in
Washington, D.C. as a Westin effective February 1, 1996 and is currently
negotiating the flagging of the French Quarter Suites Hotel in Lexington,
Kentucky which is expected to benefit from a national franchise affiliation and
reservation system. Starwood Lodging is currently planning renovations of the
Doral Inn, the Boston Park Plaza and certain other properties and may plan and
commence other renovations of existing and new properties as it deems
appropriate. Renovations of specific hotels are expected to have a negative
impact on the revenues of such hotels during the pendency of major renovations.

GAMING

 Revenues from the two hotel/casinos in Las Vegas declined 1.1
million to 26.9 million reflecting a reduction in revenues primarily at the
Bourbon Street casino. Earnings from the two hotel/casinos declined 840,000
in line with the decrease in revenues. Both properties are currently being
marketed for sale.

INTEREST INCOME

 Interest from mortgage and other notes, on a pro forma basis,
increased slightly reflecting interest received from the mortgage on the Grand
Hotel for the last three months of 1995 and which was partially offset by
overall reduced interest income for the year ended December 31, 1995, primarily
due to repayment of notes secured by mortgages on hotels in Albany, Georgia,
Irving, Texas, Stockton, California and Jefferson City, Missouri.

OTHER INCOME

 Other income of 2.0 million for the year ended December 31,
1995 was 1.0 million higher than the previous year.

 Included in other income for the year ended December 31, 1995
are (i) 800,000 received as a result of the termination of management
contracts in connection with the settlement of certain shareholder actions
against former officers of Starwood Lodging (see Item 3 of Part I) and (ii) the
retention of a 500,000 deposit related to the failure of the

40
 44
prospective purchaser of the Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino to complete the
purchase of the hotel from Starwood Lodging.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATING EXPENSES

 Administrative and operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 1995 increased to 5.7 million representing 3.2 percent of total
revenue, from 4.2 million or 2.6 percent of revenue for the corresponding
period in 1994. The increases were primarily a result of increases in payroll
costs due to additions to the corporate staffs of Starwood Lodging.

INTEREST EXPENSE

 On a pro forma basis, interest expense declined approximately
 300,000 to 2.9 million in 1995, reflecting a lower amount outstanding in 1995
on notes payable secured by the Milwaukee Marriott together with lower overall
interest rates in 1995 as compared to 1994.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

 Depreciation and amortization on a pro forma basis increased
to 18.9 million in 1995 reflecting depreciation relating primarily to the New
Properties.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 In March and October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of" and No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
respectively. These statements are effective for financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. Management believes that
adoption of Standard No. 121 will not have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations. Management intends to adopt the disclosure
method of Standard No. 123 and, accordingly, there will be no impact on
Starwood Lodging's financial position or results of operations.

COMBINED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. The principal
source of cash to be used to fund Starwood Lodging's operating expenses,
interest expense, recurring capital expenditures and dividend payments is cash
flow provided by operating activities. Starwood Lodging anticipates that its
cash flow provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds on
a short and long term basis to meet the cash requirements described above,
including all distributions to shareholders.

41
 45
 Cash flows from Investing and Financing Activities. Starwood
Lodging intends to finance the acquisition of additional hotel properties,
major hotel renovations and other non-recurring capital expenditures through
cash flow from operations, through borrowings under the Facilities and, when
market conditions warrant, through the issuance of equity or debt securities.
As of December 31, 1995, the Realty Partnership had borrowed approximately
 119.1 million under the Facilities to fund the acquisition of the New
Properties.

 As previously discussed, Starwood Lodging has commenced an
approximately 10.0 million renovation and conversion of the Dallas Park
Central Hotel to a Radisson, an approximately 6.0 million renovation of the
Atlanta Sheraton Colony Square Hotel and an approximately 2.0 million
renovation of the Portland Riverside Inn. Starwood Lodging is currently
planning renovations of the Doral Inn and the Boston Park Plaza and may plan
and commence other renovations of existing and new properties as it deems
appropriate. Renovations of specific hotels are expected to have a negative
impact on the revenues of such hotels during the pendency of major renovations.
Management believes the renovations should result in increases in REVPAR and
cash flow after completion.

 From January 1, 1995 to the date of the filing of this Joint
Annual Report, Starwood Lodging has invested over 225 million in acquiring
hotels 171 million plus capital expenditures of 4.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1995). As part of its investment strategy, Starwood Lodging
plans to acquire additional hotels. Starwood Lodging intends to incur
additional indebtedness in a manner consistent with its policy of maintaining a
Ratio of Debt - to - Total Market Capitalization of not more than 50 .
Management of each of the Trust and the Corporation believes that it will have
access to capital resources sufficient to satisfy the cash requirements of each
of the Trust and of the Corporation and to expand and develop their business in
accordance with their strategy for future growth.

 The Trust paid dividends in the fourth quarter of 1995 by
declaring a dividend of 0.47 per Paired Share for the quarter ended September
30, 1995 which was paid on October 27, 1995. The Trust also declared a
dividend of 0.47 per Paired Share for the fourth quarter ended December 31,
1995 which was paid in January of 1996.

 Pro Forma Funds From Operations. Management believes that FFO
is one measure of financial performance of an equity REIT such as the Trust.
On a pro forma basis, combined FFO (as defined by the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") (1)) for the year 1995 grew by 14.4
percent to 48.6 million, compared to combined FFO of 42.5 million, for the
corresponding period in 1994. The following table shows the calculation of pro
forma combined FFO for the indicated periods:

Year Ended December 31,

 Loss (gain) on sales of hotel assets 125 (456)
 ------- ------- 
 Funds from Operations 48,634 42,464
 ======= =======

(1) With respect to the presentation of FFO, management elected early
 adoption of the "new definition" as recommended in the March 1995
 NAREIT White Paper on Funds from Operations beginning January 1,
 1995. Management and industry analysts generally consider funds
 from operations to be one measure of the financial performance of
 an equity REIT that provides a relevant basis for comparison among
 REITs and it is presented to assist investors in analyzing the
 performance of Starwood Lodging. Funds from operations is defined
 as income before minority interest (computed in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains and
 losses from debt restructuring and sales of property, and real
 estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding
 amortization of financing costs). Funds from operations does not
 represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles and is not
 necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
 Funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to
 net income as an indication of Starwood Lodging's financial
 performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating
 activities as a measure of liquidity.

FFO includes 1 million of interest income recognized in excess of the actual
cash received on mortgage notes receivable (as a result of the notes having
been purchased at a discount) for each of the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1994.

HISTORICAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994

 The following discussion and analysis of the historical results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 give effect to
transactions on the actual date they were consummated; in the case of the
Reorganization, as of January 1, 1995; in the case of the Offering, July 6,
1995; and in the case of acquisitions of hotel properties as of the date each
was purchased.

 Combined Funds From Operations. Management believes that FFO is
one measure of financial performance of an equity REIT such as the Trust.
Combined FFO for the twelve months of 1995 rose by 379 percent to 33.1 million
compared to combined FFO of 6.9 million on combined revenues of 161.7 million
for the comparable period in 1994. The following table shows the calculation

THE TRUST

 Net income for the Trust for the year ended December 31, 1995 was
 10.7 million as compared to a loss of 3.5 million in the prior year. Rents
from the Corporation, which are primarily based on hotel revenues, increased
 9.8 million to 26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared
to the corresponding period in 1994. The increase was primarily the result of
rents earned by the Realty Partnership on four hotels contributed by the
Starwood Partners to the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership
effective January 1, 1995 and seven additional hotels acquired during the year
ended December 31, 1995. The four contributed hotels (the Doubletree Hotel
located in Rancho Bernardo, California; Capitol Hill Suites located in
Washington, DC; the Harvey Wichita located in Wichita, Kansas; and the French
Quarter Suites located in Lexington, Kentucky) and the seven hotels acquired
during the year accounted for increased rents of 9.5 million for the year. In
addition, rents earned by the Trust from continuously owned properties leased
by the Corporation increased 838,000. These increases were offset by a
decrease in rents of 543,000 resulting from the sale of hotels in Austin,
Texas (May 1994), Brunswick, Georgia (August 1994), New Port Richey, Florida
(August 1994), Fayetteville, North Carolina (November 1994) and Jacksonville,
Florida (November 1994).

 Interest from the Corporation increased by 3.0 million to 4.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1995 as compared to the corresponding
period in 1994. The increase in interest income resulted primarily from (i)
interest on the intercompany mortgage note relating to the Doral Inn from
September 20, 1995 to the end of the year; (ii) interest on unsecured notes
from the Corporation having an average balance of 11.1 million and bearing
interest at prime plus two percent for the year ended December 31, 1995 (a
moratorium on the payment of interest on such unsecured notes was in effect
throughout 1994); and (iii) interest on the first mortgage of the Milwaukee
Marriott Hotel (owned by a partnership of which the Operating Partnership is
the sole general partner) which was purchased by the Realty Partnership in July
1995.

 Interest from mortgage and other notes amounted to 10.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared to 1.5 million for the
corresponding period in 1994. The increase primarily resulted from the
contribution of notes receivable by the Starwood Partners to the Realty
Partnership in the Reorganization, together with interest earned on the
mortgage note receivable relating to the Grand Hotel purchased in September
1995.

44
 48
 Other income for the year ended December 31, 1995 of 1.1 million
resulted primarily from the retention of a 500,000 deposit related to the
proposed sale of the Bourbon Street hotel/casino and the receipt of 289,000
and 48,000 of proceeds relating to land comprising part of the King 8
hotel/casino and Bourbon Street hotel/casino, respectively, which was
transferred pursuant to eminent domain proceedings.

 The Trust and the Corporation periodically estimate the value of
their hotel assets and compare these values to the net book values of the hotel
assets. For hotel assets not held for sale, the undiscounted future cash flows
of the assets on a hotel-by-hotel basis, are compared to the net book value of
the assets; and if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net
book value of the assets, the excess of the net book values over the estimated
fair values is charged to current earnings. When it is the opinion of
management that the fair value of a hotel that has been identified for sale is
less than the net book value of the hotel, a reserve for losses is established.
Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flow of the properties
at rates (generally ranging from 11.0 to 21.0 deemed reasonable for the type
of property and prevailing market conditions, and, if appropriate, then current
net proceeds of sale from pending offers. In determining whether to accept an
offer for the sale of a property, management considers the fairness of the
offer in comparison to the value of the property, the terms of the offer, and
whether the offer is all cash or includes seller financing.

 Based on the foregoing methodology, a provision for loss in the
amount of 759,000 was recorded in 1994. No provision for loss was recorded in
1995.

 Interest expense decreased by 3.8 million to 12.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared to the corresponding period in
1994. The decrease was due to the repayment of approximately 206.5 million of
existing indebtedness following the Offering and to the retiring of mortgage
notes in 1995, which were secured by the Embassy Suites Hotel in Phoenix,
Arizona and the Bay Valley Resort in Bay City, Michigan and was partially
offset by the assumption of additional notes payable by the Realty Partnership
in the Reorganization, three of which were also repaid during 1995.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 3.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared to the corresponding period
in 1994, principally due to the above mentioned property contributions and
acquisitions and to the amortization of reorganization and financing costs
which were partially offset by the above mentioned property sales.

 Administrative and operating expenses for the year ended December
31, 1995 increased 856,000 to 2.4 million reflecting increased payroll costs
due to the growth of the Trust and costs incurred relating to the potential
acquisition of hotels which ultimately were not acquired.

 Minority interest represents the interest of the Starwood Partners
in the Realty Partnership for the year ended December 31, 1995.

45
 49
 During 1995, the Trust recognized an extraordinary loss of 2.2
million net of minority interests of 163,000 relating to two items:

 (a) An extraordinary loss before minority interest of 3.6
 million due to the early extinguishment of debt in respect
 of the Prior Credit Agreement which was terminated during
 the year; and

 (b) An extraordinary gain before minority interest of 1.3
 million relating to the reversal of outstanding amounts
 accrued in 1993, due to the early extinguishment of debt.

THE CORPORATION

 Hotel revenues increased by 38.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 1995, as compared to the corresponding period in 1994. The
addition of the four contributed properties and the seven acquired properties
as discussed above resulted in increases in hotel revenue of 42.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995. This increase was offset by the hotel sales
discussed above resulting in decreased revenues of 7.2 million. The remaining
increase of 3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, is attributable
to other continuously owned properties.

 Gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 1995 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 1994 decreased by 1.1 million to 26.9 million.
Management believes that operating performance from its gaming assets in 1996
will be comparable to that of the prior year.

 Included in other income for the year ended December 31, 1995 is
 800,000 received by the Corporation as a result of the termination of
management contracts in connection with the settlement of certain shareholder
actions against former officers of Starwood Lodging (see Item 3 of Part I).

 Administrative and operating expenses increased by 653,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared to the corresponding period in
1994. The increase was primarily the result of increases in payroll costs due
to the Corporation's growth.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 3.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 1995, as compared to the corresponding period
in 1994. The increase was primarily the result of the hotels contributed by
Starwood Capital in connection with the Reorganization and those hotels
acquired by Starwood Lodging and amortization of Reorganization costs as
discussed above.

 Minority interest represents the interest of the Starwood Partners
in the Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 1995.

HISTORICAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1993

THE TRUST

 Rents from the Corporation totaled 16.9 million and 16.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The increase was
due to higher hotel revenues for the hotels leased by the Corporation from the
Trust (which resulted in higher percentage rents) offset by a decrease in
rental income of 802,000 resulting from the sale of hotels in Tucker, Georgia
(June 1993), St. Louis, Missouri (December 1993), Austin, Texas (April 1994),
New Port Richey, Florida (August 1994), Brunswick, Georgia (August 1994),
Fayetteville, North Carolina (November 1994) and Jacksonville, Florida
(November 1994).

 Interest from the Corporation increased to 1.7 million from 1.5
million for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The
increase in interest income was a result of the higher amounts outstanding
under the Milwaukee notes, which increased from 15.2 million at December 31,
1993 to 16.9 million at December 31, 1994. (For information pertaining to
such notes see Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.) For additional
information with respect to rents and interest from the Corporation in future
periods, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.

 Interest from mortgage and other notes receivable increased by
 224,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994 as compared to 1993. The
increase resulted from the higher balances outstanding from the additional
notes received upon sales of the hotel properties discussed above and the
receipt of the final payment under three notes receivable relating to the
Vagabond Inns in Rosemead, Sacramento and Woodland Hills, California, the
interest on such notes having been previously deferred.

 Gains on sales of hotel assets for the year ended December 31,
1994 totaling 432,000 reflected the sales of hotels discussed above and
 208,000 related to the in substance foreclosure and subsequent all cash sale
of the underlying property collateralizing the Trust's mortgage note receivable
on the Ramada Inn in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

 Interest expense totaled 16.3 million and 14.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, an increase of 2.3
million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average interest
rate under a subsequently refinanced credit agreement, such rate varying with
the prime rate charged by one of the Senior Lenders.

 The sales of the properties discussed above and an increase in the
provision for investment losses are the primary reasons for the decline in
depreciation and amortization expense of 425,000 between 1994 and 1993.

47
 51
 Administrative and operating expenses totaled 1.6 million and
 1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, a
decrease of 365,000. The decrease was primarily the result of lower insurance
expense and professional fees unrelated to the debt restructuring.

 During 1994 a provision for investment losses (a non-cash charge
to operations) totaling 759,000 was recorded. The provision included 439,000
which was recorded as a result of the acceptance of offers to sell the
Jacksonville and Fayetteville properties, which had previously been identified
for sale at amounts lower than the then current net book values. The provision
also included 320,000 which was established based upon an analysis of the net
realizable value of the underlying property collateralizing the Trust's
mortgage note receivable on the Ramada Inn in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

 See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Joint Annual Report
for a description of an agreement between Ross and Starwood Capital with
respect to certain claims of Ross purchased by Starwood Capital and an
agreement by Starwood Capital to purchase the Paired Shares of the Trust and
Corporation owned by Ross at a price of 33.75 per Paired Share subject to
certain adjustments. Starwood Capital also had the right to purchase such
Paired Shares at the same time and on the same terms. During 1994, the Trust
and the Corporation recorded a charge to shareholder litigation expense of 1.3
million and 1.3 million, respectively, the estimated fair market value of the
agreement, as determined by an investment banker using an option pricing model.
In 1995, Starwood Capital and Starwood Lodging agreed, among other things, that
the maximum amount Starwood Capital could recover under such claims would not
exceed an aggregate of 1.8 million. In January 1996, Ross elected to sell his
Paired Shares, which were sold at a price of 29.625 per Paired Share and the
Trust and the Corporation paid 1,375,743 in the aggregate pursuant to their
indemnity obligations.

 No distributions were made by the Trust for the years ended
December 31, 1994 or 1993.

 The Trust's net loss totaled 3.5 million, or (1.72) per share,
and 3.9 million or (1.92) per share, for the years ended December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

THE CORPORATION

 Hotel revenues totaled 82.7 million and 86.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, representing a decrease
of 4.2 million. The hotel sales described under the caption "The Trust" above
resulted in decreased revenue of 5.3 million. In March 1994, the franchise
agreement and management agreement with Marriott Corporation for the Dallas
property were terminated. The property was then being managed for the
Corporation by Sage Hospitality, and operated as the Dallas Park Central Hotel.
Revenues at the Dallas property decreased by 3.8 million. The decrease from
property sales and the Dallas property were offset by increased revenues of
 4.9 million at the properties which continued to be leased from the Trust by
the Corporation, including an

48
 52
increase of 1.5 million at the Milwaukee Marriott, which was renovated during
1993. The following table summarizes average occupancy and average room rates
for properties which were operated by the Corporation under lease from the
Trust at December 31, 1994:

Year Ended December 31,
 ------------------------------------
 1994 1993
 ------ ------
 
 Including Dallas Park Central:
 Occupancy Rate 68.03 65.32 

 Average Room Rate 59.85 60.30

 Excluding Dallas Park Central:
 Occupancy Rate 71.76 65.75 
 Average Room Rate 59.84 59.88

Management of the Corporation believes that the increases in the average
occupancy rate resulted primarily from more favorable economic conditions which
created increased business and pleasure travel throughout the United States and
improved operational systems.

 Gaming revenues totaled 28.0 million and 27.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

 For information regarding the carrying value of properties held
for sale, see the Trust above. Gain on sales of hotel assets totaled 24,000
and 74,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
reflecting the property sales described above.

 Hotel expenses totaled 60.8 million and 68.1 million or 73.6 
and 78.4 of hotel revenues, for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The decrease in hotel expenses as a percentage of hotel revenue
are primarily due to the lower cost of operating the Dallas property (see
discussion of hotel revenues above) where operating expenses have historically
been higher than at other hotel properties, the improved operating margin
resulting from the renovation of the Milwaukee Marriott discussed above and the
effect of the sale of the properties having higher operating costs as a
percentage of revenues than properties that continue to be operated by the
Corporation.

 Gaming expenses totaled 24.4 million and 24.1 million, or 87.4 
and 87.5 of gaming revenues, for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

 For information with respect to rent and interest to the Trust
during the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, see "The Trust - Results of
Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 1994 and 1993" above.

 Administrative and operating expenses decreased by 161,000, or
6 , for the year ended December 31, 1994 as compared to 1993. The decrease was
primarily the result of a reduction in the level of corporate staff.

49
 53
 The Corporation's net loss totaled 1.2 million, or (0.59) per
share, in 1994, as compared to 3.1 million, or (1.56) per share, for 1993.

Compensation of Trustees/Directors

 Each Trustee, Director or member of the Management Committee who
is not also an officer of the Trust or the Corporation receives annual
Trustee's or Director's fees of 6,000 (other than Directors of the Corporation
who will continue to receive annual Director's fees of 12,000) and is
reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the
Board of Trustees or the Board of Directors. Each Trustee, Director and member
of the Management Committee has received options to purchase 6,000 Paired
Shares and Trustees, Directors and members of the Management Committee will
each receive additional options to purchase 6,000 Paired Shares on June 30 of
each year, beginning June 30, 1996. The Chairman of each Board receives an
additional fee of 2,500 per year. In addition, each non-officer Trustee or
Director receives a fee of 750 for each meeting in which he participates (or,
in the case of telephonic meetings, 500) and a fee of 500 for each committee
meeting in which he participates 1,000 per meeting for committee chairman).

Share Purchase Agreements

 Prior to December 1989, the Trust and the Corporation maintained
share purchase plans pursuant to which Trustees, Directors, officers and
employees of the Trust or the Corporation were granted rights to purchase
Paired Shares from the Trust and the Corporation at prices based upon the then
fair market value of the Paired Shares. A purchaser of Paired Shares under a
share purchase plan made a cash down payment equal to 10 of the purchase price
and executed a promissory note in favor of the Trust or the Corporation for the
balance. Certificates evidencing Paired Shares purchased under a share
purchase plan were pledged to the Trust or the Corporation as collateral to
secure payment of the promissory note. Prior to the satisfaction of the
obligations represented by the note, the purchaser was entitled to vote the
Paired Shares held in pledge, but not to transfer the purchaser's interest in
those shares.

 In 1995, the only share purchase agreements remaining in effect
were those between the Trust and each of Mr. Henderson, a former trustee of
the Trust and a director of the Corporation, and Mr. Samuels, and between the
Corporation and each of Messrs. Jones and Ford. Upon the effectiveness of the
Reorganization, the share purchase agreements with Messrs. Henderson, Samuels
and Ford were terminated and the non-recourse indebtedness thereunder was
canceled (an aggregate of 56,250 with respect to Mr. Henderson, 82,391 with
respect to Mr. Samuels, and 108,784 with respect to Mr. Ford). In addition,
the Paired Shares pledged in respect of such indebtedness were either released
from such pledge, to the extent that such Paired Shares had been paid for (an
aggregate of 223 Paired Shares for which 20,625 was paid with respect to Mr.
Henderson, 356 Paired Shares for which 32,922 was paid with respect to Mr.
Samuels, and 465 Paired Shares for which 45,279 was paid with respect to Mr.
Ford) or were forfeited by the individual, to the extent such Paired Shares had
not been paid for.

62
 66
Employment and Compensation Agreements with Executive Officers

 The Trust has an employment agreement with Mr. Lapin and the
Corporation had an employment agreement with Mr. Mallory which provide that
they receive annual salaries in 1995 of 200,000 and 150,000, respectively,
and such annual bonuses, if any, as the Boards of the Trust and the
Corporation, respectively, may determine. Mr. Lapin's employment agreement
expires on January 31, 1997 and Mr. Mallory's employment agreement expired
June, 1995. Mr. Lapin is entitled to an annual bonus of not less than 75,000
and was granted options to purchase 41,667 Paired Shares at an exercise price
equal to 16.50 per Paired Share (the fair market value of the Paired Shares on
the date of grant) which will vest at a rate no longer than the most rapid rate
of vesting of options granted to any other executive during the term of his
employment agreement. Mr. Lapin's annual salary increased to 225,000 in 1996.
Mr. Lapin also is eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans and
fringe benefits, if any, the Trust or the Corporation, respectively, makes
available to its other executive officers. Mr. Lapin may terminate his
employment for "Good Reason" as defined in his employment agreement including
an assignment of duties inconsistent with his position, a substantial
alteration of his responsibilities, a breach of the agreement by the Trust,
removal from office without cause (as defined), a change in the composition of
51 of the Trustees, a decision by the Board of Trustees that the Trust shall
merge, sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, dissolve or
liquidate, or the failure of Mr. Lapin to be a member of the Board of Trustees
other than for cause (as defined). If Mr. Lapin so terminates his employment,
he will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the base salary and
bonuses that would have been payable had he continued to be employed for the
remainder of the term of the employment agreement, and all fringe benefits to
which he would have been entitled through the remainder of the term of the
employment agreement (other than stock options or stock loans not granted prior
to the date of termination).

 Pursuant to Mr. Lapin's employment agreement, the Trust loaned
 250,000 to Mr. Lapin in 1995. The loan has a term of 10 years, bears interest
at the lowest applicable rate prescribed by section 1274(d) of the Code and is
unsecured. Mr. Lapin will have the right at any time to repay up to 50 of the
loan (plus 50 of accrued interest and any collection costs) by delivering
Paired Shares for credit at the rate of 11.50 per Paired Share (which is
one-half of the price to the public per Paired Share in the Offering).

 In February, 1996, the Trust granted to Barry S. Sternlicht,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, two warrants, each to purchase up to 
15,000 Paired Shares at an exercise price of 1.00 per Paired Share. One
warrant is exercisable immediately (the "1996 Warrant") and one is exercisable
only after January 1, 1997 (the "1997 Warrant"). Any Paired Shares purchased
upon exercise of such a warrant will vest ratably over the balance of the year 
in which that warrant first became exercisable, to the extent Mr. Sternlicht 
has not theretofore resigned or been discharged for "cause." Exercise of the
1997 Warrant is also subject to the condition that Mr. Sternlicht not have
previously resigned or been discharged for "cause." All Paired Shares 
purchased upon exercise of either the 1996 Warrant or the 1997 Warrant are 
non-transferable prior to February, 1998. The Board of Trustees of the Trust 
and the Board of Directors of the Corporation intend to develop incentive 
compensation programs for

63
 67
their officers and key employees which are expected to include similar grants
of warrants, options or restricted stock or other forms of incentive 
compensation.

 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
 INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

 During 1995 and early 1996, the compensation committee of the Trust
(the "Trust Compensation Committee") was comprised of Messrs. Sternlicht, Grose
and Simms. Based on informal discussions, the Trust Compensation Committee made
recommendations to the Trust's Board of Trustees regarding the compensation of
the Trust's executive officers (other than with respect to Mr. Sternlicht, as to
which Messrs. Sternlicht and Grose recused themselves). Based in part on the
recommendations of the Trust Compensation Committee, the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the executive committee of the Board of Trustees (Messrs.
Sternlicht, Lapin and Grose) made decisions with respect to the compensation of
the Trust's executive officers. Messrs. Sternlicht and Lapin, who are executive
officers of the Trust and members of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, did
not participate at the meetings related to their own compensation.

 During 1995 and early 1996, the compensation committee of the
Management Committee (the "Corporation Compensation Committee") was made up of
Messrs. Sternlicht, Jones and Chapus. The Corporation Compensation Committee
met informally during 1995 and early 1996 to discuss the compensation of the
Corporation's executive officers. Based in part on the recommendations of the
Corporation Compensation Committee, the executive committee of the Management
Committee comprised of Messrs. Sternlicht, Eilian and Goldman, made decisions
with respect to the compensation of the Corporation's executive officers
(except that Mr. Goldman recused himself with respect to his own compensation).

(2) Based on information contained in Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13G
 dated February 14, 1996, FMR Corp. beneficially owns 1,795,255 Paired
 Shares (or 13.0 of the Paired Shares). Of these Paired Shares 
 1,472,389 Paired Shares are held by Fidelity Management & Research 
 Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR Corp.) and 322,866 Paired 
 Shares are held by Fidelity Management Trust Company (a wholly owned
 subsidiary of FMR Corp.). FMR Corp. has sole voting power with 
 respect to 316,266 Paired Shares and dispositive power with respect
 to all of these Paired Shares. Based on additional information
 provided to Starwood Lodging, these Paired Shares are held by various
 distinct entities no one of which, directly or by attribution, holds
 in excess of 8.0 of the outstanding Paired Shares.

(3) Based on additional information contained in Amendment No. 1 to 
 Schedule 13D dated January 23, 1996 filed by Starwood Capital, Barry S.
 Sternlicht and the following Starwood Partners: Berl Holdings L.P.,
 Starwood-Apollo Hotel Partners VIII, L.P., Starwood-Apollo Hotel
 Partners IX, L.P., Starwood-Nomura Hotel Investors, L.P.,
 Starwood/Wichita Investors, L.P., Starwood- Huntington Partners, L.P.,
 Woodstar Partners I, L.P., Firebird Consolidated Partners, L.P.,
 Starwood Opportunity Fund II, L.P. ("SOFI II"), Berl Holdings I, Inc.,
 SAHI, Inc., SNHI, Inc., BSS Capital Partners, L.P., Sternlicht Holdings
 II, Inc., and SRL Holdings, Inc. Such Schedule 13D reports that Mr.
 Sternlicht has sole power to vote and dispose of 20,000 Paired Shares
 held by him and that SOFI II beneficially owns 49,933 Paired Shares and
 that SOFI II and Mr. Sternlicht have the power to vote and dispose of
 such Paired Shares and that the Starwood Partners hold units in the
 Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership which are, subject to
 the 8.0 Paired Share ownership limit, exchangeable for an aggregate of
 5,944,027 Paired Shares (approximately 30.1 of the outstanding Paired
 Shares after such exchange). Such units were acquired in the
 Reorganization described in Part I, Item 1 of this Joint Annual Report.
 Mr. Sternlicht also owns 15,000 Paired Shares, which are subject to 
 the terms of a presently exercisable restricted stock warrant and
 may not be transferred prior to February, 1998, and 6,000 Paired Shares
 subject to presently exercisable options. Such Amendment No. 1 to
 Schedule 13D reports that because of the 8.0 ownership limit, the
 Starwood Partners cannot beneficially own more than 8.0 of the
 outstanding Paired Shares. The amount beneficially owned and the
 percent of class assumes that Starwood Partners exchange units for
 Paired Shares to the maximum extent permitted within the ownership
 limit provision; provided, however, that prior to receipt of any
 required Gaming Approval, Starwood Capital's ownership of Paired Shares
 may not exceed 4.9 of the outstanding Paired Shares.

(4) Based on information contained in Schedule 13G dated January 29, 1996.
 Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. has sole voting power with
 respect to 879,400 Paired Shares and dispositive power with respect to

 Compliance with the Reporting Requirements of Section 16(a).
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Starwood Lodging's Trustees,
Directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of
a registered class of Starwood Lodging's equity securities, to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of
changes in ownership of Paired Shares and other equity securities of Starwood
Lodging. Trustees, Directors, officers and greater than ten percent
shareholders are required to furnish Starwood Lodging with copies of all
Section 16(a) forms they file.

 To Starwood Lodging's knowledge, based solely on a review of
the copies of such reports furnished to Starwood Lodging and written
representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1995, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to
its Trustees, Directors, officers and greater than ten percent beneficial
owners were complied with; except that one report, covering one transaction
involving the purchase of Paired Shares, was filed late by Mr. Goldman, an
officer and Director of the Corporation.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

Reorganization.

 Pursuant to the Reorganization, the Trust contributed to the
Realty Partnership substantially all of the Trust's properties and assets,
subject to all of its liabilities, in exchange for a general partner interest
in the Realty Partnership and Starwood Capital contributed to the Realty
Partnership cash, certain hotel properties, first mortgage notes and senior
debt of the Realty Partnership in exchange for a limited partner interest in
the Realty Partnership. In addition, the Corporation and its subsidiaries
contributed to the Operating Partnership substantially all of their assets,
excluding the Gaming Assets, subject to certain liabilities, in exchange for
general partner interests in the Operating Partnership and

68
 72
Starwood Capital contributed to the Operating Partnership cash, furnishings,
equipment and other hotel operating assets in exchange for a limited partner
interest in the Operating Partnership. The Reorganization was approved by the
shareholders of the Trust and the Corporation at meetings held on December 15,
1994. The limited partnership interests of the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership held by Starwood Capital are exchangeable on a
one-for-one basis for Paired Shares. See "Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management."

 Barry S. Sternlicht, the President and Chief Executive Officer
of the general partners of Starwood Capital is also the Chairman and Chief
Executive Office of the Trust and is a Trustee of the Trust, is a member of the
Management Committee of the Operating Partnership and has been elected as a
Director of the Corporation to take office upon the receipt of any required
Gaming Approval. In addition, Mr. Grose, a Trustee of the Trust, is Executive
Vice President and General Counsel of Starwood Capital and Mr. Eilian, who is a
member of the Management Committee of the Operating Partnership and has been
elected as a Director of the Corporation to take office upon the receipt of any
required Gaming Approval, is Senior Vice President of Starwood Capital.

Certain Reimbursements and Payments to Starwood Capital.

 Starwood Capital and Starwood Lodging have agreed that,
subject to approval by the independent Trustees or Directors, as appropriate,
Starwood Capital will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket costs and expenses for
any services provided to Starwood Lodging. Starwood Capital will also be
reimbursed for its internal cost (including allocation of overhead) for
services provided to Starwood Lodging, provided that, where such costs are
currently expensed by Starwood Lodging, such reimbursement will not exceed
 250,000 for the twelve months ending June 30, 1996. As of December 31, 1995,
Starwood Lodging has not reimbursed Starwood Capital for any of these costs
since July 1, 1995, and accordingly has included an accrual of 250,000 in
accounts payable and other liabilities at December 31, 1995.

 During 1995, the Trust reimbursed Starwood Capital
approximately 1.6 million, the majority of which represented a deposit on the
Boston Park Plaza. Aside from Starwood Capital's internal cost (as referred to
above), during 1995 Starwood Capital incurred approximately 1.2 million of 
additional costs which were paid directly by Starwood Lodging to third party 
vendors for services provided to Starwood Lodging, representing costs 
associated with the Reorganization, the Offering and hotel acquisitions.

 Starwood Capital provided to the Trust a 9.6 million loan,
all of which has been repaid, in order to enable the Trust to acquire the Omni 
Hotel in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. This loan bore interest at 12 per annum.

69
 73
 The Trust also received a 5 million unsecured loan from
Starwood Capital to fund the deposit for the acquisition of the Sheraton Colony
Square Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia. This loan bore interest at 12 per annum and
was repaid in July 1995.

 As part of the consideration to Starwood Capital in connection
with the Reorganization (which was approved by the shareholders of the Trust
and the Corporation in December 1994), the Partnerships agreed to pay an amount
to Starwood Capital only if the Trust and the Corporation consummated a public
offering of Paired Shares prior to June 30, 1996, which offering results in the
receipt by the Trust and the Corporation of gross proceeds of not less than
 150 million. Upon the consummation of the Offering in July 1995, the Trust
and the Corporation paid 3.7 million to Starwood Capital pursuant to such
agreement.

Westin Agreement.

 Starwood Capital owns an interest in the Westin Hotel Company
and certain affiliates ("Westin"), which own equity interests in domestic and
international hotels and which manage, franchise or represent hotels worldwide.
The Trust and the Corporation have entered into an agreement with Westin
pursuant to which Westin has agreed that during the period in which an officer,
director, general partner or employee of Starwood Capital is on either the
Board of Trustees or the Board of Directors, and Starwood Capital co-controls
Westin, Westin will not acquire or seek to acquire United States hotel equity
interests, other than certain specified acquisitions, including, without
limitation, minority equity investments made in connection with Westin's
acquisition of a management company. The Trust and the Corporation have agreed
that under certain circumstances if Westin is prohibited from consummating an
opportunity which was not being independently pursued by the Trust and the
Corporation prior to such prohibition, the Trust and the Corporation will not
pursue such opportunity for 270 days after such prohibition.

Management Obligations of Western Host.

 In connection with the settlement of shareholder litigation
(see Item 3 - "Legal Proceedings"), Messrs. Rothman and Young caused each of the
Western Host Partnerships (other than Western Host Santa Maria Partners) to
terminate Western Host's management obligations with respect to that
partnership's hotel, indemnified the Corporation and Western Host against all
claims that might be made against Western Host in connection with its status as
a general partner of Western Host Santa Maria Partners, Western Host Pasadena
Partners and Western Host San Francisco Partners or in connection with any fact
or circumstance occurring since January 1, 1993 with respect to any of the
Western Host Hotels, and delivered to the Corporation an irrevocable letter of
credit in the amount of 800,000. Western Host has agreed to accept the
termination of its management obligations with respect to the Western Host
Hotels and has drawn on the letter of credit for the full 800,000. In
addition, 120,000 of the management fees and all costs and amounts advanced to
the

70
 74
partnerships which were payable to Western Host were paid in full settlement of
such amounts due at December 31, 1993.

 Messrs. Young and Rothman also agreed to be responsible for a
percentage of any retroactive adjustments in worker's compensation insurance
premiums. Starwood Lodging has paid 167,041 for retroactive worker's
compensation insurance premiums and have sought reimbursement from Messrs.
Young and Rothman of their share of that amount (approximately an aggregate of
 56,000). (See Item 3 - "Legal Proceedings.")

Senior Debt Related Transactions.

 In May 1994, Starwood Capital purchased (at a discount)
approximately 21 million of the Trust's senior debt at a public auction by the
institutional holder of such debt. In August 1994, an affiliate of Merrill
Lynch (the "New Lender") purchased 74 million of the Trust's senior debt,
including the senior debt previously held by Starwood Capital, pursuant to a
privately negotiated transaction and at a discount. In conjunction with such
purchase by the New Lender, it entered into an agreement (the "Swap Agreement")
providing that (i) Starwood Capital could acquire such senior debt within a
specified period at the New Lender's cost basis and (ii) the excess of debt
service payments made on such senior debt over the New Lender's cost basis,
together with a specified return thereon, would be payable to Starwood Capital.
In March 1995, the senior debt was refinanced by the New Lender and the Swap
Agreement was terminated with Starwood Capital receiving (a) the return of
 13.1 million of cash collateral which it had deposited as security for its
obligations in respect of the Swap Agreement, (b) additional cash of 2.7
million, (c) 12 million of the senior debt and (d) certain warrants attendant
to the senior debt. Starwood Capital contributed such senior debt to the
Partnerships in exchange for 813,880 Units of the Partnerships. The Trust and
the Corporation paid 786,000 to Starwood Capital to cancel certain warrants
relating to the senior debt in accordance with the requirements of such senior
debt.

Other Relationships

 Sherwin L. Samuels, the General Counsel and Secretary of the
Trust, is a partner through a professional corporation of the law firm of
Sidley & Austin. Sidley & Austin provides legal services to the Trust, the
Corporation and Starwood Capital and certain of its affiliates.

 On March 24, 1995, the Realty Partnership and the Trust
entered into the Prior Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Realty
Partnership borrowed 131.75 million under the Loan which was used primarily to
refinance all outstanding Senior Debt (after the exchange by a Starwood Partner
of 12 million of Senior Debt for units of the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership) and approximately 27 million of first mortgage debt.
In connection with the refinancing under the Prior Credit Agreement, the Realty
Partnership paid 514,000 to one of the Senior Lenders and a portion of the
Lender Warrants

71
 75
issued in connection with an existing credit agreement could be canceled upon
the payment to a Starwood Partner of a 786,000 cancellation fee. Effective
March 31, 1995, the Realty Partnership issued an unsecured note payable to the
Starwood Partner and the remaining Lender Warrants were canceled. The
transactions relating to the cancellation of Lender Warrants were recorded as a
reduction in paid-in capital.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Boards of Trustees and Directors and Shareholders of
 Starwood Lodging Trust and Starwood Lodging Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying separate and combined financial statements of
Starwood Lodging Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) (the "Trust")
and Starwood Lodging Corporation (a Maryland corporation) and its subsidiaries
(the "Corporation"), collectively the "Companies", as of December 31, 1995, and
for the year then ended, listed in the foregoing index to financial statements
and financial statement schedules. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the foregoing index to financial statements and
financial statement schedules. These financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Trust's, the Corporation's
and the Companies' managements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such separate and combined financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Companies and the
financial position of the Trust and the Corporation at December 31, 1995, and
the respective results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

STARWOOD LODGING TRUST
 AND STARWOOD LODGING CORPORATION

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

General

 The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Starwood
Lodging Trust (the "Trust") and Starwood Lodging Corporation and their
subsidiaries (the "Corporation"). The Trust was formed as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code in 1969. In 1980,
the Trust formed the Corporation and made a distribution to the Trust's
shareholders of one share of common stock of the Corporation for each share of
beneficial interest of the Trust. The shares of the Trust and the shares of
the Corporation are paired on a one-for-one basis, and can only be transferred
in units ("Paired Shares") consisting of the same number of shares of the Trust
and of the Corporation.

 The combined financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and
the Corporation (the "Companies"). All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in the combined and separate consolidated
financial statements. The intercompany balances and transactions which have
been eliminated in arriving at the combined balance sheets and combined
statements of operations include the elimination of notes receivable from the
Corporation recorded on the Trust's balance sheets, and the related notes
payable to the Trust recorded on the Corporation's balance sheets. Rent and
interest income recorded on the Trust's statements of operations are eliminated
against the related rent and interest expense on the Corporation's statements
of operations.

 The Companies own and operate hotels located throughout the United States
and two hotel/casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada. The hotels range in size from 90
to 960 rooms and offer services to both business and leisure travelers.

Reorganization

 Effective January 1, 1995 (the "Closing Date"), the Trust and the
Corporation consummated a reorganization (the "Reorganization") with Starwood
Capital Group, L.P. ("Starwood Capital") and certain affiliates of Starwood
Capital (the "Starwood Partners").

 The Reorganization involved a number of related transactions that occurred
simultaneously on the Closing Date. Such transactions included (i) the
contribution by the Trust to SLT Realty Limited Partnership (the "Realty
Partnership") of substantially all of the properties and assets of the Trust,
at book values, subject to substantially all of the liabilities of the Trust
(including the Senior Debt of the Trust ), in exchange for an approximate
28.3 interest as a general partner in the Realty Partnership, (ii) the
contribution by the Starwood Partners to the Realty Partnership of
approximately 12,600,000 in cash and certain hotel properties and first
mortgage notes, at book values in exchange for limited partnership units
representing the remaining approximate 71.7 interest in the Realty
Partnership, (iii) the contribution by the Corporation and its subsidiaries to
SLC Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership", and together
with the Realty Partnership, the "Partnerships") of all of their properties and
operating assets (except for their gaming assets, which are to be contributed
upon approval by Nevada gaming authorities), subject to substantially all of
their liabilities, in exchange for an approximate 28.3 interest as a general
partner in the Operating Partnership, and (iv) the contribution by the Starwood
Partners to the Operating Partnership of approximately 1,400,000 in cash and
furniture, fixtures and equipment of the hotel properties, at book values, in
exchange for limited partnership units representing the remaining approximate
71.7 interest in the Operating Partnership.

 Immediately following the Reorganization, the Trust and the Corporation
accounted for their respective investment in the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership under the equity method of accounting, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. For accounting purposes, neither the
Trust nor Starwood

 F-15

 99

Capital unilaterally controlled the Starwood Lodging Realty Partnership and
neither the Corporation nor Starwood Capital unilaterally controlled the
Starwood Lodging Operating Partnership.

 In addition on March 24, 1995, a Starwood Partner exchanged 12 million of
Senior Debt for additional limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership
and the Operating Partnership. After giving effect to the Reorganization and
this exchange of Senior Debt, the Trust had an approximate 25.4 interest in
the Realty Partnership, the Corporation had an approximate 25.4 interest in
the Operating Partnership, and the Starwood Partners held limited partnership
interests representing the remaining approximate 74.6 interest in each of the
Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership.

The Offering

 On July 6, 1995, Starwood Lodging completed a public offering (the
"Offering") of 11,787,500 Paired Shares at a price of 23.00 per Paired Share.
Net proceeds of the Offering of approximately 245.7 million in aggregate were
contributed by the Trust and the Corporation to the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership, respectively, thereby increasing the general partnership
interest of the Trust and the Corporation to approximately 69.9 of each of the
Realty Partnership and Operating Partnership with the Starwood Partners'
limited partnership interests representing the remaining approximate 30.1 
interest in each of the Realty Partnership and Operating Partnership. From the
completion of the Offering, the Companies have consolidated the results of the
respective Partnerships.

 The 30.1 limited partnership interests of the Realty Partnership and the
Operating Partnership is reflected in the Financial Statements as Minority
Interest. The total number of operating units outstanding in the Partnership
was 19,768,000 at December 31, 1995.

Hotel assets

 Hotel assets are stated at the lower of cost or the amounts described
below and are depreciated using straight-line and declining-balance methods
over estimated useful lives of five to thirty-five years for buildings and
improvements and three to twelve years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.
Amounts allocated to leasehold interests are amortized using the straight-line
method over lease terms of eight to forty-three years.

 The Trust and the Corporation estimate the fair values of each of their
hotel assets on a quarterly basis. For each hotel asset not held for sale,
fair value is estimated as the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the
asset (generally over a five-year period), which is compared to the net book
values of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less
than the net book value of the asset, the excess of the net book value over the
estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. When it is the opinion of
management that the fair value of a hotel asset which has been identified for
sale is less than the net book value of the asset, a reserve for losses is
established. Fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows of the
hotel assets at rates (11.0 to 21.0 deemed reasonable for the type of
property and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate,
current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. A gain or loss is
recorded to the extent the amounts ultimately received differ from the adjusted
book values of the hotel assets. Gains on sales of hotel assets are recognized
at the time the hotel assets are sold provided there is reasonable assurance of
the collectability of the sales price and any future activities to be performed
by the Companies relating to the hotel assets sold are insignificant.

Mortgage notes receivable

 If a loan becomes delinquent or upon the occurrence of other events it
becomes known that the collectability of a specific loan is uncertain, interest
income is no longer accrued and an allowance for loss is established based upon
an analysis of the net realizable value of the underlying property
collateralizing the loan.

Provision for losses

 Provision for losses for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 for
the Trust are as follows:

1994 1993
 --------- -----------
 
Hotel assets 439,000 2,369,000
Mortgage notes receivable 320,000
 -------- --------- 
 759,000 2,369,000
 ======== ==========

There were no provisions for losses for the year ended December 31, 1995.

Cash and cash equivalents

 Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand and in banks plus
all short-term investments with a maturity, at the date of purchase, of three
months or less.

Inventories

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
on a first-in, first-out basis.

Organization Costs

 Organization costs related to the formation of each of the Partnerships in
the amount of 2,891,000 and 1,672,000 for the Trust and 2,891,000 and
 1,672,000 for the Corporation are included in inventories, prepaid expenses
and other assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The costs are
amortized over a five-year period beginning in January 1995. Both the Trust
and the Corporation amortized 650,000 during the year ended December 31, 1995.

Hotel Revenue

 Revenue is recognized as earned. Earned is generally defined as the date
upon which a guest occupies a room and/or utilizes the hotel's services.
Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses are
expensed at the time the account receivable is estimated to be uncollectible.
Historically, credit losses have not been material to the hotels' results of
operations. The Companies have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts
totalling 60,000 and 100,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Gaming revenue

 Gaming revenue relates to the two hotel/casinos and includes the net win
from gaming activities, as well as room, food and beverage and other revenues,
net of promotional allowances.

Fair value of financial instruments and concentration of credit risk

 The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the
related estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon
disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.

 Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and
other liabilities are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their
fair value.

 Investments of 2,841,000 for the Trust at December 31, 1995 had a fair
value of 2,674,000.

F-17

 101

At December 31, 1995, fixed rate mortgage notes receivable of 29,016,000
approximate their fair value. The Companies believe that the fair value of
mortgage notes receivable of 50,245,000 is at least 62,000,000.

 Fixed rate mortgage notes receivable of 14,049,000 for the Trust at
December 31, 1994 had a fair value of 13,488,000 as estimated based upon debt
with similar terms and maturities.

 The carrying value of the secured notes payable, fixed rate notes payable,
and revolving line of credit approximate fair value at December 31, 1995 and
1994, as the related interest rates are either variable or in line with market
rates.

 Fixed rate notes payable with carrying values of 32,838,000 and
 13,748,000 for the Trust and Corporation, respectively, at December 31, 1994
had a fair value of 34,442,000 and 11,648,000 as estimated based on debt with
similar terms and maturities

 At December 31, 1995, the Company had significant amounts in banks that
was in excess of the federally insured amounts.

Net income (loss) per share

 Net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year which is on a
Paired Share basis for purposes of the combined financial statements.
Outstanding options and warrants are included as common equivalent shares using
the treasury stock method when the effect is dilutive. The weighted average
number of shares and Paired Shares used in determining net income (loss) per
share and per Paired Share was 7,771,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995
and 2,022,158 for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993. The weighted
average number of shares and Paired Shares were determined as if the six for
one reverse stock split that occurred June 19, 1995 was effective January 1,
1993. Historical per share information has been revised accordingly.

Use of estimates

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

 Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1993 financial
statements to conform with the 1995 financial statement presentation.

Impact of recently issued accounting standards

 In March and October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of"
and No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", respectively. These
statements shall be effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995. Management believes that adoption of
Standard No. 121 will not have a material effect on its financial position or
results of operations. Management intends to adopt the disclosure method of
Standard No. 123 and, accordingly, there will be no impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

2. Income Taxes.

 The Trust will elect to be treated as a REIT under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code beginning with the 1995 year. As a result, the Trust
will not be subject to Federal income tax on its taxable income at corporate
rates to the extent it distributes annually at 95 of its taxable income to its
shareholders and complies

 F-18

 102

with certain other requirements. The Trust is subject to state income and
franchise taxes in certain states which it operates. Therefore, a tax
provision has been reflected for these income and franchise tax amounts.

 Components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 are
as follows:

1995 1994
 ------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Trust Corporation Trust Corporation

Net deferred income tax --- --- --- --- 
 ============ =========== ============ ===========

As of December 31, 1995, the Trust and Corporation had net operating loss
carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 83,000,000 and
 3,400,000 respectively. The NOL's expire in various years beginning in 2,006
through 2,009 for the Trust, and 2,006 through 2,010 for the Corporation.

 The utilization of each entities' NOL will be limited by the provisions of
IRC Section 382, and in the case of the Trust the use of approximately 50
million of the NOL will be predicated on the recognition of gain from the sale
of certain of the assets of the Trust within 5 years of the ownership change
date which occured in July 1995. A valuation allowance is provided for the
full amount of the NOL's as the realization of tax benefits from such NOL's is
not assured.

3. Extraordinary Items.

 Under the terms of a Credit Agreement dated January 28, 1993 (the "1993
Credit Agreement") the Trust restructured its debt existing at such time.
Management concluded that that restructuring represented a "troubled debt
restructuring" as defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and
accordingly, upon execution of the 1993 Credit Agreement, accrued all known
current or future identifiable debt restructuring costs as of December 31,
1992. Upon execution of an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March
24, 1995 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"), the Realty Partnership recognized
extraordinary income of 1,284,000 relating to the extinguishment of debt under
the terms of the 1993 Credit Agreement, representing the remaining amount of
the accrual at March 24, 1995. Additionally, in July 1995 subsequent to the
Offering, the Realty Partnership repaid existing indebtedness borrowed under
the Prior Credit Agreement and recorded an extraordinary charge to net income
of 3,602,000 relating to the extinguishment of such debt.

4. Loan Restructuring Costs.

 All restructuring costs in relation to the "troubled debt restructuring"
referred to in Note 3 have been expensed as incurred. In 1993, upon execution
of the definitive debt restructuring agreement, 700,000 was paid by the Trust
to the certain institutional lenders and 4,032,000 was added to the loan
balance under the terms of a credit agreement for restructuring costs due the
institutional lenders for legal and other experts. Previously accrued
restructuring costs of 611,000, 778,000 and 3,152,000 were paid during the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. As noted above, an
additional 1,284,000 of previously accrued restructuring costs was recognized
as extraordinary income during 1995. At December 31, 1995, there are no
accrued loan restructuring costs included in accounts payable and other
liabilities.

5. Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosure.

 Interest paid in cash by the Trust in the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993 was 15,235,000 12,736,000 and 13,205,000, respectively.

F-19

 103

Interest paid in cash by the Corporation in the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994, and 1993 was 1,345,000, 1,342,000 and 140,000, respectively.

 The Corporation deferred interest of 3,012,000, 1,730,000 and 1,519,000
on its intercompany debt with the Trust in the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993 respectively.

 In December 1993, the Corporation transferred 278,000 of share purchase
loans to the Trust and reduced notes payable - Trust.

 During 1993, 4,032,000 of accrued loan restructuring costs were added to
the loan balance of the secured notes payable and revolving line of credit.

 During 1994, a charge of 246,000 to additional paid-in capital was made
relating to the cancellation of share purchase notes. Paired Shares which
secured the portion of the principal canceled on the original notes were
returned to the Companies.

 In December 1994, the Trust forgave 58,335,000 of notes payable to the
Trust by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Because of the common ownership
of the Trust and the Corporation, the Trust charged, and the Corporation
credited, the amount of debt forgiven to additional paid-in capital of the
Trust and Corporation, respectively.

 In connection with the Reorganization, the Starwood Partners contributed
 30.2 million (net of 474,000 of depreciation) in land and buildings, 49.2
million (net of discounts of 24.9 million and allowances of 2.9 million) in
mortgage notes receivable, and 52.9 million (net of 6.0 million of debt
forgiven by the Starwood Partners) in long term debt obligations for
partnership units in the Realty Partnership. In addition, the Starwood
Partners contributed 3.7 million (net of 757,000 of depreciation) of
furniture, fixtures and equipment for partnership units of the Operating
Partnership.

 During 1995, a Starwood Partner exchanged 12 million of Senior Debt for
partnership units of the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership.

 During 1995, the Trust transferred approximately 7.2 million (net of
accumulated depreciation) in furniture, fixtures and equipment to the
Corporation and increased the intercompany receivable by the same amount.

 In December 1995, the Companies declared approximately 9.3 million in
dividends to be paid in January 1996.

6. Senior Notes Payable and Revolving Line of Credit.

 Effective March 24, 1995 the Realty Partnership and the Trust entered into
the Prior Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Realty Partnership borrowed
approximately 131.7 million which was used primarily to refinance the
outstanding Senior Debt of 113,896,000 at December 31, 1994 (after the
exchange by a Starwood Partner of 12 million of Senior Debt for units of the
Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership) and approximately 27 million
of first mortgage debt. The Senior Debt carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus
3.00 and at December 31, 1994, the Senior Debt balance of 113,896,000 had an
interest rate of 8.69 . The Prior Credit Agreement contained a clause which
stated that upon the payment to a Starwood Partner of a 786,000 cancellation
fee, the remaining Lender Warrants issued in connection with the 1993 Credit
Agreement, would be canceled. Effective March 31, 1995 the Realty Partnership
settled the cancellation fee by issuing an unsecured note payable to the
Starwood Partner and the remaining Lender Warrants were canceled.

 On July 25, 1995, the Realty Partnership entered into a Mortgage Loan
Funding Facility Agreement (the "Repo Facility") providing for advances up to
 71 million for a period of 18 months ending January 25, 1997. Advances under
the Repo Facility bear interest at a rate based on one month LIBOR plus 1.5 
for the period ending July 25, 1996 and one month LIBOR plus 1.75 thereafter
and are secured by certain mortgage notes receivable and other collateral of
the Realty Partnership.

On October 25, 1995, the Realty Partnership entered into a Credit
Agreement (the "Acquisition Facility") providing for advances of up to 135
million for a period expiring on October 1, 1998. The Acquisition Facility
superseded and replaced the Prior Credit Agreement.

 Advances under the Acquisition Facility bear interest at a rate based upon
one, two or three-month LIBOR plus 1.625 percent and are collateralized by
liens on 29 of the hotel equity interests of the Realty Partnership and may be
collateralized by other properties, all on a cross-collateralized basis. As
of December 31, 1995, borrowings under the Repo Facility and the Acquisition
Facility (together, the "Facilities") totaled 119.1 million with interest
rates ranging from 7.4 to 7.6 . The Acquisition Facility provides for an
annual fee of 0.25 of the average daily unfunded portion of the Facility
Amount.

 The Facilities require the Companies to maintain a specified minimum
adjusted net worth, a specified minimum ratio of actual consolidated EBITDA to
debt service plus fixed charges and a restriction against total debt exceeding
a specified maximum percent of net book value. In addition, the Facilities
place restrictions on distributions and require the Trust to maintain its REIT
status, maintain a minimum borrowing base (defined as Net Operating Income per
Facility Agreement divided by stated interest rates) and maintain minimum
replacement reserves. As of December 31, 1995, the Companies were in
compliance with their covenants.

 The Companies intend to finance the acquisition of additional hotel
properties, hotel renovations and capital improvements and provide for general
corporate purposes through the Facilities and when market conditions warrant,
to issue additional equity or debt securities.

7. Hotel Sales and Reserve for Losses.

 During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Companies sold their

hotels at amounts lower than net book value.

 During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Companies sold their 
interests in five hotel assets, the Best Western South located in Austin,
Texas, the Sheraton Hotel located in New Port Richey, Florida, the Holiday Inn

based upon a 12-year amortization schedule, with all unpaid principal and
interest due in December 2006. In connection with the Reorganization (see Note
1), the Holiday Inn located in Albany, Georgia was sold to the Starwood
Partners for an all cash purchase price of 6,000,000. The transaction 

F-21

 105

was accounted for as a financing activity and the Starwood Partners subsequently
contributed the property to the Partnerships . No gain or loss was recorded on
the sale.
 
 For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Trust recognized a gain of
 224,000 and the Corporation recognized a gain of 24,000 on sales of hotel
assets, including a 55,000 discount recorded by the Trust resulting from the
early payoff in 1994 of the mortgage note receivable related to the
Spartanburg, South Carolina property sold in 1992. In 1994, the Trust recorded
a provision for investment losses of 439,000 primarily as a result of the
acceptance of offers for the sale of hotels at amounts lower than net book
value.

 During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Companies did not sell any of
their hotel assets.

8. Mortgage Notes Receivable.

 In 1992, the Trust sold a hotel asset in Merrimack, New Hampshire and
received as partial consideration a promissory note in an original principal
amount of 1,440,000, collateralized by a first mortgage on the property. In
September 1994, the Trust initiated foreclosure proceedings and recorded a
provision for investment losses of 320,000, resulting in a net book value of
 983,000. The property was subsequently sold to a third party in December 1994
for net proceeds of 1,191,000 and the Trust recorded a gain on sale of
 208,000.

 At December 31, 1995, in addition to the MHLP notes discussed in Note 9,
the Trust held eighteen promissory notes collateralized by mortgages. Eleven
notes 78,996,000 carrying amount at December 31, 1995), representing 12
hotels, are collateralized by first mortgages, and seven notes 365,000
carrying amount at December 31, 1995) are collateralized by second, third and
fourth mortgages. Ten of the notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 7 
to 10 per annum, and five of the notes have variable interest rates that range
from 7.16 to 9.75 per annum at December 31, 1995. Two of the notes
(representing two properties) provide for contingent interest based on a
percentage of gross revenues of the properties securing such notes. Three of
the notes are principal only. The maturity dates of the notes range from 1996
to 2017. Aggregate principal payments under the mortgage notes receivable due
within one year of December 31, 1995 are 3,266,000. As of December 31, 1995
and 1994, the reserve for investment losses for the mortgage notes receivable
amounted to 100,000 in both years.

9. Milwaukee Marriott Hotel.

 In December 1985, the Trust sold its interest in the Milwaukee Marriott
Hotel to Milwaukee Brookfield Limited Partnership ("Brookfield"). In
connection with the sale, the Trust received a second mortgage note (the
"Original Trust Note") from Brookfield.

 In July 1991, ownership and operation of the Milwaukee Marriott was
reorganized and ownership of the hotel was transferred from Brookfield to
Moorland Hotel Limited Partnership, ("MHLP"), a limited partnership in which
the Corporation has a 51 interest and is the sole general partner and
Brookfield is the sole limited partner. The operations of MHLP are
consolidated into the Corporation's financial statements from the date of
reorganization and, accordingly, the Trust has recorded the note receivable
from MHLP as a note receivable from the Corporation. The Corporation and MHLP
entered into an agreement for the Corporation to manage the property.

 In addition, MHLP entered into an assignment and forbearance agreement
with Marriott Corporation ("Marriott"), the franchisor. This agreement, among
other things, required MHLP to renovate the hotel to Marriott standards. The
renovation was completed in January 1994.

 During 1992, MHLP, Aetna Life Insurance Company ("Aetna"), the holder of
the first mortgage on the Milwaukee Marriott (the "Aetna Note"), Marriott, the
Trust, the Corporation, and Brookfield and various partners of Brookfield
reached agreements arranging financing for the renovation of the Milwaukee
Marriott and restructuring of debt for MHLP.

 Effective December 1, 1992, Aetna agreed to defer for the period December
1, 1992 through November 30, 1993, the monthly principal and interest payments
on the Aetna Note, which accrues interest at 11.25 per annum, with the
deferred interest added to principal monthly. Beginning December 1, 1993, the
loan amortizes in equal monthly installments over a period of 17 years at 10 
interest per annum until January 1, 1996, at which time all 

F-22

 106

unpaid interest and principal are due, including appreciation interest
("Appreciation Interest"). The due date of the unpaid interest and principal
was extended to June 30, 1996 by an amendment executed on December 31, 1995. 
Appreciation Interest is defined as 50 of the aggregate principal reduction in
the Aetna Note from December 1, 1993 until the loan is due in full as provided
in the agreement. On July 31, 1995, the Trust purchased the Aetna Note from
Aetna. The amount of the Aetna Note outstanding totaled 9,899,000 at December
31, 1994.
 
 In 1993, Marriott agreed to loan MHLP 750,000 collateralized by a second
deed of trust on the hotel (the "Marriott Note") for the purchase of equipment
from a Marriott subsidiary. The Marriott Note bore interest at 9 per annum,
payable monthly beginning May 31, 1993 through April 30, 1994, at which time
fixed monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately 49,000
became due until December 31, 1994, at which time all unpaid interest and
principal were due. In 1994, Marriott agreed to extend the Marriott Note with
interest at 10 per annum beginning January 1, 1995 at which time fixed monthly
payments of principal and interest of approximately 31,000 become due until
June 30, 1995. All unpaid interest and principal was paid on June 30, 1995.

 In 1993, the Trust agreed to loan MHLP 1,000,000 to be used to complete
the renovation of the Milwaukee Marriott. The loan is collateralized by a
third deed of trust on the hotel (the "Renovation Note") and bears interest at
10.5 per annum, payable monthly. Under certain circumstances, interest is
deferred and added to the principal of the Renovation Note monthly. The
amounts outstanding under the Renovation Note totaled 1,000,000 and 1,225,000
as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Trust may declare due and
payable the principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest thereon at any
time through the maturity date of the Renovation Note on January 1, 1996. The
due date of the unpaid interest and principal was extended to June 30, 1996 by
an amendment executed on December 31, 1995. The Renovation Note became a
second mortgage following repayment of the Marriott Note in 1995.

 The Original Trust Note held by the Trust of 11,000,000 was modified as
of December 31, 1992 by adding deferred and previously unpaid interest of
 1,667,000 to principal due under the note and converting the note to a fourth
mortgage note. Further, 1,790,000 and 1,607,000 of interest at 10.5 per
annum for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, was
deferred monthly and added to principal due under the loan. The fourth
mortgage note outstanding totaled 17,481,000 and 15,691,000 as of December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Interest is payable monthly unless deferred
under the provisions of the loan agreement until January 1, 1996, at which time
all remaining unpaid interest and principal are due. The due date of the
unpaid interest and principal was extended to June 30, 1996 by an amendment
executed on December 31, 1995. The Original Trust Note became a third mortgage
following repayment of the Marriott Note in 1995.

 The Corporation agreed to defer and convert to a note up to 250,000 of
management fees due under its management agreement with MHLP for a period of up
to twelve months commencing with base management fees due after January 1,
1993. The deferred fees bear interest at 9 per annum, which were added to the
principal balance of the note through December 1, 1993. Thereafter, the note
is due in twelve equal monthly installments of principal and interest
commencing on January 1, 1994 at 12 interest per annum. All unpaid interest
and principal was due and paid December 1, 1994.

 The 600,000 original loan (the "GSI Fourth Note")made by GSI Acquisition
Company, L.P., a limited partner of Brookfield, ("GSI"), was modified as of
December 31, 1992, by converting deferred and previously unpaid interest of
approximately 86,000 to principal. For the years ending December 31, 1995 and
1994 interest at 10.5 per annum was deferred monthly and added to the
principal balance, which balance totals 946,000 and 849,000 at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively. Thereafter, interest is payable monthly unless
deferred under the provisions of the agreement until January 1, 1996, at which
time all remaining unpaid interest and principal are due. On December 31,
1995, the due date for the unpaid interest and principal was extended to June
30, 1996.

 The GSI Fourth Note became a fourth mortgage following repayment of the
Marriott Note in 1995, however it ranks pari passu with the Original Trust
Note.

 As of December 31, 1992, MHLP also agreed to pay GSI 2,000,000 pursuant
to a note (the "GSI Fifth Note") bearing non-accruing interest at 12 payable
out of available monthly cash flow (as defined in the GSI Fifth 

F-23

 107

Note). The principal balance outstanding is 2,000,000 at December 31, 1995 and
1994. The GSI Fifth Note became a fifth mortgage following repayment of the
Marriott Note in 1995.
 
 Of the five notes outstanding at December 31, 1995, the Trust held three -
the Aetna Note, the Renovation Note, and the Original Trust Note.

 The Trust evaluates the collectability of the notes receivable
collateralized by the Milwaukee Marriott Hotel at the end of each quarter.
Factors considered by the Trust in performing the evaluations include the
discounted estimated future cash flow (at 11.0 over a five-year period. The
Corporation evaluates the recoverability of the net book value of the property
at the end of each quarter. Factors considered by the Corporation in
performing the evaluation included the undiscounted estimated future cash flow
of the property over a five-year period. Based upon the evaluations no
provision for losses was required.

10. Hotel Properties.

 A summary of hotel assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is as follows (in
thousands):

11. Real Estate Investments and Intercompany Transactions.

 At December 31, 1995, the Trust owned equity interests in thirty-five
hotels, including two hotel/casinos. Of that number, thirty properties were
owned in fee, four were held pursuant to long-term leases and one was owned
through a 5 general partnership interest in a joint venture that owns the
Omaha Marriott Hotel.

 Thirty-one of the Trust's hotels (including the two hotel/casinos) are
leased to the Corporation or its subsidiaries. Three hotels have been leased
to and are operated by Imperial Hotels Corporation, formerly Vagabond Inns,
Inc. The Omaha Marriott Hotel has been leased to an affiliate of the
Corporation, and is managed by Marriott pursuant to a long-term management
agreement. As of December 31, 1995, three of the hotels leased by the
Corporation from the Trust are being managed by third-party operators. Two of
the third-party management agreements are for three-year terms expiring in
1998, and one of the management agreements is a five-year term expiring in
1999. The management agreements are subject to certain cancellation
provisions. Base management fees range from 2 to 2-1/2 of gross revenues
with incentive management fees based upon hotel profitability.

 The leases are generally long-term and generally provide for annual 
base, or minimum rents, plus contingent, or percentage rents based on the gross
revenues of the properties and are accounted for as operating leases. The
leases are "triple-net" in that the lessee is generally responsible for paying
all operating expenses of the properties, including maintenance, insurance and
real property taxes. Total rental expense paid by the Corporation to the Trust
under such leases was 26,730,000, 16,906,000 and 16,481,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, of which 5,443,000,
 2,456,000 and 1,939,000 were contingent. The lessee is also generally
responsible for any payments required pursuant to underlying ground leases. 
Most leases provide for cancellation by the Trust in the event that the Trust
does not earn a specified rent, or by the lessee (including the Corporation) in
the event the lessee does not earn a specified net operating profit.

 As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Corporation was indebted to the
Trust for an aggregate of 86,464,000 and 26,916,000, respectively, (including
the MHLP mortgage notes of 28,236,000 and 16,916,000 as of December 31, 1995
and December 31, 1994, respectively - see Note 5 and the Doral lease obligation
of 

 F-24

 108

40,250,000-see discussion below). The Corporation borrowings were non-interest
bearing for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993. In December 1994, the
Trust forgave 58,335,000 of notes receivable payable to the Trust by the
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 1995, the remaining
notes bear interest at prime plus 2 with interest payable monthly and are due
on January 1, 2000.

 On September 20, 1995, the Realty Partnership purchased land for 3
million and mortgage notes receivable collateralized by the Doral Inn for 40.3
million. The note bears interest at 9.5 and matures on October 1, 2006. The
Realty Partnership also entered into a long-term lease agreement with SBK
Delaware Realty Holdings, L.L.C. ("SBK"), the owners of the Doral Inn, to lease
SBK the land for 240,000 per year. Simultaneously, the Operating Partnership
entered into a long-term lease agreement with SBK to lease the land and the
building for 240,000 per year, plus the debt service on the mortgage held by
the Realty Partnership. The Operating Partnership lease agreement includes a
clause under which SBK is paid a management fee of 0.5 of gross revenues. The
Realty Partnership has the option of acquiring the building for the value of
the mortgage note plus 400,000 after ten years. It is management's intention
to exercise that option. The Operating Partnership has recorded the
transaction as a capitalized lease with an intercompany obligation to the
Realty Partnership.

 Rents accrued by the Trust from leased hotel properties are summarized as

The Corporation is committed under its leases with the Trust to pay the
rents payable with respect to four ground leases which expire in 1997 through
2029, including renewal options. The leases generally provide for a minimum
rent plus a percentage of gross revenues of the properties in excess of the
minimum rent. Future minimum lease payments under the leases are included in
"other" rents payable in the table above. The Trust is the primary obligor
under the leases; however, the Corporation as lessee/operator of the hotels
makes payments under

F-25

these leases directly to the lessors. Rent expense incurred by the Corporation
as a lessee/operator under these ground leases was 549,000, 879,000 and
 854,000, in the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

respectively, in assets (less 127,000, and 117,000, respectively, in
accumulated amortization) recorded under capital leases. Such amounts are

13. Shareholders' Equity.

Warrants to purchase Paired Shares

 At December 31, 1995 and 1994, there were outstanding 276,662 warrants to
purchase Paired Shares at an exercise price of 101.70 per Paired Share (as
adjusted for the one for six reverse stock split in June 1995) through
September 15, 1996. At the expiration date, each 600 warrants are convertible
into one Paired Share of stock. In lieu of fractional shares, holders will be
paid an amount equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a
single share.

Share option plans

 The Trust and the Corporation each adopted Incentive and Non-Qualified
Share Option Plans in 1986 which provided for the purchase of up to an
aggregate of 116,667 Paired Shares (as adjusted for the one for six reverse
stock split in June 1995) by Trustees, Directors, officers and employees
pursuant to option grants. During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Trust
and the Corporation granted options to purchase 56,892 Paired Shares at
excercise prices ranging from 16.50 to 21.75 per Paired Share. During the
year ended December 31, 1994, the Trust and the Corporation granted options to
purchase 16,500 Paired Shares at an exercise price of 16.50 per Paired Share.
During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Trust and the Corporation granted
options to purchase 3,333 Paired Shares at an exercise price of 15.75 per
Paired Share. Such options, which are granted at fair market value on the date
of grant, vest over three years. As of December 31, 1995, 10,860 options have
been exercised.

 During 1995, the Trust and the Corporation each also adopted a 1995 Share
Option Plan which provides for the purchase of Paired Shares by Trustees,
Directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors, pursuant to option
grants. The aggregate number of Paired Shares subject to options which may be
granted under the Plans is 1,573,000 plus 8 of any additional partnership
units or Paired Shares issued subsequent to August 17, 1995 (other than Paired
Shares issued in exchange for partnership units, Paired Shares issued pursuant
to employee benefit plans or Paired Shares that were previously issued and
re-acquired by the Trust or the Corporation). During the year ended December
31, 1995, the Trust and the Corporation granted options under the 1995 Plans to
purchase 926,750 Paired Shares to Trustees, Directors, officers and employees, 
at exercise prices ranging from 23.00 to 29.00 per Paired Share.

 At December 31, 1995, outstanding options granted under all plans of the 
Trust and Corporation (including options granted to officers and directors of a
company previously acquired by the Trust) aggregated 1,004,640 Paired Shares. 
At December 31, 1995, options for 130,112 Paired Shares are fully vested with
exercise prices ranging from 4.50 to 120.00 per Paired Share.

F-27

 111

Share purchase plans

 Prior to December 1989, the Trust and the Corporation each had a Share
Purchase Plan, whereby an aggregate of 33,333 Paired Shares (as adjusted for
the one for six reverse stock split in June 1995) were available to be
purchased by Trustees, Directors, officers and employees at their fair market
value on the date of sale with monies borrowed from the Trust or Corporation.

 In December 1989, the Trust's Board of Trustees and the Corporation's
Board of Directors voted to terminate the Share Purchase Plans for purposes of
prospective eligibility, and to irrevocably waive the right of the Trust and
the Corporation to accelerate the payment of a note executed by a participating
Trustee or Director upon termination of such participant's relationship with
the Companies.

 In January 1991, the Companies entered into agreements with certain
Trustees and Directors who had agreements outstanding pursuant to the Share
Purchase Plans to which each such Board member agreed to stand for re-election
as a Trustee or Director at the next annual shareholders' meeting if requested
to do so by their respective Boards, or if the Boards did not so request, to
act, for a period of up to two years and at mutually agreed upon times and
places, as an advisor to the Trust or the Corporation on matters within such
Board member's experience and expertise, and the Trust or the Corporation
agreed that any outstanding promissory note executed by such Board member in
partial payment for Paired Shares purchased under the Share Purchase Plans
would be amended to cause such promissory note to be without recourse to the
maker.

 In March 1992, certain of the aforementioned notes were restructured to
bear an annual interest rate of 8 as of February 2, 1992, with such notes to
accrue interest only from February 2, 1992 until February 15, 1995, at which
time the principal and accrued interest would become payable in equal monthly
installments over a ten-year period.

 The share purchase agreement between a former officer and director and the
Corporation was terminated in connection with his December 31, 1992 resignation
as an officer of the Corporation, and the 1,667 Paired Shares (as adjusted for
the one for six reverse split in June 1995) acquired pursuant to that agreement
were assigned by him to the Corporation. The share purchase note in the amount
of 112,500, was written off at December 31, 1993. The share purchase notes of
other former officers, directors and employees aggregating 63,500 were also
written off at December 31, 1993.

 During 1994, the parties agreed to cancel the remaining outstanding share
purchase notes of 246,000 and during 1995 such notes were canceled and the
unpaid Paired Shares were forfeited by the purchasers.

Preferred shares

 The Corporation has 10,000,000 authorized preferred shares, 0.01 par
value, none of which are issued or outstanding.

14. Commitments and Contingencies.

Litigation

 In late 1991 and early 1992 three complaints were filed against the Trust
and the Corporation and certain other related persons (the "Shareholder
Actions"). As amended, two of the complaints allege that the Trust and the
Corporation, a Director and officer of the Corporation and a former
officer/Trustee of the Trust violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act and Federal and California securities laws and acted
fraudulently in connection with the Trust's and the Corporation's public
disclosures with respect to the Trust's purchase of its two hotel/casinos and
the Ramada Inn in Indian Wells, California. Both of these complaints sought
class action certification. The third complaint was filed purportedly on behalf
of the Trust and the Corporation and alleged that certain former and present
Trustees and Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the
purchase of the Ramada Inn in Indian Wells and the two hotel/casinos

F-28

 112

On July 20, 1994, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California entered a Final Judgment of Dismissal With Prejudice
(the "Final Judgment") of the two purported class actions filed in that Court.

 Pursuant to the Final Judgment, the District Court, among other things,
approved the settlement set forth in stipulations of settlement (the
"Stipulation") entered into among the plaintiffs and defendants in the
Shareholder Actions, as well as the insurance company that issued the
Companies' directors and officers policy applicable to the period to which
Shareholder Actions relate.

 Under the Final Judgment, all claims that were or might have been made in
the Shareholder Actions were deemed released as of the Effective Date (as
defined in the Stipulation), and a 3,250,000 cash settlement fund was
established which, after the deduction of fees and costs to plaintiffs'
counsel, was to be distributed to qualified members of the certified plaintiff
classes according to an allocation formula that includes a calculation based on
certain shares that opted out of the settlement. Of the settlement fund,
 2,500,000 was paid by the insurance company, 400,000 was paid by the
Companies, and 350,000 was paid by former officers of the Companies. Upon
completion of the claims administration process, any funds remaining, up to a
limit of 325,000, was to be returned to the parties who contributed to the
settlement fund on a pro rata basis. The parties contributing to the
settlement fund have previously established a separate 45,000 fund to be used
for purposes of notifying the classes and otherwise administering the
settlement. Legal fees and other costs incurred by the defendants in the
Shareholder Actions prior to October 12, 1993 were paid by the Companies;
subsequent defense costs were paid by the insurance company. Holders of
approximately 198,398 Paired Shares (as adjusted for the one for six reverse
stock split in June 1995) opted out of the settlement. All amounts relating to
the Shareholder Actions paid or expected to be paid, had been accrued and
expensed as of December 31, 1994.

 Pursuant to the Final Judgment, notice was given to the class plaintiffs
to submit claims and claims were received. Final distribution of the Net
Settlement Fund and payment of costs and expenses was ordered by the Court on
December 15, 1995.

 The Stipulation also requires that the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Corporation's Board of Directors establish a joint transaction committee of
independent Trustees and Directors to make recommendations to those Boards with
respect to any transaction proposed in the future by management and having a
fair market value of 20 million or more.

 In connection with the settlement of the Shareholder Actions, Messrs.
Young and Rothman and certain of their affiliated partnerships terminated the
management agreements (the "Management Contracts") that existed between those
partnerships and the Corporation's subsidiary, Western Host, Inc., ("Western
Host). Western Host agreed to forbear from disputing such action and withdrew
as a general partner of two additional affiliated partnerships. Messrs. Young
and Rothman paid 800,000 to Starwood Lodging in satisfaction of any damages
resulting from the termination of the management contracts. They also agreed
to be responsible for a percentage of any retroactive adjustments in worker's
compensation insurance premiums. Starwood Lodging has paid 167,041 for
retroactive worker's compensation insurance premiums and have sought
reimbursement from Messrs. Young and Rothman of their share of that amount (an
aggregate approximately 56,000). The Corporation has commenced litigation
against Messrs. Young and Rothman to collect such amounts (Starwood Lodging
Corp. v. Ronald A. Young, et al., San Diego Superior Court Case No. 693822)

Ross Settlement Agreement

 Subsequent to the settlement of the Shareholder Actions, Leonard M. Ross
and his affiliates ("Ross"), who held 198,398 Paired Shares (as adjusted for
the one for six reverse split in June 1995) and opted out of the settlement,
threatened litigation against the Trust and the Corporation.

 In October 1994, Starwood Capital entered into an agreement with Ross to
settle the threatened litigation in which Starwood Capital agreed to purchase
Ross' Paired Shares, at Ross' election, in a 60-day period beginning on
the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the Reorganization or
December 15, 1995 at a price of 33.75 subject to certain adjustments.
Starwood Capital also had the right to elect to purchase such Paired Shares at
the same time and on the same terms. The Trust and Corporation severally
agreed that under certain circumstances they would indemnify Starwood Capital
with respect to Starwood Capital's obligations to Ross, up to a maximum of

F-29

 113

 1.8 million, upon receipt of a full release from Starwood Capital of all of the
claims assigned by Ross. At December 31, 1995, the Companies had accrued 1.8
million in respect of this potential liability.
 
 Ross elected to sell his Paired Shares, and in January 1996 those Paired
Shares were sold to a third party through the New York Stock Exchange. The
Paired Shares were sold at 29.625 per Paired Share; the Trust and the
Corporation paid 1,375,743 in aggregate pursuant to their indemnity
obligations, and Starwood Capital released the Trust and the Corporation from
all claims assigned by Ross.

Environmental matters

 In the latter part of 1995, in connection with either the Acquisition
Facility or the purchase of the relevant hotel, preliminary or "Phase I"
environmental site assessments were prepared with respect to 35 of the Trust's
fee interest and ground leasehold properties. The results of those Phase I
assessments and subsequent Phase II assessments performed at six of the
properties revealed that the overall potential for environmental impairment was
assessed as low.

 A 1991 Phase I environmental assessment and a tank leak test performed in
1992 at the Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino and a Phase I environmental
assessment prepared for the Milwaukee Marriott in 1991 revealed no material
impairments.

 Neither the Trust, the Corporation, the Realty Partnership nor the
Operating Partnership has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency as a responsible or potentially responsible party for, nor have they
been the subject of any governmental proceeding with respect to, any hazardous
waste contamination. If the Trust, the Corporation, the Realty Partnership or
the Operating Partnership were to be identified as a responsible party, they
would in most circumstances be strictly liable, jointly and severally with
other responsible parties, for environmental investigation and clean-up costs
incurred by the government and, to a more limited extent, by private persons.

 Based upon the environmental reports described above, the Trust believes
that a substantial number of its hotels incorporate potentially
asbestos-containing materials. Under applicable current Federal, state and
local laws, asbestos need not be removed from or encapsulated in a hotel unless
and until the hotel is renovated or remodeled. In that context, upon the
performance of a material renovation, the appropriate measures will need to be
taken. Meanwhile, the Trust has placed in effect an asbestos operation and
maintenance plan for all those properties testing positive for asbestos.

 Based upon the above-described environmental reports and testing and facts
known to the managements of the Trust and the Corporation, future remediation
costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, financial position or cash flows of the Trust or the Corporation
and compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have
a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position
of the Trust or the Corporation.

Performance bonds and restricted cash

 The Corporation is required to post performance bonds or cash collateral
as security for certain obligations. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the
Corporation had posted performance bonds totaling approximately 756,000 and
 747,000, respectively, to cover such obligations; however, no amounts had been
drawn against such bonds. In addition, at December 31, 1995, the Corporation
has a 250,000 letter of credit with First Interstate Bank included in cash and
cash equivalents, which was restricted as to use.

 At December 31, 1995, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets
include 756,000 for the Corporation which was restricted as to use. At
December 31, 1994, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets include 
 246,000 and 1,606,000 for the Trust and the Corporation, respectively, 
which were restricted as to use. Other than the performance bonds, the 
restricted cash of the Corporation primarily is the cash of MHLP
(see Note 9).

15. Related Party Transactions.

 At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Trust holds an 800,000
uncollateralized note receivable from John Rothman, the former President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Trust. The principal amount of the note
receivable is due in 1999 and bears interest due annually at 10 .

 The Companies incurred legal fees from law firms in which a Trustee and
officer of the Trust was or currently is a partner during the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 totaling 1,728,000, 940,000, and 235,000,
respectively.

 The Companies and Starwood Capital have agreed that, subject to approval
by the Independent Trustees or Directors, as appropriate, Starwood Capital will
be reimbursed for out-of-pocket costs and expenses for any services provided to
the Company. Starwood Capital will also be reimbursed for its internal costs
(including allocation of overhead) for services provided to the Company,
provided that, where such costs are currently expensed by the Company, such
reimbursement will not exceed 250,000 in the year ending June 30, 1996. The
Companies have not reimbursed Starwood Capital for any of these costs since
July 1, 1995, and accordingly have included an accrual of 250,000 in accounts
payable and other liabilities at December 31, 1995.

 During 1995, the Trust reimbursed Starwood Capital approximately
 1,649,000, the majority of which represented a deposit on the Boston Park
Plaza. Aside from Starwood Capital's internal cost, during 1995 Starwood
Capital incurred approximately 1,198,000 of costs paid directly by the Company
to third party vendors for services provided to the Company, representing costs
associated with the Reorganization, the Offering and hotel acquisitions.

 During 1995, the Trust loaned an officer of the Trust 250,000. The loan
has a term of 10 years, bears interest, to be paid quarterly, at the lowest
applicable rate prescribed by section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. At
December 31, 1995, the loan had an applicable rate of 6.6 and was current.

16. Industry Segment Information.

 The Corporation operates in two segments of the hospitality industry,
hotel and gaming. The hotel segment consists of room, food and beverage and
other revenues recognized in connection with the operation of hotels owned by
the Corporation or under lease from the Trust, and income from management
contracts. The gaming segment consists of net win from casino operations, as
well as room, food and beverage and other revenues recognized in connection
with the operation of the two hotel/casinos under lease from the Trust. The

The Trust is an owner/lessor of real property and does not "operate" in
different segments, and is therefore not subject to disclosure by segment. The
Trust's net investment (initial cost less accumulated depreciation and
provision for loss) in the two Las Vegas hotel/casinos was 20,547,000, and
 21,306,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

18. Pro Forma Financial Information

 Due to the impact of the Reorganization of the Companies and other
 transactions in 1995, the following pro forma statements of operations are
 presented to supplement the historical statements of operations. These pro
 forma statements reflect the Reorganization, the Offering and certain
 property acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Doral Inn in New
 York, the Terrace Garden Inn and Lenox Inn in Atlanta, Georgia, and the
 Holiday Inn in Beltsville, Maryland as if they occurred on January 1, 1994:

19. Subsequent events

 On January 4, 1996, the Companies completed the purchase of the Grand
Hotel, a 263-room luxury hotel, located in Washington, D.C., for an additional
 13.5 million. The Company had purchased the mortgage interest in September
1995 for 19.5 million.

 On January 17, 1996, the Trust had entered into interest rate hedging
agreements known as Treasury locks, which have the effect of fixing the base
rate for the Trust to issue debt until October 1996 with a principal amount of
 100 million and a term to maturity of seven years. The effect of these
agreements is to fix the base rate at 5.7 percent and thus eliminate exposure
to fluctuations in seven-year interest rates.

 On January 24, 1996, the Companies completed the acquisition of the
960-room Boston Park Plaza Hotel Complex in Boston, Massachusetts. The
Companies formed the Starwood Saunders Partnership (the "Partnership") with
Donald L. Saunders of Saunders Real Estate Corporation. The Trust contributed
approximately 41.6 million in exchange for a 58 percent interest in the
Partnership, while Mr. Saunders contributed his existing interest in the asset
for the remaining 42 percent interest in the Partnership.

 On February 26, 1996, the Companies acquired a debt interest for 21
million and entered into an agreement to purchase the equity interest in the
251-room Doubletree Guest Suites Hotel and the 175-room Days Inn, both located
at the Philadelphia Airport in Philadelphia, PA.

 1995 SHARE OPTION PLAN OF THE CORPORATION

1

EXHIBIT 10.5

STARWOOD LODGING CORPORATION
 1995 SHARE OPTION PLAN
 (AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF AUGUST 17, 1995)

I. INTRODUCTION

1.1 PURPOSES AND GENERAL. The purposes of the 1995 Share Option Plan
(the "Plan") of Starwood Lodging Corporation (the "Corporation") are to align
the interests of the Corporation's shareholders and the recipients of options
under this Plan by increasing the proprietary interest of such recipients in
the Corporation's growth and success and to advance the interests of the
Corporation by attracting and retaining officers, key employees, consultants
and advisers, as well as qualified persons for service as directors of the
Corporation ("Directors"). For purposes of this Plan, references to employment
by or service as a consultant, adviser or director of the Corporation shall
also mean employment by or service as a consultant, advisor or director of a
subsidiary of the Corporation.

 This Plan seeks to accomplish the foregoing purposes by providing a
means whereby options to purchase from the Corporation shares of common stock,
par value .01 per share, of the Corporation ("Corporation Shares") and options
to purchase from the Corporation shares of beneficial interest, par value .01
per share, of Starwood Lodging Trust ("Trust Shares") may be granted in
accordance with Section II to eligible persons and shall be granted, in
accordance with Section III, to Directors. Pursuant to an Agreement dated June
25, 1980, as amended, between the Corporation and Starwood Lodging Trust (the
"Trust"), all outstanding Corporation Shares and Trust Shares are paired on a
one-for-one basis and trade as units consisting of one Corporation Share and
one Trust Share ("Paired Shares"). Accordingly, each option to purchase
Corporation Shares (a "Corporation Share Option") shall be paired with an
option to purchase an equal number of Trust Shares (a "Trust Share Option" and
each such paired Corporation Share Option and Trust Share Option is herein
referred to as a "Paired Option").

 Each Paired Option may be exercised, terminated, cancelled, forfeited,
transferred or otherwise disposed of only in units consisting of Paired Shares.
Accordingly, a Corporation Share Option, or portion thereof, may be exercised,
terminated, cancelled, forfeited, transferred or otherwise disposed of only in
connection with, and to the same extent as, the exercise, termination,
cancellation, forfeiture, transfer or other disposition of a Trust Share
Option. Each Corporation Share Option constituting part of a Paired Option may
be either an incentive share option or a non-qualified share option. An
incentive share option shall mean a Corporation Share Option that meets the
requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any successor
 2
provision, which is intended by the Committee (as defined below) to constitute
an incentive share option. Each Trust Share Option constituting part of a
Paired Option shall be a non-qualified share option.

1.2 ADMINISTRATION. This Plan shall be administered by a committee (the
"Committee") designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
"Board") consisting of two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be
a "disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and an "outside
director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, subject to any
transition rules applicable to the definition of outside director.

 The Committee may, subject to the terms of this Plan, select eligible
persons to be granted Paired Options in accordance with Section II and shall
determine the number of Paired Shares subject to each such Paired Option. The
Committee shall, subject to the terms of this Plan, determine the exercise
price of each Paired Option granted hereunder, including the portion of the
exercise price of such Paired Option which is attributable to the Corporation
Share Option and the Trust Share Option, respectively, the time and conditions
of exercise of such Paired Option and all other terms and conditions of such
Paired Option, including, without limitation, the form of the Agreement
representing such Paired Option. The Committee may, in its sole discretion and
for any reason at any time, accelerate the exercisability of any Paired Option.
The Committee shall, subject to the terms of this Plan, interpret this Plan and
the application thereof, establish rules and regulations it deems necessary or
desirable for the administration of this Plan and may impose, incidental to the
grant of a Paired Option, conditions with respect to the grant, such as
limiting competitive employment or other activities. All such interpretations,
rules, regulations and conditions shall be conclusive and binding on all
parties. Each Paired Option shall be evidenced by a written Agreement (an
"Agreement") between the Corporation and the optionee setting forth the terms
and conditions applicable to such Paired Option.

 The Committee may delegate some or all of its power and authority
hereunder to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer or other
executive officer of the Corporation as the Committee deems appropriate;
provided, however, that the Committee may not delegate its power and authority
with regard to (i) the grant of a Paired Option to any person who is a "covered
employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code or who, in the
Committee's judgment, is likely to be a covered employee at any time during the
period a Paired Option granted to such employee would be outstanding or (ii)
the selection for participation in this Plan of an officer or other person
subject

-2-
 3
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or decisions concerning the timing, pricing
or amount of a grant of a Paired Option to such an officer or other person.

 A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. The acts of
the Committee shall be either (i) acts of a majority of the members of the
Committee present at any meeting at which a quorum is present or (ii) acts
approved in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee without a
meeting.

1.3 ELIGIBILITY. Participants in this Plan shall consist of such
officers, key employees, consultants, advisers and Directors of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries as the Committee in its sole discretion may select from
time to time. The Committee's selection of a person to participate in this
Plan at any time shall not require the Committee to select such person to
participate in this Plan at any other time. Directors shall be also eligible
to participate in this Plan in accordance with Section III.

1.4 SHARES AVAILABLE. The number of Paired Shares available for grants
of Paired Options under this Plan, other than a Paired Option that includes a
Corporation Share Option that is designated as an incentive share option, shall
be 1,573,000 (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.7) plus eight
percent (8 of the sum of (i) the number of Paired Shares which may be issued
upon the exchange of limited partnership units ("Units") in SLT Realty Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and SLC Operating Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership to the extent such Units first
become outstanding after August 17, 1995 (without reduction for subsequent
repurchases, redemptions or similar events involving the Units), plus (ii) the
number of Paired Shares which first become outstanding (without reduction for
subsequent repurchases, redemptions or similar events involving Paired Shares)
after August 17, 1995 (other than by reason of (A) such exchange of Units, (B)
the issuance or delivery of Paired Shares pursuant to any employee benefit plan
of the Corporation or the Trust or (C) the issuance of Paired Shares which were
acquired and held by the Corporation or the Trust prior to their issuance),
reduced by (iii) the aggregate number of Paired Shares which become subject to
(A) outstanding Paired Options under this Plan, including each Paired Option
that includes a Corporation Share Option that is designated as an incentive
share option, or (B) outstanding options to purchase Paired Shares under the
Trust's 1995 Share Option Plan (the "Trust Plan"). Subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 4.7, the number of Paired Shares available for grants of
Paired Options that include Corporation Share Options that are designated as
incentive share options shall be 1,573,000, reduced by the aggregate number of
Paired Shares which become subject to (X) outstanding Paired Options under this
Plan, including each Paired Option that does not include a Corporation

-3-
 4
Share Option that is designated as an incentive share option, or (Y)
outstanding options to purchase Paired Shares under the Trust Plan. To the
extent that Paired Shares subject to an outstanding Paired Option or an
outstanding option to purchase Paired Shares under the Trust Plan are not
issued or delivered by reason of the termination, cancellation or forfeiture of
any such option or by reason of the delivery of Paired Shares to pay all or a
portion of the exercise price of any such option, or to satisfy all or a
portion of the tax withholding obligations relating to any such option, then
such Paired Shares shall again be available under this Plan.

 Paired Shares to be delivered under this Plan shall be made available
(i) (A) by the Corporation from authorized and unissued Corporation Shares
issued by the Corporation directly to the optionee and (B) by the Trust from
authorized and unissued Trust Shares issued by the Trust directly to the
Corporation for delivery to the optionee, (ii) from authorized and issued
Paired Shares acquired and held by the Corporation or (iii) a combination
thereof.

 To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code and the rules and
regulations thereunder, the maximum number of Paired Shares with respect to
which Paired Options may be granted during any calendar year to any person
shall be 500,000, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.7.

II. PAIRED OPTIONS

2.1 GRANTS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. The Committee may, in its discretion,
grant Paired Options to such eligible persons as may be selected by the
Committee. Each Corporation Share Option, or portion thereof, that is not an
incentive share option, shall be a non-qualified share option. Each Paired
Option that includes a Corporation Share Option that is designated as an
incentive share option shall be granted within ten years of the effective date
of this Plan. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined
as of the date of grant) of Corporation Shares with respect to which
Corporation Share Options designated as incentive share options are exercisable
for the first time by a participant during any calendar year (under this Plan
or any other plan of the Corporation, or any parent or subsidiary) exceeds the
amount (currently 100,000) established by the Code, such Corporation Share
Options shall constitute non-qualified share options. The "fair market value"
of a Corporation Share shall be that portion of the fair market value of a
Paired Share which the Committee determines to be attributable to the
Corporation Share by applying in good faith a method of valuation permissible
under Section 422 of the Code. The "fair market value" of a Paired Share shall
mean the closing transaction price of a Paired Share as reported in the New
York Stock Exchange

-4-
 5
Composite Transactions on the date as of which such value is being determined
or, if there shall be no reported transaction on such date, on the next
preceding date for which a transaction was reported; provided that if the fair
market value of a Paired Share for any date cannot be determined as above
provided, fair market value of a Paired Share shall be determined by the
Committee by whatever means or method as the Committee, in the good faith
exercise of its discretion, shall at such time deem appropriate.

2.2 TERMS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. Paired Options shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee
shall deem advisable:

 (a) Number of Paired Shares and Purchase Price. The number of
Paired Shares subject to a Paired Option and the purchase price per Paired
Share purchasable upon exercise of the Paired Option, including the portions of
the purchase price of a Paired Share which are attributable to a Corporation
Share and a Trust Share, respectively, shall be determined by the Committee;
provided, however, that (i) the purchase price per Paired Share shall not be
less than 100 of the fair market value of a Paired Share on the date of grant
of such Paired Option, (ii) the portion of the purchase price of a Paired Share
which the Committee determines to be attributable to a Corporation Share shall
not be less than 100 of the fair market value of a Corporation Share on the
date of grant of such Paired Option and (iii) the portion of the purchase price
of a Paired Share which the Committee determines to be attributable to a Trust
Share shall not be less than 100 of the fair market value of a Trust Share on
the date of grant of such Paired Option; provided further, that if a
Corporation Share Option designated as an incentive share option shall be
granted to any person who, at the time such incentive share option is granted,
owns capital stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Corporation (or of any
parent or subsidiary) (a "Ten Percent Holder"), the purchase price per
Corporation Share shall be the price (currently 110 of fair market value of a
Corporation Share) required by the Code in order to constitute an incentive
share option. The "fair market value" of a Trust Share shall be that portion
of the fair market value of a Paired Share which the Committee determines to be
attributable to the Trust Share.

 (b) Option Period and Exercisability. The period during which a
Paired Option may be exercised shall be determined by the Committee; provided,
however, that no Paired Option which includes a Corporation Share Option
designated as an incentive share option shall be exercised later than ten years
after its date of grant; provided further, that if a Paired Option which
includes a Corporation Share Option designated as an incentive

-5-
 6
share option shall be granted to a Ten Percent Holder, such Paired Option shall
not be exercised later than five years after its date of grant. The Committee
shall determine whether a Paired Option shall become exercisable in cumulative
or non-cumulative installments and in part or in full at any time. An
exercisable Paired Option, or portion thereof, may be exercised only with
respect to whole Paired Shares.

 (c) Method of Exercise. A Paired Option may be exercised (i) by
giving written notice to the Corporation specifying the number of whole Paired
Shares to be purchased and accompanied by payment therefor in full (or
arrangement made for such payment to the Corporation's satisfaction) either (A)
in cash, (B) by delivery of previously owned whole Paired Shares (which the
optionee has held for at least six months prior to the delivery of such Paired
Shares or which the optionee purchased on the open market and for which the
optionee has good title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having a
fair market value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the
aggregate purchase price payable by reason of such exercise, (C) in cash by a
broker-dealer acceptable to the Corporation to whom the optionee has submitted
an irrevocable notice of exercise or (D) a combination of (A) and (B), in each
case to the extent set forth in the Agreement relating to the Paired Option and
(ii) by executing such documents as the Corporation may reasonably request.
The Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant
to either clause (B) or (C) and in the case of an optionee who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Corporation may require that the method of
making such payment be in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Any fraction of a Paired Share which would be required
to pay such purchase price shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due
shall be paid in cash by the optionee. No certificate representing a Paired
Share shall be delivered until the full purchase price therefor has been paid.

2.3 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE.

 (a) Disability and Death. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Corporation or service as a consultant, adviser
or Director terminates by reason of Disability or death, each Paired Option
held by such optionee shall be fully exercisable and may thereafter be
exercised by such optionee (or such optionee's executor, administrator, legal
representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case may be) until and
including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is one year (or such
other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such Paired Option)
after the effective date of such optionee's termination of employment or
service or date of death, as the case may be, and (ii) the expiration date of
the term of such Paired Option. For purposes

-6-
 7
of this Plan, "Disability" shall mean the inability of an optionee
substantially to perform such optionee's duties and responsibilities for a
continuous period of at least six months.

 (b) Termination for Cause. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Corporation or service as a consultant, adviser
or Director terminates for Cause, each Paired Option held by such optionee,
whether or not then exercisable, shall terminate automatically on the effective
date of such optionee's termination of employment or service. For purposes of
this Plan, "Cause" shall mean embezzlement or misappropriation of funds or
other assets, other act of dishonesty, significant activities harmful to the
reputation of the Corporation or the Trust, willful refusal to perform or
substantial disregard of the duties properly assigned to the optionee (other
than as a result of Disability), significant violation of any statutory or
common law duty of loyalty to the Corporation or the Trust or a material breach
by the optionee of the optionee's employment Agreement with the Corporation, if
any.

 (c) Other Termination. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Corporation or service as a consultant, adviser
or Director terminates for any reason other than Disability, death or Cause,
each Paired Option held by such optionee shall be exercisable only to the
extent that such Paired Option is exercisable on the effective date of such
optionee's termination of employment or service and may thereafter be exercised
by such optionee (or such optionee's legal representative or similar person)
until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is three months
(or such other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such Paired
Option) after the effective date of such optionee's termination of employment
or service and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such Paired Option.

 (d) Death Following Termination of Employment or Service. Subject to
paragraph (e) below and unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to
a Paired Option, if an optionee dies during the one-year period following
termination of employment or service by reason of Disability, or if an optionee
dies during the three-month period following termination of employment or
service for any other reason other than Disability or Cause (or, in each case,
such other period as the Committee may specify in the Agreement relating to a
Paired Option), each Paired Option held by such optionee shall be exercisable
only to the extent that such Paired Option is exercisable on the date of such
optionee's death and may thereafter be exercised by such optionee's executor,
administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case
may be, until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is
three

-7-
 8
months (or such other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such
Paired Option) after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the term
of such Paired Option.

 (e) Termination of Employment - Incentive Share Options. Unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option which includes
a Corporation Share Option designated as an incentive share option, if the
employment with the Corporation of a holder of such a Paired Option terminates
by reason of Permanent and Total Disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of
the Code) or death, each such Paired Option shall be fully exercisable and may
thereafter be exercised by such optionee (or such optionee's executor,
administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case
may be) until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is one
year (or such shorter period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such
Paired Option) after the effective date of such optionee's termination of
employment by reason of Permanent and Total Disability or date of death, as the
case may be, and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such Paired Option.

 Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a
Paired Option which includes a Corporation Share Option designated as an
incentive share option, if the employment with the Corporation of a holder of
such a Paired Option terminates for Cause, each such Paired Option, whether or
not then exercisable, shall terminate automatically on the effective date of
such optionee's termination of employment.

 If the employment with the Corporation of a holder of a Paired
Option which includes a Corporation Share Option designated as an incentive
share option terminates for any reason other than Permanent and Total
Disability, death or Cause, each such Paired Option shall be exercisable only
to the extent such Paired Option is exercisable on the effective date of such
optionee's termination of employment and may thereafter be exercised by such
holder (or such holder's legal representative or similar person) until and
including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is three months after the
effective date of such optionee's termination of employment and (ii) the
expiration date of the term of such Paired Option.

 If the holder of a Paired Option which includes a Corporation
Share Option designated as an incentive share option dies during the one-year
period following termination of employment by reason of Permanent and Total
Disability (or such shorter period as set forth in the Agreement relating to
such Paired Option), or if the holder of such a Paired Option dies during the
three-month period following termination of employment for any reason other
than Permanent and Total Disability or Cause, each such Paired Option held by
such optionee shall be exercisable only to the extent such Paired Option is
exercisable

-8-
 9
on the date of the optionee's death and may thereafter be exercised by the
optionee's executor, administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or
similar person until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which
is three months after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the
term of such Paired Option.

III. CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO DIRECTORS

3.1 ELIGIBILITY. Each Director shall be granted Paired Options in accordance
with this Section III. All Corporation Share Options and Trust Share Options
included in the Paired Options granted under this Section III shall constitute
non-qualified share options.

3.2 GRANTS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. Each Director shall be granted Paired Options
as follows:

 (a) Time of Grant. On the date of the effectiveness of the
Corporation's first public offering of Corporation Shares which occurs
subsequent to the adoption of this Plan by the Board and prior to June 30,
1996, and on June 30 of each calendar year beginning in 1996 (or, if later, on
the date on which a person is first elected to serve as a Director), each
person who is a Director on such date, including each person who has been
elected a Director as of such date but who will not begin to serve as a
Director until a later date, shall be granted a Paired Option to purchase 6,000
Paired Shares (which amount shall be pro-rated if such person is first elected
to serve as a Director on a date other than such effective date or June 30 of a
calendar year, as the case may be) at a purchase price per Paired Share equal
to 100 of the fair market value of a Paired Share on the date of grant of such
Paired Option; provided, however, that the portion of the purchase price of a
Paired Share which is attributable to a Corporation Share shall be 100 of the
fair market value of a Corporation Share on the date of grant of such Paired
Option and the portion of the purchase price of a Paired Share which is
attributable to a Trust Share shall be 100 of the fair market value of a Trust
Share on the date of grant of such Paired Option.

 (b) Option Period and Exercisability. Each Paired Option granted
under this Article III shall be fully exercisable on and after its date of
grant, shall expire ten years after its date of grant (notwithstanding
termination of service as a Director for any reason prior to such ten-year
anniversary date) and may be exercised in whole or in part only with respect to
whole Paired Shares. Paired Options granted under this Article III shall be
exercisable in accordance with Section 2.2(c).

-9-
 10
 (c) Death. If a Director dies while a Paired Option is outstanding,
such Paired Option may thereafter be exercised by such Director's executor,
administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case
may be, until and including the expiration date of the term of such Paired
Option.

IV. GENERAL

4.1 EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN. This Plan shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Corporation for approval within one year after the date of
approval by the Board and, if approved by a majority of all the votes cast at a
meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present, shall become effective as
of the date of approval by the Board. No Paired Option may be exercised prior
to the date of such shareholder approval. This Plan shall terminate ten years
after its effective date unless terminated earlier by the Board. Termination
of this Plan shall not affect the terms or conditions of any Paired Option
granted prior to termination.

 Paired Options may be granted hereunder at any time prior to the
termination of this Plan, provided that no Paired Option may be granted later
than ten years after the effective date of this Plan. In the event that this
Plan is not approved by the shareholders of the Corporation within one year
after the date of approval by the Board, this Plan and any Paired Options
granted hereunder shall be null and void.

4.2 AMENDMENTS. The Board may amend this Plan as it shall deem advisable,
subject to any requirement of shareholder approval required by applicable law,
rule or regulation including Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and Sections
162(m) and 422 of the Code; provided, however, that the number of Paired Shares
subject to a Paired Option granted to Directors pursuant to Article III, the
purchase price therefor, the date of grant of any such Paired Option, and the
category of persons eligible to be granted such Paired Options shall not be
amended more than once every six months, other than to comply with changes in
the Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
or the rules and regulations thereunder; and provided further, that any
amendment with respect to the persons eligible to participate in this Plan or
the number of Paired Shares available for grants of Paired Options under this
Plan shall not be effective without shareholder approval of such amendment
within 12 months before or after the date such amendment is approved by the
Board. No amendment may impair the rights of a holder of an outstanding Paired
Option without the consent of such holder.

4.3 AGREEMENT. No Paired Option may be exercised until an Agreement is
executed by the Corporation and the optionee and, upon execution by the
Corporation and the optionee and delivery

-10-
 11
of the Agreement to the Corporation, such Paired Option shall be effective as
of the effective date set forth in the Agreement.

4.4 NON-TRANSFERABILITY. No Paired Option hereunder shall be
transferable other than (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or
pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Corporation or
(ii) in the case of a Paired Option which does not include a Corporation Share
Option designated as an incentive share option, as otherwise permitted under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act as set forth in the Agreement relating to
such Paired Option. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence,
each Paired Option may be exercised during the optionee's lifetime only by the
optionee or the optionee's legal representative or similar person. Except as
permitted by the second preceding sentence, no Paired Option shall be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed
of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to so sell, transfer, assign,
pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any Paired Option such
Paired Option and all rights thereunder shall immediately become null and void.

4.5 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Corporation shall have the right to require,
prior to the delivery of any Paired Shares, payment by the optionee of any
Federal, state, local or other taxes which may be required to be withheld or
paid in connection with a Paired Option hereunder. An Agreement may provide
that the optionee may satisfy any such obligation by any of the following
means: (A) a cash payment to the Corporation, (B) delivery to the Corporation
of previously owned whole Paired Shares (which the optionee has held for at
least six months prior to the delivery of such Paired Shares or which the
optionee purchased on the open market and for which the optionee has good
title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having an aggregate fair
market value, determined as of the date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes
arises in connection with the Paired Option (the "Tax Date"), equal to the
amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (C) a cash payment by a
broker-dealer acceptable to the Corporation to whom the optionee has submitted
an irrevocable notice of exercise or (D) any combination of (A) and (B), in
each case to the extent set forth in the Agreement relating to the Paired
Option; provided, however, that the Committee shall have sole discretion to
disapprove of an election pursuant to any of clauses (B)-(D) and that in the
case of an optionee who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the
Corporation may require that the method of satisfying any such obligation be in
compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations thereunder. An
Agreement may provide for Paired Shares to be delivered having a fair market
value in excess of the minimum amount required to be withheld, but not in
excess of the amount determined by applying the optionee's maximum marginal

-11-
 12
tax rate. Any fraction of a Paired Share which would be required to satisfy
such an obligation shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due shall be
paid in cash by the optionee.

4.6 RESTRICTIONS ON PAIRED SHARES. Each Paired Option hereunder shall be
subject to the requirement that if at any time the Corporation determines that
the listing, registration or qualification of the Paired Shares subject to such
Paired Option upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is
necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the delivery
of Paired Shares thereunder, such Paired Shares shall not be delivered unless
such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action
shall have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to
the Corporation. The Corporation may require that certificates evidencing
Paired Shares delivered pursuant to any Paired Option bear a legend indicating
that the sale, transfer or other disposition thereof by the holder is
prohibited except in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 Notwithstanding any other provision hereunder, no Paired Option
hereunder shall be exercisable if, as a result of either the ability to
exercise or the exercise of such Paired Option, the Trust would not satisfy the
REIT Requirements in any respect. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"REIT Requirements" shall mean the requirements for the Trust to (i) qualify as
a real estate investment trust under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (ii) retain its status as grandfathered pursuant to
Section 132(c)(3) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and (iii) retain the
benefits of that certain private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue
Service to the Trust dated as of January 4, 1980.

4.7 ADJUSTMENT. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange
of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or
event, or any distribution to holders of Paired Shares other than a regular
cash dividend, the number and class of securities available under this Plan,
the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding Paired Option,
the purchase price per security, and the number of securities subject to each
Paired Option to be granted to Directors pursuant to Article III shall be
appropriately adjusted by the Committee, such adjustments to be made in the
case of outstanding Paired Options without an increase in the aggregate
purchase price. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment
shall be final, binding and conclusive. If any adjustment would result in a
fractional security being (i) available under this Plan, such fractional
security shall be disregarded, or (ii) subject to a Paired Option

-12-
 13
under this Plan, the Company shall pay the optionee, in connection with the
first exercise of the Paired Option in whole or in part, occurring after such
adjustment, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the fraction of
such security (rounded to the nearest hundredth) by (B) the excess, if any, of
(x) the fair market value of a Paired Share on the exercise date over (y) the
exercise price of the Paired Option.

 With respect to any optionee who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act and notwithstanding the exercise periods set forth in paragraphs
(a), (c) and (d) of Section 2.3, paragraph (b) of Section 3.2 or as set forth
pursuant to such paragraphs in any Agreement to which such optionee is a party
(or as may be set forth in any Agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section
2.3), in the event (i) the Corporation is involved in a business combination
which is intended to be treated as a pooling of interests for financial
accounting purposes (a "Pooling Transaction") or pursuant to which such
optionee receives a substitute option to purchase securities of any entity,
including an entity directly or indirectly acquiring the Corporation, and (ii)
such optionee's employment with the Corporation or service as a Director is
terminated during the nine-month period beginning three months prior to the
consummation of such business combination, then each Paired Option (or option
in substitution thereof) held by such optionee shall be exercisable to the
extent set forth in such paragraphs until and including the latest of (x) the
date set forth pursuant to the then applicable paragraph of Section 2.3 or 3.2,
as the case may be, (y) the date which is six months and one day after the
consummation of such business combination and (z) the date which is ten
business days after the date of expiration of any period during which such
optionee may not dispose of a security issued in the Pooling Transaction in
order for the Pooling Transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of
interests.

4.8 NO RIGHT OF PARTICIPATION OR EMPLOYMENT. No person shall have any right
to participate in this Plan. Neither this Plan nor any Paired Option granted
hereunder shall confer upon any person any right to continued employment by the
Corporation, any subsidiary or any affiliate of the Corporation or affect in
any manner the right of the Corporation, any subsidiary or any affiliate of the
Corporation to terminate the employment of any person at any time without
liability hereunder.

4.9 RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER. No person shall have any rights as a shareholder
of the Corporation with respect to any Corporation Shares or Trust Shares which
are subject to a Paired Option hereunder until such person becomes a
shareholder of record with respect to such Corporation Shares and Trust Shares.

4.10 DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. If permitted by the Corporation, an optionee
may file with the Committee a written

-13-
 14
designation of one or more persons as such optionee's beneficiary or
beneficiaries (both primary and contingent) in the event of the optionee's
death. To the extent an outstanding Paired Option granted hereunder is
exercisable, such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be entitled to exercise
such Paired Option.

 Each beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in
writing with the Committee during the optionee's lifetime on a form prescribed
by the Committee. The spouse of a married optionee domiciled in a community
property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of a beneficiary other than
such spouse. The filing with the Committee of a new beneficiary designation
shall cancel all previously filed beneficiary designations.

 If an optionee fails to designate a beneficiary, or if all designated
beneficiaries of an optionee predecease the optionee, then each outstanding
Paired Option hereunder held by such optionee, to the extent exercisable, may
be exercised by such optionee's executor, administrator, legal representative
or similar person.

4.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Plan, each Paired Option hereunder and the related
Agreement, and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to
the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States,
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and construed in
accordance therewith without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.

4.12 TERMINATION OF PAIRING AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan
to the contrary, if at any time the Agreement dated June 25, 1980, by and
between the Corporation and the Trust, pursuant to which Corporation Shares and
Trust Shares are paired on a share-for-share basis, is terminated for any
reason and as a result of such termination Corporation Shares and Trust Shares
no longer are required to be transferred together, then concurrently with such
termination (i) Paired Options will no longer be granted hereunder; (ii) only
Corporation Share Options may thereafter be granted hereunder; (iii) each then
outstanding Paired Option shall constitute a wholly separate and independent
Corporation Share Option and Trust Share Option and the Corporation, in its
discretion, may require that each Agreement evidencing a Paired Option be
returned to the Corporation for cancellation in exchange for separate
agreements evidencing the Corporation Share Option and Trust Share Option
subject to such Paired Option; (iv) Corporation Share Options and Trust Share
Options shall no longer be required to be exercised, terminated, cancelled,
forfeited, transferred or otherwise disposed of together; and (v) the "fair
market value" and the "closing price" of the Corporation Shares and Trust
Shares as used herein shall thereafter be deemed to refer, respectively, to

-14-
 15
the fair market value and the closing price of a Corporation Share and a Trust
Share.

 1995 SHARE OPTION PLAN OF THE TRUST

1

EXHIBIT 10.6

STARWOOD LODGING TRUST
 1995 SHARE OPTION PLAN
 (AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF AUGUST 17, 1995)

I. INTRODUCTION

1.1 PURPOSES AND GENERAL. The purposes of the 1995 Share Option Plan
(the "Plan") of Starwood Lodging Trust (the "Trust") are to align the interests
of the Trust's shareholders and the recipients of options under this Plan by
increasing the proprietary interest of such recipients in the Trust's growth
and success and to advance the interests of the Trust by attracting and
retaining officers, key employees, consultants and advisers, as well as
qualified persons for service as trustees of the Trust ("Trustees"). For
purposes of this Plan, references to employment by or service as a consultant,
adviser or Trustee of the Trust shall also mean employment by or service as a
consultant, adviser or Trustee of a subsidiary of the Trust.

 This Plan seeks to accomplish the foregoing purposes by providing a
means whereby options to purchase from the Trust shares of beneficial interest,
par value .01 per share, of the Trust ("Trust Shares") and options to purchase
from the Trust shares of the common stock, par value .01 per share, of
Starwood Lodging Corporation ("Corporation Shares") may be granted, in
accordance with Section II, to eligible persons and shall be granted, in
accordance with Section III, to Trustees. Pursuant to an Agreement dated June
25, 1980, as amended, between the Trust and Starwood Lodging Corporation (the
"Corporation"), all outstanding Trust Shares and Corporation Shares are paired
on a one-for-one basis and trade as units consisting of one Trust Share and one
Corporation Share ("Paired Shares"). Accordingly, each option to purchase
Trust Shares (a "Trust Share Option") shall be paired with an option to
purchase an equal number of Corporation Shares (a "Corporation Share Option"
and each such paired Trust Share Option and Corporation Share Option is herein
referred to as a "Paired Option").

 Each Paired Option may be exercised, terminated, cancelled, forfeited,
transferred or otherwise disposed of only in units consisting of Paired Shares.
Accordingly, a Trust Share Option, or portion thereof, may be exercised,
terminated, cancelled, forfeited, transferred or otherwise disposed of only in
connection with, and to the same extent as, the exercise, termination,
cancellation, forfeiture, transfer or other disposition of a Corporation Share
Option. Each Trust Share Option constituting part of a Paired Option may be
either an incentive share option or a non-qualified share option. An incentive
share option shall mean a Trust Share Option that meets the requirements of
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any successor provision, which
 2
is intended by the Committee (as defined below) to constitute an incentive
share option. Each Corporation Share Option constituting part of a Paired
Option shall be a non-qualified share option.

1.2 ADMINISTRATION. This Plan shall be administered by a committee (the
"Committee") designated by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board")
consisting of two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be a
"disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and an "outside
director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, subject to any
transition rules applicable to the definition of outside director.

 The Committee may, subject to the terms of this Plan, select eligible
persons to be granted Paired Options in accordance with Section II and shall
determine the number of Paired Shares subject to each such Paired Option. The
Committee shall, subject to the terms of this Plan, determine the exercise
price of each Paired Option granted hereunder, including the portion of the
exercise price of such Paired Option which is attributable to the Trust Share
Option and the Corporation Share Option, respectively, the time and conditions
of exercise of such Paired Option and all other terms and conditions of such
Paired Option, including, without limitation, the form of the Agreement
representing such Paired Option. The Committee may, in its sole discretion and
for any reason at any time, accelerate the exercisability of any Paired Option.
The Committee shall, subject to the terms of this Plan, interpret this Plan and
the application thereof, establish rules and regulations it deems necessary or
desirable for the administration of this Plan and may impose, incidental to the
grant of a Paired Option, conditions with respect to the grant, such as
limiting competitive employment or other activities. All such interpretations,
rules, regulations and conditions shall be conclusive and binding on all
parties. Each Paired Option shall be evidenced by a written Agreement (an
"Agreement") between the Trust and the optionee setting forth the terms and
conditions applicable to such Paired Option.

 The Committee may delegate some or all of its power and authority
hereunder to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer or other
executive officer of the Trust as the Committee deems appropriate; provided,
however, that the Committee may not delegate its power and authority with
regard to (i) the grant of a Paired Option to any person who is a "covered
employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code or who, in the
Committee's judgment, is likely to be a covered employee at any time during the
period a Paired Option granted to such employee would be outstanding or (ii)
the selection for participation in this Plan of an officer or other person
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or decisions concerning the

-2-
 3
timing, pricing or amount of a grant of a Paired Option to such an officer or
other person.

 A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. The acts of
the Committee shall be either (i) acts of a majority of the members of the
Committee present at any meeting at which a quorum is present or (ii) acts
approved in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee without a
meeting.

1.3 ELIGIBILITY. Participants in this Plan shall consist of such
officers, key employees, consultants, advisers and Trustees of the Trust and
its subsidiaries as the Committee in its sole discretion may select from time
to time. The Committee's selection of a person to participate in this Plan at
any time shall not require the Committee to select such person to participate
in this Plan at any other time. Trustees shall also be eligible to participate
in this Plan in accordance with Section III.

1.4 SHARES AVAILABLE. The number of Paired Shares available for grants
of Paired Options under this Plan, other than a Paired Option that includes a
Trust Share Option that is designated as an incentive share option, shall be
1,573,000 (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.7) plus eight percent
(8 of the sum of (i) the number of Paired Shares which may be issued upon the
exchange of limited partnership units ("Units") in SLT Realty Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and SLC Operating Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership to the extent such Units first
become outstanding after August 17, 1995 (without reduction for subsequent
repurchases, redemptions or similar events involving the Units), plus (ii) the
number of Paired Shares which first become outstanding (without reduction for
subsequent repurchases, redemptions or similar events involving Paired Shares)
after August 17, 1995 (other than by reason of (A) such exchange of Units, (B)
the issuance or delivery of Paired Shares pursuant to any employee benefit plan
of the Trust or the Corporation or (C) the issuance of Paired Shares which were
acquired and held by the Trust or the Corporation prior to their issuance),
reduced by (iii) the aggregate number of Paired Shares which become subject to
(A) outstanding Paired Options under this Plan, including each Paired Option
that includes a Trust Share Option that is designated as an incentive share
option, or (B) outstanding options to purchase Paired Shares under the
Corporation's 1995 Share Option Plan (the "Corporation Plan"). Subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 4.7, the number of Paired Shares available
for grants of Paired Options that include Trust Share Options that are
designated as incentive share options shall be 1,573,000, reduced by the
aggregate number of Paired Shares which become subject to (X) outstanding
Paired Options under this Plan, including each Paired Option that does not
include a Trust Share Option that is designated as an incentive share option,
or (Y) outstanding options to purchase Paired Shares under the Corporation
Plan. To the extent that Paired Shares subject to an outstanding Paired

-3-
 4
Option or an outstanding option to purchase Paired Shares under the Corporation
Plan are not issued or delivered by reason of the termination, cancellation or
forfeiture of any such option or by reason of the delivery of Paired Shares to
pay all or a portion of the exercise price of any such option, or to satisfy
all or a portion of the tax withholding obligations relating to any such
option, then such Paired Shares shall again be available under this Plan.

 Paired Shares to be delivered under this Plan shall be made available
(i) (A) by the Trust from authorized and unissued Trust Shares issued by the
Trust directly to the optionee and (B) by the Corporation from authorized and
unissued Corporation Shares issued by the Corporation directly to the Trust for
delivery to the optionee, (ii) from authorized and issued Paired Shares
acquired and held by the Trust or (iii) a combination thereof.

 To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code and the rules and
regulations thereunder, the maximum number of Paired Shares with respect to
which Paired Options may be granted during any calendar year to any person
shall be 500,000, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.7.

II. PAIRED OPTIONS

2.1 GRANTS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. The Committee may, in its discretion,
grant Paired Options to such eligible persons as may be selected by the
Committee. Each Trust Share Option, or portion thereof, that is not an
incentive share option, shall be a non- qualified share option. Each Paired
Option that includes a Trust Share Option that is designated as an incentive
share option shall be granted within ten years of the effective date of this
Plan. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the
date of grant) of Trust Shares with respect to which Trust Share Options
designated as incentive share options are exercisable for the first time by a
participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan of the
Trust, or any parent or subsidiary) exceeds the amount (currently 100,000)
established by the Code, such Trust Share Options shall constitute
non-qualified share options. The "fair market value" of a Trust Share shall be
that portion of the fair market value of a Paired Share which the Committee
determines to be attributable to the Trust Share by applying in good faith a
method of valuation permissible under Section 422 of the Code. The "fair
market value" of a Paired Share shall mean the closing transaction price of a
Paired Share as reported in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
on the date as of which such value is being determined or, if there shall be no
reported transaction on such date, on the next preceding date for which a
transaction was reported; provided that if the fair market value of a Paired
Share for any date cannot be determined as above provided, fair market value of
a Paired Share shall be determined by the Committee by whatever means or method
as the Committee, in

-4-
 5
the good faith exercise of its discretion, shall at such time deem appropriate.

2.2 TERMS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. Paired Options shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee
shall deem advisable:

 (a) Number of Paired Shares and Purchase Price. The number of
Paired Shares subject to a Paired Option and the purchase price per Paired
Share purchasable upon exercise of the Paired Option, including the portions of
the purchase price of a Paired Share which are attributable to a Trust Share
and a Corporation Share, respectively, shall be determined by the Committee;
provided, however, that (i) the purchase price per Paired Share shall not be
less than 100 of the fair market value of a Paired Share on the date of grant
of such Paired Option, (ii) the portion of the purchase price of a Paired Share
which the Committee determines to be attributable to a Trust Share shall not be
less than 100 of the fair market value of a Trust Share on the date of grant
of such Paired Option and (iii) the portion of the purchase price of a Paired
Share which the Committee determines to be attributable to a Corporation Share
shall not be less than 100 of the fair market value of a Corporation Share on
the date of grant of such Paired Option; provided further, that if a Trust
Share Option designated as an incentive share option shall be granted to any
person who, at the time such incentive share option is granted, owns capital
stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of capital stock of the Trust (or of any parent or subsidiary) (a
"Ten Percent Holder"), the purchase price per Trust Share shall be the price
(currently 110 of fair market value of a Trust Share) required by the Code in
order to constitute an incentive share option. The "fair market value" of a
Corporation Share shall be that portion of the fair market value of a Paired
Share which the Committee determines to be attributable to the Corporation
Share.

 (b) Option Period and Exercisability. The period during which a
Paired Option may be exercised shall be determined by the Committee; provided,
however, that no Paired Option which includes a Trust Share Option designated
as an incentive share option shall be exercised later than ten years after its
date of grant; provided further, that if a Paired Option which includes a Trust
Share Option designated as an incentive share option shall be granted to a Ten
Percent Holder, such Paired Option shall not be exercised later than five years
after its date of grant. The Committee shall determine whether a Paired Option
shall become exercisable in cumulative or non-cumulative installments and in
part or in full at any time. An exercisable Paired Option, or portion thereof,
may be exercised only with respect to whole Paired Shares.

-5-
 6
 (c) Method of Exercise. A Paired Option may be exercised (i) by
giving written notice to the Trust specifying the number of whole Paired Shares
to be purchased and accompanied by payment therefor in full (or arrangement
made for such payment to the Trust's satisfaction) either (A) in cash, (B) by
delivery of previously owned whole Paired Shares (which the optionee has held
for at least six months prior to the delivery of such Paired Shares or which
the optionee purchased on the open market and for which the optionee has good
title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances) having a fair market
value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the aggregate purchase
price payable by reason of such exercise, (C) in cash by a broker-dealer
acceptable to the Trust to whom the optionee has submitted an irrevocable
notice of exercise or (D) a combination of (A) and (B), in each case to the
extent set forth in the Agreement relating to the Paired Option and (ii) by
executing such documents as the Trust may reasonably request. The Committee
shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to either
clause (B) or (C) and in the case of an optionee who is subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act, the Trust may require that the method of making such
payment be in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Any fraction of a Paired Share which would be required to pay such
purchase price shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due shall be paid
in cash by the optionee. No certificate representing a Paired Share shall be
delivered until the full purchase price therefor has been paid.

2.3 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE.

 (a) Disability and Death. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Trust or service as a consultant, adviser or
Trustee terminates by reason of Disability or death, each Paired Option held by
such optionee shall be fully exercisable and may thereafter be exercised by
such optionee (or such optionee's executor, administrator, legal
representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case may be) until and
including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is one year (or such
other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such Paired Option)
after the effective date of such optionee's termination of employment or
service or date of death, as the case may be, and (ii) the expiration date of
the term of such Paired Option. For purposes of this Plan, "Disability" shall
mean the inability of an optionee substantially to perform such optionee's
duties and responsibilities for a continuous period of at least six months.

 (b) Termination for Cause. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Trust or service as a consultant, adviser or
Trustee terminates for Cause, each Paired Option held by such optionee, whether
or not then exercisable, shall terminate automatically on the effective date

-6-
 7
of such optionee's termination of employment or service. For purposes of this
Plan, "Cause" shall mean embezzlement or misappropriation of funds or other
assets, other act of dishonesty, significant activities harmful to the
reputation of the Trust or the Corporation, willful refusal to perform or
substantial disregard of the duties properly assigned to the optionee (other
than as a result of Disability), significant violation of any statutory or
common law duty of loyalty to the Trust or the Corporation or a material breach
by the optionee of the optionee's employment Agreement with the Trust, if any.

 (c) Other Termination. Subject to paragraph (e) below and unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option, if an
optionee's employment with the Trust or service as a consultant, adviser or
Trustee terminates for any reason other than Disability, death or Cause, each
Paired Option held by such optionee shall be exercisable only to the extent
that such Paired Option is exercisable on the effective date of such optionee's
termination of employment or service and may thereafter be exercised by such
optionee (or such optionee's legal representative or similar person) until and
including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is three months (or such
other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such Paired Option)
after the effective date of such optionee's termination of employment or
service and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such Paired Option.

 (d) Death Following Termination of Employment or Service. Subject to
paragraph (e) below and unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to
a Paired Option, if an optionee dies during the one-year period following
termination of employment or service by reason of Disability, or if an optionee
dies during the three-month period following termination of employment or
service for any other reason other than Disability or Cause (or, in each case,
such other period as the Committee may specify in the Agreement relating to a
Paired Option), each Paired Option held by such optionee shall be exercisable
only to the extent that such Paired Option is exercisable on the date of such
optionee's death and may thereafter be exercised by such optionee's executor,
administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case
may be, until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which is
three months (or such other period as set forth in the Agreement relating to
such Paired Option) after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the
term of such Paired Option.

 (e) Termination of Employment - Incentive Share Options. Unless
otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a Paired Option which includes
a Trust Share Option designated as an incentive share option, if the employment
with the Trust of a holder of such a Paired Option terminates by reason of
Permanent and Total Disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) or
death, each such Paired Option shall be fully exercisable and may thereafter be
exercised by such optionee (or such optionee's

-7-
 8
executor, administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person,
as the case may be) until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date
which is one year (or such shorter period as set forth in the Agreement
relating to such Paired Option) after the effective date of such optionee's
termination of employment by reason of Permanent and Total Disability or date
of death, as the case may be, and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such
Paired Option.

 Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to a
Paired Option which includes a Trust Share Option designated as an incentive
share option, if the employment with the Trust of a holder of such a Paired
Option terminates for Cause, each such Paired Option, whether or not then
exercisable, shall terminate automatically on the effective date of such
optionee's termination of employment.

 If the employment with the Trust of a holder of a Paired
Option which includes a Trust Share Option designated as an incentive share
option terminates for any reason other than Permanent and Total Disability,
death or Cause, each such Paired Option shall be exercisable only to the extent
such Paired Option is exercisable on the effective date of such optionee's
termination of employment and may thereafter be exercised by such holder (or
such holder's legal representative or similar person) until and including the
earliest to occur of (i) the date which is three months after the effective
date of such optionee's termination of employment and (ii) the expiration date
of the term of such Paired Option.

 If the holder of a Paired Option which includes a Trust Share
Option designated as an incentive share option dies during the one-year period
following termination of employment by reason of Permanent and Total Disability
(or such shorter period as set forth in the Agreement relating to such Paired
Option), or if the holder of such a Paired Option dies during the three-month
period following termination of employment for any reason other than Permanent
and Total Disability or Cause, each such Paired Option held by such optionee
shall be exercisable only to the extent such Paired Option is exercisable on
the date of the optionee's death and may thereafter be exercised by the
optionee's executor, administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or
similar person until and including the earliest to occur of (i) the date which
is three months after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the
term of such Paired Option.

III. CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO TRUSTEES

3.1 ELIGIBILITY. Each Trustee shall be granted Paired Options in 
accordance with this Section III. All Trust Share Options and Corporation
Share Options included in the Paired Options granted under this Section III

3.2 GRANTS OF PAIRED OPTIONS. Each Trustee shall be granted Paired 
Options as follows:

 (a) Time of Grant. On the date of the effectiveness of the Trust's
first public offering of Trust Shares which occurs subsequent to the adoption
of this Plan by the Board and prior to June 30, 1996, and on June 30 of each
calendar year beginning in 1996 (or, if later, on the date on which a person is
first elected to serve as a Trustee), each person who is a Trustee on such
date, including each person who has been elected a Trustee as of such date but
who will not begin to serve as a Trustee until a later date, shall be granted a
Paired Option to purchase 6,000 Paired Shares (which amount shall be pro-rated
if such person is first elected to serve as a Trustee on a date other than such
effective date or June 30 of a calendar year, as the case may be) at a purchase
price per Paired Share equal to 100 of the fair market value of a Paired Share
on the date of grant of such Paired Option; provided, however, that the portion
of the purchase price of a Paired Share which is attributable to a Trust Share
shall be 100 of the fair market value of a Trust Share on the date of grant of
such Paired Option and the portion of the purchase price of a Paired Share
which is attributable to a Corporation Share shall be 100 of the fair market
value of a Corporation Share on the date of grant of such Paired Option.

 (b) Option Period and Exercisability. Each Paired Option granted
under this Article III shall be fully exercisable on and after its date of
grant, shall expire ten years after its date of grant (notwithstanding
termination of service as a Trustee for any reason prior to such ten-year
anniversary date) and may be exercised in whole or in part only with respect to
whole Paired Shares. Paired Options granted under this Article III shall be
exercisable in accordance with Section 2.2(c).

 (c) Death. If a Trustee dies while a Paired Option is outstanding,
such Paired Option may thereafter be exercised by such Trustee's executor,
administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person, as the case
may be, until and including the expiration date of the term of such Paired
Option.

IV. GENERAL

4.1 EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN. This Plan shall be submitted to 
the shareholders of the Trust for approval within one year after the date of
approval by the Board and, if approved by a majority of all the votes cast at a
meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present, shall become effective as
of the date of approval by the Board. No Paired Option may be exercised prior
to the date of such shareholder approval. This Plan shall terminate ten years
after its effective date unless terminated earlier by the Board. Termination
of this Plan shall not affect the terms or conditions of any Paired Option
granted prior to termination.

-9-
 10
 Paired Options may be granted hereunder at any time prior to
the termination of this Plan, provided that no Paired Option may be granted
later than ten years after the effective date of this Plan. In the event that
this Plan is not approved by the shareholders of the Trust within one year
after the date of approval by the Board, this Plan and any Paired Options
granted hereunder shall be null and void.

4.2 AMENDMENTS. The Board may amend this Plan as it shall deem advisable,
subject to any requirement of shareholder approval required by applicable law,
rule or regulation including Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and Sections
162(m) and 422 of the Code; provided, however, that the number of Paired Shares
subject to a Paired Option granted to Trustees pursuant to Article III, the
purchase price therefor, the date of grant of any such Paired Option and the
category of persons eligible to be granted such Paired Options shall not be
amended more than once every six months, other than to comply with changes in
the Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
or the rules and regulations thereunder; and provided further, that any
amendment with respect to the persons eligible to participate in this Plan or
the number of Paired Shares available for grants of Paired Options under this
Plan shall not be effective without shareholder approval of such amendment
within 12 months before or after the date such amendment is approved by the
Board. No amendment may impair the rights of a holder of an outstanding Paired
Option without the consent of such holder.

4.3 AGREEMENT. No Paired Option may be exercised until an Agreement is
executed by the Trust and the optionee and, upon execution by the Trust and the
optionee and delivery of the Agreement to the Trust, such Paired Option shall
be effective as of the effective date set forth in the Agreement.

4.4 NON-TRANSFERABILITY. No Paired Option hereunder shall be
transferable other than (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or
pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Trust or (ii) in
the case of a Paired Option which does not include a Trust Share Option
designated as an incentive share option, as otherwise permitted under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act as set forth in the Agreement relating to such
Paired Option. Except to the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, each
Paired Option may be exercised during the optionee's lifetime only by the
optionee or the optionee's legal representative or similar person. Except as
permitted by the second preceding sentence, no Paired Option shall be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed
of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to so sell, transfer, assign,
pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any Paired Option such
Paired Option and all rights thereunder shall immediately become null and void.

-10-
 11
4.5 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Trust shall have the right to require, prior to
the delivery of any Paired Shares, payment by the optionee of any Federal,
state, local or other taxes which may be required to be withheld or paid in
connection with a Paired Option hereunder. An Agreement may provide that the
optionee may satisfy any such obligation by any of the following means: (A) a
cash payment to the Trust, (B) delivery to the Trust of previously owned whole
Paired Shares (which the optionee has held for at least six months prior to the
delivery of such Paired Shares or which the optionee purchased on the open
market and for which the optionee has good title, free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances) having an aggregate fair market value, determined as of the
date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes arises in connection with the
Paired Option (the "Tax Date"), equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any
such obligation, (C) a cash payment by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Trust
to whom the optionee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise or (D) any
combination of (A) and (B), in each case to the extent set forth in the
Agreement relating to the Paired Option; provided, however, that the Committee
shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to any of
clauses (B)-(D) and that in the case of an optionee who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act, the Trust may require that the method of satisfying any
such obligation be in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations
thereunder. An Agreement may provide for Paired Shares to be delivered having
a fair market value in excess of the minimum amount required to be withheld,
but not in excess of the amount determined by applying the optionee's maximum
marginal tax rate. Any fraction of a Paired Share which would be required to
satisfy such an obligation shall be disregarded and the remaining amount due
shall be paid in cash by the optionee.

4.6 RESTRICTIONS ON PAIRED SHARES. Each Paired Option hereunder shall be
subject to the requirement that if at any time the Trust determines that the
listing, registration or qualification of the Paired Shares subject to such
Paired Option upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is
necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the delivery
of Paired Shares thereunder, such Paired Shares shall not be delivered unless
such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action
shall have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to
the Trust. The Trust may require that certificates evidencing Paired Shares
delivered pursuant to any Paired Option bear a legend indicating that the sale,
transfer or other disposition thereof by the holder is prohibited except in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 Notwithstanding any other provision hereunder, no Paired Option
hereunder shall be exercisable if, as a result of either the ability to
exercise or the exercise of such Paired Option,

-11-
 12
the Trust would not satisfy the REIT Requirements in any respect. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, "REIT Requirements" shall mean the requirements for
the Trust to (i) qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) retain its status as
grandfathered pursuant to Section 132(c)(3) of the Deficit Reduction Act of
1984 and (iii) retain the benefits of that certain private letter ruling issued
by the Internal Revenue Service to the Trust dated as of January 4, 1980.

4.7 ADJUSTMENT. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange
of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or
event, or any distribution to holders of Paired Shares other than a regular
cash dividend, the number and class of securities available under this Plan,
the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding Paired Option,
the purchase price per security, and the number of securities subject to each
Paired Option to be granted to Trustees pursuant to Article III shall be
appropriately adjusted by the Committee, such adjustments to be made in the
case of outstanding Paired Options without an increase in the aggregate
purchase price. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment
shall be final, binding and conclusive. If any adjustment would result in a
fractional security being (i) available under this Plan, such fractional
security shall be disregarded, or (ii) subject to a Paired Option under this
Plan, the Company shall pay the optionee, in connection with the first exercise
of the Paired Option in whole or in part, occurring after such adjustment, an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the fraction of such security
(rounded to the nearest hundredth) by (B) the excess, if any, of (x) the fair
market value of a Paired Share on the exercise date over (y) the exercise price
of the Paired Option.

 With respect to any optionee who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act and notwithstanding the exercise periods set forth in paragraphs
(a), (c) and (d) of Section 2.3, paragraph (b) of Section 3.2 or as set forth
pursuant to such paragraphs in any Agreement to which such optionee is a party
(or as may be set forth pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 2.3), in the event
(i) the Trust is involved in a business combination which is intended to be
treated as a pooling of interests for financial accounting purposes (a "Pooling
Transaction") or pursuant to which such optionee receives a substitute option
to purchase securities of any entity, including any entity directly or
indirectly acquiring the Trust, and (ii) such optionee's employment with the
Trust or service as a Trustee is terminated during the nine-month period
beginning three months prior to the consummation of such business combination,
then each Paired Option (or option in substitution thereof) held by such
optionee shall be exercisable to the extent set forth in such paragraphs until
and including the latest of (x) the date set forth pursuant to the then
applicable paragraph of Section 2.3 or 3.2, as the case may be, (y) the date
which is

-12-
 13
six months and one day after the consummation of such business combination and
(z) the date which is ten business days after the date of expiration of any
period during which such optionee may not dispose of a security issued in the
Pooling Transaction in order for the Pooling Transaction to be accounted for as
a pooling of interests.

4.8 NO RIGHT OF PARTICIPATION OR EMPLOYMENT. No person shall have any 
right to participate in this Plan. Neither this Plan nor any Paired Option
granted hereunder shall confer upon any person any right to continued
employment by the Trust, any subsidiary or any affiliate of the Trust or affect
in any manner the right of the Trust, any subsidiary or any affiliate of the
Trust to terminate the employment of any person at any time without liability
hereunder.

4.9 RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER. No person shall have any rights as a 
shareholder of the Trust with respect to any Trust Shares or Corporation Shares
which are subject to a Paired Option hereunder until such person becomes a
shareholder of record with respect to such Trust Shares and Corporation Shares.

4.10 DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. If permitted by the Trust, an optionee may
file with the Committee a written designation of one or more persons as such
optionee's beneficiary or beneficiaries (both primary and contingent) in the
event of the optionee's death. To the extent an outstanding Paired Option
granted hereunder is exercisable, such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be
entitled to exercise such Paired Option.

 Each beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in
writing with the Committee during the optionee's lifetime on a form prescribed
by the Committee. The spouse of a married optionee domiciled in a community
property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of a beneficiary other than
such spouse. The filing with the Committee of a new beneficiary designation
shall cancel all previously filed beneficiary designations.

 If an optionee fails to designate a beneficiary, or if all designated
beneficiaries of an optionee predecease the optionee, then each outstanding
Paired Option hereunder held by such optionee, to the extent exercisable, may
be exercised by such optionee's executor, administrator, legal representative
or similar person.

4.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Plan, each Paired Option hereunder and the related
Agreement, and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to
the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States,
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and construed in
accordance therewith without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.

-13-
 14
4.12 TERMINATION OF PAIRING AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Plan to the contrary, if at any time the Agreement dated June 25, 1980, by and
between the Trust and the Corporation, pursuant to which Trust Shares and
Corporation Shares are paired on a share-for-share basis, is terminated for any
reason and as a result of such termination Trust Shares and Corporation Shares
no longer are required to be transferred together, then concurrently with such
termination (i) Paired Options will no longer be granted hereunder; (ii) only
Trust Share Options may thereafter be granted hereunder; (iii) each then
outstanding Paired Option shall constitute a wholly separate and independent
Trust Share Option and Corporation Share Option and the Trust, in its
discretion, may require that each Agreement evidencing a Paired Option be
returned to the Trust for cancellation in exchange for separate agreements
evidencing the Trust Share Option and Corporation Share Option subject to such
Paired Option; (iv) Trust Share Options and Corporation Share Options shall no
longer be required to be exercised, terminated, cancelled, forfeited,
transferred or otherwise disposed of together; and (v) the "fair market value"
and the "closing price" of the Trust Shares and Corporation Shares as used
herein shall thereafter be deemed to refer, respectively, to the fair market
value and the closing price of a Trust Share and a Corporation Share.

 TRUST INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

1

EXHIBIT 10.7

 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

 This Indemnification Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as
of the _____ day of __________, 1995, between Starwood Lodging Trust, a
Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Trust"), and ____________________
("Indemnitee"), with reference to the following facts and objectives:

 A. Indemnitee is currently serving as a Trustee or officer of the
Trust or has been elected or appointed a Trustee or officer of the Trust to
take effect on a later date; the Trust conducts its business as general partner
of SLT Realty Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership.

 B. Section 7.4 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust
dated as of June 6, 1988, as amended February 1, 1995, of the Trust (the "Trust
Declaration") and Section 8-301 (15) of the Maryland General Corporation Law
(the "MGCL") provide that the provisions of Section 2-418 of the MGCL shall be
fully applicable to the Trust and its Trustees (the "Trustees"), officers,
employees and other agents, and Section 7.4 of the Trust Declaration obligates
the Trust to indemnify its Trustees and officers to the fullest extent
permitted by the aforesaid Section 2-418 or other applicable law.

 C. Each of Section 2-418 of the MGCL and Section 7.4 of the Trust
Declaration specifically provides that the indemnification provided for therein
is not exclusive, and each such Section thereby contemplates that agreements or
other financial arrangements may be entered into between the Trust, on the one
hand, and the Trustees or the Trust's officers, on the other hand, with respect
to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to such persons.

 D. In recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection
against personal liability in order to maintain Indemnitee's continued service
to the Trust in an effective manner and Indemnitee's reliance on the Trust
Declaration, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual
assurance that the protection promised by the Trust Declaration will be
available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any limitation or
other amendment or revocation of Section 7.4 of the Trust Declaration or any
change in the composition of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the "Board of
Trustees")), the Trust desires to provide in this Agreement for the
indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the full
extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law, as set forth in this
Agreement, and, to the extent trustees' and officers' insurance is maintained
by the Trust, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under such policy or
policies.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of
Indemnitee's continuing to serve the Trust directly or, at its request, another
enterprise, the Trust and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:

 1. D&O Liability Insurance.

 (a) Subject only to the provisions of Section
1(b) hereof, so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a Trustee and/or
officer of the Trust (or shall continue at the request of the Trust to serve as
a trustee, director, officer, partner, employee or agent 

 2
of another business trust, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other 
enterprise or an employee benefit plan), and thereafter so long as Indemnitee 
shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed 
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or 
investigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee was a Trustee and/or 
officer of the Trust or served in any of said other capacities, the Trust 
shall purchase and maintain in effect, including through the obtaining or 
exercise of appropriate "tail" coverage, one or more valid, binding and 
enforceable insurance policies issued by a reputable insurer or insurers 
protecting Trustees and Trust officers (subject to customary limitations and 
exceptions) against losses, costs and expenses arising out of any such claim, 
action, suit or proceeding ("D&O Insurance"), which D&O Insurance shall 
provide coverage in all respects at least comparable to that presently 
provided, and shall cause Indemnitee to be covered by such policy or policies.

 The Trust shall not be required to maintain in effect the
policy or policies of D&O Insurance contemplated by the first paragraph of this
Section 1(a) at any time at which (i) said insurance is not generally
available, or (ii) in the reasonable business judgment of the persons then
constituting the Board of Trustees, either (I) the premium cost for such
insurance is substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage afforded,
or (II) the coverage provided by such insurance is so limited and/or subject to
such exclusions that there is insufficient benefit to the Trust from such
insurance; provided, however, that to the extent that the Trust maintains any
D&O Insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in
accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage
available for any Trustee or Trust officer under such policy or policies, and,
further, that in the event the Trust does not purchase and maintain in effect
the policy or policies of D&O Insurance contemplated by this Section 1(a), the
Trust shall indemnify Indemnitee to the full extent of the coverage that would
otherwise have been provided for the benefit of Indemnitee pursuant to such D&O
Insurance.

 (b) The Trust's obligation under this Article 1
shall terminate as of the fifth anniversary of the date on which Indemnitee
ceases to render any service or to act in any capacity specified in Article 3
hereof.

 2. Basic Indemnity. The Trust hereby indemnifies
Indemnitee, whether or not he is then an officer, to the fullest extent
permitted by the provisions of Section 2-418 of the MGCL or any amendment
thereof or by any other statute permitting such indemnification that is adopted
after the date hereof.

 3. Additional Indemnity. Subject only to the
limitations and exclusions set forth in Article 5 hereof, and without limiting
the provisions of the foregoing Article 2, the Trust hereby also expressly
agrees that in the event Indemnitee is or becomes a party to or witness or
other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or
other participant in, any action, suit or proceeding, whether pending,
threatened or completed, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether
instituted by or in the name of the Trust or any other party, or any
investigation or inquiry or investigation that Indemnitee in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding,
by reason of (or arising in part out of) the fact that Indemnitee is or was a
Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, or is or was serving at the
request of the Trust as a trustee, 

-2-
 3
director, officer, partner, employee, agent or fiduciary of another business 
trust, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise or an 
employee benefit plan, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee 
in any such capacity (any such threatened, pending or completed action, suit 
or proceeding, or any such inquiry or investigation, a "Claim"), the Trust 
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all judgments, fines, penalties and 
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other 
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, 
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement), and any and all reasonable 
expenses, actually paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with or in 
respect of such Claim.

 4. Advancing of Expenses. If so requested by
Indemnitee, and subject only to the limitations and exclusions of Article 5
hereof, the Trust shall pay to Indemnitee or reimburse Indemnitee for any and
all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
or in respect of any Claim (an "Expense Advance") in advance of the final
determination thereof, in the manner provided in Section 11(a) hereof.

 For purposes of this Agreement, "expenses" shall include
attorneys' fees and all other costs, charges and obligations paid or incurred
in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including an appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Claim.

 5. Limitation on Additional Indemnity and Advance
Payment of Expense Advances. No indemnity pursuant to Article 3 hereof shall
be paid by the Trust, nor shall the Trust be required to make Expense Advances
under Article 4 hereof:

 (a) For which and to the extent that payment or
 reimbursement of such amount is made to Indemnitee under any
 D&O Insurance;

 (b) For which and to the extent that Indemnitee
 is indemnified, receives a recovery or is reimbursed other
 than pursuant to a policy of insurance or this Agreement;

 (c) On account of any action, suit or proceeding
 for which and to the extent that judgment is rendered against
 Indemnitee (i) for an accounting of profits made from the
 purchase or sale by Indemnitee of securities of the Trust
 pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar provisions of
 any Federal, state or local statutory law, or (ii) for a
 violation of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933, as
 amended, in connection with the offer or sale of securities of
 the Trust pursuant to a registration statement under said
 statute, unless either (I) in the opinion of counsel for the
 Trust, Indemnitee is entitled to such indemnification by
 controlling precedent, or (ii) a final adjudication by a court
 of competent jurisdiction holds that such indemnification is
 not against public policy as expressed in such statute;

 (d) On account of any action, suit or proceeding
 in which a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter a final
 judgment that:

-3-
 4
 (i) The act or omission of
 Indemnitee was material to the matter giving
 rise to the proceeding and (I) was committed
 in bad faith; or (II) was that result of
 active and deliberate dishonesty; or

 (ii) Indemnitee actually received an
 improper personal benefit in money, property 
 or services; or

 (iii) In the case of any criminal
 proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause
 to believe that the act or omission was
 unlawful;

 (e) On account of any action, suit or proceeding
 in which a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter a final
 judgment in a proceeding by or in the right of the Trust that
 Indemnitee is liable to the Trust; or

 (f) If such payment by the Trust under this
 Agreement is not otherwise permitted by applicable law.

 In addition, if Maryland law in effect at the time so
requires, (i) the obligations of the Trust under Articles 3 and 4 hereof shall
be subject to the condition that any "Determining Party" (as hereinafter
defined) shall not have determined (in a written opinion in any case in which
the "Independent Legal Counsel" (as defined in Article 6 hereof) is involved)
that indemnification of Indemnitee is not permitted under applicable law or the
expenses as to which Indemnitee requests payment or reimbursement are not
reasonable, and (ii) the obligation of the Trust to make an Expense Advance
pursuant to Article 4 hereof shall be subject to the condition that if, when
and to the extent that any Determining Party determines that Indemnitee would
not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, Indemnitee shall
reimburse the Trust for all expenses paid; provided, however, that if as of the
time any determination is made by the Determining Party that Indemnitee is
under certain circumstances not permitted to be indemnified and/or that certain
expenses are not reasonable, Indemnitee has commenced or thereafter commences
legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a final
determination that Indemnitee should or may be indemnified under applicable law
and/or that any expenses are not reasonable shall not be binding, and
Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Trust for any such expense
until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which
all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed).

 If there has not been a Change in Control (as hereinafter
defined), or if such Change in Control was approved by a majority of the Board
of Trustees who were Trustees immediately prior to such Change in Control, the
"Determining Party" shall be such members of the Board of Trustees, such
Independent Legal Counsel (other than with respect to the reasonableness of
expenses), or such other person or persons as MGCL Section 2-418 (or any
successor provisions) shall require. If, on the other hand, there has been a
Change in Control not approved by such majority of the Board, the Determining
Party shall be (i) as to whether indemnification is permitted under applicable
law, the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Article 6 hereof, and (ii) as
to the reasonableness of expenses, such members

-4-
 5
of the Board of Trustees or such other person(s) as MGCL Section 2-418 (or any
successor provision) shall require.

 For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be
deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Securities Exchange Act"), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding
securities under an employee benefit plan of the Trust or another business
trust or corporation owned directly or indirectly by the shareholders of the
Trust in substantially in the same proportions as their ownership shares of
beneficial interest of the Trust, becomes, directly or indirectly, the
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13(d)-3 under the Securities Exchange
Act) of securities of the Trust evidencing 8 or more of the total voting power
evidenced by the Trusts's then outstanding securities that vote generally in
the election of trustees ("Voting Securities"), or (ii) during any period of
two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period
constitute the Board of Trustees and any new Trustee whose election by the
Board of Trustees or nomination for election by the Trust's shareholders was
approved by the vote of at least two-thirds of the Trustees then still in
office who were either Trustees at the beginning of the period or whose
election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Trustees, or (iii) the
shareholders of the Trust approve a merger or consolidation of the Trust with
any other business trust, corporation or other entity, other than a merger or
consolidation that would result in the holders of Voting Securities outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to have (by virtue
of such Voting Securities either remaining outstanding or being converted into
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees or directors
of the surviving entity) at least 80 of the total voting power evidenced by
the Voting Securities or the voting securities of such surviving entity
outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (iv) the
shareholders of the Trust approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Trust
or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Trust of (in one transaction
or a series of affiliated transactions) all or substantially all of the Trust's
assets.

 If within 15 business days after Indemnitee submits a request
for indemnification or for a payment or reimbursement of expenses hereunder,
there has been no determination by the Determining Party, or if the Determining
Party determines that Indemnitee is not permitted to be indemnified in whole or
in part under applicable law and/or that the expenses as to which payment or
reimbursement has been requested are not reasonable, Indemnitee shall have the
right to commence litigation in any court in the States of Maryland or
California having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is
proper, seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such
determination by the Determining Party or any aspect thereof, including the
legal or factual bases therefor, and the Trust hereby consents to service of
process and to appear in any such proceeding.

 6. Independent Legal Counsel. In the event that there
is a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control that has been approved
by a majority of the Board of Trustees immediately prior to such Change in
Control), the Trust shall seek legal advice with respect to any and all matters
thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments
and payment or reimbursement of expenses under this Agreement or any other
agreement or financial arrangement or the Declaration of Trust as now or
hereafter in

-5-
 6
effect only from an attorney or firm of attorneys (the "Independent Legal
Counsel") proposed by Indemnitee and selected by the Board of Trustees (or a
committee thereof), or such other person(s) as MGCL Section 2-418 (or any
successor provision) may require. Such Independent Legal Counsel, among other
things, shall render its written opinion to the Trust and Indemnitee as to
whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified
under applicable law. The Trust shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Independent Legal Counsel and shall fully indemnify such counsel against
all expenses, claims, liabilities, losses and damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or such counsel's engagement pursuant hereto.

 7. Indemnification for Additional Expenses. To the full
extent permitted by law, the Trust shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and
all expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within 10 business days of
such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, that are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Claim asserted against or action, suit or
proceeding brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or payment or
reimbursement of expenses by the Trust and this Agreement, or any other
agreement or the Trust Declaration each as now or hereafter in effect, relating
to claims for indemnification or advancement of expenses, and/or (ii) recovery
under any D&O Insurance policy or policies maintained by the Trust, if
Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification,
advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.

 8. Partial Indemnity. If Indemnitee is entitled under
any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Trust for some or a
portion of the expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement or incurred by Indemnitee in respect of a Claim, but not, however,
for all of such amount, the Trust nevertheless shall indemnify Indemnitee for
the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been
successful in the merits or otherwise in defense of any Claim, issue or matter,
including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against
all expenses incurred in connection with such defense.

 9. No Presumptions; Burden of Proof. For purposes of
this Agreement, the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order or settlement (with or without court approval) shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that Indemnitee's conduct was such that indemnity is not
available pursuant to Article 3 hereof; provided, however, that the
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior
to judgment, shall create a rebuttable such presumption, and that the
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by a settlement entered into by
the Indemnitee at the request of the Trust shall create a rebuttable
presumption that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity hereunder.

 Except as provided by the immediately preceding sentence, in
connection with any determination by the Determining Party or otherwise as to
whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proof
shall be on the Trust to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled. In
addition, any attorneys' fees as to which Indemnitee requests indemnification
or advancement shall be rebuttably presumed reasonable if and to

-6-
 7
the extent that such fees, if charged at an hourly rate, do not exceed the
hourly rates then regularly charged by such attorney or attorneys.

 10. Notification and Defense of Claims. Promptly after
receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Claim, Indemnitee
shall notify the Trust of the commencement thereof; provided, however, that the
failure so to notify the Trust shall relieve the Trust from any obligation or
liability that the Trust may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement only if
and to the extent that the Trust's rights hereunder are prejudiced by such
omission. If at the time the Trust receives such notice, the Trust has D&O
Insurance in effect, the Trust shall give prompt notice of the commencement of
Claim to the insurer(s) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
policy or policies in favor of Indemnitee. The Trust thereafter shall take all
necessary or desirable action to cause such insurer(s) to pay, or advance, to
or on behalf of Indemnitee, all losses, costs and expenses payable as a result
of such Claim in accordance with the terms of such policy or policies. The
provisions of this Agreement shall in no way relieve or modify any
obligation(s) or liability or liabilities of any insurer under any D&O
Insurance or other applicable insurance policy.

 With respect to any Claim as to which Indemnitee notifies the
Trust of the commencement thereof:

 (a) The Trust shall be entitled to participate
 therein at its own expense.

 (b) Except to the extent such Claim is brought by
 or in the right of the Trust and/or as otherwise provided below, to
 the extent that it may wish, the Trust, jointly with any other
 indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the
 defense of Indemnitee in respect of such Claim, at the Trust's own
 expense, with counsel approved by Indemnitee, whose approval shall not
 be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the Trust to Indemnitee
 of the Trust's election so to assume such defense, the Trust shall not
 be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other
 expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
 defense thereof, other than as expressly provided to the contrary
 below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in
 connection with such Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
 incurred after notice from the Trust of its assumption of the defense
 thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless:

 (i) Such retention (or continued
 retention) of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized or
 consented to by Trust;

 (ii) Counsel employed by Indemnitee shall
 have concluded that there is or may be a conflict of interest
 between Indemnitee and the Trust with respect to such action,
 in which event counsel employed by Indemnitee also shall be
 entitled to participate in the defense of Indemnitee in
 connection with such Claim;

-7-
 8
 (iii) The counsel retained by the Trust
 to assume the defense of Indemnitee in such proceeding shall
 also be representing in such action the Trust and/or one or
 more other parties; such counsel shall have concluded that
 there is an actual conflict of interest between Indemnitee and
 the one or more of such other parties (including, if
 applicable, the Trust); and within 10 business days after the
 Trust is notified of such conflict, separate counsel shall
 have been retained by the Trust to represent either the party
 or parties with whom there is such conflict of interest or
 Indemnitee (in which case such counsel shall be selected by
 Indemnitee and approved by the Trust, whose approval shall not
 be unreasonably withheld); or

 (iv) The Trust shall not in fact have
 retained counsel to assume the defense of Indemnitee in
 connection with such action.

 In each of the above cases, the fees and expenses of counsel employed
 by Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Trust.

 (c) The Trust shall not be required to indemnify
 Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of
 any Claim effected without the Trust's written consent. The Trust
 shall not settle any Claim in any manner that would impose any penalty
 or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent.
 Neither the Trust nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold consent
 to any such proposed such settlement.

 11. Indemnification and Expense Advancement Requests.

 (a) Advancement of Expenses.

 (i) Indemnitee shall, in order to
 request payment or reimbursement of expenses pursuant to
 Article 4 hereof, submit to the Board of Trustees a statement
 or request for advancement of expenses substantially in the
 form of Exhibits 1 or 1A attached hereto and made a part
 hereof (the "Expense Advancement Request").

 (ii) Within 10 business days after
 receipt of a properly completed Expense Advancement Request
 and an invoice or other statement of the expenses to be
 advanced, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, a Vice
 President or General Counsel of the Trust shall authorize the
 Trust's payment or reimbursement of said expenses, whereupon
 such payment(s) or reimbursement(s) shall immediately be made.
 No security shall be required in connection with any Expense
 Advancement Request, and it shall be accepted without
 reference to Indemnitee's financial ability to make repayment.

 (b) Indemnification.

 (i) Indemnitee, in order to request
 indemnification pursuant to Article 3 hereof, shall submit to
 the Board of Trustees a statement of

-8-
 9
 request for indemnification substantially in the form of
 Exhibit 2 attached hereto and made a party hereof (the
 "Indemnification Request").

 (ii) Any and all payments on account of
 the Trust's indemnification obligations under Article 3 hereof
 shall be made within 10 business days of the Trust's receipt
 of a duly completed Indemnification Request with respect
 thereto.

 12. Continuation of Indemnity; Indemnity Not Exclusive.
All agreements and obligations of the Trust contained herein shall continue
during the period Indemnitee is a Trustee and/or officer of the Trust (or
serves at the request of the Trust as a trustee, director, officer, partner,
employee or agent of another business trust, corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other enterprise or an employee benefit plan) and shall continue
thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Claim.

 The rights and benefits of Indemnitee and the obligations of
the Trust under this Agreement shall be in addition to, and shall not
supersede, limit or be in lieu of, the provisions, if any, relating to the
indemnification of Indemnitee by the Trust in the Trust Declaration, the
Trustee's Regulations of the Trust, any resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Trustees, any other agreement or financing arrangement, the provisions of
policies of insurance of the Trust, or other applicable law.

 13. Subrogation. In the event of payment or
reimbursement by the Trust under this Agreement, the Trust shall be subrogated
to the extent of such payment or reimbursement to any and all rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do
everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution
of any and all such documents as may be necessary to enable the Trust
effectively to enforce such rights.

 14. Notice. All notices and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
(i) delivered by hand and receipted for by the party to whom such notice or
other communication shall have been directed, or (ii) mailed by certified or
registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date
on which so mailed:

 If to Indemnitee, to: ____________________________________

 Attention: President

-9-
 10
or to such other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the Trust
or to the Trust by Indemnitee, as the case may be.

 15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provision so held to be
invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and
only to that extent) necessary to make it enforceable.

 16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one
document.

 17. Captions. The captions of the Articles to this
Agreement have been included herein for convenience of reference only, and this
Agreement shall not be construed by reference thereto.

 18. Governing Law; Binding Effect; Amendment and
 Termination.

 (a) This Agreement is made and entered into
 pursuant to Section 2-418 of the MGCL, and this Agreement shall be
 governed by and its provisions interpreted and enforced in accordance
 with the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to contracts made
 and to be performed in such State without giving effect to the
 principles of conflicts of laws.

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and
 inure to the benefit of (i) the Trust and its successors and permitted
 assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase,
 merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the
 business and/or assets of the Trust), and (ii) Indemnitee, his or her
 spouse, heirs, executors, personal and legal representatives and other
 successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
 right or obligation hereunder may be assigned, delegated or otherwise
 transferred by Indemnitee voluntarily during his lifetime or by the
 Trust, except that the Trust shall require and cause any successor to
 expressly assume and agree (by a writing in form and substance
 satisfactory to Indemnitee, whose approval shall not be unreasonably
 withheld) to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
 extent that the Trust would have been required to perform if no such
 succession had taken place.

 (c) No amendment, supplement or other
 modification, termination of this Agreement shall be effective unless
 executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any
 provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
 constitute a waiver of any other provision or provisions hereof
 (whether or not similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a
 continuing waiver.

 19. Other Indemnification Agreements.

-10-
 11
 (a) This Agreement supersedes and replaces any
prior Indemnification Agreement between the Trust and Indemnitee which covers
similar rights and obligations between Indemnitee and the Trust; provided
however that Indemnitee and the Trust shall retain any and all rights and
obligations under any such prior agreement which may have accrued or be
applicable to any period prior to the date of this Agreement.

 (b) If Indemnitee has entered into, or in the
future enters into, an Indemnification Agreement with Starwood Lodging
Corporation, a Maryland corporation, similar to this Agreement, then if and to
the extent that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification against and/or
advancement of any judgement(s), fine(s), penalty(ies), amount(s) paid in
settlement, cost(s) and/or expense(s) both under this Agreement and such other
Indemnification Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek such
indemnification and/or reimbursement under either or both said agreements, as
Indemnitee may elect, but any and all such requests for indemnification and/or
advancement or expenses shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of
Section 5 of this Agreement.

 20. Disclaimer. The name "Starwood Lodging Trust" is a
designation of a Maryland real estate investment trust and its trustees (as
trustees but not personally) under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust
dated as of June 6, 1988, as amended, and all persons dealing with such trust
must look solely to such trust property for enforcement of any claims against
such trust, the trustees, officers, agents and security holders of such trust
assume no personal liability for obligations entered into on behalf of such
trust and the respective property shall not be subject to the claims of any
person relating to any such obligations.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
Agreement on and as of the day and year first above written.

 Re: Indemnification Agreement

Gentlemen:

 Please refer to the Indemnification Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of
____________________, between Starwood Lodging Trust, a Maryland real estate
investment trust (the "Trust") and the undersigned ("Indemnitee").

 Defined terms used herein have the same meaning as in the Agreement.

 This confirms our understanding that nothing contained in the Agreement is
intended to, nor shall be deemed as, an agreement to indemnify or to advance
expenses to the Indemnitee to the extent that the Indemnitee brings any action,
suit or proceeding or causes any such action, suit or proceeding to be brought,
against the Trust or any of the Trustees of the Trust other than an action,
suit or proceeding against the Trust for the Trust's alleged breach of the
Agreement.

 Yours very truly,

AGREED TO:

 CORPORATION INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

1
 EXHIBIT 10.8

 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

 This Indemnification Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the
_____ day of __________, 1995, between Starwood Lodging Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (the "Corporation"), and ____________________ ("Indemnitee"), with
reference to the following facts and objectives:

 A. Indemnitee is a Director or officer of the Corporation or one or more
of its subsidiaries or has been elected or appointed a Director or officer of
the Corporation or one or more of its subsidiaries effective at a later date;
and in the case of a person elected or appointed as a Director of the
Corporation effective at a later date is, or pending such later date is to
become, a member of the Management Committee of SLC Operating Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (of which the Corporation is the
managing general partner) and as such is acting at the request of the
Corporation as an agent of the Corporation and an agent of SLC Operating
Limited Partnership.

 B. Article Tenth of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
of the Corporation (the "Corporation Articles") provides for the
indemnification of directors ("Directors"), officers, employees and other
agents of the Corporation to the fullest extent required or permitted under of
the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL").

 C. Each of the MGCL and Article Tenth of the Corporation Articles
specifically provides that the indemnification provided for therein is not
exclusive, thereby contemplate that agreements or other financial arrangements
may be entered into between the Corporation, on the one hand, and the
Corporation's Directors and officers, on the other hand, with respect to the
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to such persons.

 D. In recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection
against personal liability in order to maintain Indemnitee's continued service
to the Corporation in an effective manner and Indemnitee's reliance on the
Corporation Articles, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific
contractual assurance that the protection promised by the Corporation Articles
will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any
limitation or other amendment or revocation of Article Tenth of the Corporation
Articles or any change in the composition of the Corporation's Board of
Directors (the "Board of Directors")), the Corporation desires to provide in
this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to
Indemnitee to the full extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law,
as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent directors' and officers'
insurance is maintained by the Corporation, for the continued coverage of
Indemnitee under such policy or policies.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee's
continuing to serve the Corporation directly or, at its request, another
enterprise, the Corporation and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:

 1. D&O Liability Insurance.

 (a) Subject only to the provisions of Section 1(b) hereof, so
 long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a Director and/or officer of
 the Corporation (or 

 2
 shall continue at the request of the Corporation to serve as a
 director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or agent of another
 corporation, business trust, partnership, joint venture or other
 enterprise or an employee benefit plan), and thereafter so long as
 Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending
 or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
 administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee was
 a Director and/or officer of the Corporation or served in any of said
 other capacities, the Corporation shall purchase and maintain in effect,
 including through the obtaining or exercise of appropriate "tail"
 coverage, one or more valid, binding and enforceable insurance policies
 issued by a reputable insurer or insurers protecting Directors and
 Corporation officers (subject to customary limitations and exceptions)
 against losses, costs and expenses arising out of any such claim, action,
 suit or proceeding ("D&O Insurance"), which D&O Insurance shall provide
 coverage in all respects at least comparable to that presently provided,
 and shall cause Indemnitee to be covered by such policy or policies.

 The Corporation shall not be required to maintain in effect the
 policy or policies of D&O Insurance contemplated by the first paragraph of
 this Section 1(a) at any time at which (i) said insurance is not generally
 available, or (ii) in the reasonable business judgment of the persons then
 constituting the Board of Directors, either (I) the premium cost for such
 insurance is substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage
 afforded, or (II) the coverage provided by such insurance is so limited
 and/or subject to such exclusions that there is insufficient benefit to
 the Corporation from such insurance; provided, however, that to the extent
 that the Corporation maintains any D&O Insurance, Indemnitee shall be
 covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms,
 to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any Director or
 Corporation officer under such policy or policies, and, further, that in
 the event the Corporation does not purchase and maintain in effect the
 policy or policies of D&O Insurance contemplated by this Section 1(a), the
 Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee to the full extent of the coverage
 that would otherwise have been provided for the benefit of Indemnitee
 pursuant to such D&O Insurance.

 (b) The Corporation's obligations under this Article 1 shall
 terminate as of the fifth anniversary of the date on which Indemnitee
 ceases to render any service or to act in any capacity specified in
 Article 3 hereof.

 2. Basic Indemnity. The Corporation hereby indemnifies Indemnitee,
whether or not he is then in office, to the fullest extent permitted by the
provisions of Section 2-418 of the MGCL or any amendment thereof or by any
other statute permitting such indemnification that is adopted after the date 
hereof.

 3. Additional Indemnity. Subject only to the limitations and
exclusions set forth in Article 5 hereof, and without limiting the provisions
of the foregoing Article 2, the Corporation hereby also expressly agrees that
in the event Indemnitee is or becomes a party to or witness or other
participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other
participant in, any action, suit or proceeding, whether pending, threatened or
completed, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether instituted by
or in the

-2-
 3
name of the Corporation or any other party, or any investigation or inquiry or
investigation that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, by reason of (or arising in
part out of) the fact that Indemnitee is or was a Director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, trustee, officer, partner, employee, agent or
fiduciary of another corporation, business trust, partnership, joint venture or
other enterprise or an employee benefit plan, or by reason of anything done or
not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity (any such threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, or any such inquiry or investigation, a
"Claim"), the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement),
and any and all reasonable expenses, actually paid or incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with or in respect of such Claim.

 4. Advancing of Expenses. If so requested by Indemnitee, and
subject only to the limitations and exclusions of Article 5 hereof, the
Corporation shall pay to Indemnitee or reimburse Indemnitee for any and all
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with or
in respect of any Claim (an "Expense Advance") in advance of the final
determination thereof, in the manner provided in Section 11(a) hereof.

 For purposes of this Agreement, "expenses" shall include attorneys'
fees and all other costs, charges and obligations paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including an appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim.

 5. Limitation on Additional Indemnity and Advance Payment of
Expense Advances. No indemnity pursuant to Article 3 hereof shall be paid by
the Corporation, nor shall the Corporation be required to make any Expense
Advance under Article 4 hereof:

 (a) For which and to the extent that payment or reimbursement of
 such amount is made to Indemnitee under any D&O Insurance;

 (b) For which and to the extent that Indemnitee is indemnified,
 receives a recovery or is reimbursed other than pursuant to a policy of
 insurance or this Agreement;

 (c) On account of any action, suit or proceeding for which and
 to the extent that judgment is rendered against Indemnitee (i) for an
 accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by Indemnitee of
 securities of the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b)
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar
 provision of any Federal, state or local statutory law, or (ii) for a
 violation of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in
 connection with the offer or sale of securities of the Corporation
 pursuant to a registration statement under said statute, unless either (I)
 in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, Indemnitee is entitled to
 such indemnification by controlling

-3-
 4
 precedent, or (II) a final adjudication by a court of competent
 jurisdiction holds that such indemnification is not against public policy
 as expressed in such statute;

 (d) On account of any action, suit or proceeding in which a
 court of competent jurisdiction shall enter a final judgment that:

 (i) The act or omissions of Indemnitee was material to the
 matter giving rise to the proceeding and (I) was committed in bad
 faith; or (II) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; or

 (ii) Indemnitee actually received an improper personal
 benefit in money, property or services; or

 (iii) In the case of any criminal proceeding,
 Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission
 was unlawful;

 (e) On account of any action, suit or proceeding in which a
 court of competent jurisdiction shall enter a final judgment in a
 proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation that Indemnitee is liable
 to the Corporation; or

 (f) If such payment by the Corporation under this Agreement is
 not otherwise permitted by applicable law.

 In addition, if Maryland law in effect at the time so requires, (i)
the obligations of the Corporation under Articles 3 and 4 hereof shall be
subject to the condition that any "Determining Party" (as hereinafter defined)
shall not have determined (in a written opinion in any case in which the
"Independent Legal Counsel" (as defined in Article 6 hereof) is involved) that
indemnification of Indemnitee is not permitted under applicable law or the
expenses as to which Indemnitee requests payment or reimbursement are not
reasonable, and (ii) the obligation of the Corporation to make an Expense
Advance pursuant to Article 4 hereof shall be subject to the condition that if,
when and to the extent that any Determining Party determines that Indemnitee
would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, Indemnitee
shall reimburse the Corporation for all expenses paid; provided, however, that
if as of the time any determination is made by the Determining Party that
Indemnitee is under certain circumstances not permitted to be indemnified
and/or that certain expenses are not reasonable, Indemnitee has commenced or
thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to
secure a final determination that Indemnitee should or may be indemnified under
applicable law and/or that such expenses are reasonable, any determination made
by the Determining Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be
indemnified under applicable law and/or that any expenses are not reasonable
shall not be binding, and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the
Corporation for any such expense until a final judicial determination is made
with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been
exhausted or lapsed).

 If there has not been a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined),
or if such Change in Control was approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors who were Directors

-4-
 5
immediately prior to such Change in Control, the "Determining Party" shall be
such members of the Board of Directors, such Independent Legal Counsel (other
than with respect to the reasonableness of expenses), or such other person or
persons as MGCL Section 2-418 (or any successor provision) shall require. If,
on the other hand, there has been a Change in Control not approved by such
majority of the Board, the Determining Party shall be (i) as to whether
indemnification is permitted under applicable law, the Independent Legal
Counsel referred to in Article 6 hereof, and (ii) as to the reasonableness of
expenses, such members of the Board of Directors or such other person(s) as
MGCL Section 2-418 (or any successor provision) shall require.

 For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed
to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Securities
Exchange Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities
under an employee benefit plan of the Corporation or another corporation or
business trust owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the
Corporation in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares
of stock of the corporation, becomes, directly or indirectly, the "beneficial
owner" (as defined in Rule 13(d)-3 under the Securities Exchange Act) of
securities of the Corporation evidencing 8 or more of the total voting power
evidenced by the Corporation's then outstanding securities that vote generally
in the election of Directors ("Voting Securities"), or (ii) during any period
of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period
constitute the Board of Directors and any new Director whose election by the
Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders
was approved by the vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors then still in
office who were either Directors at the beginning of the period or whose
election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors, or (iii) the
stockholders of the Corporation approve a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with any other corporation, business trust or other entity, other
than a merger or consolidation that would result in the holders of Voting
Securities outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
continuing to have (by virtue of such Voting Securities either remaining
outstanding or being converted into securities entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors or trustees of the surviving entity) at least 80 of
the total voting power evidenced by the Voting Securities or the voting
securities of such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger
or consolidation, or (iv) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of
complete liquidation of the Corporation or an agreement for the sale or
disposition by the Corporation of (in one transaction or a series of affiliated
transactions) all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets.

 If within 15 business days after Indemnitee submits a request for
indemnification or for a payment or reimbursement of expenses hereunder, there
has been no determination by the Determining Party, or if the Determining Party
determines that Indemnitee is not permitted to be indemnified in whole or in
part under applicable law and/or that the expenses as to which payment or
reimbursement has been requested are not reasonable, Indemnitee shall have the
right to commence litigation in any court in the States of Maryland or
California having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is
proper, seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such
determination

-5-
 6
by the Determining Party or any aspect thereof, including the legal or factual
bases therefor, and the Corporation hereby consents to service of process and
to appear in any such proceeding.

 6. Independent Legal Counsel. In the event that there is a Change
in Control (other than a Change in Control that has been approved by a majority
of the Board of Directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the
Corporation shall seek legal advice with respect to any and all matters
thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments
and payment or reimbursement of expenses under this Agreement or any other
agreement or financial arrangement or the Corporation Articles as now or
hereafter in effect only from an attorney or firm of attorneys selected in
accordance with the provisions of this Article, which attorney or firm (the
"Independent Legal Counsel") proposed by Indemnitee and selected by the board
of Directors (or a committee thereof), or such other person(s) as MGCL Section
2-418 (or any successor provision) may require. Such Independent Legal
Counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the
Corporation and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be
permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Corporation shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Legal Counsel and shall
fully indemnify such counsel against all expenses, claims, liabilities, losses
and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or such counsel's
engagement pursuant hereto.

 7. Indemnification for Additional Expenses. To the full extent
permitted by law, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and
all expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within 10 business days of
such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, that are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Claim asserted against or action, suit or
proceeding brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or payment or
reimbursement of expenses by the Corporation under this Agreement or any other
agreement or the Corporation Articles each as now or hereafter in effect,
relating to claims for indemnification or advancement of expenses, and/or (ii)
recovery under any D&O Insurance policy or policies maintained by the
Corporation, if Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such
indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may
be.

 8. Partial Indemnity. If Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a
portion of the expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement or incurred by Indemnitee in respect of a Claim, but not, however,
for all of such amount, the Corporation nevertheless shall indemnify Indemnitee
for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that
Indemnitee has been successful in the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Claim, issue or matter, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall
be indemnified against all expenses incurred in connection with such defense.

 9. No Presumptions; Burden of Proof. For purposes of this
Agreement, the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order
or settlement (with or without court approval) shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee's conduct

-6-
 7
was such that indemnity is not available pursuant to Article 3 hereof;
provided, however, that the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of
an order of probation prior to judgment, shall create a rebuttable such
presumption, and that the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by a
settlement entered into by Indemnitee at the request of the Corporation shall
create a rebuttable presumption that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity
hereunder.

 Except as provided by the immediately preceding sentence, in
connection with any determination by the Determining Party or otherwise as to
whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proof
shall be on the Corporation to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
In addition, any attorneys' fees as to which Indemnitee requests
indemnification or advancement shall be rebuttably presumed reasonable if and
to the extent that such fees, if charged at an hourly rate, do not exceed the
hourly rates then regularly charged by such attorney or attorneys.

 10. Notification and Defense of Claims. Promptly after receipt by
Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Claim, Indemnitee shall notify
the Corporation of the commencement thereof; provided, however, that the
failure so to notify the Corporation shall relieve the Corporation from any
obligation or liability that the Corporation may have to Indemnitee under this
Agreement only if and to the extent that the Corporation's rights hereunder are
prejudiced by such omission. If at the time the Corporation receives such
notice, the Corporation has D&O Insurance in effect, the Corporation shall give
prompt notice of the commencement of Claim to the insurer(s) in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the policy or policies in favor of Indemnitee. The
Corporation thereafter shall take all necessary or desirable action to cause
such insurer(s) to pay, or advance, to or on behalf of Indemnitee, all losses,
costs and expenses payable as a result of such Claim in accordance with the
terms of such policy or policies. The provisions of this agreement shall in no
way relieve or modify any obligation(s) or liability or liabilities of any
insurer under any D&O Insurance or other applicable insurance policy.

 With respect to any Claim as to which Indemnitee notifies the
Corporation of the commencement thereof:

 (a) The Corporation shall be entitled to participate therein at
 its own expense.

 (b) Except to the extent such Claim is brought by or in the
 right of the Corporation and/or as otherwise provided below, to the extent
 that it may wish, the Corporation jointly with any other indemnifying
 party similarly notified shall be entitled to assume the defense of
 Indemnitee in respect of such Claim, at the Corporation's own expense,
 with counsel approved by Indemnitee, whose approval shall not be
 unreasonably withheld. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of
 the Corporation's election so to assume such defense, the Corporation
 shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this agreement for any legal or
 other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
 defense thereof, other than as expressly

-7-
 8
 provided to the contrary below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
 his own counsel in connection with such Claim, but the fees and expenses
 of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its
 assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee
 unless:

 (i) Such retention (or continued retention) of counsel by
 Indemnitee has been authorized or consented to by the Corporation;

 (ii) Counsel employed by Indemnitee shall have concluded
 that there is or may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and
 the Corporation with respect to such action, in which event counsel
 employed by Indemnitee also shall be entitled to participate in the
 defense of Indemnitee in connection with such Claim;

 (iii) The counsel retained by the Corporation to assume
 the defense of Indemnitee in such proceeding shall also be
 representing in such action the Corporation and/or one or more other
 parties; such counsel shall have concluded that there is an actual
 conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the one or more of such
 other parties (including, if applicable, the Corporation); and within
 10 business days after the Corporation is notified of such conflict,
 separate counsel shall not have been retained by the Corporation to
 represent either the party or parties with whom there is such
 conflict of interest or Indemnitee (in which case such counsel shall
 be selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Corporation, whose
 approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); or

 (iv) The Corporation shall not in fact have retained
 counsel to assume the defense of Indemnitee in connection with such
 action.

 In each of the above cases, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by
 Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation.

 (c) The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify
 Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any
 Claim effected without the Corporation's written consent. The Corporation
 shall not settle any Claim in any manner that would impose any penalty or
 limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent. Neither
 the Corporation nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold consent to any
 such proposed settlement.

 11. Indemnification and Expense Advancement Requests.

 (a) Advancement of Expenses.

 (i) Indemnitee shall, in order to request payment or
 reimbursement of expenses pursuant to Article 4 hereof, submit to the
 Board of Directors a statement of request for advancement of expenses
 substantially

-8-
 9
 in the form of Exhibits 1 or 1A attached hereto and made a part 
 hereof (the "Expense Advancement Request").

 (ii) Within 10 business days after receipt of a properly
 completed Expense Advancement Request and an invoice or other
 statement of the expenses to be advanced, the President, the Chief
 Executive Officer or a Vice President of the Corporation shall
 authorize the Corporation's payment or reimbursement of said
 expenses, whereupon such payment(s) or reimbursement(s) shall
 immediately be made. No security shall be required in connection
 with any Expense Advancement Request, and it shall be accepted
 without reference to Indemnitee's financial ability to make
 repayment.

 (b) Indemnification.

 (i) Indemnitee, in order to request indemnification
 pursuant to Article 3 hereof, shall submit to the Board of Directors
 a statement of request for indemnification substantially in the form
 of Exhibit 2 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
 "Indemnification Request").

 (ii) Any and all payments on account of the Corporation's
 indemnification obligations under Article 3 hereof shall be made
 within 10 business days of the Corporation's receipt of a duly
 completed Indemnification Request with respect thereto.

 12. Continuation of Indemnity; Indemnity Not Exclusive. All
agreements and obligations of the Corporation contained herein shall continue
during the period Indemnitee is a Director and/or officer of the Corporation
(or serves at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, officer,
partner, employee or agent of another corporation, business trust, partnership,
joint venture or other enterprise or an employee benefit plan) and shall
continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible
Claim.

 The rights and benefits of Indemnitee and the obligations of the
Corporation under this Agreement shall be in addition to, and shall not
supersede, limit or be in lieu of, the provisions, if any, relating to the
indemnification of Indemnitee by the Corporation in the Corporation Articles,
the Bylaws of the Corporation, any resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors, any other agreement or financing arrangement, the provisions of
policies of insurance of the Corporation, or other applicable law.

 13. Subrogation. In the event of payment or reimbursement by the
Corporation under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the
extent of such payment or reimbursement to any and all rights of recovery of
Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that
may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of any and all
such documents as may be necessary to enable the Corporation effectively to
enforce such rights.

 14. Notice. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (i) delivered by hand
and receipted

-9-
 10
for by the party to whom such notice or other communication shall have been
directed, or (ii) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid,
on the third business day after the date on which so mailed:

 Attention: Executive Vice President

or to such other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the
Corporation or to the Corporation by Indemnitee, as the case may be.

 15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of such provision to any person or circumstance is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provision so held to be
invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and
only to that extent) necessary to make it enforceable.

 16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one document.

 17. Captions. The captions of the Articles to this Agreement have
been included herein for convenience of reference only, and this Agreement
shall not be construed by reference thereto.

 18. Governing Law; Binding Effect; Amendment and Termination.

 (a) This Agreement is made and entered into pursuant to Section
 2-418 of the MGCL, and this Agreement shall be governed by and its
 provisions interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
 State of Maryland applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such
 State without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
 benefit of (i) the Corporation and its successors and permitted assigns
 (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger,
 consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business
 and/or assets of the Corporation), and (ii) Indemnitee, his or her spouse,
 heirs, executors, personal and legal representatives and other successors
 and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation
 hereunder may be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by
 Indemnitee voluntarily during his lifetime or by the Corporation, except
 that the Corporation shall

-10-
 11
 require and cause any successor to expressly assume and agree (by a
 writing in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, whose approval
 shall not be unreasonably withheld) to perform this Agreement in the same
 manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would have been
 required to perform if no such succession had taken place.

 (c) No amendment, supplement or other modification, termination
 of this Agreement shall be effective unless executed in writing by both of
 the parties hereto. No waiver of any provision or provisions of this
 Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
 provision or provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall any
 such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

 19. Other Indemnification Agreements.

 (a) This Agreement supersedes and replaces any prior Indemnification
Agreement between the Corporation and Indemnitee which covers similar rights
and obligations between Indemnitee and the Corporation; provided however that
Indemnitee and the Corporation shall retain any and all rights and obligations
under any such prior agreement which may have accrued or be applicable to any
period prior to the date of this Agreement.

 (b) If Indemnitee has entered into, or in the future enters into, an
Indemnification Agreement with Starwood Lodging Trust, a Maryland real estate
investment trust, similar to this Agreement, then if and to the extent that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification against and/or advancement of any
judgement(s), fine(s), penalty(ies), amount(s) paid in settlement, cost(s)
and/or expense(s) both under this Agreement and such other Indemnification
Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek such indemnification and/or
reimbursement under either or both of said agreements, as Indemnitee may elect,
but any and all such requests for indemnification and/or advancement of
expenses shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 5 of
this Agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement
on and as of the day and year first above written.

 Re: Indemnification Agreement

Gentlemen:

 Please refer to the Indemnification Agreement (the "Agreement") dated
as of ____________________, between Starwood Lodging Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (the "Corporation") and the undersigned ("Indemnitee").

 Defined terms used herein have the same meaning as in the Agreement.

 This confirms our understanding that nothing contained in the
Agreement is intended to, nor shall be deemed as, an agreement to indemnify or
to advance expenses to the Indemnitee to the extent that the Indemnitee brings
any action, suit or proceeding or causes any such action, suit or proceeding to
be brought, against the Corporation or any of the Directors of the Corporation
other than an action, suit or proceeding against the Corporation for the
Corporation's alleged breach of the Agreement.

 Yours very truly,

MORTGAGE LOAN FUNDING FACILITY

 Dated: July 25, 1995

SLT Realty Limited Partnership and
SLT Realty Company, L.L.C.
11845 West Olympic Boulevard, Suite 550
Los Angeles, California 90064

Attention: Barry S. Sternlicht, Chairman, Trustee and Chief
 Executive Officer of
 Starwood Lodging Trust (the general partner of SLT Realty Limited
 Partnership and 0.28 member of SLT Realty Company, L.L.C.)

Gentlemen:

 Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ("Lehman") hereby agrees to make
available to SLT Realty Limited Partnership ("SLTLP") and SLT Realty Company,
L.L.C. ("SLTLLC", together with SLTLP collectively, the "Customers") a loan
facility (this "Facility") secured by mortgage loans and a participation
interest on the terms set forth in this Mortgage Loan Funding Facility (this
"Facility Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the
respective meanings given such terms in the Pledge Agreement, dated the date
hereof, between the Customers and Lehman (the "Pledge Agreement").

 1. The Advances. Lehman agrees to make advances from
time to time (each an "Advance" and collectively with any Subsequent Advances,
the "Advances") to Customers and to Reset such Advances (subject to the
requirements of the Relevant Agreements) in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed at any one time outstanding 44,600,000 (the "Maximum Credit"). The
minimum amount of each Advance or Subsequent Advance shall be one million
dollars 1,000,000) with additional increments of one hundred thousand dollars 100,000) thereafter. This Facility is a commitment to lend and sets forth
the procedures to be used in connection with periodic Advances. The parties
acknowledge that in the absence of an Event of Default and upon satisfaction of
all of the covenants and conditions precedent in the Relevant Agreements,
Lehman shall make any Advance requested pursuant to this Facility. All
Advances made by Lehman hereunder shall be evidenced by the Promissory Note.
Although the Promissory Note shall be dated the date of issue, interest in
respect thereof shall be payable only for the periods during which the Advances
evidenced thereby are outstanding, and although the stated amount of the
Promissory Note shall be equal to the Maximum Credit, the Promissory Note shall
be enforceable only to the extent of the unpaid aggregate principal amount of
the Advances then outstanding plus any other amounts due thereunder. Within
the limits of the Maximum Credit, Customers may borrow, repay pursuant to
Sections 3 and 4 hereof and reborrow pursuant to Section 2 hereof. Lehman shall
note and endorse on its internal records each Advance and payment thereon,
provided, however, failure to do so shall not prejudice Lehman's rights under
the Relevant Agreements.

 2. Making the Advances and Resetting of the Interest
Rate. (a) On any day no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) two (2)
Business Days prior to the date on which Customers desire to borrow funds from
Lehman under this Facility or two (2) Business Days prior to the Reset Date (as
defined below) of an outstanding Advance, if the Customers desire a term until
the next Reset Date with respect to such Advance (each such term, the "Reset
Term") to be other than one month, Customers shall notify Lehman by telephone
or telecopy that Customers wish to borrow money on a specified date in a
specified principal amount and for a specified term or notify Lehman of the
desired Reset Term, if other than one month, as the case may be.

 (b) Each such request by Customers shall be
evidenced by a notice (each, a "Notice of Borrowing") substantially in the form
attached hereto, with the blanks appropriately completed and duly executed,
which Notice of Borrowing shall be received no later than 4:00 PM (New York
City time) two (2) Business Days prior to the Reset Date or the date of the
requested Advance, as applicable. On the date of such Subsequent Advance, as
so agreed by Customers and Lehman, Lehman will make its Advance to Customers
upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to such Advance set forth in
Section 6 hereof. On the Reset Date, the Interest Rate for the requested Reset
Term shall be quoted by Lehman in accordance with Section 2(c) hereof.
Promptly after the Reset Date or the date of any Subsequent Advance, as
applicable, Lehman will send to Customers' a written confirmation of such
Subsequent Advance or Reset Term (each, a "Confirmation"), and Customers'
acceptance of the related proceeds, if applicable, or failure to object in
writing within one Business Day of receipt thereof, shall constitute Customers'
agreement to the terms thereof.

 (c) The Reset Term for each Advance shall be one
month (or, in the case of the initial Reset Term related to an Advance or
Subsequent Advance, such shorter period of time from the date of such Advance
or Subsequent Advance to the immediately succeeding Reset Date), unless
otherwise requested in the Notice of Borrowing and confirmed by Lehman in the
Confirmation. In the event the Reset Term of an Advance or Subsequent Advance
is one month or less and the Reset Date or the date on which the Advance or
Subsequent Advance is made, as applicable, is (i) within the first twelve (12)
months from the date hereof, the interest rate with respect to such Advance or
Subsequent Advance shall be the LIBOR Rate, as determined by Lehman, plus one
hundred fifty (150) basis points, or (ii) after the first twelve (12) months
from the date hereof, the interest rate with respect to such Advance or
Subsequent Advance shall be the LIBOR Rate, plus one hundred seventy-five (175)
basis points (either such rate, the "Interest Rate"). In the event that
One-Month LIBOR is no longer publicly available, the Interest Rate shall be the
Prime Rate plus fifty (50) basis points. In the event that the Customers
request a Reset Term for an Advance or a Subsequent Advance which is longer
than one month, such request shall be specified on the Notice of Borrowing, and
the Interest Rate shall be the rate quoted by Lehman and agreed to by Customers
(and as specified in the Confirmation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lehman
shall be under no obligation to provide Customers with a quoted rate for a
Reset Term in excess of one month and, if such quoted rate is not mutually
agreeable among the Customers and Lehman or if no Notice of Borrowing is
delivered prior to the then applicable Reset Date, the Reset Term in connection
with the related Advances shall be one month. All computations

 -2-

3

of interest based on the LIBOR Rate or the rate quoted by Lehman at the
Customers' request shall be made by Lehman on the basis of a year of 360 days
for the actual number of days elapsed during the applicable Interest Period
(including the first day and the last day of the Interest Period). All
computations of interest based on the Prime Rate shall be made by Lehman on the
basis of a year of 360 days and twelve 30-day months for the actual number of
days elapsed during the applicable Interest Period (including the first day and
the last day of the Interest Period). In the event that the principal and/or
interest due relating to any Collateral remains due and unpaid for more than 59
days (the "Delinquent Collateral"), then the Interest Rate with respect to the
amount of the outstanding Advances or portion thereof which are secured by such
Delinquent Collateral shall be increased by one hundred fifty (150) basis
points retroactively to the date such Delinquent Collateral became 59 days
delinquent, until the Collateral is no longer Delinquent Collateral.
Notwithstanding the above, Advances shall be deemed secured first by Collateral
which is not Delinquent Collateral and second by Delinquent Collateral, to the
fullest extent possible. Lehman shall notify the Customers in writing within
30 days following Lehman's actual notice that such Collateral has become
Delinquent Collateral of the revised Collateral Value (including the Delinquent
Collateral) and the amount of outstanding Advances which are secured by such
Delinquent Collateral, as determined in accordance with the Relevant
Agreements. Any payment to be made hereunder on a day other than a Business
Day shall be made on the applicable Business Day determined in accordance with
the provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth herein and such
extension or reduction of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of payment of interest.

 (d) The Interest Rate for each Advance and
Subsequent Advance shall Reset on each Reset Date in accordance with the terms
of this Section 2 and in accordance with the provisions of the term "Interest
Period" set forth herein. On each Reset Date, unless the Customers' have
delivered the Notice of Borrowing in accordance with Sections 2(a) and (b),
Customers shall be deemed to have elected to reset the Advance or Subsequent
Advance for the Reset Term of one month at the Interest Rate applicable to such
Reset Term in effect on the Reset Date (or if at such time One Month LIBOR is
no longer publicly available, Customers shall be deemed to have elected to
convert such Advance or Subsequent Advance into an Advance bearing interest at
the Prime Rate plus fifty (50) basis points, effective as of the Reset Date).
Lehman shall send a Confirmation to the Customers after each Reset Date
specifying the new Interest Rate with respect to the related Advances or
Subsequent Advances.

 (e) Customers agree to indemnify Lehman and to
hold Lehman harmless from any loss or expense which Lehman may actually sustain
or actually incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Customers in payment
when due of the principal amount of or interest on any Advance, (ii) default by
the Customers in making a borrowing after the Customers have delivered a Notice
of Borrowing to Lehman in accordance with Section 2 hereof or (iii) prepayments
of an Advance prior to a Reset Date or the Facility Termination Date by
Customers. Lehman may fund any Advance in any manner that it in its sole
discretion chooses. This Section 2(e) shall survive termination of this
Facility and payment of all amounts outstanding under the Relevant Agreements.

-3-
 4

 (f)(1) In the event that, from and after the date
hereof, any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by Lehman with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

 (i) shall subject Lehman to any tax of
 any kind whatsoever with respect to this Facility, any Advances made
 by it, or change to the basis of taxation of payments to Lehman in
 respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall
 net income of Lehman);

 (ii) shall impose, modify or hold
 applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
 requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in
 or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit
 by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of Lehman which
 are not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate or
 the quoted rate; or

 (iii) shall impose on Lehman any other
 condition; 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lehman, by
any amount which Lehman deems to be material, of making or maintaining Advances
or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof then, in any
such case, the Customers shall promptly pay Lehman, within ten (10) days
following demand therefor, any additional amounts necessary to compensate
Lehman for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable. If Lehman
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2(f),
it shall promptly notify the Customers of the event by reason of which it has
become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lehman to the Customers shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Facility and payment of the amounts outstanding under the
Relevant Agreements.

 (2) In the event that Lehman shall have 
determined that any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by Lehman or any
corporation controlling Lehman with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lehman's or such corporation's
capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which Lehman or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or
compliance (taking into consideration Lehman's or such corporation's policies
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Lehman to be material,
then from time to time, after submission by Lehman to the Customers of a
written request therefor (including calculations of any such additional amounts
in reasonable detail), the Customers shall pay to Lehman such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate Lehman for such reduction.

 (g) All payments made by the Customers under this
Facility and the Relevant Agreements shall be made free and clear of, and
without deduction or withholding

-4-
 5

for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of
net income taxes) imposed on Lehman as a result of a present or former
connection between the jurisdiction of the government or taxing authority
imposing such tax and Lehman (excluding a connection arising solely from Lehman
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment
under, or enforced, this Facility or the Relevant Agreements) or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fee, deductions and withholdings being
hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable to Lehman hereunder or under the Relevant Agreements, the
amounts so payable to Lehman shall be increased to the extent necessary to
yield to Lehman (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts
payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Facility and
the Relevant Agreements. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Customers, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Customers shall send to Lehman for its own
account a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the
Customers showing payment thereof. If the Customers fail to pay any Taxes when
due to the appropriate taxing authority or fail to remit to Lehman the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Customers shall indemnify
Lehman for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable
by Lehman as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section
shall survive the termination of this Facility and the payment of the
Promissory Note and all other amounts payable under the Relevant Agreements.
The Customers agree that each transferee or assignee of Lehman or participant
who purchases a participation in this Facility (collectively, the
"Transferees") shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2(g) with
respect to its interest in this Facility and the Advances outstanding from time
to time as if it were "Lehman", provided that the Transferees shall not be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to this Section 2(g) than
Lehman would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the
interest transferred by Lehman to such Transferees had no such transfer
occurred. The Customers shall not be required to indemnify Lehman (or a
Transferee), pursuant to this Section 2(g) to the extent that the Taxes are a
result of the transfer of this Facility, to an office of Lehman (or such
Transferee) in another jurisdiction, after the date Lehman (or such Transferee)
obtains its interest hereunder.

 (h) The following terms have the meanings
indicated when used herein:

 may be.

accordance with Section 2(c) hereof.

 "LIBOR Rate" means with respect to each day during each

 "LIBOR Reserve Requirements" means, with respect to Lehman or
any Transferee, for any day, the aggregate (without duplication) of the rates
(expressed as a decimal fraction) of reserve requirements in effect on such day

supplemental, marginal and emergency reserves under any regulations of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto), dealing with reserve
requirements prescribed for eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as
"Eurocurrency Liabilities" in Regulation D of such Board) maintained by a
member bank of such System.

 "One-Month LIBOR" shall mean, with respect to each day during
an Interest Period pertaining to an Advance or Subsequent Advance with a Reset
Term of one month or less, a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of an

interpolated rate per annum based on such rates appearing at page 314 of the
Telerate Screen on the first day of such initial Interest Period and with
durations most closely approximating the number of days from such date to the
next succeeding Reset Date, and (b) in the case of an Advance or Subsequent
Advance made on a Reset Date or reset on a Reset Date, the rate appearing at
page 3750 of the Telerate Screen as one-month LIBOR on the first day of such
Interest Period, in each case determined at or about 11:00 a.m. (London,
England time). If either such rate shall not be so quoted, the One-Month
LIBOR shall be the rate per annum at which deposits in Dollars are offered by a
prime bank in the London interbank market designated by Lehman at approximately
11:00 a.m. (London, England time) on such date and in an amount comparable to

the principal amount thereof, plus interest thereon, in accordance with the
terms hereof and of the Promissory Note. Interest accrued on an Advance shall
be payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each month which such
Advance is outstanding and upon the payment or prepayment in full thereof,
except that interest payable on any amount not paid in full when due shall be
payable from time to time on demand. Customers shall have the right to prepay
any principal amount of any Advance without the prior written consent of Lehman
on any Reset Date and Customers may prepay an Advance prior to the Reset Date
of such Advance if Customers pay to Lehman on the date of such prepayment (the

Confirmation, in United States Dollars and in same day funds, provided,

Minimum Spending Requirement for calendar year 1996 shall be expended to
complete the work recommended by Oldham & Seltz in the Architecture and
Engineering Report, dated as of December 1, 1995, prepared by Oldham & Seltz, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Minimum Spending
Requirement for each calendar year shall be determined annually by Lehman, and

Requirement in any calendar year, Customers may apply such excess, up to an
amount equal to 2 of the annual Gross Revenues from the Grand Hotel to reduce
the amount of the Minimum Spending Requirement that must be spent in the
immediately succeeding calendar year. The Customers shall deliver evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lehman no more frequently than monthly, but at least
quarterly, of the portion of the Minimum Spending Requirement that has been
spent; such evidence shall include copies of paid invoices or other receipts
for work done or materials provided and such other information as reasonably

THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of
which, when so executed, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 24. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be

termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the New Grand Hotel
Documents, nor consent to any departure by the Customers therefrom, shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which
given. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand
on the Customers, shall entitle the Customers to any other or future notice or
demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.

 26. Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of
Lehman in insisting upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or
agreement, or exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or
under the New Grand Hotel Documents, shall operate as or constitute a waiver
thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other

the event that the funding of an Advance would cause the principal amount of
the Note Borrower has designated for such Advance to exceed the Available
Facility Amount for such Note, or if Borrower fails to make such a designation,
the excess amount of such Advance shall be funded under the other Notes in the
following manner and priority: first, under Note A, up to the Available
Facility Amount for Note A, second, under Note B, up to the Available Facility
Amount for Note B, third, under Note C; up to the Available Facility Amount for
Note C, and fourth, under Note D, up to the Available Facility Amount for Note
D. The portion of the aggregate principal balance of the Aggregate Available
Facility Amount evidenced by the Swing Line Notes shall not exceed, in the
aggregate U.S. 10,000,000.00.

 (e) The obligation of Lender and each Co-Lender to make
their pro rata share of each Advance of the Loan is several and not joint.
Neither Lender nor any Co-Lender shall be liable for the failure of any other
Co-Lender to fund its pro rata share of any Advance hereunder provided that such
Co-Lender has executed and delivered an Assignment and Assumption Agreement.
Except as provided in Section 2.10, no Lender or Co-Lender other than the Swing
Line Lender shall have any obligation to make a Swing Line Advance.

 Section 2.2 Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever Borrower
desires an Advance hereunder (other than a Swing Line Advance), it shall give
Lender at Lender's Office prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, at least
three (3) Business Days' prior facsimile, or telephonic notice (promptly
confirmed in writing) of each Advance to be made hereunder. Each such notice
(a "Notice of Borrowing") (i) shall be irrevocable, (ii) shall be executed by
the general partner of Borrower or a senior executive officer of Borrower,
(iii) shall specify (x) the aggregate principal amount of the requested
Advance, (y) the date of the Advance, (which shall be a Business Day) and (z)
the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, or, if such Advance is
not a Eurodollar Portion, that such Advance shall be a Base Rate Portion, (iv)
the Note under which the Advance will be made, (v) shall certify that, taking
into account the amount of the requested Advance, no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, and all provisions of the Loan
Documents including, but not limited to, the Available Borrowing Base Covenant
with respect to each Note and the Loan to Value Ratio Covenant with respect to
each Pool will be complied with after giving effect to such Advance, and (vi)
shall be in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit "A-1". Lender shall, upon
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period, promptly notify
Borrower thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower requests an
Advance to cure a default under the Whole Loan Facility, Borrower may request
such Advance one (1) Business

 36
 -29-

Day prior to the date of the requested Advance provided that in addition to
compliance with the conditions of this Section 2.2(a), such Advance shall be a
Base Rate Portion and Borrower certifies, in writing, that such Advance shall be
used solely for the purpose of curing such default under the Whole Loan Facility
and authorizes and directs Lender to make such Advance directly to, or for the
account of, Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc.

 (b) Whenever Borrower desires a Swing Line Advance hereunder,
it shall give Lender and Swing Line Lender at Lender's Office and Swing Line
Lender's Office prior to 11:00 A.M. New York City time, on the date that the
Swing Line Advance is to be made, which shall be a Business Day, facsimile or
telephonic notice (confirmed in writing prior to 12:00 noon, New York City Time
on the same day). Each such notice (a "Notice of Swing Line Advance") (i)
shall be irrevocable, (ii) shall be executed by the general partner of Borrower
or a senior executive officer of Borrower (iii) shall specify the aggregate
principal amount of the requested Swing Line Advance, (iv) shall specify the
date of the Swing Line Advance, which shall be a Business Day, (v) shall
certify that, taking into account the amount of the requested Swing Line
Advance, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and all
provisions of the Loan Documents including, but not limited to, the Available
Borrowing Base Covenant with respect to each Note and the Loan to Value Ratio
Covenant with respect to each Pool will be complied with after giving effect to
such Swing Line Advance, and (vi) shall be in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit "A-2." Each Swing Line Advance shall be a Base Rate Portion and shall
be allocated pro-rata among the four Swing Line Notes.

 Section 2.3 Disbursement of Funds. No later than 2:00
P.M., New York City time on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing,
provided all conditions precedent to the making of such Advance have been
complied with, and further provided that Lender has received, in immediately
available federal funds, each Co-Lender's pro rata share of such Advance from
each Co-Lender, (or, in the case of a Swing Line Advance, Lender has received
in immediately available funds the amount of the Swing Line Advance from the
Swing Line Lender), Lender will make available to Borrower by disbursing to or
at the direction of Borrower, the amount of the requested Advance. If Lender
has not received from any Co-Lender such Co-Lender's pro rata share of such
Advance, Lender shall nonetheless disburse the portion of the Advance received
by Lender, together with Lender's pro rata share of such Advance, pursuant to
this Section 2.3.

 Section 2.4 The Note. (a) Borrower's and the REIT's
obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loan shall be
evidenced by (i) the promissory note (as amended, modified, supplemented,

B, Note C and Note D individually a "Note" and collectively, together with any
related Swing Line Note, as the context may require, hereinafter referred to as
the "Notes") with blanks in each Note appropriately completed in conformity
herewith. Each Note shall (i) be payable to the order of Lender, (ii) be dated
the Closing Date, and (iii) mature on the Maturity Date. After the Syndication,
if required by a Co-Lender, Borrower and (except for the Florida Note) the REIT
hereby agree to execute for each Note a supplemental Note in the principal
amount of such Co-Lender's pro rata share of each Note substantially in the form
of Exhibit "B-1" hereto, with blanks appropriately completed, and each such
supplemental Note shall (i) be payable to order of Lender, as Agent, on account
of such Co-Lender, (ii) be dated as of the Closing Date, and (iii) mature on
the Maturity Date. Each such supplemental Note shall evidence a portion of the
existing indebtedness hereunder and not any new or additional indebtedness of
Borrower.

 (b) Borrower's and the REIT's obligation to pay the
principal of, and interest on the Swing Line Advances shall be evidenced by a
promissory note duly executed and delivered by Borrower and the REIT,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto (the "Swing Line Notes"),
supplementing Note A-1, in the principal amount of 10,000,000.00. The Swing
Line Note shall be a supplemental Note with respect to Note A-1 and shall
evidence a portion of the indebtedness under Note A-1 and not evidence any new
or additional indebtedness of Borrower or the REIT. The Swing Line Note shall
(i) be payable to order of Lender, as Agent, on account of the Swing Line
Lender or, at the Swing Line Lender's option, to the order of the Swing Line
Lender, (ii) be dated as of the date the Syndication occurs, and (iii) mature
on the Maturity Date.

 (c) Lender is hereby authorized, at its option, (i) to
endorse on the schedule attached to each Note (including the Swing Line Note)
(or on a continuation of such schedule attached to each such Note and made a
part thereof) an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each
Advance evidenced thereby (including the Swing Line Lender in the case of Swing
Line Advances), and the date and amount of each principal and interest payment
in respect thereof, and/or (ii) to record such Advances and such payments in
its books and records. Such schedule or such books and records, as the case
may be, shall be conclusive and binding on
 38
 -31-

Borrower absent manifest error provided that the failure to make any notation
shall not affect the obligations of Borrower or the REIT or the rights of
Lender or any Co-Lender hereunder.

 Section 2.5 Interest. (a) Borrower and (except with
respect to the Florida Note) the REIT shall pay interest in respect of the
unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Portion from the date of the making
of such Base Rate Portion until such Base Rate Portion shall be paid in full,
or converted to a Eurodollar Portion, at a rate per annum which shall be equal
to the sum of the Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate in effect from time to
time, such rate to change automatically and without notice as and when the Base
Rate changes.

 (b) Borrower and (except with respect to the Florida
Note) the REIT shall pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of
each Eurodollar Portion from the date of the making of such Eurodollar Portion
until such Eurodollar Portion shall be paid in full, continued as a Eurodollar
Portion or converted to a Base Rate Portion, at a rate per annum which shall be
equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate Margin plus the relevant Eurodollar
Rate.

 (c) Intentionally Omitted.

 (d) In the event that, and for so long as, any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the outstanding principal amount
of the Loan and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of
the Loan, shall bear interest at the Default Rate, calculated from the date such
payment was due without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein.

 (e) Interest on the Loan shall accrue from and including
the date of each Borrowing thereof to but excluding the date of any repayment
thereof (provided that any Advance borrowed and repaid on the same day shall
accrue one day's interest) and Borrower and (except with respect to the Florida
Note) the REIT shall pay such interest (i) in respect of each Base Rate
Portion, (A) monthly in arrears on the first day of each month, (B) on the date
of any prepayment or conversion, (C) on the Maturity Date (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and (D) after the Maturity Date, on demand, and (ii)
in respect of each Eurodollar Portion, in arrears (A) on the last day of the
applicable Interest Period, (B) on the date of any prepayment or conversion (on
the amount prepaid or converted), (C) on the Maturity Date (whether by
acceleration or otherwise), and (D) after the Maturity Date, on demand.

 (f) Interest on the outstanding principal balance of Base
Rate Portions shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360)
day year based on twelve (12) thirty (30) day months, except that interest due
and payable for a period of less than a full month shall be calculated by
multiplying the actual number of days elapsed in such period by a daily rate
based on said 360-day year. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of
Eurodollar Portions shall
 39
 -32-

be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year based on the
actual number of days elapsed.

 (g) This Agreement and the Note are subject to the
express condition that at no time shall Borrower or the REIT be obligated or
required to pay interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which
could subject Lender or any Co-Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) to
either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the
Maximum Legal Rate. If by the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents,
Borrower or the REIT is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on
the principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate, the interest rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous
payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due
hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the
rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum
Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan
for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

 Section 2.6 Interest Periods. (a) Borrower shall, in
each Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation in respect of
the making of, conversion into or continuation of a Eurodollar Portion, select
the interest period (each such period or any Short Interest Period an "Interest
Period") applicable to such Eurodollar Portion, which Interest Period, other
than a Short Interest Period, shall, at the option of Borrower, be either a one
month, two-month or three-month period subject to Section 2.6(b) below,
provided that:

 (i) the Interest Period (other than a Short Interest
 Period) for any Eurodollar Portion shall commence on the first Business
 Day of a calendar month and shall expire on the day immediately
 preceding the day that the next Interest Period (other than a Short
 Interest Period) commences;

 (ii) if the date of an Advance is not the first Business
 Day of a calendar month, the Interest Period for such Eurodollar
 Portion shall be a Short Interest Period and shall commence on the date
 of the making of such Advance and expire on the day immediately
 preceding the first Business Day of the next succeeding calendar month;
 and

 (iii) no Interest Period in respect of any Eurodollar
 Portion shall extend beyond the Maturity Date.

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
last day of an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Portion occurs within the
thirty (30) day period ending on a voluntary

 40
 -33-

prepayment date pursuant to Section 2.11 or the Maturity Date, Borrower may upon
three (3) Business Days notice to Lender, which notice shall be in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit C-1, request a Short Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Portion. Neither Lender nor the Co-Lenders shall be under any
obligation to permit Borrower to select a Short Interest Period, and the
Eurodollar Base Rate offered to Borrower for any Short Interest Period shall be
determined by Lender and the Co-Lenders in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. Lender shall notify Borrower, either orally or in writing,
prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on the date on which the Short Interest
Period is to begin, of the Eurodollar Base Rate, Eurodollar Portion and the
length of the Short Interest Period that would be applicable to such Short
Interest Period and Borrower shall orally confirm its acceptance of such
Eurodollar Base Rate at or prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time and shall
deliver written confirmation of such acceptance to Lender at or prior to 2:00
p.m. New York City time on such date. If such confirmation differs in any
respect with the commencement date or length of the Short Interest Period, the
Eurodollar Base Rate or applicable Eurodollar Portion agreed to by Lender,
Lender shall be under no obligation to create such Eurodollar Portion, and
Eurodollar Portions shall be continued in accordance with Section 2.6(c).

 (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period,
Borrower has failed to elect or confirm a new Interest Period or Eurodollar Base
Rate to be applicable to any Eurodollar Portion as provided above in Sections
2.6(a) and 2.6(b) or failed to convert such Eurodollar Portion to a Base Rate
Portion, all in accordance with Section 2.8, Borrower shall be deemed to have
elected to continue such Eurodollar Portions as Eurodollar Portions with an
Interest Period of one month (or, if at such time Eurodollar Portions are not
available pursuant to Section 2.17, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to
convert such Eurodollar Portion into a Base Rate Portion), effective as of the
expiration date of such current Interest Period.

 Section 2.7 Minimum Amount of Eurodollar Portions. All
advances, borrowings, conversions, continuations, payments, prepayments and
selection of Interest Periods hereunder shall be made or selected so that,
after giving effect thereto, each Eurodollar Portion shall (i) have a principal
amount equal to or greater than One Million Dollars (U.S. 1,000,000.00) and
(ii) be in an integral multiple of Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
(U.S. 500,000.00) in excess of such minimum amount. Subject to compliance
with such minimum amounts there shall be no limit on the number of Eurodollar
Portions.

 Section 2.8 Conversion or Continuation. (a) Subject to
the other provisions hereof, Borrower shall have the option (i) to convert at
any time all or any part of the outstanding Base Rate Portions (other than
Swing Line Advances, but including Refunded Swing Line Advances,) to Eurodollar
Portions, (ii) to convert, at the expiration of the applicable Interest Period,
any outstanding Eurodollar Portions to Base Rate Portions, or (iii) to continue
all or any part of the outstanding Eurodollar Portions as Eurodollar Portions
for one or more additional Interest Periods, subject to Section 2.7, on the
expiration of the Interest Period applicable thereto (or

 41
 -34-

prior to such expiration date, provided Borrower pays Funding Costs in
connection therewith pursuant to Section 2.17); provided that Borrower shall not
have the right to continue any Eurodollar Portion or convert any Base Rate
Portion into, a Eurodollar Portion when any Default with respect to the payment
of interest or principal hereunder or any Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and in such case all outstanding Eurodollar Portions shall
automatically convert into a Base Rate Portion effective as of the expiration
date of the related Interest Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, all Swing Line Advances shall be Base Rate Portions, and Borrower shall
not be entitled to convert any Swing Line Advance into a Eurodollar Portion. In
the event Eurodollar Portions are not available pursuant to Section 2.16,
Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Portions
into Base Rate Portions, and if such conversion occurs prior to the expiration
date of the applicable Interest Period, Borrower shall also pay all Funding
Costs and other costs, expenses and losses in connection therewith pursuant to
Sections 2.16 and 2.17.

 (b) In order to elect to convert or continue a Loan
Portion under this Section 2.8, Borrower shall deliver an irrevocable notice
thereof in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit "C-2" (a "Notice of Conversion or
Continuation") to Lender no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, (which
notice may be by facsimile transmission provided that an original is delivered
prior to the close of business on the immediately succeeding Business Day)
three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion or continuation date
in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Portion. A
Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall specify (v) the requested conversion
or continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (w) the amount and Type
of the Loan Portion to be converted or continued, (x) whether a conversion or
continuation is requested, (y) in the case of a conversion to, or a
continuation of, a Eurodollar Portion, the requested Interest Period and (z)
the existing Contract Rate applicable to the Loan Portion to be converted or
continued.

 Section 2.9 Voluntary Reduction of Maximum Facility
Amount; Termination of Maximum Facility Amount. (a) Upon at least three (3)
Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice annexed hereto as Exhibit "D"
(or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to Lender, Borrower shall
have the right, without premium or penalty, to permanently reduce the Maximum
Facility Amount, provided that (a) Borrower may not reduce the Maximum Facility
Amount below the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan at the
time of such requested reduction, (b) any such partial reduction shall be in
the minimum aggregate amount of Five Million Dollars (U.S. 5,000,000.00) or
any integral multiple of One Million Dollars (U.S. 1,000,000.00) in excess
thereof, (c) notwithstanding any such voluntary reduction of the Maximum
Facility Amount, none of the Liens affecting the Collateral shall be released
unless Borrower shall have complied with the terms and conditions of Section
2.21, (d) Borrower may not reduce the Maximum Facility Amount to an amount less
than Twenty Five Million Dollars (U.S. 25,000,000.00) and (e) if the Maximum
Facility Amount shall be reduced below the Aggregate Available Facility Amount,
the Available Facility Amount for each Note shall be
 42
 -35-

reduced at Borrower's direction, provided that such reductions do not result in
a breach of the Available Borrowing Base Covenant or the Loan to Value Covenant;
if such direction results in a breach of either the Available Borrowing Base
Covenant or the Loan to Value Covenant or if Borrower fails to specify the Note
or Notes to be reduced, the Available Facility Amount for each Note shall be
reduced pro rata, in each case so that the Aggregate Available Facility Amount
shall equal the Maximum Facility Amount. Any reduction of the Maximum Facility
Amount shall be applied pro rata to Lender's and each Co-Lender's respective
percentage interest in the Loan.

 (b) Upon at least three (3) Business Days prior
irrevocable written notice to Lender, Borrower shall have the right to
terminate the Loan, this Agreement and reduce the Maximum Facility Amount to
zero, provided that Borrower, on the date specified in such notice, pays to
Lender the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loan, together with all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, all Funding Costs, and all other sums due
under the Note (including without limitation, the Swing Line Note), this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; upon such termination, Lender and the
Co-Lender shall have no further obligation to make any Advances.

 Section 2.10 Swing Line Advances. (a) The Swing Line
Lender, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, may on behalf of the
Borrower and the REIT (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swing Line Lender
to act on their behalf) request each Co-Lender, including the Swing Line
Lender, to make an Advance in an amount equal to such Co-Lender's pro rata
share of the amount of the Swing Line Advances (the "Refunded Swing Line
Advances") outstanding on the date such notice is given. Unless any of the
events described in Section 7.1(e) shall have occurred (in which event the
procedures of subsection 2.10(b) shall apply) each Co-Lender shall, not later
than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day next succeeding the
date on which such notice is given, make available to the Swing Line Lender in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Refunded Swing Line Advance
to be made by such Co-Lender. The proceeds of such Refunded Swing Line Advance
shall be immediately applied to repay the Swing Line Advance. Upon any request
by the Swing Line Lender to the Co-Lenders pursuant to this subsection 2.10(a),
Lender shall promptly give notice to the Borrower of such request. Refunded
Swing Line Advances shall be Base Rate Portions until converted by Borrower in
accordance with Section 2.8.

 (b) If prior to the making of a Refunded Swing Line
Advance pursuant to subsection 2.10(a), one of the events described in Section
7.1(e) shall have occurred, each Co-Lender will, on the date such Refunded
Swing Line Advance was to have been made, purchase an undivided participating
interest in the outstanding Swing Line Advance in an amount equal to its pro
rata share of such Swing Line Advance. Each Co-Lender will immediately
transfer to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount
of its participation, and upon receipt thereof the Swing Line Lender will
deliver to such Co-Lender a participation certificate (a

 43
 -36-

"Swing Line Participation Certificate") in the form annexed as Exhibit J,
appropriately completed by the Swing Line Lender, dated the date of receipt of
such funds and in the amount of such Co-Lender's participation.

 (c) Whenever, at any time after the Swing Line Lender has
received from any Co-Lender such Co-Lender's participating interest in a Swing
Line Advance, the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account thereof,
the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Co-Lender its participating
interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Co-Lender's
participating interest was outstanding and funded); provided, however, that in
the event that such payment was received by the Swing Line Lender and is
required to be returned, such Co-Lender will return to the Swing Line Lender
any portion thereof previously distributed by the Swing Line Lender to it.

 (d) Each Co-Lender's obligation to purchase participating
interests pursuant to subsection 2.10(b) shall be absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation,
(a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such
Co-Lender or any Loan Party may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Loan
Party or anyone else for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or
continuation of any Default or Event of Default; (c) any adverse change in the
condition (financial or otherwise) of any Loan Party; (d) any breach of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents by any Loan Party or any Co-Lender; or
(e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

 Section 2.11 Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower and the REIT
shall have the right to prepay the Loan, in whole or in part, from time to time
on the following terms and conditions: (a) Borrower shall give Lender written
notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing), in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E, which notice shall be irrevocable, of its intent
to prepay all or a portion of the Loan, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to a prepayment of Eurodollar Portions and Base Rate Portions, which notice
shall specify the amount of such prepayment and what Loan Portions are to be
prepaid, whether or not the prepayments shall be applied to a Swing Line
Advance, and, in the case of Eurodollar Portions, the specific Borrowing(s)
pursuant to which made, (b) each prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of One Million Dollars (U.S. 1,000,000.00) (Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
(U.S. 250,000.00) for a Swing Line Advance) or any integral multiple of Five
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S. 500,000.00) (Fifty Thousand (U.S.
 50,000.00) for a Swing Line Advance) in excess thereof, and (c) prepayments of
Eurodollar Portions made pursuant to this Section on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto shall be accompanied by payment
of any Funding Costs which Lender and the Co-Lenders shall incur as a result of
such early payment. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such
notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
 44
 -37-

 Section 2.12 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) On each date
after the Closing Date on which Borrower or the REIT actually receives a
distribution of the proceeds of any insurance payment or condemnation award in
respect of any of the Real Property Assets, and if Lender is not obligated to
make such proceeds available to Borrower for the restoration of any Real
Property Asset or to release such proceeds to Borrower under the terms of the
Security Instruments, Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal balance
of the related Note secured by such Real property Asset in an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) one hundred percent (100 of such proceeds and (ii) the
Allocated Loan Amount with respect to such Real Property Asset and, in either
case, the applicable Funding Costs as a result of such payment. All
prepayments made pursuant to this subsection shall be applied in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.13, and the Available Facility Amount for such
Note shall be reduced by such amount. The Allocated Loan Amount with respect
to such Real Property Asset will be reduced in an amount equal to such
prepayment.

 (b) On each day on which the Aggregate Available Facility
Amount is reduced pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, if the Available Borrowing Base Covenant or Loan to Value Ratio
Covenant are no longer satisfied, Borrower shall prepay the Loan to the extent,
if any, that the outstanding principal amount of the Loan exceeds such reduced
Aggregate Available Facility Amount, together with any applicable Funding Costs
as a result of such payment. Such payments shall be applied to the Notes for
which the Available Borrowing Base Covenant or Loan to Value Covenant is not
met.

 Section 2.13 Application of Payments and Prepayments.
Unless specifically provided otherwise, all payments and prepayments of the
Loan, whether voluntary or otherwise, shall be applied first, to unpaid Fees
and any Funding Costs, second, to pay any accrued and unpaid interest then
payable with respect to the Loan, and third, to pay the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan. Payments applied to the outstanding principal amount of
the Loan shall if voluntary be applied to the Notes and Loan Portions
(including Swing Line Advances) specified by Borrower and if not specified by
Borrower, shall be first applied to the Swing Line Advances, then the other
Base Rate Portions of the Loan and then to pay the Eurodollar Portions of the
Loan being repaid in the order of such Eurodollar Portion's maturity and
allocated to each Note on a pro rata basis; notwithstanding the foregoing, no
payments shall be allocated to the Florida Note if such payment would reduce
the outstanding principal amount of the Florida Note to less than
 3,400,000.00, unless at the time of application of such payment the
outstanding principal amount of Notes A-1 (including the Swing Line Note, if
any) B, C and D are each 0.00.

 Section 2.14 Method and Place of Payment. (a) Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments and prepayments under this
Agreement and the Note shall be made to Lender not later than 12:00 noon, New
York City time, on the date when due and shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America in immediately available funds at Lender's Office, and
any funds received by Lender after such time shall, for all purposes hereof,

 45
 -38-

be deemed to have been paid on the next succeeding Business Day. Each payment
(including all prepayments on account of principal and interest on the Loan), to
the extent received, shall constitute payment by Borrower to each Co-Lender and
Swing Line Lender in the amount of such Co-Lender's pro rata share or the Swing
Line Lender's share of such payment.

 (b) Except as expressly provided to the contrary in
Section 2.6 hereof, whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the Note
or other Loan Documents shall be stated to be due on a day which is not an
Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be
payable at the applicable rate during such extension.

 (c) All payments made by Borrower hereunder, under the
Note and the other Loan Documents, shall be made irrespective of, and without
any deduction for, any setoff or counterclaims.

 Section 2.15 Fees. Borrower and the REIT shall pay to
Lender a fee (the "Non-use Fee"), computed at the per annum rate (based on a
year of 360 days, for the actual number of days elapsed) of one-quarter of one
percent (0.25 on the average daily unfunded portion of the Initial Facility
Amount, or, if the Syndication has occurred, the applicable Maximum Facility
Amount from and including the Closing Date through and including the Maturity
Date, payable, in arrears, on the later of the Non-use Fee Due Date or the
first day of each calendar quarter beginning on the Closing Date through the
Maturity Date and on the Maturity Date. For purposes of calculating the
Non-use Fee, all amounts outstanding under any Swing Line Advance (but
excluding any Refunded Swing Line Advance) shall be deemed to be part of the
unfunded portion of the Initial Facility Amount or, if the Syndication has
occurred, the then applicable Maximum Facility Amount. Each payment of the
Non-use Fee, to the extent received by Lender, shall constitute payment by
Borrower and the REIT to each Co-Lender in the amount of such Co-Lender's pro
rata share of the Non-use Fee.

 Section 2.16 Interest Rate Unascertainable, Increased
Costs, Illegality. (a) In the event that Lender has determined or, with
respect to any Co-Lender or Participants, has been notified that (which
determination or notice shall, if made in good faith and absent manifest error,
be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):

 (i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar
 Rate for any Interest Period, that by reason of any changes arising
 after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank Eurodollar
 market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
 applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition
 of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 46
 -39-

 (ii) at any time, that the relevant Eurodollar
 Rate applicable to any of its Eurodollar Portions shall not represent
 the effective pricing to Lender or any Co-Lender for funding or
 maintaining its Eurodollar Portions, or Lender or any Co-Lender shall
 incur increased costs or reduction in the amounts received or
 receivable hereunder in respect of any Eurodollar Portion, in any such
 case because of (x) any change since the date of this Agreement in any
 applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order,
 request or directive or any interpretation thereof and including the
 introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation,
 guideline, order, request or directive (such as, for example, but not
 limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all
 events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D of the Federal
 Reserve Board to the extent included in the computation of the
 Eurodollar Rate), whether or not having the force of law and whether
 or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful, and/or (y) other
 circumstances affecting Lender, any Co-Lender or the interbank
 Eurodollar market or the position of Lender or any Co-Lender in such
 market; or

 (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance
 by it of any Eurodollar Portion has become unlawful in order for
 Lender or any Co-Lender, in good faith, to comply with any law or
 governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order, request or directive
 (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to
 comply therewith would be unlawful), or any change therein, or any
 change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
 governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
 the interpretation or administration thereof, or has become
 impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date of
 this Agreement which materially and adversely affects the interbank
 Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, Lender shall, promptly after making such
determination or receiving notice thereof from any Co-Lender, give notice by
telephone promptly confirmed in writing to Borrower. Thereafter (x) in the
case of clause (i) above, Borrower's right to request advances, conversions or
continuations of Eurodollar Portions shall be suspended, and any Notice of
Borrowing, request for Short Interest Period or Notice of Conversion or
Continuation given by Borrower with respect to any Borrowing of Eurodollar
Portions which has not yet been made shall be deemed cancelled and rescinded by
Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, Borrower shall pay to Lender,
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of Lender's written demand
therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of
interest, or a different method of calculating interest, or otherwise, as
Lender shall determine) as shall be required to compensate Lender or any
Co-Lender for such increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
receivable hereunder (it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
in the event that Lender shall fail to notify Borrower within ten (10) Business
Days after such determination, then Borrower shall not be liable to pay to
Lender any additional amounts relating to the period prior to Lender's
notifying Borrower, and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, Borrower shall
take one of the actions specified in clause (b) below as promptly as
 47
 -40-

possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law. The written
demand provided for in clause (y) shall demonstrate in reasonable detail the
circumstances giving rise to such demand and the calculation of the amounts
demanded; provided that Borrower and the REIT shall not be obligated to pay an
amount in excess of the amount directly attributable to the Loan hereunder.

 (b) In the case of any Eurodollar Portion or requested
Eurodollar Portion affected by the circumstances described in clause (a)(ii)
above, Borrower may, and in the case of any Eurodollar Portion affected by the
circumstances described in clause (a)(iii) above, Borrower shall, either (i) if
any such Eurodollar Portion has not yet been made but is then the subject of a
Notice of Borrowing, a request for Short Interest Period or a Notice of
Conversion or Continuation, be deemed to have cancelled and rescinded such
notice, or (ii) if any such Eurodollar Portion is then outstanding, require
Lender to convert each such Eurodollar Portion into a Base Rate Portion at the
end of the applicable Interest Period or such earlier time as may be required
by law, in each case by giving Lender notice (by telephone promptly confirmed
in writing) thereof within two (2) Business Days after Borrower was notified by
Lender pursuant to clause (a) above.

 (c) In the event that Lender determines at any time
following the giving of notice based on the conditions described in clause
(a)(i) and (a)(iii) above that such conditions no longer exist, Lender shall
promptly give notice thereof to Borrower, whereupon Borrower's right to request
Eurodollar Portions from Lender and Lender's and any Co-Lender's obligation to
make Eurodollar Portions shall be automatically restored.

 (d) The amount of any increased costs or reductions in
amounts referred to in Section 2.16(a)(ii) with respect to Lender and each
Co-Lender shall be based on the assumption that Lender and any Co-Lender funded
all of its Eurodollar Portions in the interbank Eurodollar market, although the
parties hereto agree that Lender or Co-Lender may fund all or any portion of a
Eurodollar Portion, in any manner it independently determines. For purposes of
any demand for payment made by a Lender under Sections 2.16(a)(ii) or 2.18, in
attributing Lender's or any Co-Lender's general costs relating to eurocurrency
operations or its commitments or customers, or in averaging any costs over a
period of time, Lender may use any reasonable attribution and/or averaging
method which it deems appropriate, reasonable and practical. The agreements in
this Section 2.16 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of the Note and all other Obligations.

 Section 2.17 Funding Losses. Borrower and, except with
respect to Funding Costs in connection with the Florida Note, the REIT, shall
compensate Lender, upon Lender's delivery of a written demand therefor to
Borrower and the REIT, (which demand shall set forth in detail the basis for
requesting such amounts and shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all of the parties hereto), for all reasonable
losses, expenses and liabilities, to the

 48
 -41-

extent actually incurred (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or
liability incurred by Lender or any Co-Lender in connection with the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or funds required by it to make or carry its
Eurodollar Portions), excluding loss of anticipated profits ("Funding Costs"),
that Lender or any Co-Lender sustains: (a) if for any reason (other than a
default by Lender or any Co-Lender) a Borrowing of, or conversion from or into,
or a continuation of, Eurodollar Portions does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation
(whether or not rescinded, cancelled or withdrawn or deemed rescinded, cancelled
or withdrawn, pursuant to Sections 2.16(a) or 2.16(b) or otherwise), (b) if any
prepayment (whether voluntary or mandatory), repayment (including, without
limitation, payment after acceleration) or conversion of any of its Eurodollar
Portions occurs on a date which is not the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (c) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Portions is
not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Borrower, or
(d) as a consequence of any default by Borrower or the REIT in repaying its
Eurodollar Portions or any other amounts owing hereunder in respect of its
Eurodollar Portions when required by the terms of this Agreement. Calculation of
all amounts payable to Lender under this Section 2.17 shall be made on the
assumption that Lender and each Co-Lender has funded its relevant Eurodollar
Portion through (i) the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the
Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Portion with
a maturity equivalent to the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
Portion, and (ii) the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore
office of Lender or any Co-Lender to a domestic office of Lender or any
Co-Lender in the United States of America, provided that Lender or any Co-Lender
may fund its Eurodollar Portions in any manner that it in its sole discretion
chooses and the foregoing assumption shall only be made in order to calculate
amounts payable under this Section 2.17. The agreements in this Section 2.17
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Note and
all other Obligations.

 Section 2.18 Increased Capital. With respect to each
Eurodollar Portion, if Lender shall have determined (or received notice from
any Co-Lender of its determination), in good faith, that compliance with any
applicable law, rule, regulation, guideline, request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) which shall be imposed, issued or amended from and
after the date of this Agreement by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the capital or assets of Lender or any Co-Lender as a consequence of its
commitments or obligations hereunder, then from time to time, upon Lender's
delivering a written demand therefor to Borrower, setting forth its reasonable
calculations, Borrower and, except with respect to Increased Capital Costs in
connection with the Florida Note, the REIT, shall pay to Lender on demand such
additional amount or amounts ("Increased Capital Costs") as will compensate
Lender or any Co-Lender for such reduction. Such calculations may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods selected by Lender. The
agreements in this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Note and all other Obligations.
 49
 -42-

 Section 2.19 Taxes. (a) All payments made by Borrower or
the REIT under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income,
stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any governmental authority excluding, in the case of Lender or any
Co-Lender, net income and franchise taxes imposed on Lender or any Co-Lender by
the jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is organized or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or by any jurisdiction in
which Lender's or Co-Lender's Domestic Lending Office or Eurodollar Lending
Office, as the case may be, is located or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings being hereinafter called "Taxes").

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
at any time or from time to time Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld
from the payments required to be made to Lender or any Co-Lender hereunder
solely by reason of a Change in Law after the date hereof (other than as a
result of any transfer or assignment of any of the obligations of Borrower and
the REIT hereunder), all payments required to be made by Borrower and, except
with respect to the Florida Note, the REIT, hereunder (including any additional
amounts that may be payable pursuant to this clause (b)) shall be increased to
the extent required so that the net amount received by Lender or any Co-Lender
after the deduction or withholding of Taxes imposed solely by reason of a
Change in Law after the date hereof will be not less than the full amount that
would otherwise have been receivable had no such deduction or withholding been
imposed by reason of such Change in Law. In the event that this clause (b)
shall be operative, Borrower and the REIT shall promptly provide to Lender
evidence of payment of such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and shall
promptly forward to Lender any official tax receipts or other documentation
with respect to the payment of the Taxes as may be issued by the taxing
authority. If Borrower or the REIT fails to pay any Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to Lender the required receipts
or other required documentary evidence, Borrower and the REIT shall indemnify
Lender and any Co-Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that
may become payable by Lender or Co-Lender as a result of any such failure. The
agreements in this Section 2.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Note and all other Obligations.

 (c) For purposes of this Section 2.19 the term "Change in
Law" shall mean the following events: (i) the enactment of any legislation by
the United States, including the enactment, amendment or modification of a
treaty; (ii) the lapse, by its terms, of any law of the United States or any
treaty to which the United States is a party; or (iii) the promulgation of any
temporary or final regulation under the Code.

 (d) Each Co-Lender that is not incorporated under the
laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that, prior to
the first date on which any payment is

 50
 -43-

due to it hereunder, it will deliver to Borrower and Lender (i) two duly
completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or
successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such
Co-Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Note
payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor
applicable form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax. Each Co-Lender required to deliver to Borrower
and Lender a Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9 pursuant to the preceding
sentence further undertakes to deliver to Borrower and Lender two further copies
of the said letter and Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor
applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such letter or form expires (which, in the case of the
Form 4224, is the last day of each U.S. taxable year of the non-U.S. Co-Lender)
or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in
the most recent letter and form previously delivered by it to Borrower and
Lender, and such other extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be
requested by Borrower or Lender, certifying in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224
that such Co-Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Co-Lender from duly completing and delivering any such letter or
form with respect to it and such Co-Lender advises Borrower and Lender that it
is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of
United States federal income tax, and in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9,
establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.
Notwithstanding clause (a), if a Co-Lender fails to provide a duly completed
Form 1001 or 4224 or other applicable form and, under applicable law, in order
to avoid liability for Taxes, Borrower is required to withhold on payments made
to such a Co-Lender that has failed to provide the applicable form, Borrower
shall be entitled to withhold the appropriate amount of Taxes. In such event,
Borrower shall promptly provide to such Co-Lender or Lender evidence of payment
of such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and shall promptly forward to
such Co-Lender or Lender any official tax receipts or other documentation with
respect to the payment of the Taxes as may be issued by the taxing authority.

 Section 2.20 Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use the
proceeds of the Loan to acquire interests in additional hospitality properties,
and hotels, for costs associated with the construction, renovation and
development of such hospitality properties and hotels, for working capital, for
the initial funding of capital expenditures, replacement reserves or other
escrows required hereunder, to pay various Transaction Costs and general
corporate purposes, including the payment of Distributions (subject to the
conditions of this Agreement).

 Section 2.21 Release and Substitution of Collateral. (a)
Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
shall have the right, from time to time, to

 51
 -44-

obtain a release of a Real Property Asset from the Lien of the related Security
Instrument and Loan Documents (a "Release Property") upon delivery to Lender of
a written request for such release at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
requested release date. In the event Borrower seeks to release a Real Property
Asset from the Lien of the related Security Instrument, Lender shall release
such Real Property Asset from the Lien of the related Security Instrument and
the Loan Documents, but only upon receipt by Lender of the following:

 (i) if after giving effect to the Release, the aggregate
 Allocated Loan Amounts for the remaining Real Property Assets in the
 Pool to which the Release Property belonged is less than the then
 outstanding principal balance of the related Note, a wire transfer of
 immediately available federal funds in an amount equal to the
 difference between (A) the outstanding principal balance of such Note
 and (B) the aggregate Allocated Loan Amounts for such remaining Real
 Property Assets; notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Non-Competition
 Agreement has expired or is otherwise terminated, a wire transfer of
 immediately available federal funds in an amount equal to the lesser
 of (x) the outstanding principal balance of the related Note and (y)
 the greater of the Allocated Loan Amount or the Available Borrowing
 Base calculated for the Release Property, in either case together with
 all accrued interest on the amount being prepaid, and any costs and
 expenses incurred by Lender to effect the Transaction contemplated by
 this Section; such payment shall be applied to the Note related to the
 Release Property;

 (ii) A certificate of the general partner of Borrower or
 senior executive officer of Borrower certifying that (i) the
 Non-Competition Agreement has either expired or terminated or is in
 full force of effect, and (ii) the Real Property Assets remaining
 encumbered by the Liens of the Security Instruments after giving
 effect to the payment of the Allocated Loan Amount or the Available
 Borrowing Base calculated for such Real Property Asset, continue to
 satisfy the Available Borrowing Base Covenant and the Loan to Value
 Ratio Covenant.

 Simultaneously with compliance with the conditions set forth
in this Section 2.21(a), (w) Lender and any Co-Lender shall release the Lien
with respect to all Collateral relating to the applicable Release Property, (x)
Lender shall revise Schedules 1, 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 3, 8, 10, 11, 11A, 12, 14,
16 and 17 (the "Related Schedules") and (y) the Available Facility Amount shall
be reduced to the extent of the applicable amounts prepaid hereunder. If the
Non-Competition Agreement has expired or otherwise terminated, the Maximum
Facility Amount, the Aggregate Available Facility Amount and the Available
Facility Amount for such Note shall be irrevocably reduced by the amount of
such prepayment.

 (b) Provided that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and the Non-Competition Agreement has not expired
or otherwise terminated, prior to the Termination Date, Borrower shall have the
right, subject to Lender's consent, which

 52
 -45-

consent may be withheld in Lender's sole discretion, to obtain a release of a
Real Property Asset from the Lien of the related Security Instrument and Loan
Documents (a "Release Property"), if Borrower simultaneously substitutes
another fully licensed, stabilized and operating hospitality property owned in
fee simple by Borrower and leased by the Partnership pursuant to an Operating
Lease (a "Substitute Property"), and subjects such Substitute Property and
Operating Lease to the Lien of a new mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure
debt or similar security instruments, in the same form and substance as the
Security Instruments ("Substitute Mortgage") and to the Lien of the Loan
Documents, as a first lien thereon. Lender's consent to such release and
substitution may be conditioned on, among other things, receipt by Lender of
the following:

 (i) Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the
 Substitute Property is fully operational, stabilized and is of similar
 or higher quality or value to the Release Property.

 (ii) An Appraisal (or, at the election of Lender, an
 internal valuation by Lender) of the Substitute Property prepared
 within six (6) months prior to delivery and reasonably satisfactory to
 Lender.

 (iii) Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender (which may
 include an opinion of counsel with respect to the procedural and
 substantive requirements for the enforcement of mortgages or deeds of
 trust in the state where the Substitute Property is located and the
 impact of an out of state enforcement action on the enforcement of the
 Substitute Mortgage and related Loan Documents within the state where
 the Substitute Property is located) that subjecting the Substitute
 Property to the Lien of the Substitute Mortgage and the Loan Documents
 does not and will not affect or impair the ability of Lender to
 enforce its remedies under all of the Security Instruments and Loan
 Documents with respect to the Pool to which the Substitute Property
 has been added or to realize the benefits of the
 cross-collateralization.

 (iv) An opinion of Borrower's and the Partnership's (and
 HIC's, if applicable) counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lender
 stating (u) that the Substitute Mortgage and the Loan Documents by
 which the Substitute Property will be encumbered have been duly
 authorized, executed and delivered by Borrower and, if the Partnership
 has entered into an Operating Lease with respect to the Substitute
 Property, the Partnership, are valid and enforceable in accordance
 with their terms, subject to bankruptcy and equitable principles, (v)
 that Borrower (and the REIT, if necessary) and, if the Partnership
 entered into an Operating Lease with respect to the Substitute
 Property, the Partnership, are qualified to do business and in good
 standing under the laws of the jurisdiction where the Substitute
 Property is located, or that Borrower or the REIT or the Partnership,
 as applicable, are not required by Applicable Law to qualify to do
 business in such jurisdiction, (w) based on a certificate of Borrower
 (or the Partnership, or HIC as the
 53
 -46-

 case may be) the encumbrance of the Substitute Property with the Liens
 of the Substitute Mortgage and the Loan Documents shall not cause a
 breach of, or a default under any agreement, document or instrument to
 which Borrower is a party or to which it or its properties are bound or
 affected and (x) the anticipated release and substitution will not
 affect the status of the REIT as a qualified real estate investment
 trust under Section 856 of the Code.

 (v) A certification by Borrower and the REIT (w) that the
 Non-Competition Agreement has not expired or otherwise terminated and
 is in full force and effect, (x) that the certificates, opinions and
 other instruments which have been or are therewith delivered to or
 deposited with Lender in connection with such release and substitution
 conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Security
 Instruments, (y) that all conditions precedent herein have been
 complied with and (z) that all conditions precedent to the delivery of
 the Substitute Mortgage and Loan Documents contained in this Agreement
 have been fulfilled.

 (vi) Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that
 Borrower, the REIT and the other Loan Parties are, and will remain
 after the consummation of the transaction, Solvent.

 (vii) Original executed counterparts of the Substitute
 Mortgage and the Loan Documents encumbering the Substitute Property
 and the related Operating Lease and related Collateral, including
 without limitation, a Partnership Guaranty Security Agreement and a
 Partnership Mortgage, or a HIC Guaranty Security Agreement and a HIC
 Mortgage, financing statements or other documents necessary to grant
 or perfect Lender's first priority security interest in the fixtures
 and personalty located thereon and the Gross Revenues and Accounts
 Receivable derived therefrom; the principal amount of such Substitute
 Mortgage shall equal the face amount of the Note that such Substitute
 Mortgage secures.

 (viii) A title insurance policy issued by a title insurance
 company reasonably satisfactory to Lender insuring the lien of the
 Substitute Mortgage on the Substitute Property, in form and substance
 satisfactory to Lender insuring that the Substitute Mortgage is a
 valid and enforceable first lien on the good and marketable fee simple
 title or leasehold estate of Borrower to the Substitute Property, as
 the case may be, in an amount equal to the amount of the Loan
 allocated to the Substitute Property, subject only to such exceptions
 that Lender has approved together with such affirmative insurance and
 other endorsements reasonably required by Lender, including a
 revolving credit endorsement, together with a "tie-in" and first loss
 endorsement satisfactory to Lender, or, if such endorsement is not
 available in the state in which the Substitute Property is located, in
 an amount equal to the greater of one hundred ten percent (110 of
 the

 54
 -47-

 amount of the Loan allocated by Lender to the Substitute Property or
 the amount on which mortgage or intangibles tax was paid with respect
 to the Security Instrument for the Substitute Property, together with a
 "last dollar endorsement". Such title insurance policy shall not
 contain any exception for any state of facts that an accurate survey
 might show or that a survey made after the date of the survey referred
 to in Section 2.21(b)(xii) might show.

 (ix) Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender to the
 effect that the Substitute Property and the use thereof are in
 substantial compliance with the applicable zoning, subdivision, and
 all other applicable federal, state or local laws and ordinances
 affecting the Substitute Property, and that all material building and
 operating licenses and permits necessary for the use and occupancy of
 the Substitute Property as an hospitality property or hotel including,
 but not limited to, current certificates of occupancy, have been
 obtained and are in full force and effect.

 (x) An Environmental Report dated within six (6) months
 prior to delivery which states that the Substitute Property does not
 contain any Hazardous Substances (as defined in the Security
 Instrument) or risk of contamination from off-site Hazardous
 Substance, and which otherwise shall be reasonably satisfactory to
 Lender.

 (xi) Payment of all Transaction Costs and other expenses
 incurred by Lender and all Co-Lenders including reasonable counsel
 fees and disbursements in connection with the release of any Release
 Property and the Substitute Property and its inclusion as Collateral.
 In the event that the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is
 located imposes a mortgage recording or intangibles tax, or similar
 tax, and does not permit the allocation of indebtedness for the
 purpose of determining the amount of such tax payable, if permitted by

increase the Available Facility Amount for a Note by offering to add additional
properties (in addition to the Initial Assets) as security for the Loan and
encumbering them with the Lien of the Security Instrument securing such Note and

Properties are satisfactory to Lender in Lender's sole discretion, subject to
continued satisfaction of the Loan to Value Ratio Covenant and the Available
Borrowing Base Covenant (after giving effect to such New Property) with respect
to the related Note, and all the conditions in this Section 2.22 are complied
with, the Available Facility Amount for such Note shall be increased when New
Properties have been encumbered by the Lien of the Security Instrument securing
such Note and the related Loan Documents by an amount equal to the lesser of 55 
of Lender's internal valuation of the New Properties or 50 of the appraised
value of the New Properties based on Appraisals reasonably satisfactory to
Lender; or, if the Syndication has occurred, 50 of the appraised value of the
New Properties based on Appraisals reasonably satisfactory to Lender and further

Borrower that such New Property is satisfactory.

 In no event shall the Aggregate Available Facility Amount,
after taking into account the increase in the Available Facility Amount for
such Notes be increased to more than the Maximum Facility Amount.

 In addition to the restrictions set forth above, at any time
that the Available Facility Amount for such Note is to be increased at the
request of Borrower, the following conditions precedent must be satisfied:

 (a) No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
 continuing or would result from the consummation of the proposed
 addition of the New Property;
 59
 -52-

 applicable Loan Parties have executed and delivered to Lender (at
 Borrower's sole cost and expense) all of the documents required under

 of the conditions contained in Section 2.21(b) with respect to a
 Substitute Property;

 Borrower and the REIT agree that they shall execute a new or amended
 Note covering the amount of such increase and provide to Lender such
 amendments, supplements, modifications or increases to the applicable

 necessary in connection therewith, which may include some or all of
 the documents or items required under Section 2.21(b) in connection
 with a Substitute Property and under Section 3.1 in connection with
 the initial Advance, and it is understood that any new Note shall be
 cross-defaulted with all other Notes, Security Instruments and Loan
 Documents and cross collateralized with the Real Property Assets
 securing such Note, such cross collateralization to be accomplished
 through the recordation of a Security Instrument as a first lien on
 any New Property and a modification and increase of the Security
 Instruments on the existing Real Property Assets securing such Note.

 (e) No increase in the Available Facility Amount for any
 Note may take place after the Termination Date.

 Section 2.23 Breach of Available Borrowing Base Covenant
or Loan to Value Ratio Covenant. In the event that the Available Facility
Amount for a Note shall have been reduced pursuant to Section 5.15 or 5.20, and
Borrower elects to add additional Collateral pursuant to the terms of this
Section in order to cause the Available Borrowing Base Covenant and/or the Loan
to Value Ratio Covenant to be satisfied, in addition to complying with all of
the requirements of Section 2.22, Borrower shall:

 (a) deliver to Lender within five (5) Business Days 
after the breach of the Available Borrowing Base Covenant or the Loan to Value 
Ratio Covenant, a "Request For Additional Collateral" substantially in the 
form of Exhibit "F", hereto, executed by the general partner of Borrower or a 
senior executive officer of Borrower, which request shall contain a 
certification that (i) the appraised value of the New Property would be 
adequate to satisfy the Loan to Value Ratio Covenant if combined with the then 
existing Real Property Assets, (ii) that

 60
 -53-

in Borrower's reasonable opinion the Net Operating Income from the New Property
would be sufficient to satisfy the Available Borrowing Base Covenant if combined
with the then existing Real Property Assets, (iii) to the best of Borrower's
knowledge after due inquiry, there are no Hazardous Materials (as defined in the
Security Instruments) on or in the New Property and (iv) the New Property is
subject to an Operating Lease with the Partnership or such other entity
satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion and which Operating Lease is
subordinate to the Lien of the Security Instrument and is otherwise satisfactory
to Lender in its sole discretion.

 (b) if Lender notifies Borrower that such request has been
accepted, within 45 days of receipt of such notice, Borrower shall comply with
all of the conditions in this Section 2.23 and have consummated the addition of
the New Property to the Collateral for the Loan. During such 45 day period
Borrower shall not be entitled to any Advance under the related Note.

 Section 2.24 Adjustment of Allocated Loan Amounts upon
Addition of New Property. Upon the addition of any New Property pursuant to
Section 2.22 or 2.23, Lender shall revise Schedules 1, 2, 2A,2B, 2C and 2D and
the Related Schedules to reflect the addition of such New Property or
Properties and to adjust the Allocated Loan Amounts as Lender deems necessary
among the Real Property Assets.

 Section 2.25 Maximum Number of Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate number of
(a) releases and simultaneous substitutions of Substitute Properties pursuant to
Section 2.21(b) and (b) the simultaneous addition of one or more New Properties
in a single transaction pursuant to Section 2.22, in any combination during the
term of the Facility shall not exceed seven (7). With respect to clause (b)
above, it is understood and agreed that additions of more than one New Property
in any single simultaneous transaction shall constitute one transaction for
purposes of this Section 2.25.

 Section 2.26 Increasing Allocable Loan Amounts. Provided
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall
have the one time right, upon written notice to Lender, commencing on October
1, 1996 and ending on April 1, 1997, to request Lender to revise the Allocated
Loan Amounts on Schedule 1 with respect to the Real Property Assets identified
on Schedule 1 as the Sheraton Colony Square Atlanta, the Dallas Park Central
and the Riverside Inn, Portland. Such notice shall be accompanied by an
Appraisal, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, for the related Real Property
Asset. All such Appraisals shall be prepared on an "as is" basis and be based
on the then existing condition of the Real Property Asset, and shall not assume
the completion or performance of any renovations or maintenance work in the
calculation of value. Borrower shall also provide such additional information
regarding the related Real Property Asset as Lender shall reasonably request in
connection with Lender's review of the related Allocated Loan Amounts. Lender
shall notify Borrower within 45 Business Days of its receipt of the Appraisal
and all required information that the Allocated Loan Amounts for the Related
Real Property Assets will not be revised or of the revised Allocated

 61
 -54-

Loan Amounts, and shall revise Schedule 1 accordingly. Any revision of such
Allocated Loan Amounts shall be in Lender's reasonable discretion and shall be
based, in part, on 50 of the value of the related Real Property Asset as
indicated in the Appraisal delivered by Borrower in connection with the notice.
After any such revision the Available Borrowing Base Covenant and Loan to Value
Ratio Covenant shall continue to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the Allocated Loan Amounts for Sheraton Colony Square
Atlanta, Dallas Park Central and Riverside Inn Portland exceed 18,000,000.00,
 6,200,000.00 and 8,800,000.00, respectively. No revision of the Allocated
Loan Amounts shall increase the Maximum Facility Amount, the Aggregate
Available Facility Amount or the Available Facility Amount with respect to any
Note.

with respect to Borrower, each of the other Loan Parties, and (b) searches of
title to each of the Real Property Assets (each, a "Title Search"). Such Title
Searches and lien searches required under this Agreement shall be conducted by

 Section 5.15 Available Borrowing Base Covenant. Borrower
shall at all times maintain an Available Borrowing Base for each Note for the
aggregate of all Real Property Assets applicable to each such Note (measured on
a monthly basis based on a trailing twelve month analysis) greater than or
equal to the Available Facility Amount for each such Note; provided, however,
that to the extent the available borrowing base covenant (the "Available
Borrowing Base Covenant") set forth in the preceding clause is not met at the
end of any calendar month for a particular Note, then:

 (a) the Available Facility Amount for such Note and the
 Aggregate Available Facility Amount shall be immediately and
 automatically, without any act or notice by Lender, reduced to the
 extent necessary to cause the Available Borrowing Base Covenant to be
 satisfied; and

 (b) to the extent that the then outstanding principal
 balance of the Loan (including outstanding Swing Line Advances)
 exceeds the Available Facility Amount for such Note as reduced as a
 result of a reduction of the Available Facility Amount for such Note
 pursuant to clause (a) above, Borrower shall repay, without penalty or
 premium (other than as provided in Section 2.17), that portion of the
 outstanding principal balance of the Note which is in excess of the
 Available Facility Amount for such Note within five (5) Business Days
 of the earliest of (i) Borrower's receipt of written notice that the
 Available Borrowing Base Covenant is no longer satisfied, (ii)
 Borrower's delivery of the Section 5.1(b)(ii) certificate indicating
 that the Available Borrowing Base Covenant is no longer satisfied (or,
 if such certificate is not delivered on or prior to the date provided
 for in Section 5.1(b)(ii), the date on which such certificate was
 required to be delivered thereunder) and (iii) Borrower's
 determination that the Available Borrowing Base Covenant is no longer
 satisfied.
 88
 -81-

 (c) Neither the Aggregate Available Facility Amount nor
 the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note shall be
 reduced pursuant to Section 5.15(a) above if (i) Borrower shall
 provide Lender, within five Business Days of the earliest date in
 clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 5.15(b) (the "Relevant BBC
 Date"), with (A) a certificate of the general partner or a senior
 executive officer of Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit F
 stating that it intends to provide an additional real property or
 properties to Lender pursuant to Section 2.23 within 45 days of the
 Relevant BBC Date and (B) evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Lender,
 that the Net Operating Income for such additional real property or
 properties for the twelve (12) month period most recently ended
 together with the Net Operating Income of the other Real Property
 Assets securing such Note, would have enabled Borrower to meet the
 Available Borrowing Base Covenant on the Relevant BBC Date with
 respect to such Note and (C) such additional real property or
 properties shall be satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion and
 (ii) Borrower shall have provided Lender within 45 days of the
 Relevant BBC Date with such additional collateral pursuant to Section
 2.23 hereof and such additional collateral, in the aggregate with the
 other Real Property Assets securing the Loan, is capable of meeting
 the Available Borrowing Base Covenant with respect to such Note at
 such time. In the event that (I) Borrower shall fail to deliver to
 Lender the items set forth in clause 5.15(c)(i) above within five (5)
 Business Days of the Relevant BBC Date, (II) the additional property
 or properties offered by Borrower are not satisfactory to Lender or
 (III) Borrower shall fail to subject such additional property or
 properties to the Liens of the Loan Documents pursuant to Section 2.23
 or comply with any other provision of Section 2.23 within the time
 period provided above, then the Aggregate Available Facility Amount
 and the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note shall
 immediately be reduced without any further action on the part of
 Borrower or Lender pursuant to Section 5.15(b) and Borrower shall
 prepay the Loan to the extent, if any, required pursuant to Section
 5.15(b).

 (d) In the event that the Aggregate Available Facility
 Amount and the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note is
 reduced pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.15, Borrower shall
 have the ability to partially or fully reinstate the Aggregate
 Available Facility Amount and the Available Facility Amount for such
 Note to its previous level by delivering to Lender, with respect to
 periods ending at the end of any calendar month (but no sooner than
 one month following a Relevant BBC Date), a certificate of a general
 partner or a senior executive officer of Borrower, in the form of the
 quarterly certificate required pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii),
 demonstrating that as of the end of such month, Borrower is in
 compliance with the Available Borrowing Base Covenant to the extent of
 the requested reinstatement of the Aggregate Available Facility Amount
 and the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note.

 Section 5.16 Minimum Net Worth. The minimum net worth of
Borrower shall not, at any time, be less than 215,000,000.00 plus 75 of the
net proceeds (after payment of underwriter and placement fees and other
expenses directly related to such equity offering) received from subsequent
equity offerings by the REIT, calculated on a GAAP basis; however, the
conversion or exchange of existing operating partnership units in Borrower for
shares in the REIT for which the REIT does not receive cash compensation shall
not be deemed an equity offering for purposes of this Section 5.16.

 Section 5.17 Total Indebtedness. (a) The maximum
combined Total Debt of Borrower and the REIT shall not exceed at any time 55 
of the combined Net Book Value of Borrower and the REIT, calculated without
duplication.

 (b) The maximum combined Total Debt of Borrower and the
Partnership shall not exceed at any time 55 of the combined Net Book Value of
Borrower and the Partnership, calculated without duplication, provided that
Total Debt and Net Book Value shall exclude amounts related to the Intercompany
Debt between (i) the Corporation and the Partnership and their consolidated
Subsidiaries and (ii) the REIT and Borrower and their consolidated
Subsidiaries.

 Section 5.18 Coverage Ratios. (a) The ratio of (x) actual
consolidated EBITDA of Borrower and the REIT (without duplication) for any
period of twelve consecutive months (or if twelve consecutive months have not
passed since July 6, 1995, the period of time from July 6, 1995) (in either
case the "Base Period"), to (y) the sum of Debt Service plus Fixed Charges of
the Borrower and the REIT for such Base Period shall not at any time be less
than (i) 2.15 to 1 at any time during the nine month period commencing on July
6, 1995 and (ii) 2.25 to 1 for any period thereafter.

 (b) The ratio of (x) actual EBITDA (adjusted to include
replacement reserves of 4 of gross hotel revenues) of Borrower and the
Partnership for the applicable Base Period, to (y) the sum of Debt Service plus
Fixed Charges of Borrower and the Partnership for the same Base Period shall
not at any time be less than (i) 2.40 to 1 at any time during the nine month
period commencing on July 6, 1995 and (ii) 2.50 to 1 thereafter. For purposes
of this Section 5.18(b), EBITDA and Debt Service shall exclude amounts related
to the Operating Leases with the Partnership as tenant and intercompany debt
between (A) the Corporation and the Partnership and their consolidated
Subsidiaries and (B) the REIT and the Borrower and their consolidated
Subsidiaries.

 Section 5.19 Replacement Reserve and Deferred Maintenance
Reserve. (a) After the Closing Date Borrower shall spend at least the amounts
set forth on Schedule 16 for each Real Property Asset on or before December 31,
1996 (the "Initial Minimum Spending Requirement"). For the calendar year
commencing on January 1, 1997 and for each calendar year thereafter,

 90
 -83-

Borrower shall spend, or cause to have spent, a minimum spending amount (the
"Minimum Spending Requirement") for each Real Property Asset equal to 4 of the
annual Gross Revenues from each Real Property Asset per annum on repair,
replacement and maintenance of the related Real Property Asset during the
applicable calendar year. The Minimum Spending Requirement for each calendar
year shall be determined annually by Lender, and shall be based on Gross
Revenues for the immediately preceding calendar year, and Lender shall revise
Schedule 16 accordingly. In the event that Borrower has spent more than the
Minimum Spending Requirement for a Real Property Asset in any calendar year,
Borrower may apply such excess, up to an amount equal to 2 of the annual Gross
Revenues from the Real Property Asset, to reduce the amount of the Minimum
Spending Requirement that must be spent in the immediately succeeding calendar
year. Borrower shall deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender no more
frequently than monthly, but at least quarterly, of the portion of the Initial
Minimum Spending Requirement and the Minimum Spending Requirement, as the case
may be, for each Real Property Asset that has been spent; such evidence shall
include copies of paid invoices or other receipts for work done or materials
provided and such other information as reasonably requested by Lender. On July
1, 1996, and on the first day of July of each year thereafter, Lender shall
determine the portion of the Initial Minimum Spending Requirement or the Minimum
Spending Requirement for that calendar year that has not been spent and
determine the amount to be reserved for such repair, replacement and maintenance
as provided below (such amount, the "Initial Replacement Reserve" or the
"Minimum Replacement Reserve", as the case may be). Such amount to be reserved
shall equal the difference between (i) the portion of the Minimum Spending
Requirement for the applicable year that has not been spent and (ii) the
difference between (A) (1) the lesser of 55 of the value of the related Real
Property Asset according to Lender's internal valuation or 50 of the value
according to an Appraisal of the related Real Property Asset, or (2) if the
Syndication has occurred, 50 of the value according to the Appraisal of such
Real Property Asset and (B) the Allocated Loan Amount for such Real Property
Asset. Borrower shall maintain, from the date of notice of the Initial
Replacement Reserve or the Minimum Replacement Reserve, as the case may be,
until such time as the Initial Minimum Spending Requirements or the Minimum
Spending Requirement, as the case may be, for such calendar year have been spent
in full, an amount equal to the Initial Replacement Reserve and the Minimum
Replacement Reserve for such calendar year, as the case may be, in the form of
(x) readily available and unrestricted cash held in a segregated account or (y)
borrowing capacity under this Agreement, as measured by the unfunded portion of
the Aggregate Available Facility Amount; provided however, that during any given
calendar year the amounts required to be maintained as the Initial Replacement
Reserve or the Minimum Replacement Reserve shall be reduced from time to time to
the extent that such sums were actually spent on repair, replacement and
maintenance of the Real Property Assets as determined by Lender in its
reasonable discretion.

 (b) Borrower shall spend the amounts shown on Schedule 17
(as the same may be amended from time to time) for each Real Property Asset
listed on such Schedule prior to

 91
 -84-

January 1, 1997 to perform the specified maintenance set forth on such
Schedule (the "Deferred Maintenance Spending Requirement"). Borrower shall
deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender on or prior to December 31,
1996 that such work has been completed; such evidence shall include copies of
paid invoices or other receipts for work done or materials provided, and may
include an updated Engineering Report. Borrower shall maintain an amount (the
"Deferred Maintenance Reserve") equal to the difference between (i) the
Deferred Maintenance Spending Requirement and (ii) the difference between (A)
(1) the lesser of 55 of the value of the related Real Property Asset according
to Lender's internal valuation or 50 of the value according to an Appraisal of
the related Real Property Asset, or (2) if the Syndication has occurred, 50 of
the value according to the Appraisal of such Real Property Asset and (B) the
Allocated Loan Amount for such Real Property Asset in the form of (x) readily
available and unrestricted cash held in a segregated account or (y) borrowing
capacity under this Agreement, as measured by the unfunded portion of the
Aggregate Available Facility Amount. The Deferred Maintenance Reserve shall be
reduced, from time to time, to the extent that such sums were actually spent to
perform the required work as determined by Lender in its reasonable discretion.

 (c) With respect to the Real Property Asset identified as
Bay Valley, Michigan on Schedule 1, Borrower shall complete the soil excavation
and replacement as described in and pursuant to the Corrective Action Plan for
Bay Valley Resort Facility, 2470 Old Bridge Road, Bay City, Michigan prepared
for Hotel Investors Trust, Los Angeles, California, by Earth Tech, dated
January 1995, Project 22424.03 as modified by the Options Update for Bay Valley
Resort, Bay City, Michigan prepared by Earth Tech and dated October 18, 1995
(the "Corrective Action Plan") on or prior to October 1, 1996, and shall comply
with the ground water monitoring program as described in and pursuant to the
Corrective Action Plan throughout the term of the Loan. Borrower shall deliver
a quarterly report to Lender with respect to the status of the soil excavation
and replacement and the ground water monitoring; upon the completion of the
soil excavation and replacement, Borrower shall deliver a report with respect
to the gound water monitoring every second quarter, in each case, concurrently
with the report delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii). Until such time as
Lender receives a report from Earth Tech or another environmental consultant
reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the soil excavation and replacement has
been completed and the ground water monitoring has commenced, each in
accordance with Applicable Law and the Corrective Action Plan, Borrower shall
maintain the amount set forth on Schedule 17 with respect to such Real Property
Asset for soil excavation and remediation as part of the Deferred Maintenance
Reserve pursuant to Section 5.19(b); provided, however, that such amount shall
be reduced from time to time to the extent that such sums were actually spent
on the soil excavation and replacement, or on the ground water monitoring, as
determined by Lender in its reasonable discretion.

 Section 5.20 Loan to Value Ratio. Borrower shall at all
times maintain the ratio of Available Facility Amount for each Note to the most
recent aggregate appraised value according to the Appraisals, updates to
existing Appraisals or Lender's internal valuation most recently

 92
 -85-

delivered or prepared, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 5.25 or, if no
such updated appraisal has been prepared and delivered to Borrower with respect
to a Real Property Asset, according to the Appraisal or internal valuation
completed for such Real Property Asset on or before the Closing Date, unless
Borrower or Lender reasonably believes that the value is less, of not more than
50 of the value according to an Appraisal or 55 of the value according to
Lender's internal valuation, provided, however, that all determinations of Loan
to Value Ratios from and after the Syndication shall be based on 50 of
appraised value determined by Appraisals reasonably satisfactory to the Lender
of all Real Property Assets securing each such Note, measured in the aggregate
(the "Loan to Value Ratio"); provided, however, that to the extent the loan to
value ratio covenant (the "Loan to Value Ratio Covenant") set forth in the
preceding clause is not satisfied for a particular Note, then:

 (a) the Available Facility Amount for such Note and the
 Aggregate Available Facility Amount shall be immediately and
 automatically, without any act or notice by Lender, reduced to the
 extent necessary to cause the Loan to Value Ratio Covenant to be
 satisfied; and

 (b) to the extent that the then outstanding principal
 balance of the Loan (including outstanding Swing Line Advances)
 exceeds the Available Facility Amount for such Note as reduced as a
 result of a reduction of the Available Facility Amount for such Note
 pursuant to clause (a) above, Borrower shall repay, without penalty or
 premium (other than as provided in Section 2.17), that portion of the
 outstanding principal balance of the Note which is in excess of the
 Available Facility Amount for such Note within five (5) Business Days
 after the earlier to occur of (i) Borrower's receipt of the Section
 5.25 Appraisal(s) or Lender's internal valuations, provided that, if
 the Syndication has occurred, only Appraisals delivered in connection
 with the Syndication or Section 5.25 shall be used, (ii) Borrower's
 receipt of Lender's written notice that the Loan to Value Ratio
 Covenant is no longer satisfied and (iii) Borrower's delivery of the
 Section 5.1(b)(ii) certification indicating that the Loan to Value
 Ratio Covenant is no longer satisfied;

provided, however, that Borrower has the option of returning the Aggregate
Available Facility Amount and the Available Facility Amount for such Note to its
level prior to the impact of clause (a) above, by (i) providing Lender with
evidence satisfactory to Lender respecting the value of the Real Property Assets
securing such Note (such as a new Appraisal) which would cause Lender, in its
sole discretion, or, if such evidence is a new Appraisal, in its reasonable
discretion, to modify its determination respecting the Loan to Value Ratio
Covenant, or (ii) providing Lender, within 45 days of the earliest date in
clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of Section 5.20(b), with additional collateral
satisfactory to Lender pursuant to Section 2.23 hereof which, in the aggregate
with the other Real Property Assets securing the Loan is capable of meeting the
Loan to Value Ratio Covenant and otherwise in compliance with Section 5.20(c).
 93
 -86-

 (c) Neither the Aggregate Available Facility Amount nor
 the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note shall be
 reduced pursuant to Section 5.20(a) above if (i) Borrower shall
 provide Lender within five Business Days of the earliest date in
 clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 5.20(b) (the "Relevant LTV
 Date"), with (A) a certificate of the general partner or a senior
 executive officer of Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit F
 stating that it intends to provide an additional real property or
 properties to Lender pursuant to Section 2.23 within 45 days of the
 Relevant LTV Date and (B) evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Lender
 that the appraised value of such additional real property or
 properties as determined by Appraisals satisfactory to Lender together
 with the values of the other Real Property Assets securing the Loan
 (as determined in accordance with this Section 5.20), would have
 enabled Borrower to meet the Loan to Value Ratio Covenant on the
 Relevant LTV Date and (C) such additional real property or properties
 shall be satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion and (ii)
 Borrower shall have provided to Lender within 45 days of the Relevant
 LTV Date with such additional collateral pursuant to Section 2.23
 hereof and such additional collateral in the aggregate with the other
 Real Property Assets securing the Loan is capable of meeting the Loan
 to Value Ratio Covenant at such time. In the event that (I) Borrower
 shall fail to deliver to Lender the items set forth in clause
 5.20(c)(i) above within five (5) Business Days of the Relevant LTV
 Date, (II) the additional property or properties offered by Borrower
 are not satisfactory to Lender or (III) Borrower shall fail to subject
 such additional property or properties to the Liens of the Loan
 Documents pursuant to Section 2.23 or comply with any other provision
 of Section 2.23 within the time period provided above, then the
 Aggregate Available Facility Amount and the Available Facility Amount
 with respect to such Note shall immediately be reduced without any
 further action on the part of Borrower or Lender pursuant to Section
 5.20(b) and Borrower shall prepay the Loan to the extent, if any,
 required pursuant to Section 5.20(b).

 (d) In the event that the Aggregate Available Facility
 Amount and the Available Facility Amount with respect to such Note is
 reduced pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.20, Borrower has the
 ability to partially or fully reinstate the Aggregate Available
 Facility Amount and the Available Facility Amount with respect to such
 Note to its level prior to such reduction by providing Lender with
 evidence satisfactory to Lender respecting the value of the Real
 Property Assets (such as a new Appraisal) which would cause Lender, in
 its sole discretion, or, if such evidence is a new Appraisal, in its
 reasonable discretion, to modify its determination respecting the Loan
 to Value Ratio Covenant.

 Section 5.21 Manager. Borrower shall terminate
 the management agreements listed on Schedule 12 (other than the
 management agreement with respect to the Real Property Asset
 identified on such Schedule as Harvey Wichita) prior to December 31,
 1995 and the Partnership

 94
 -87-

shall manage such Real Property Asset thereafter pursuant to the Operating
Lease; however, the Partnership may enter into a new management agreement for
any Real Property Asset with Lender's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and provided that such management agreement shall be on
market terms and at market rates with a bona fide independent third party
manager that is in the business of managing hotels and otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to Lender.

 Section 5.22 Further Assurances. Borrower and the REIT
will, at Borrower's and the REIT's sole cost and expense, at any time and from

instruments which Lender in its reasonable discretion deems necessary or
appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents including (i) to consummate the transfer or sale of the Loan or any

Party's obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents shall not be
increased or their rights diminished or abridged without their consent, (ii) to
preserve, protect and perfect the security intended to be created and preserved

for all of the Real Property Assets (the cost of which, with respect to the
Initial Assets only, shall be subject to the Expense Cap). Borrower shall only
be obligated to pay for Appraisals or updated Appraisals or Lender's internal
valuations or updates thereof in connection with (i) an increase in the
Available Facility Amount (other than as a result of the Syndication, provided
that such increase is based on the Initial Assets), (ii) the addition of a

Appraisals requested by Lender, any Co- Lender or any Participant, shall
deliver copies of such Appraisals to Lender promptly after receipt but in no
event later than five days after written notice from Lender (provided Borrower
has theretofore received such Appraisal). In Lender's sole discretion, Lender
may elect to update and review its own internal valuation, or prepare its own
internal valuation in lieu of one or more of the Appraisals which may be
required under this Section 5.25. Borrower shall pay, to the extent required
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.25, within five (5) Business Days
of Lender's request therefor, Lender's out-of-pocket costs and expenses for
each such internal valuation or review or update thereof and each Appraisal or

for its out-of-pocket costs and expenses in accordance with the preceding
sentence in connection with the internal valuations done pursuant to Section
3.1(n) no later than the Closing Date (subject to the Expense Cap).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if an internal valuation has been
prepared and the Loan to Value Ratio is in dispute, Borrower shall deliver to
Lender Appraisals, at Borrower's sole cost and expense, of each Real Property
Asset.

 Section 5.26 Maintenance of Control. An officer,
director, employee or general partner of the Group shall at all times remain a

Lender that changes in composition of REIT's Trustees or Corporation's
Directors shall not constitute a change in control).

 Section 5.27 Maintenance of Intercompany Debt. Except as
set forth on Schedule 9, no Intercompany Debt shall be secured by any of the
Collateral.

 Section 5.28 Transfer of Licenses. With respect to all of
the Real Property Assets (other than the Vagabond Inns but only for so long as
the Vagabond Inns are not leased or operated by a Loan Party or an Affiliate of
any Loan Party), to the extent that any Licenses are not in the name of the
applicable Loan Party, Borrower and the REIT shall promptly commence or cause
the applicable Loan Party to commence, and diligently proceed to have all such
Licenses issued in the name of the applicable Loan Party or deliver evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the failure to have such License in the
name of the applicable Loan Party does not materially adversely affect the
operation and use of the related Real Property Asset. Borrower shall notify
Lender within 10 Business Days of the end of each calendar quarter of the
status of the various Licenses that have not been transferred to the applicable
Loan Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall have all liquor
licenses (other than with respect to the liquor licenses held by Imperial
Hotels Corporation with respect to the Vagabond Inns and the liquor license
held by the Currency Club as tenant under a restaurant lease on the

includes an explicit and unconditional release from the party bringing such
lawsuit, claim or other proceeding of each Indemnitee. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither Borrower nor the REIT shall
be liable to pay to Agent, Lender or any Co-Lender any amounts with respect to

provided that such terms, provisions and conditions shall have been disclosed
to Borrower and the REIT; Lender agrees that the terms of such Intercreditor
Agreement shall not be inconsistent with this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or the Assignment and Assumption.

(b) In the case of any waiver, Borrower, the REIT, Lender
and all Co-Lenders shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder and under the outstanding Note and any other Loan Documents, and any
Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

 Section 9.5 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or
delay on the part of Lender or any Co-Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no course of dealing
between Borrower, the REIT or any other Loan Party and Lender or any Co-Lender
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies
herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which Lender or any Co-Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on Borrower, the REIT or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle
Borrower, the REIT or any other Loan Party to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights
of Lender or any Co-Lender, to any other or further action in any circumstances
without notice or demand.

 Section 9.6 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.
(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant to
the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, provided however, that with respect to the creation, perfection, priority
and enforcement of the lien of the Security Instruments, and the determination
of deficiency judgments, the laws of the State where the Real Property Asset is

 (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and any action for enforcement of any

Agreement, Borrower and the REIT hereby accept for themselves and in respect of
its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. Borrower and the
REIT irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Borrower and the
REIT at its address set forth in Section 9.2. Borrower and the REIT and Lender

hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further
irrevocably waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any
such
 110
 -103-

action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of Lender or any
Co-Lender, to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence
legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against Borrower or the REIT in any
other jurisdiction.

 Section 9.7 Confidentiality; Disclosure of Information.
Each party hereto shall treat the transactions contemplated hereby and all
financial and other information furnished to it about Borrower, the other Loan
Parties and the Real Property Assets, as confidential; provided, however, that
such confidential information may be disclosed (a) as required by law or
pursuant to generally accepted accounting procedures, (b) to officers,
directors, employees, agents, partners, attorneys, accountants, engineers and
other consultants of the parties hereto who need to know such information,
provided such Persons are instructed to treat such information confidentially,
(c) by Lender to any Participant, Co-Lender, servicer, or assignee
("Transferee"), which disclosure to Transferees and prospective Transferees may
include any and all information which has been delivered to Lender by Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or which has been
delivered to Lender in connection with Lender's credit evaluation of Borrower
prior to entering into this Agreement, provided that such Transferee agrees to
be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.7, or (d) upon the written consent
of the party whose otherwise confidential information would be disclosed.

 Borrower and the REIT acknowledge and agree that Lender may
provide to the Co-Lenders, and that Lender and each of the Co-Lenders may
provide to any Participant, originals or copies of this Agreement, all Loan
Documents and all other documents, instruments, certificates, opinions,
insurance policies, letters of credit, reports, requisitions and other
materials and information of every nature or description, and may communicate
all oral information, at any time submitted by or on behalf of Borrower or the
REIT or received by Lender in connection with the Loan or Borrower or the REIT.

 Section 9.8 Recourse. The Loan and the Obligations shall
be fully recourse to Borrower; however, no personal liability or personal
deficiency judgment shall be asserted or enforced against the REIT except as a
result and to the extent of (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by
Borrower or any other Loan Party; (ii) Borrower's or any other Loan Party's
misapplication or misappropriation of Gross Revenues or Accounts Receivable
received by Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default; (iii) the
misapplication or the misappropriation of insurance proceeds or condemnation
awards; or (iv) the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 7.1(f) of
this Agreement and nothing contained in this Section 9.8 shall limit, affect or
impair any of Lender's rights or remedies against the REIT under the
Environmental Indemnity Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
agreement of Lender to not assert or enforce personal liability or a personal
deficiency judgment against the REIT SHALL BECOME NULL AND VOID and shall be of
no further force and effect in the event that there is any breach of Section
7.4 of Borrower's Partnership Agreement or of Sections
 111
 -104-

5.5(c), 6.4(b) or 6.9 of this Agreement. Lender and each Co-Lender
acknowledges and agrees that the name "Starwood Lodging Trust" is a designation
of the REIT and its Trustees (as Trustees but not personally) under a
Declaration of Trust dated August 25, 1969, as amended and restated as of June
6, 1988, as further amended on February 1, 1995 and as further amended on June
19, 1995 and as the same may be further amended from time to time, and all
persons dealing with the REIT shall look solely to the REIT's assets for the
enforcement of any claims against the REIT, as the Trustees, officers, agents
and security holders of the REIT assume no personal liability for obligations
entered into on behalf of the REIT, and their respective individual assets
shall not be subject to the claims of any person relating to such obligations.
The foregoing shall govern all direct and indirect obligations of the REIT
under this Agreement and the Loan Documents.

Section 9.9 Sale of Loan, Co-Lenders, Participations and
Servicing.

 (a) After the earliest to occur of (or simultaneously
with) (i) the Syndication, (ii) January 31, 1996 or (iii) Borrower's rejection
of a Syndication, Lender may, at its option, sell with novation all or any part
of its right, title and interest in, and to, and under the Loan, including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its obligation to make Advances, and
its interest in the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, to one or more
entities (any entity that purchases an interest in the Loan with novation, a
"Co-Lender"); notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, any such sale with novation during the Draw
Period to any Co-Lender that is not an Affiliate of Lender shall be subject to
Borrower's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Each Co-Lender shall purchase an interest in the Loan of
at least 5,000,000.00. Lender and each Co-Lender shall enter into an
assignment and assumption agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit "Y" (the "Assignment and Assumption") assigning a portion of
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan, and pursuant to which the
Co-Lender accepts such assignment and assumes the assigned obligations. From
and after the effective date specified in the Assignment and Assumption (A)
each Co-Lender shall be a party hereto and to each Loan Document to the extent
of the applicable percentage or percentages set forth in the Assignment and
Assumption and, except as specified otherwise herein, shall succeed to the
rights and obligations of Lender hereunder and thereunder in respect of the
Loan (including, without limitation, its pro rata share of Lender's obligations
to make Advances hereunder), and (B) Lender, as lender shall, to the extent
such rights and obligations have been assigned pursuant to such Assignment and
Assumption, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. The liabilities of Lender and each of
the Co-Lenders shall be several and not joint, and Lender's obligations to
Borrower under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of each such
Assignment and Assumption. Neither Lender nor any Co-Lender shall be
responsible for the obligations of any other Co- Lender. Lender and each
Co-Lender shall be liable to Borrower only for their respective proportionate
shares of the Loan. If for any reason any of the Co-Lenders shall fail or
refuse to abide by their obligations under this Agreement, Lender and the other
Co- Lenders shall not be relieved of their obligations, if any, hereunder,
including their obligations to make their pro rata share of any Advance on the
date set forth for such Advance in the Notice of Borrowing.
 113
 -106-

(b) Intentionally Omitted.

 (c) Borrower and the REIT agree that they shall, in
connection with any sale of all or any portion of the Loan, whether in whole,
subject to Section 9.9(d), or to a Co-Lender or Participant, within ten (10)
business days after requested by Lender, furnish Lender with the certificates
required under Section 9.22(a) and (b) and such other information as reasonably
requested by any Co-Lender or Participant in performing its due diligence in
connection with its purchase of an interest in the Loan.

 (d) During the Draw Period and provided that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall retain at
least a ten percent (10 direct ownership interest in the Loan and in the
Maximum Facility Amount.

 (e) Unless the entire Loan has been sold to a single
entity other than an Affiliate of Lender, Lender (or an Affiliate of Lender)
shall act as administrative agent for itself and the Co-Lenders (together with
any successor administrative agent, the "Agent") pursuant to this Section
9.9(e). Subsequent to the Syndication, Lender shall have the right to appoint
a successor administrative agent for the Loan or delegate any portion of the
administrative agent's duties. Borrower acknowledges that Lender, as Agent
shall have the sole and exclusive authority to execute and perform this
Agreement and each Loan Document on behalf of itself, as Lender and as agent
for itself and the Co-Lenders. Borrower may rely conclusively on the actions
of Lender as Agent to bind Lender and the Co-Lenders, notwithstanding that the
particular action in question may, pursuant to this Agreement or any
Intercreditor Agreement among Lender and the Co-Lenders, be subject to the
consent or direction of the Co-Lenders. Lender may resign as Agent of the
Co-Lenders, in its sole discretion, without the consent of Borrower; provided
however, that prior to the Syndication, Lender may only resign as Agent (i)
after an Event of Default has occurred or (ii) if required to by the
Co-Lenders. Upon any such resignation, the Co-Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent. If, within thirty (30) days of the Agent's
resignation, a successor Agent has not been appointed or such successor has not
accepted such appointment, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Co-Lenders, appoint a successor Agent. Upon appointment of a successor Agent,
the successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent
hereunder and the retiring Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of the retiring
Agent, Borrower, or the Co-Lenders.

 The Collateral Agent shall have no duties or obligations with
respect to Borrower or the Loan other than to serve as a custodian of the
Collateral as agent of Lender and the Co-Lenders and to serve as mortgagee,
beneficiary or secured party, as the case may be, of record with respect to the
Loan Documents for the benefit of Lender and the Co-Lenders pursuant to a
Custodial Agreement dated the date hereof between Lender as Agent, and the
Collateral Agent
 114
 -107-

(the "Custodial Agreement"). Lender and the Co-Lenders shall have the right to
terminate or change the Collateral Agent and enter into a new Custodial
Agreement, provided that the Collateral Fees to be paid by Borrower hereunder
are not significantly increased.

 (f) Except to the extent its obligations hereunder and
its interest in the Loan have been assigned pursuant to one or more Assignments
and Assumption, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") as Lender, shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Co-Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent. The term "Co-Lender" or
"Co- Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Lehman in
its individual capacity. Lehman and the other Co-Lenders and their respective
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower,
Loan Party or any Affiliate of Borrower or Loan Party and any Person or entity
who may do business with or own securities of Borrower or Loan Party or any
Affiliate of Borrower or Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof, all as if they
were not serving in such capacities hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to each other.

 (g) This Agreement is being entered into by Lender
individually and as agent for one or more Co-Lenders, and upon the execution
and delivery of each Assignment and Assumption, privity of contract shall be
created as between (i) Lender and each Co-Lender and (ii) Borrower and each
Co-Lender.

 (h) Lender, as Agent shall maintain at its domestic
lending office or at such other location as Lender, as Agent shall designate in
writing to each Co-Lender and Borrower a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Co-Lenders, the amount of each Co-Lender's proportionate
share of the Maximum Facility Amount and the Loan and the name and address of
each Co-Lender's agent for service of process (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and Borrower, Lender, as Agent and the Co-Lenders may treat each person
or entity whose name is recorded in the Register as a Co-Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
and copying by Borrower or any Co-Lender during normal business hours upon
reasonable prior notice to the Agent. A Co-Lender may change its address and
its agent for service of process upon written notice to Lender, as Agent and
Borrower, which notice shall only be effective upon actual receipt by Lender
and Borrower, which receipt will be acknowledged by Lender as Agent, and
Borrower upon request.

 (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
financial institution or other entity may be sold a participation interest in
the Loan by Lender or any Co-Lender without Borrower's consent (such financial
institution or entity, a "Participant") (x) if such sale is without novation
and (y) if the other conditions set forth in this paragraph are met. No
Participant shall be considered a Lender or Co-Lender hereunder or under any
Note or the Loan
 115
 -108-

Documents. No Participant shall have any rights under this Agreement, the
Notes or any of the Loan Documents and the Participant's rights in respect of
such participation shall be solely against Lender or Co-Lender, as the case may
be, as set forth in the participation agreement executed by and between Lender
or Co-Lender, as the case may be, and such Participant. The terms of any
participation agreement between Lender or Co-Lender, as the case may be, and
its Participant shall not grant the Participant any consent rights except for
consent to (i) changes in the interest rate and term of the Loan, (ii) increase
in the principal amount of the Loan (except for protective advances and
increases made in accordance with Sections 2.22, 2.23 and 2.24 hereof), (iii)
release of collateral (except for Section 2.21 hereof), (iv) release of any
party liable for repayment of the Loan, (v) forbearance, (vi) consents to
subordinate financing of the Real Property Asset(s), (vii) the acceleration of
the Loan or commencement of foreclosure, (viii) the acquisition of foreclosed
property and (ix) the management of, and ultimate sale of, real estate owned.
No participation shall relieve Lender or Co-Lender, as the case may be, from
its obligations hereunder or under the Notes or the Loan Documents and Lender
or Co-Lender, as the case may be,shall remain solely responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder.

 (j) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, the Lender or any Co-Lender may at any time create a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts owing to it in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System), provided that no such security interest or the exercise by the secured
party of any of its rights thereunder shall release Lender or Co-Lender from
its funding obligations hereunder.

 (k) If prior to January 31, 1996, Lender receives written
commitments from one or more Co-lenders to fund, in the aggregate, up to an
additional 60,000,000.00 under the Loan, pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Syndication Letter dated the date hereof between Lender and Borrower and
the REIT (the "Syndication Letter"), the Maximum Facility Amount shall, upon
execution and delivery of Assignment and Assumption Agreements and
Intercreditor Agreements satisfactory to Lender, upon payment of all Commitment
Fees pursuant to and as defined in the Fee Letter and the Syndication Letter,
and upon notice to and acceptance by Borrower, increase the Maximum Facility
Amount up to 135,000,000.00 without any further action on the part of Lender
or any Co- Lender (the "Syndication"). Any such increase in the Maximum
Facility Amount is subject to the terms and conditions of the Syndication
Letter. Upon Syndication, Borrower may elect to have a portion of the Maximum
Facility Amount, up to an aggregate amount of 10,000,000.00, consist of Swing
Line Advances from one designated Co-Lender (the "Swing Line Lender").

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but
subject to the terms and conditions of the Syndication Letter, Lender shall be
under no obligation to advance
 116
 -109-

other proceeding arising or relating to such a liability unless such settlement
includes an explicit and unconditional release from the party bringing such
lawsuit, claim or more than 75,000,000.00 from its own funds. The sale of pro
rata interests in the initial 75,000,000.00 Initial Facility Amount to
Co-lenders shall not be deemed a Syndication.

 (l) Each Lender, Co-Lender and Participant represents,
warrants and covenants, and each person to whom a Lender or Co-Lender or
Participant directly or indirectly sells or assigns or otherwise transfers all
or any part of its right, title or interest in, or to, or under the Loan (i.e.,
a Transferee), shall be deemed to represent, warrant and covenant, to Borrower
and each of the Loan Parties that they and each other Person to whom all or any
part of any Lender, Co-Lender, Participant or Transferee's right, title or
interest in, or to, or under the Loan is directly or indirectly sold or
assigned or otherwise transferred are not, and shall not be, a Plan Asset
Entity at any time any Lender, Co-Lender, Participant, Transferee or other
Person has any right, title or interest in, or to, or under the Loan, unless
such person being a Plan Asset Entity would not result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
because of an exemption or otherwise. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or any Loan Document, if this representation, warranty and covenant
is breached and a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA in Section
4975 of the Code results, (i) neither Borrower nor any Loan Party shall be
considered to be in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this
Agreement or of any Loan Document that is breached or becomes untrue as a
result of a prohibited transaction caused by a sale or assignment or other
transfer in violation of the preceding sentence, (ii) no Event of Default or
Default shall be considered to occur pursuant to this Agreement as a result of
a prohibited transaction caused by a sale or assignment or other transfer in
violation of the preceding sentence, and similarly no default to the detriment
of Borrower or any Loan Party shall be deemed to occur pursuant to any other
Loan Document as a result of a prohibited transaction caused by a sale or
assignment or other transfer in violation of the preceding sentence and (iii)
the Person breaching the representation, warranty and covenant shall indemnify
and hold harmless Borrower and each Loan Party from any and all actual, but in
no event consequential, losses, expenses, and liabilities resulting to Borrower
and any Loan Party resulting therefrom or in connection therewith.

 In the event that liability is sought to be imposed on any
Person pursuant to the indemnification in the subsection (iii) of the preceding
sentence ("ERISA Indemnitee"), then such ERISA Indemnitee shall have the right,
if it so chooses, to control any litigation or arbitration involving potential
liability, loss or expenses under such subsection (iii) and if such ERISA
Indemnitee is not timely informed of a claim for liability and given the right
to exercise such control, then indemnification under subsection (iii) in the
preceding sentence shall be null and void. Borrower and the Loan Parties agree
that, without the prior written consent of the ERISA Indemnitee, which shall
not unreasonably be withheld, they shall not enter into any settlement of a
lawsuit, claim or other proceeding arising or relating to such a liability
unless such settlement includes an explicit and unconditional release from the
party bringing such lawsuit, claim or

 117
 -110-

other proceeding of each Lender, Co-Lender, Participant and any Transferee, 
including each ERISA Indemnitee.

no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower, the REIT, any other
Loan Party or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations. To the extent Lender receives any payment by or on behalf of
Borrower, the REIT or any other Loan Party, which payment or any part thereof
is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required to be repaid to Borrower, the REIT or such other Loan Party
or its estate, trustee, receiver, custodian or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to
the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which
has been paid, reduced or satisfied by the amount so repaid shall be reinstated
by the amount so repaid and shall be included within the liabilities of
Borrower, the REIT or such other Loan Party to Lender as of the date such
initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred.

 Section 9.15 Severability. In case any provision in or
obligation under this Agreement or the Note or the other Loan Documents shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of
such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER, THE REIT, LENDER AND ALL CO-LENDERS EACH

to the contrary herein contained, Lender by entering into this Agreement or by
taking any action pursuant hereto, will not be deemed a partner or joint
venturer with Borrower or the REIT and Borrower and the REIT agree to hold
Lender harmless from any damages and expenses resulting from such a
construction of the relationship of the parties hereto or any assertion
thereof.

 Section 9.22 Estoppel Certificates. (a) Borrower, the

less than ten (10) Business Days prior written notice by Borrower or Lender to

statement, in writing, certifying whether this Agreement is unmodified and in
full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, whether the same,
as modified, is in full force and effect and stating the modifications hereto),
and stating whether or not, to the best knowledge of such certifying party, any
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, and, if so,
specifying each such Default or Event of Default; provided, however, that it
shall be a condition precedent to Lender's obligation to deliver the statement
pursuant to this
 119
 -112-

Section, that Lender shall receive, together with Borrower's request for such
statement, a certificate of a general partner or senior executive officer of
Borrower and the REIT stating that no Default or Event of Default exists as of
the date of such certificate (or specifying such Default or Event of Default).

Borrower shall execute and deliver a certificate of the general partner of
Borrower or senior executive officer of Borrower and the REIT confirming the

Lender and the Co-Lenders and the Swing Line Lender to make Advances hereunder
are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Lender and the Co-Lenders
and the Swing Line Lender and their respective assigns and no other person
shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance
with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender and any Co-Lender and the
Swing Line Lender will refuse to make Advances in the absence of strict
compliance with any and all thereof and no other person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender at any time if it in
