PART I
Item 1. Business
 BUSINESS OF ENTERGY

Entergy Corporation

 Entergy Corporation is a Delaware corporation which, through its
subsidiaries, engages principally in the following businesses: domestic
utility, power marketing and trading, global power development, and
domestic non-utility nuclear. Power marketing and trading, global power
development, and domestic non-utility nuclear are sometimes referred to
as the competitive businesses. In 2000, Entergy placed the management of
the power marketing and trading business under the global power
development business, and the jointly-managed businesses are referred to
as Entergy Wholesale Operations. Entergy Corporation has no significant
assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation is
a registered public utility holding company under PUHCA. As such,
Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries generally are subject to the
broad regulatory provisions of PUHCA. PUHCA generally limits registered
public utility holding company activity to direct and indirect ownership
of domestic integrated utility businesses, domestic and foreign electric
generation ventures, foreign utility ownership, telecommunications and
information service businesses, and certain other domestic energy related
businesses. Financial information regarding Entergy Corporation's
operating segments is contained in Note 14 to the financial statements.
In December 2000, Entergy's shareholders approved a business combination
between Entergy Corporation and FPL Group, the objective of which is the
creation of a new company. See "Business Combination with FPL Group" for
further discussion of the terms and timing of this transaction.

Domestic Utility

 The domestic utility is Entergy's predominant business segment,
providing 74 of its revenue and 87 of its net income in 2000, and
holding 81 of its assets as of December 31, 2000. Entergy Corporation
has five wholly-owned domestic retail electric utility subsidiaries:
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. As of December 31, 2000, these
utility companies provided retail electric service to approximately 2.6
million customers primarily in portions of the states of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. In addition, Entergy Gulf States
furnishes natural gas utility service in and around Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans furnishes natural gas utility service
in New Orleans, Louisiana. The business of the domestic utility
companies is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with the peak sales period
normally occurring during the third quarter of each year. During 2000,
the domestic utility companies' combined retail electric sales volumes as
a percentage of total electric sales volumes were: residential - 28.3 ;
commercial - 21.8 ; and industrial - 38.8 . Retail electric revenues
from these sectors as a percentage of total electric revenues were:
residential - 35.0 ; commercial - 23.5 ; and industrial - 30.2 . Sales
to governmental and municipal sectors and to nonaffiliated utilities
accounted for the balances of energy sales and electric revenues. The
major industrial customers of the domestic utility companies are in the
chemical, petroleum refining, paper, and food products industries. State
or local regulatory authorities regulate the retail rates and services of
Entergy's domestic retail utility subsidiaries.

 Entergy Corporation also owns 100 of the voting stock of System
Energy, an Arkansas corporation that owns and leases an aggregate 90 
undivided interest in Grand Gulf. System Energy sells all of the
capacity and energy from its interest in Grand Gulf 1 at wholesale to its
only customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
and Entergy New Orleans. Management discusses sales from Grand Gulf 1
more thoroughly in "CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE FINANCING - Certain
Grand Gulf-related Financial and Support Agreements - Unit Power Sales
Agreement" below. System Energy's wholesale power sales are subject to
the jurisdiction of FERC.

 Entergy Services, a Delaware corporation wholly-owned by Entergy
Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal,
engineering, and other services primarily to the domestic utility
subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation. Entergy Operations, a Delaware
corporation, is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides
nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract
for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf 1, subject to the owner
oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana,
and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans own 35 , 33 , 19 , and 13 ,
respectively, of the common stock of System Fuels, a Louisiana
corporation that implements and manages certain programs to procure,
deliver, and store fuel supplies for those companies. Entergy Services,
Entergy Operations, and System Fuels provide their services to the
domestic utility companies and System Energy on an "at cost" basis,
pursuant to service agreements approved by the SEC under PUHCA.
Information regarding affiliate transactions is contained in Note 13 to
the financial statements.

 Entergy Gulf States has wholly-owned subsidiaries that (i) own and
operate intrastate gas pipelines in Louisiana used primarily to transport
fuel to two of Entergy Gulf States' generating stations; (ii) own the
Lewis Creek Station, a gas-fired generating plant, which is leased to and
operated by Entergy Gulf States; and (iii) own several miles of railroad
track constructed in Louisiana primarily for the purpose of transporting
coal for use as boiler fuel at Entergy Gulf States' Nelson Unit 6
generating facility.

Power Marketing and Trading

 Prior to 2001, Entergy conducted its power marketing and trading
business primarily through three subsidiaries, Entergy Power, EPMC, and
ET&M. Entergy Power is a domestic power producer that owns 665 MW of
fossil-fueled generation assets located in Arkansas. Entergy Power's
capacity and energy is sold at wholesale principally to EPMC and Entergy
Arkansas. Entergy Power's wholesale power sales are subject to the
jurisdiction of FERC. EPMC engages in the marketing and trading of
physical and financial energy commodity products, industrial energy
management, and risk management services. It has authority from the SEC
to deal in a wide range of energy commodities and related financial
products. ET&M is engaged in the marketing and trading of physical and
financial energy commodity products in the UK.

 On January 31, 2001, Entergy contributed its power marketing
and trading business to a new limited partnership, Entergy-Koch, L.P.
The joint venture is with Koch Industries, Inc., which contributed to the
venture its 9,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline (which has been renamed the
Gulf South Pipeline), gas storage facilities including the Bistineau
storage facility near Shreveport, Louisiana, and Koch Energy Trading,
which markets and trades electricity, gas, weather derivatives, and other
energy-related commodities and services (the joint venture's trading
activities are now conducted under the name Axia Energy). The parties
have equal ownership interests in Entergy-Koch, L.P., which is governed
by an eight-member board of directors. Entergy appointed four members of
the board. The partnership agreement allocates the substantial majority
of Entergy-Koch, L.P.'s earnings through 2003 to Entergy. Losses are
generally allocated equally. Entergy Power was not transferred to the
joint venture, and it was placed under the management of the global power
development business.

Global Power Development

 Entergy's global power development business is focused on acquiring
or developing power generation projects in North America and Western
Europe. The Latin American projects owned by the global power
development business are not a core part of its strategy, and Entergy is
considering various strategies to maximize the value of these
investments, including possibly selling them. The global power
development business owns interests in the following electric generation
assets that are currently operating or are under construction:

 Investment Percent Ownership Status

Argentina - Costanera, 1,260 MW 6 operational
Argentina - Costanera expansion, 220 MW 10 operational
Chile - San Isidro, 375 MW 25 operational
Pakistan - Hub River, 1,200 MW 5 operational
Peru - Edegel - 833 MW 24 operational
United Kingdom - Saltend, 1,200 MW 100 operational
United Kingdom - Damhead Creek, 800 MW 100 operational
U.S. (AR) - Ritchie Unit 2, 544 MW 100 operational
U.S. (AR) - Independence Unit 2, 840 MW 14 operational
U.S. (LA) - Riverside, 425 MW 50 under construction
U.S. (MS) - Warren Power, 300 MW 100 under construction

Damhead Creek commenced commercial operation in 2001. Entergy Power owns
Ritchie Unit 2 and the interest in Independence Unit 2. Entergy owns its
interest in Riverside through a 50 interest in RS Cogen, LLC, and the
remaining 50 interest is owned by PPG Industries, an industrial customer
of Entergy Gulf States. Entergy's global power development business has
several other development projects in the planning stages, including
announced projects in the United States, Spain, and Bulgaria.

 In preparation for its global power development plans, Entergy has
obtained an option to acquire turbines from GE Power Systems. See
"MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES" for further information on the turbines. Furthermore, the
global power development business entered into a 50/50 joint venture with
The Shaw Group Inc. that is named EntergyShaw, L.L.C. EntergyShaw
provides management, engineering, procurement, construction, and
commissioning services for electric power plants. EntergyShaw plans to
operate in the rapidly growing electric power generation market and
provide services for Entergy's global power development plans. In June
2000, Entergy also acquired a 75 interest in Highland Energy Company, an
energy aggregation, marketing, and producer services company.

 In June 2000, the global power development business sold its
interest in Freestone, a planned 1,000 MW combined cycle gas turbine
merchant power plant to be constructed in Fairfield, Texas, adjacent to
Entergy Gulf States' service territory.

Domestic Non-Utility Nuclear

 Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business is focused on
acquiring, owning, operating, and selling power from nuclear power plants
and providing operations and management services to nuclear power plants
owned by other utilities in the United States. Plant acquisitions are
made through Entergy's wholly owned subsidiary ENHC and its affiliates.
Operations and management services, including decommissioning services,
are provided through Entergy's wholly owned subsidiary, Entergy Nuclear.

 Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business owns the following
nuclear power plants that it has acquired from other utilities:

 Power Plant Capacity Percent Ownership Location

Pilgrim Nuclear Station 670 MW 100 Plymouth, MA
James A. FitzPatrick 825 MW 100 Oswego, NY
Indian Point 3 980 MW 100 Westchester County, NY

Pilgrim has firm power purchase agreements with Boston Edison and other
utilities that expire at the end of 2004. One hundred percent of the
plant's output is committed to those parties through 2001, and that
commitment decreases to 50 by 2003. Indian Point 3 has a firm power
purchase agreement with NYPA that expires at the end of 2004 for 100 of
the plant's output. FitzPatrick has firm power purchase agreements with
NYPA that expire at the end of 2004 for 100 of the plant's output
through 2003 and approximately 45 of the plant's output in 2004. See
Note 12 to the financial statements for a further discussion of these
acquisitions by Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business.

 In November 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
agreed to purchase Consolidated Edison's (Con Edison) 957 MW Indian Point
2 nuclear power plant (IP2) located in Westchester County, New York. In
the transaction, Entergy has agreed to acquire Indian Point 1 nuclear
power plant (IP1), which has been shut down and in safe storage since the
early 1970s. Entergy will pay 600 million in cash at the closing of the
purchase and will receive the plant, nuclear fuel, and other assets,
including a purchase power agreement (PPA). Under the PPA, Con Edison
will purchase 100 of IP2's output through 2004. Con Edison will also
transfer a 430 million decommissioning trust fund, along with the
liability to decommission IP2 and IP1, to Entergy's nuclear business.
Management expects to close the acquisition by mid-2001, pending the
approvals of the NRC, the New York Public Service Commission, and other
regulatory agencies.

 In January 2001, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
submitted an offer to buy Vermont Yankee, a 540 MW boiling water reactor
plant, located in Vernon, Vermont, for 50 million. Entergy's offer is
firm through the end of 2001. In February 2001, the Vermont Public
Service Board rejected a competing offer and the plant is expected to be
auctioned during the second or third quarter of 2001.

 Entergy Nuclear provides services to nuclear power plants owned by
other utilities, including engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel
procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training,
administrative support, and other managerial or technical services
required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power
facilities. Currently Entergy is providing decommissioning services for
the Maine Yankee and Millstone Unit 1 nuclear power plants. The cost of
decommissioning and insuring the plants that Entergy provides
decommissioning services for is the responsibility of the plant owners.

 In 2000, Entergy Nuclear entered into two business arrangements to
assist it in providing operation and management services. Entergy
Nuclear and Framatome Technologies intend to jointly offer operating
license renewal and life extension services to nuclear power plants in
the United States. Framatome has provided and continues to provide
license renewal services to several utilities owning nuclear power plants
in the United States. Entergy Nuclear also acquired TLG Services in
September 2000. TLG provides decommissioning, engineering, and related
services to nuclear power plant owners.

Domestic and Foreign Generation Investment Restrictions and Risks

 Entergy's ability to invest in domestic and foreign generation
businesses is subject to the SEC's regulations under PUHCA. Absent SEC
approval, these regulations limit Entergy Corporation's aggregate
investment in domestic and foreign generation businesses at the time an
investment is made to an amount equal to 50 of average consolidated
retained earnings for the previous four quarters. In June 2000, the SEC
issued an order that allows Entergy's EWG and FUCO investments to
increase from 50 to 100 of Entergy's average consolidated retained
earnings. As of December 31, 2000 Entergy's investments under this rule
totaled 770 million constituting 25 of its average consolidated
retained earnings.

 Entergy's ability to guarantee obligations of its non-utility
subsidiaries is also limited by SEC regulations under PUHCA. In August
2000, the SEC issued an order, effective through December 31, 2005, that
allows Entergy to issue up to 2 billion of guarantees to its non-utility
companies, excluding guarantees outstanding as of that date that were
issued under a previous order.

 International operations are subject to the risks inherent in
conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or
expropriation, price and currency exchange controls, inflation,
limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises, and other
restrictions. Changes in the relative value of currencies may favorably
or unfavorably affect the financial condition and results of operations
of Entergy's non-U.S. businesses. In addition, exchange control
restrictions in certain countries may limit or prevent the repatriation
of earnings.

Business Combination with FPL Group

 On July 30, 2000, Entergy Corporation and FPL Group entered into a
Merger Agreement providing for a business combination that will result in
the creation of a new company. Each outstanding share of FPL Group
common stock will be converted into one share of the new company's common
stock, and each outstanding share of Entergy Corporation common stock
will be converted into 0.585 of a share of the new company's common
stock. It is expected that FPL Group's shareholders will own
approximately 57 of the common equity of the new company and Entergy's
shareholders will own approximately 43 . The initial board of directors
of the new company will consist of eight directors designated by FPL
Group and seven directors designated by Entergy. The new company will be
given a new name that will be agreed upon between the Boards of Directors
of FPL and Entergy prior to the consummation of the Merger. The new
company will maintain its principal corporate offices and headquarters in
Juno Beach, Florida, and will maintain its utility headquarters in New
Orleans, Louisiana. The Merger Agreement generally allows Entergy to
continue business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and contains certain restrictions on Entergy's capital activities,
including restrictions on the issuance of securities, capital
expenditures, dispositions, incurrence or guarantee of indebtedness, and
trading or marketing of energy. Entergy generally will be permitted to
take actions pursuant to restructuring legislation in the domestic
utility companies' jurisdictions of operation and to reorganize its
transmission business. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, a termination fee of 215 million may be payable
by one of the parties. The Merger Agreement may be terminated if the
Merger is not consummated by April 30, 2002, unless automatically
extended until October 30, 2002 under certain circumstances. Both the
FPL Group and Entergy Boards of Directors unanimously approved the
Merger, and the shareholders of Entergy Corporation and FPL Group have
approved the Merger. The Merger is conditioned upon, among other things,
the receipt of required regulatory approvals of various local, state, and
federal regulatory agencies and commissions, including the SEC and FERC.
Entergy has filed for approval of the Merger in all of its state and
local regulatory jurisdictions (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas,
and New Orleans), and at FERC, the SEC, and the NRC. In their filing with
the SEC, Entergy and FPL Group requested to remain in existence as
intermediate holding companies after the Merger is consummated. The
objective of Entergy and FPL Group is to consummate the Merger by late
2001.

 In September 2000, Entergy and FPL Group announced plans to form a
joint venture between FPL Energy and Entergy Wholesale Operations.
Entergy and FPL Group management subsequently decided not to form a
separate joint venture in advance of the Merger.

new agreements with IBEW.

Industry Restructuring and Competition

 As a result of the actions of federal legislative and regulatory
bodies over the period of approximately the past twenty years, wholesale
markets have developed in which electricity, gas, and other energy
related products and services are purchased and sold at market-based
(rather than traditional cost-based) rates. These wholesale markets are
continuing to grow and evolve. This evolution has changed the ways in
which public utilities conduct their business and has changed the nature
of the participants in these wholesale markets, which now include not
only public utilities but also power marketers and traders, other energy
commodity marketers and traders, wholesale generators of electricity, and
a wide range of wholesale customers.

 Major changes in the retail utility business are now occurring in
some parts of the United States, including some states in which Entergy's
domestic utility companies operate. Both Texas and Arkansas adopted
legislation in 1999 aimed at separating ("unbundling") traditionally
integrated public utilities into distinct distribution, transmission,
generation, and various types of retail marketing businesses, and aimed
at introducing competition into the generation component of utility
service. The Texas legislation provides for retail open access by
January 1, 2002. In Arkansas, retail open access has been delayed by law
so that it begins no sooner than October 2003 and no later than October
2005. This delay is intended to allow further development of the
wholesale generation market, including the completion of several
independent generation projects within the state. Other jurisdictions in
which the domestic utility companies operate have not enacted retail
competition and utility unbundling legislation. Further changes in
restructuring in Entergy's service territories, including the timing of
implementation of restructuring and competition, may result from the
effects of the developments in the California power supply markets.

 Changes in the wholesale and retail electricity markets in the
Entergy system will take place over a number of years, and regulators and
legislators in different jurisdictions have not coordinated these
changes. In some cases, actions by one jurisdiction may conflict with
actions by another, creating potentially incompatible obligations for
public utilities and holding companies, including the Entergy system.
Examples include:

 o the LPSC's docket relating to the changes in corporate structure of
 Entergy Gulf States as a result of complying with the Texas
 restructuring law and its potential impact on Louisiana retail
 ratepayers (described more fully in Note 2 to the financial
 statements); and
 o System Agreement restructuring issues (described more fully in
 "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT
 FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS - Federal Regulatory and Legislative
 Activity - Proposed System Agreement Amendments").

It is too early to accurately predict how incompatible obligations will
be resolved or the effects of the changes that are taking place in the
wholesale and retail energy markets. However, these changes will result
in fundamental alterations in the way traditional integrated utilities
and holding company systems, like Entergy and its domestic utility
companies, conduct their business. Some of these alterations will be
positive for Entergy and its affiliates, while others will not be.

 These changes are resulting in increased costs associated with
utility unbundling and transitioning to new organizational structures and
ways of conducting business. It is possible that the new organizational
structures that will be required will result in lost economies of scale,
less beneficial cost sharing arrangements within utility holding company
systems, and, in some cases, greater difficulty and cost in accessing
capital. Furthermore, these changes could result in early refinancing of
debt, the reorganization of debt, or other obligations between newly-
formed companies. Ultimately, capital structures may result that
initially are more complex than the existing capital structures of the
domestic utility companies.

 Utilities, including the domestic utility companies, may be required
or encouraged to sell generating plants or interests therein, or the
output from such plants. FERC set December 15, 2001 as the date by which
all owners and operators of transmission lines should sell or turn over
operating and management responsibility for their transmission systems to
independent parties. Entergy has responded to FERC by filing plans to
transfer control of its transmission assets to a non-affiliated
transmission company subject to control by a regional transmission
organization. These changes will alter the historical structure from the
operation of the domestic utility companies' electric generation and
transmission assets as an integrated system supporting utility service
throughout their combined service territories.

 As a potential result of restructuring, Entergy's domestic utility
companies may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting
principles to some or all of their operations, and they may be required
to write off certain regulatory assets or recognize asset impairments.

 There are a number of other changes that may result from electric
industry competition and unbundling, including but not limited to changes
in labor relations, management and staffing, structure of operations,
environmental compliance responsibility, and other aspects of the utility
business.

 "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT
FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS" and Note 2 to the financial statements contain
detailed discussions of the competitive challenges Entergy faces in the
utility industry, including the status of the transition to a more
competitive utility business environment for the domestic utility
companies.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE FINANCING

 For the years 2001 through 2003, Entergy plans to spend 8.2 billion
in a capital investment plan focused on improving service at the domestic
utility companies and growing the global power development and domestic
non-utility nuclear businesses. It is estimated that 2.6 billion will
be spent by the domestic utility companies, 3.6 billion by the global
power development business, and 2.0 billion by the domestic non-utility
nuclear business. The capital investment plan is subject to modification
based on the ongoing effects of transition to competition planning, the
ability to recover regulated utility costs in rates, and the proposed
business combination with FPL Group. Additionally, the plan is
contingent upon the ability to access the capital necessary to finance
the planned expenditures, and significant borrowings may be necessary to
implement these capital spending plans. Capital expenditures (including
nuclear fuel but excluding AFUDC) for Entergy are estimated at 3.2
billion in 2001, 2.5 billion in 2002, and 2.6 billion in 2003.
Included in these totals are estimated construction expenditures for the
domestic utility companies and System Energy as follows:

 2001 2002 2003 Total
 (In Millions)

 Entergy Arkansas 297 200 205 702
 Entergy Gulf States 293 216 220 729
 Entergy Louisiana 222 175 168 565
 Entergy Mississippi 147 128 113 388
 Entergy New Orleans 53 46 48 147
 System Energy 41 14 12 67

 The domestic utility companies will mainly focus their planned
spending on distribution and transmission projects that will support
continued reliability improvements and transitioning to a more
competitive environment.

 The global power development business will mainly focus its planned
spending on several merchant power plant projects either under
construction or in the planning stages in the U.S. and Europe, including
the purchase of gas turbines scheduled for delivery in 2001 through 2004
under an option to purchase obtained from GE Power Systems.

 The domestic non-utility nuclear business will mainly focus its
planned spending on the acquisition of U.S. nuclear power plants from
other utilities, including the anticipated purchase in 2001, pending
regulatory approvals, of IP2.

 Entergy Corporation's primary capital requirements are to invest
periodically in, or make loans to, its subsidiaries and to invest in new
enterprises. In February 2001, Entergy Corporation made a cash
contribution consisting of equity investment and loans of approximately
 414 million in the formation of Entergy-Koch, L.P. Entergy Corporation
also requires capital for its stock repurchase plans. In addition to
meeting capital expenditure requirements, Entergy must meet scheduled
long-term debt and preferred stock maturities and cash sinking fund
requirements. Actual capital expenditures may vary from the estimates
given for a number of reasons, including changes in load growth
estimates; environmental regulations; labor, equipment, materials, and
capital costs; modifications to generating units to meet regulatory
requirements; the transition to competition; and the proposed business
combination with FPL Group.

 Management more thoroughly discusses Entergy's capital investment and
common stock repurchase plans, financing requirements, Entergy Corporation
credit support requirements, and its sources and uses of capital in
"MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES" and Notes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 to the financial statements.

Certain Grand Gulf-related Financial and Support Agreements

Unit Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the
related costs from System Energy's 90 ownership and leasehold interests
in Grand Gulf 1 to Entergy Arkansas (36 ), Entergy Louisiana (14 ),
Entergy Mississippi (33 ), and Entergy New Orleans (17 ). Each of these
companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its
entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis
regardless of the quantity of energy delivered, so long as Grand Gulf 1
remains in commercial operation. Payments under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement are System Energy's only source of operating revenues. The
financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued
commercial operation of Grand Gulf 1 and the receipt of such payments.
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement through the rates charged to their customers. In the case of
Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered
through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of
Grand Gulf 1. The retained shares are discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements under the heading "Grand Gulf 1 Deferrals and
Retained Shares."

Availability Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was
entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy of
Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provided that System Energy would
join in the System Agreement on or before the date on which Grand Gulf 1
was placed in commercial operation and would make available to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
all capacity and energy available from System Energy's share of Grand
Gulf.

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly
for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts
that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement, or otherwise) would at least equal System Energy's
total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a
specified rate) and interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of
System Energy's investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately
 900 million, is being amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over
27 years.

 The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are
fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1 ; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9 ;
Entergy Mississippi - 31.3 ; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7 . The
allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in
effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event
of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources,
including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

 System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its first
mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing
the letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale
and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial
statements under "Sale and Leaseback Transactions - Grand Gulf 1 Lease
Obligations." In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the
event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments
under the Availability Agreement (for example, if FERC reduced or
disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would
then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and
at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be
allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in
default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

 Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability
Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to
System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments
must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the
beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made
pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.

 The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the
Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued
effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals. Sales of capacity
and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the
Availability Agreement be submitted to FERC for approval with respect to
the terms of such sale. No such filing with FERC has been made because
sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to
the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of capacity
and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement,
the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be
submitted to FERC for approval. Other aspects of the Availability
Agreement are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC, whose approval has
been obtained, under PUHCA.

 Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf 1 began, payments under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts
payable under the Availability Agreement. Therefore, no payments under
the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas
or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement
payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources,
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims
or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances
under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to
the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments
and their required Availability Agreement payments.

 The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified
by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of
any assignees or other creditors.

Capital Funds Agreement (Entergy Corporation and System Energy)

 System Energy and Entergy Corporation have entered into the Capital
Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System
Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System Energy's equity
capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35 of its total
capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued
commercial operation of Grand Gulf 1 and pay in full all indebtedness for
borrowed money of System Energy when due.

 Entergy Corporation has entered into various supplements to the
Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned its rights under
such supplements as security for its first mortgage bonds and for
reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in
connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions
described in Note 10 under "Sale and Leaseback Transactions - Grand Gulf
1 Lease Obligations." Each such supplement provides that permitted
indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in connection
with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy's rights
under the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the
Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to
the Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being
secured, Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital
contributions directly to System Energy sufficient to enable System
Energy to make payments when due on such indebtedness (Specific
Payments). However, if there is an event of default, Entergy Corporation
must make those payments directly to the holders of indebtedness
benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other than
the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of
the respective obligations benefiting from the supplemental agreements.

 The Capital Funds Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified
by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, upon obtaining the consent,
if required, of those holders of System Energy's indebtedness then
outstanding who have received the assignments of the Capital Funds
Agreement.

RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION

Rate Matters

 The retail rates of Entergy's domestic utility companies are
regulated by state or local regulatory authorities, as described below.
FERC regulates their wholesale rates (including intrasystem sales
pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of
electricity, as well as rates for System Energy's sales of capacity and
energy from Grand Gulf 1 to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales
Agreement.

Wholesale Rate Matters

System Energy

 As described above under "CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE FINANCING
- - Certain Grand Gulf-related Financial and Support Agreements," System
Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf 1 through
rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement.

 In December 1995, System Energy implemented a 65.5 million rate
increase, subject to refund. In 1998, FERC approved requests by Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand
Gulf purchased power obligations. The rate increase request filed by
System Energy with FERC and the Grand Gulf accelerated recovery tariffs
are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

System Agreement (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and
System Energy)

 The domestic utility companies have historically engaged in the
coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generation and
transmission facilities pursuant to the terms of the System Agreement, as
described under "PROPERTY - Generating Stations," below. Restructuring
in the electric utility industry will affect these coordinated activities
in the future.

 The LPSC and the Council commenced a proceeding at FERC in April
2000 that requests revisions to the System Agreement that the LPSC and
the Council allege are necessary to accommodate the introduction of
retail competition in Texas and Arkansas. In June 2000, Entergy's
domestic utility companies filed proposed amendments to the System
Agreement with FERC to facilitate the implementation of retail
competition in Arkansas and Texas and to provide for continued
equalization of costs among the domestic utilities in Louisiana and
Mississippi. The LPSC and the Council's complaint and Entergy's proposed
amendments are more thoroughly discussed in "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS". These
proceedings have been consolidated with a previous complaint filed with
FERC by the LPSC in 1995. In that complaint, the LPSC requested, among
other things, modification of the System Agreement to exclude curtailable
load from the cost allocation determination. Hearings in these
proceedings have been scheduled for March 2001, with an initial ALJ
decision expected by June 2001. Entergy requested a final decision from
FERC by October 2001, however, neither the timing, nor the ultimate
outcome, of the proceeding can be predicted at this time.

Open Access Transmission (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans)

 FERC issued Order 2000 in December 1999, which calls for owners and
operators of transmission lines in the United States to join regional
transmission organizations (RTOs) on a voluntary basis. Order 2000
requires that RTOs commence independent operations no later than December
15, 2001.

 It appears that FERC will be flexible regarding the structure of
RTOs. For example, it appears that RTOs may be for-profit or not-for-
profit and may be organized as joint ventures or legal entities of
various other types. However, RTOs will be required, among other things,
to be independent of market participants, to have sufficient regional
scope to maintain reliability and efficiency, to be non-discriminatory in
granting service, and to maintain operational control over their regional
transmission systems.

 In October 2000, in compliance with Order 2000, Entergy made a
filing with FERC that requested:

 o authorization to establish an RTO referred to as Transco;
 o authorization to transfer the domestic utility companies'
 transmission assets to the Transco; and
 o a determination that the partnership arrangement with the Southwest
 Power Pool (SPP) that the Transco proposes to operate in would qualify
 as an independent RTO. The partnership arrangement provides for
 operations under the oversight of, and within, the SPP RTO.

The amounts of the domestic utility companies' net transmission utility
plant assets recorded in their financial statements are provided in Note
1 to the financial statements under the heading "Utility Plant."

 The proposed Transco will be a limited liability company. The
managing member of the Transco will be a separate corporation with a
board of directors independent of Entergy. The Transco will be:

 o regulated by FERC;
 o composed of the transmission system transferred to it by the
 domestic utility companies and other transmission owners in Entergy's
 current service territory region;
 o operated and maintained by employees who would work exclusively for
 the Transco and would not be employed by Entergy or the domestic utility
 companies; and
 o passively owned by the domestic utility companies and other member
 companies who will transfer assets but not control or otherwise direct
 its operation and management.

 Entergy filed in December 2000 for FERC approval of the rates for
transmission service across Transco's facilities. Included in this rate
filing is a request to cancel Service Schedule MSS-2, the portion of the
System Agreement related to equalization of certain transmission costs.
In March 2001, Entergy, Entergy Services, and the domestic utility
companies requested SEC approval under PUHCA of certain elements of the
Transco plan. The domestic utility companies have also made filings with
their local regulators for Transco approval. Under its planned timeline,
Entergy expects to have the necessary regulatory approvals by the third
quarter of 2001, with the transmission asset transfers occurring before
Transco commences independent operations in December 2001. In the event
that some or all of these transmission assets cannot be transferred to
the Transco by December 2001, operational control of these assets will
move to an intermediate entity as of that date.

Retail Rate Regulation

General (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans)

 Certain costs related to Grand Gulf 1, Waterford 3, and River Bend
were phased into retail rates over a period of years in order to avoid
the "rate shock" associated with increasing rates to reflect all such
costs at once. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
and the portion of Entergy Gulf States regulated by the LPSC have fully
recovered such deferred costs associated with one or more of the plants.
Entergy New Orleans' phase-in plan will be completed in 2001.

 The retail regulatory philosophy has shifted in some jurisdictions
from traditional, exclusively cost-of-service regulation to include
performance-based rate elements. Performance-based formula rate plans
are designed to encourage efficiencies and productivity while permitting
utilities and their customers to share in the benefits. Entergy
Mississippi and Entergy Louisiana have implemented performance-based
formula rate plans.

 The domestic utility companies have initiated proceedings with state
and local regulators regarding transition to a more competitive market
for electricity. In addition, retail open access laws have been enacted
in Arkansas and Texas. These matters are discussed more thoroughly in
Note 2 to the financial statements.

Entergy Arkansas

Retail Rate Proceedings

 Entergy Arkansas' material retail rate proceedings that were
resolved during the past year, are currently pending, or affect current
year results are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Recovery of Grand Gulf 1 Costs

 Under the settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985
and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22 of its share of Grand
Gulf 1 costs and recovers the remaining 78 of its share through rates.
Under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, Entergy Arkansas' share of Grand
Gulf 1 costs is 36 . In the event Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell
its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its
retail customers at a price equal to its avoided energy cost, which is
currently less than Entergy Arkansas' cost of energy from the retained
share.

Fuel Recovery

 Entergy Arkansas' rate schedules include an energy cost recovery
rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills. The
rider utilizes projected energy costs for the twelve month period
commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which
is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the
over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the
energy cost for the prior calendar year.

Rate Freeze

 In December 1997, the APSC approved a settlement agreement resolving
Entergy Arkansas' transition to competition case. One provision in that
settlement was that base rates would remain at the level resulting from
that case until at least July 1, 2001. The terms of the settlement
agreement are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Entergy Gulf States

Retail Rate Proceedings

 Entergy Gulf States' material retail rate proceedings that were
resolved during the past year, are currently pending, or affect current
year results are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. In
addition, the 1999 settlement agreement that resolved Entergy Gulf
States' 1996 and 1998 rate proceedings, which is currently under appeal,
and various other matters are discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Texas Jurisdiction - River Bend

 In March 1998, the PUCT issued an order disallowing recovery of 1.4
billion of company-wide abeyed River Bend plant costs which have been
held in abeyance since 1988. Entergy Gulf States has appealed the PUCT's
decision on this matter to a Texas District Court. The 1999 settlement
agreement mentioned above addresses the treatment of abeyed plant costs,
and, as a result, Entergy Gulf States removed the reserve for these costs
and reduced the plant asset in 1999. Based on advice of counsel,
management believes that it is probable that the matter will be remanded
again to the PUCT for a further ruling on the prudence of the abeyed
plant costs and it is reasonably possible that some portion of these
costs will be added to the net book value of the River Bend plant for
regulatory purposes. The abeyed plant costs are discussed in more detail
in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Fuel Recovery

 Entergy Gulf States' Texas rate schedules include a fixed fuel
factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying
charges, not recovered in base rates. The 1999 settlement agreement
mentioned above established a methodology for semi-annual revisions of
the fixed fuel factor in March and September based on the market price of
natural gas. This agreement is effective through December 2001 or until
otherwise ordered by the PUCT. To the extent actual costs vary from the
fixed fuel factor, refunds or surcharges are required or permitted. Fuel
costs are also subject to reconciliation proceedings. In connection with
the implementation of restructuring in Texas, Entergy Gulf States
anticipates that it will file a final fuel reconciliation in March 2003
for the period ending December 31, 2001. Beginning in January 2002,
which is the scheduled start of retail open access in Texas, fuel and
purchased power cost recovery will be subject to the PUCT's rule
governing the price that Entergy Gulf States' affiliated retail electric
provider may charge residential and commercial customers, as discussed in
more detail in Note 2 to the financial statements.

 Entergy Gulf States' Louisiana electric rate schedules include a
fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased
power costs in the second prior month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit
for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the
monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel revenues
billed to customers. The LPSC and the PUCT fuel cost reviews that were
resolved during the past year or are currently pending are discussed in
Note 2 to the financial statements. In July 2000, the LPSC issued an
order requiring Entergy Gulf States to realign approximately 2.4 million
of certain Louisiana fuel costs from the fuel adjustment clause to base
rates.

 Entergy Gulf States' Louisiana gas rates include a purchased gas
adjustment based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by
a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly
reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues
billed to customers.

Entergy Louisiana

Retail Rate Proceedings

 Entergy Louisiana's material retail rate proceedings that were
resolved during the past year, are currently pending, or affect current
year results are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Recovery of Grand Gulf 1 Costs

 In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from
late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with
respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana's share of capacity
and energy from Grand Gulf 1, subject to certain terms and conditions.
In November 1988, Entergy Louisiana agreed to retain 18 of its share of
Grand Gulf 1 costs and recover the remaining 82 of its share through
rates. Under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, Entergy Louisiana's share
of Grand Gulf 1 costs is 14 . Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs
for Grand Gulf 1 are recovered through Entergy Louisiana's base rates.
Additionally, Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover, through the fuel
adjustment clause, 4.6 cents per KWH for the energy related to its
retained portion of these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may
sell such energy to nonaffiliated parties at prices above the fuel
adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC's approval.

Performance-Based Formula Rate Plan

 Entergy Louisiana files a performance-based formula rate plan by
April 15 of each year that compares the annual rate of return on common
equity (ROE) with a benchmark ROE. The benchmark ROE determined under
the formula rate plan includes the current approved ROE adjusted for a
customer satisfaction performance measure. The formula rate plan allows
for periodic adjustments in retail rates if the annually determined ROE
is outside an allowed range of the benchmark ROE. The performance-based
formula rate plan will end in 2001 after the filing for the 2000 test
year unless a continuance is ordered. Entergy Louisiana's performance-
based formula rate plan filings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Fuel Recovery

 Entergy Louisiana's rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause
designed to recover the cost of fuel in the second prior month, adjusted
by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying
charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs
incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers.

Entergy Mississippi

Retail Rate Proceedings

 Entergy Mississippi's material retail rate proceedings that were
resolved during the past year, are currently pending, or affect current
year results are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Performance-Based Formula Rate Plan

 Entergy Mississippi files a performance-based formula rate plan
every 12 months that compares the annual earned rate of return to and
adjusts it against a benchmark rate of return. The benchmark is
calculated under a separate formula within the formula rate plan. The
formula rate plan allows for periodic small adjustments in rates based on
a comparison of actual earned returns to benchmark returns and upon
certain performance factors. The formula rate plan filing for the 1999
test year is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. The
formula rate plan filing for the 2000 test year will be submitted in
March 2001.

Fuel Recovery

 Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules include an energy cost recovery
rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2000, the
MPSC approved the recovery of 136.7 million of under-recoveries, plus
carrying charges, over a 24-month period effective with the first billing
cycle of January 2001. Effective with January 2001 billings, the rider
utilizes projected energy costs filed quarterly by Entergy Mississippi to
develop an energy cost rate. The energy cost rate is redetermined each
calendar quarter and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-
recovery or under-recovery of the energy cost as of the second quarter
preceding the redetermination.

Entergy New Orleans

Retail Rate Proceedings

 Entergy New Orleans' material retail rate proceedings that were
resolved during the past year, are currently pending, or affect current
year results are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Recovery of Grand Gulf 1 Costs

 Under Entergy New Orleans' various rate settlements with the Council
in 1986, 1988, and 1991, Entergy New Orleans agreed to absorb and not
recover from ratepayers a total of 96.2 million of its Grand Gulf 1
costs. Entergy New Orleans was permitted to implement annual rate
increases in decreasing amounts each year through 1995, and to defer
certain costs and related carrying charges for recovery on a schedule
extending from 1991 through 2001. As of December 31, 2000, the
uncollected balance of Entergy New Orleans' deferred costs was 11
million.

Fuel Recovery

 Entergy New Orleans' electric rate schedules include a fuel
adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel in the second
prior month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense
arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred
with fuel cost revenues billed to customers. The adjustment also
includes the difference between non-fuel Grand Gulf 1 costs paid by
Entergy New Orleans and the estimate of such costs, which are included in
base rates, as provided in Entergy New Orleans' Grand Gulf 1 rate
settlements. Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules include an
adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted
by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel
adjustment clause, in addition to carrying charges. The Council is
currently studying Entergy New Orleans' fuel adjustment methodologies,
with the intention of considering means of mitigating the effect on
ratepayers of sudden increases in fuel costs. The resolution commencing
the study notes that the Council does not intend to deny Entergy New
Orleans full recovery of its prudently incurred fuel and purchased power
costs.

Regulation

Federal Regulation (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and
System Energy)

PUHCA

 Entergy Corporation and its various direct and indirect subsidiaries
are subject to the broad regulatory provisions of PUHCA, with the
exception of its EWG and FUCO subsidiaries. Except with respect to
investments in EWGs and FUCOs, the principal regulatory provisions of
PUHCA:

 o limit the operations of a registered holding company system to a
 single, integrated public utility system, plus certain ancillary and
 related systems and businesses;
 o regulate certain transactions among affiliates within a holding
 company system;
 o govern the issuance, acquisition, and disposition of securities and
 assets by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries;
 o limit the entry by registered holding companies and their
 subsidiaries into businesses other than electric and/or gas utility
 businesses; and
 o require SEC approval for certain utility mergers and acquisitions,
 including Entergy's proposed merger with FPL Group.

 Entergy Corporation and other electric utility holding companies
have supported legislation in the United States Congress to repeal PUHCA
and transfer certain aspects of the oversight of public utility holding
companies from the SEC to FERC. Entergy believes that PUHCA inhibits its
ability to compete in the evolving electric energy marketplace and
largely duplicates the oversight activities otherwise performed by FERC
and other federal regulators and by state and local regulators. In June
1995, the SEC adopted a report proposing options for the repeal or
significant modification of PUHCA, but the U.S. Congress has not passed
legislation pursuant to this report.

Federal Power Act

 The domestic utility companies, System Energy, Entergy Power, and
EPMC are subject to the Federal Power Act as administered by FERC and the
DOE. The Federal Power Act provides for regulatory jurisdiction over the
transmission and wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate
commerce, licensing of certain hydroelectric projects and certain other
activities, including accounting policies and practices. Such regulation
includes jurisdiction over the rates charged by System Energy for Grand
Gulf 1 capacity and energy provided to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

 Entergy Arkansas holds a FERC license for two hydroelectric projects
totaling 70 MW of capacity that was renewed on July 2, 1980 and expires
on February 28, 2003. In December 2000, Entergy Arkansas filed a license
extension application with FERC for these two facilities.

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry (Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

Regulation of Nuclear Power

 Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization
Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the
NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority
to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is
achieved. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and
System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend, Waterford
3, and Grand Gulf 1, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the
licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of
the NRC. Additionally, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
is subject to the NRC's jurisdiction as the owner and operator of
Pilgrim, Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick. Revised safety requirements
promulgated by the NRC have, in the past, necessitated substantial
capital expenditures at these nuclear plants, and additional expenditures
could be required in the future.

 The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the
cost and long-term availability of sites for disposal of spent nuclear
fuel and other radioactive waste, nuclear plant operations, the
technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end
of their licensed lives, and requirements relating to nuclear insurance.
These matters are briefly discussed below.

Regulation of Spent Fuel and Other High-Level Radioactive Waste

 Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for
a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of,
all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated
by domestic nuclear power reactors. However, the DOE has not yet
identified a permanent storage repository and, as a result, future
expenditures may be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at
Entergy's nuclear plant sites. Information concerning spent fuel
disposal contracts with the DOE, current on-site storage capacity, and
costs of providing additional on-site storage is presented in Note 9 to
the financial statements.

Regulation of Low-Level Radioactive Waste

 The availability and cost of disposal facilities for low-level
radioactive waste resulting from normal nuclear plant operations are
subject to a number of uncertainties. Under the Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, each state is responsible for
disposal of waste originating in that state, but states may participate
in regional compacts to fulfill their responsibilities jointly. Arkansas
and Louisiana participate in the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Compact (Central States Compact), and Mississippi participates in
the Southeast Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact (Southeast Compact).
Both the Central States Compact and the Southeast Compact waste facility
development projects are on hold and further development efforts are
unknown at this time. Neither Massachusetts, where Pilgrim is located,
nor New York, where Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick are located,
participates in any regional compact and efforts to fulfill their
responsibilities have been minimal. Two licensed disposal sites are
currently operating in the United States, but only one site, the Barnwell
Disposal Facility (Barnwell) located in South Carolina, is open to out-of-
region generators. The availability of Barnwell provides only a
temporary solution for Entergy's low-level radioactive waste storage and
does not alleviate the need to develop new disposal capacity. In June
2000, the governor of South Carolina signed legislation forming a new low-
level waste compact with the states of Connecticut and New Jersey. The
compact will start restricting acceptance of out-of-region waste in 2002
and totally ban out-of-region waste by 2008.

 The Southeast Compact has filed sanctions against the host state of
North Carolina and the process is currently on hold pending resolution of
the sanctions action by the compact. In December 1998, the host state
for the Central States Compact, Nebraska, denied the compact's license
application. In December 1998, Entergy and two other utilities in the
Central States Compact filed a lawsuit against the state of Nebraska
seeking damages resulting from delays and a faulty license review
process. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Gulf States,
along with other waste generators, fund the development costs for new
disposal facilities relating to the Central States Compact. Development
costs to be incurred in the future are difficult to predict. The current
schedules for the site development in both the Central States Compact and
the Southeast Compact are undetermined at this time. Until long-term
disposal facilities are established, Entergy will seek continued access
to existing facilities. If such access is unavailable, Entergy will
store low-level waste at its nuclear plant sites.

Regulation of Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy are recovering through electric rates the estimated
decommissioning costs for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf 1,
respectively. These amounts are deposited in trust funds which, together
with the related earnings, can only be used for future decommissioning
costs. Estimated decommissioning costs are periodically reviewed and
updated to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and
technology. Applications are periodically made to appropriate regulatory
authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected
decommissioning costs. In conjunction with the Pilgrim acquisition,
Entergy received Pilgrim's decommissioning trust fund. Based on cost
estimates provided by an outside consultant, Entergy believes that
Pilgrim's decommissioning fund will be adequate to cover future
decommissioning costs for the plant without any additional deposits to
the trust. Subject to decommissioning service agreements between Entergy
and NYPA, NYPA retains the decommissioning liability and trusts relating
to Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick up to a specified amount. Entergy
believes that the amounts that will be available from the trusts will be
sufficient to cover the future decommissioning costs of Indian Point 3
and FitzPatrick without any additional contributions to the trusts.
Additional information with respect to decommissioning costs for ANO,
River Bend, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf 1, Pilgrim, Indian Point 3, and
FitzPatrick is found in Note 9 to the financial statements.

 The EPAct requires all electric utilities (including Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) that
purchased uranium enrichment services from the DOE to contribute up to a
total of 150 million annually over approximately 15 years (adjusted for
inflation, up to a total of 2.25 billion) for decontamination and
decommissioning of enrichment facilities. In accordance with the EPAct,
contributions to decontamination and decommissioning funds are recovered
through rates in the same manner as other fuel costs. The estimated
annual contributions by Entergy for decontamination and decommissioning
fees are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.

Nuclear Insurance

 The Price-Anderson Act limits public liability for a single nuclear
incident to approximately 9.5 billion. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business have protection with respect to this liability
through a combination of private insurance and an industry assessment
program, as well as insurance for property damage, costs of replacement
power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units. Insurance
applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy is discussed in Note 9 to
the financial statements.

Nuclear Operations

General (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States,
Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

 Entergy Operations operates ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand
Gulf 1, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy pay
directly or reimburse Entergy Operations at cost for its operation of the
nuclear units. Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business is the
operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick.

ANO Matters (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Arkansas)

 Cracks in steam generator tubes at ANO 2 were discovered and
repaired during an outage in March 1992. Further inspections and repairs
were conducted during subsequent refueling and mid-cycle outages and
turbine modifications were installed in May 1997 to restore most of the
output lost due to steam generator fouling and tube plugging. In October
1996, the Board authorized Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Operations to
fabricate and install replacement steam generators at ANO 2. Entergy
Operations thereafter entered into contracts for the design, fabrication,
and installation of replacement steam generators. In December 1998, the
APSC issued an order finding replacement of the ANO 2 steam generators to
be in the public interest. The steam generators were replaced during a
refueling outage in the second half of 2000. During the next scheduled
outage, an examination of both generators is planned to evaluate their
wear and to meet the requirements of industry guidelines for steam
generator program integrity.

 In February 2000, Entergy Operations applied to the NRC for an
extension of ANO 1's operating license. The current license expires in
2014, and, if granted, the extension would provide the authority to
continue operating ANO 1 until 2034. Management expects the NRC
consideration process to take two years.

 In December 2000, Entergy Operations applied to the NRC for an
amendment to ANO 2's operating license that would allow for an increase
in the reactor core power rating. If granted, this amendment will allow
ANO 2 to increase its gross electrical output by approximately 90 MW.
Entergy Operations has requested action by the NRC on the amendment by
March 2002, to permit implementation of the uprate following ANO 2's next
scheduled refueling outage.

State Regulation (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans)

General

 Entergy Arkansas is subject to regulation by the APSC, which
includes the authority to:

 o oversee utility service;
 o set rates;
 o determine reasonable and adequate service;
 o require proper accounting;
 o control leasing;
 o control the acquisition or sale of any public utility plant or
 property constituting an operating unit or system;
 o set rates of depreciation;
 o issue certificates of convenience and necessity and certificates of
 environmental compatibility and public need; and
 o regulate the issuance and sale of certain securities.

 Entergy Gulf States is subject to the jurisdiction of the municipal
authorities of a number of incorporated cities in Texas as to retail
rates and service within their boundaries, with appellate jurisdiction
over such matters residing in the PUCT. Entergy Gulf States' Texas
business is also subject to regulation by the PUCT as to:

 o retail rates and service in rural areas;
 o certification of new transmission lines; and
 o extensions of service into new areas.

 Entergy Gulf States' Louisiana electric and gas business and Entergy
Louisiana are subject to regulation by the LPSC as to:

 o utility service;
 o rates and charges;
 o certification of generating facilities;
 o power or capacity purchase contracts; and
 o depreciation, accounting, and other matters.

 Entergy Louisiana is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Council
with respect to such matters within Algiers in Orleans Parish.

 Entergy Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MPSC as to the
following:

 o utility service;
 o service areas;
 o facilities; and
 o retail rates.

 Entergy Mississippi is also subject to regulation by the APSC as to
the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the
Independence Station, which is located in Arkansas.

 Entergy New Orleans is subject to regulation by the Council as to
the following:

 o utility service;
 o rates and charges;
 o standards of service;
 o depreciation, accounting, and issuance and sale of certain
 securities; and
 o other matters.

Franchises

 Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric
service in approximately 304 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas.
These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the
municipalities purchase the utility property. In Arkansas, franchises
are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable upon breach
of the terms of the franchise.

 Entergy Gulf States holds non-exclusive franchises, permits, or
certificates of convenience and necessity to provide electric and gas
service in approximately 55 incorporated municipalities in Louisiana and
to provide electric service in approximately 63 incorporated
municipalities in Texas. Entergy Gulf States typically is granted 50-
year franchises in Texas and 60-year franchises in Louisiana. Entergy
Gulf States' current electric franchises will expire during 2007 - 2036
in Texas and during 2015 - 2046 in Louisiana. The natural gas franchise
in the City of Baton Rouge will expire in 2015. In addition, Entergy
Gulf States holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the
PUCT to provide electric service to areas within 21 counties in eastern
Texas. Retail open access is scheduled to begin in Entergy Gulf States'
Texas service territory on January 1, 2002. Refer to "MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS"
and Note 2 to the financial statements for discussions of the transition
to competition in Texas.

 Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric
service in approximately 116 incorporated Louisiana municipalities. Most
of these franchises have 25-year terms, although six of these
municipalities have granted 60-year franchises. Entergy Louisiana also
supplies electric service in approximately 353 unincorporated
communities, all of which are located in Louisiana parishes in which it
holds non-exclusive franchises.

 Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of
public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas
within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western
Mississippi. Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are
exclusive. Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such
municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of
whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.

 Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of
New Orleans pursuant to city ordinances (except for in Algiers, which is
served by Entergy Louisiana). These ordinances contain a continuing
option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans'
electric and gas utility properties. A resolution to study the
advantages for ratepayers that might result from an acquisition of these
properties has been filed in a committee of the Council. The committee
has deferred consideration of that resolution until May 2001. The full
Council must approve the resolution to commence such a study before it
can become effective.

 The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales.
It has no distribution franchises.

Environmental Regulation

General

 Entergy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by
various domestic and foreign governmental authorities having jurisdiction
over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and
hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management
believes that its affected subsidiaries are in substantial compliance
with environmental regulations currently applicable to their facilities
and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change,
future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Clean Air Legislation

 The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) established the
following three programs that currently or in the future may affect
Entergy's fossil-fueled generation:

 o an acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
 nitrogen oxides (NOx);
 o an ozone nonattainment area program for control of NOx and volatile
 organic compounds; and
 o an operating permits program for administration and enforcement of
 these and other Act programs.

 Under the current acid rain program, Entergy's subsidiaries will not
require additional equipment to control SO2 or NOx. The Act provides SO2
allowances to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions
based upon past emission levels and operating characteristics. Each
allowance is an entitlement to emit one ton of SO2 per year. Under the
Act, utilities are or will be required to possess allowances for SO2
emissions from affected generating units. All Entergy fossil-fueled
generating units are classified as "Phase II" units under the Act and are
subject to SO2 allowance requirements.

 Additional controls were recently implemented at certain Entergy
Gulf States generating units to achieve NOx reductions due to the ozone
non-attainment status of areas served in and around Beaumont and Houston,
Texas. Texas environmental authorities imposed NOx controls on power
plants that had to be in place by November 1999. To date, the cost of
additional control equipment necessary to maintain this compliance is
immaterial. In December 1999 and August 2000, Texas authorities proposed
future control strategies for public comment that would affect the
Beaumont and Houston areas, respectively. The Texas authorities
finalized regulations for the Beaumont area in April 2000. The analogous
Houston area regulations were finalized in December 2000. The final
strategies adopted by the state of Texas will cause Entergy Gulf States
to incur additional costs for NOx controls through 2007. Entergy Gulf
States has conducted studies to estimate the costs that would be incurred
based on the proposed strategies. Pursuant to these studies, Entergy
Gulf States' preliminary estimate is that compliance costs through 2003
in the Beaumont and Houston areas will be 37 million and 26 million
respectively, and that these expenditures will be sufficient for the
entire compliance period through 2007. Entergy commenced projects in
2000 to engineer, procure, and construct needed air pollution control
facilities. Cost estimates will be refined as engineering design
progresses based on the final adopted strategies approved by the EPA.
Entergy believes the future control strategies in the ozone non-
attainment regulations require emission limits that are more restrictive
than those discussed below related to utility restructuring in Texas.

 As part of legislation passed in Texas in June 1999 to restructure
the electric power industry in the state, certain generating units of
Entergy Gulf States will be required to obtain operating permits and meet
new, lower emission limits for NOx. It is expected that Entergy Gulf
States will incur costs through 2003 to meet these new standards. The
Texas portion of these costs and the costs associated with ozone non-
attainment regulations are expected to be recoverable as stranded costs
of environmental cleanup.

Oil Pollution Prevention and Response

 The EPA has issued a proposed rule on oil pollution prevention and
response. This rule could affect Entergy's operation of its
approximately 3,500 transmission and distribution electrical equipment
installations that are potentially subject to this proposed rule. If the
proposed rule is issued in the form expected by the industry, Entergy
will be substantially in compliance with the rule. However, there is a
possibility that the rule could be issued in a form that would require
Entergy to develop site-specific oil spill prevention and control
countermeasure plans for the facilities subject to this rule. In
addition, secondary containment could be required around the equipment in
these facilities. Entergy participates in industry groups involved with
the proposed rule and will be monitoring the development of the proposed
rule. It is expected that the final rule will be issued in the first
half of 2001.

Other Environmental Matters

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA and,
indirectly, the states, to mandate cleanup, or reimbursement of clean-up
costs, by owners or operators of sites from which hazardous substances
may be or have been released. Parties that generated or transported
hazardous substances to these sites are also deemed liable by CERCLA.
CERCLA has been interpreted to impose joint and several liability on
responsible parties. The domestic utility companies have sent waste
materials to various disposal sites over the years. In addition,
environmental laws now regulate certain of the domestic utility
companies' operating procedures and maintenance practices, which
historically were not subject to regulation. Some of Entergy's disposal
sites have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA,
resulting in site clean-up activities. The domestic utility companies
have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective
potential liabilities in such site cleanups and have developed experience
with clean-up costs. The affected domestic utility companies have
established reserves for such environmental clean up and restoration
activities.

Entergy Arkansas

 Entergy Arkansas entered into a Consent Administrative Order with
the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) in which it
agreed to conduct initial stabilization associated with contamination at
the Utilities Services, Inc. Superfund site located near Rison, Arkansas.
This site was never owned nor operated by any Entergy-affiliated company.
This site was found to have soil contaminated by polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and pentachlorophenol (a wood preservative). Containers
and drums that contained PCBs and other hazardous substances were found
at the site. Entergy Arkansas worked with the ADEQ to identify and
notify other PRPs with respect to this site. Approximately twenty PRPs
have been identified to date. In December 1999, Entergy Arkansas, along
with several other PRPs, met with ADEQ representatives to discuss the
cleanup of the site. The PRPs are being encouraged to undertake a
voluntary cleanup and have begun discussions regarding the sharing of
costs. Entergy Arkansas believes that its ultimate responsibility for
this site will not materially exceed its existing cleanup provision of 5
million. Entergy has sent a letter of intent to the ADEQ to participate
in the site characterization, and Entergy is waiting for a response from
the ADEQ. As of December 31, 2000, Entergy Arkansas had incurred
approximately 400,000 of these costs.

Entergy Gulf States

 Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and
federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States and others for
damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-
related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Gulf States'
premises (see "Other Regulation and Litigation" below).

 In August 1999, Entergy Gulf States received notice from the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) that it is considered to
be a PRP for the Spector Salvage Yard in Orange, Texas. The Spector
Salvage site operated from approximately 1944 until 1971. In addition to
general salvage, the facility functioned as a repository for military
surplus equipment and supplies purchased from military, industrial, and
chemical facilities. Soil samples from the site indicate the presence of
heavy metals and various organics, including PCBs. The TNRCC requested
of all PRPs a submission of a good faith offer to fully fund or conduct a
remedial investigation. Entergy Gulf States believes that there is
insufficient basis for including the company as a PRP. If additional
evidence that the company is a PRP were discovered, Entergy Gulf States
would re-evaluate its position. Based on the size of the site, Entergy
Gulf States expects that its future expenditures for investigation and
clean-up should not exceed 250,000.

 Entergy Gulf States is currently involved in a remedial
investigation of the Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. A manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have
operated at this site from approximately 1916 to 1931. Coal tar, a by-
product of the distillation process employed at MGPs, was apparently
routed to a portion of the property for disposal. The same area has also
been used as a landfill. In 1999, Entergy Gulf States signed a second
Administrative Consent Order with the EPA to perform removal action at
the site. Entergy Gulf States believes that its ultimate responsibility
for this site will not materially exceed its existing clean-up provision
of 16.8 million.

 Entergy Gulf States is currently involved in the second phase of an
investigation of contamination of an MGP site, known as the Old Jennings
Ice Plant, located in Jennings, Louisiana. The MGP is believed to have
operated from approximately 1909 to 1926. The site is currently used for
an electrical substation and storage of transmission and distribution
equipment. In July 1996, a petroleum-like substance was discovered on
the surface soil, and notification was made to the LDEQ. The LDEQ was
aware of this site based upon a survey performed by an environmental
consultant for the EPA. Entergy Gulf States obtained the services of an
environmental consultant to collect core samples and to perform a search
of historical records to determine what activities occurred at Jennings.
Results of the core sampling, which found limited amounts of
contamination on-site, were submitted to the LDEQ. A plan to determine a
cost-effective remediation strategy will be developed and submitted to
the LDEQ for review in 2001. Entergy does not expect that its ultimate
financial responsibility with respect to this site will be material. The
amount of its existing provision for cleanup is 250,000.

 In 1994, Entergy Gulf States performed a site assessment in
conjunction with a construction project at the Louisiana Station
Generating Plant (Louisiana Station). In 1995, a further assessment
confirmed subsurface soil and groundwater impact to three areas on the
plant site. After further evaluation, a notification was made to the
LDEQ. Remediation of Louisiana Station is expected to continue through
2001. The remediation cost incurred through December 31, 2000 for this
site was 6.2 million. Future costs are not expected to exceed the
existing provision of 1.3 million.

Entergy New Orleans

 Entergy New Orleans is planning a new substation on a parcel of land
located adjacent to an existing substation, which is in close proximity
to the former Market Street power plant. During pre-construction
activities in January 2000, significant levels of lead were discovered in
the soil at this site. Entergy New Orleans notified the LDEQ of the
contamination. The contamination at this site was addressed using the
LDEQ Risk/Evaluation Corrective Action Plan. The work has been completed
and the final closure report is scheduled to be submitted in the first
quarter of 2001. The cost of this remediation was approximately 1
million.

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans

 The Southern Transformer shop located in New Orleans has served both
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. This transformer shop is now
being closed and an environmental assessment is being performed to
determine what remediation may be necessary. Based on preliminary
findings, Entergy Louisiana has reserved 150,000 for this project.

 From 1992 to 1994, Entergy Louisiana performed a site assessment and
remedial activities at a retired power plant known as the Thibodaux
municipal site, previously owned and operated by a Louisiana
municipality. Entergy Louisiana purchased the power plant at this site
as part of the acquisition of municipal electric systems. The site
assessment indicated some subsurface contamination from fuel oil.
Remediation of the Thibodaux site is expected to continue through 2001.
The cost incurred through December 31, 2000 for the Thibodaux site was
approximately 580,000. Future costs are not expected to exceed the
existing provision of 240,000.

 During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules for solid waste regulation,
including regulation of wastewater impoundments. Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy New Orleans have determined that certain of their power plant
wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and chose to
upgrade or close them. Completion of this work is pending LDEQ approval.
LDEQ has issued notices of deficiencies for certain of these sites. As a
result, a remaining recorded liability in the amount of 5.8 million for
Entergy Louisiana and 0.5 million for Entergy New Orleans existed at
December 31, 2000 for wastewater upgrades and closures. Management of
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans believes these reserves are
adequate based on current estimates.

Other Regulation and Litigation

Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States Merger

 Several parties, including Entergy Services, appealed FERC's
approval of the merger between Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf
States to the D.C. Circuit. Entergy Services sought review of FERC's
deletion of a 40 cap on the amount of fuel savings Entergy Gulf States
may be required to transfer to other domestic utility companies under a
tracking mechanism designed to protect the other companies from certain
unexpected increases in fuel costs. The other parties sought to overturn
FERC's decisions on various grounds, including issues as to whether FERC
appropriately conditioned the merger to protect various interested
parties from alleged harm and FERC's reliance on Entergy's transmission
tariff to mitigate any potential anti-competitive impacts of the merger.
Management cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding.

Employment Litigation (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans)

 Entergy Corporation and the domestic utility companies are
defendants in numerous lawsuits that have been filed by former employees
alleging that they were wrongfully terminated and/or discriminated
against on the basis of age, race, and/or sex. Entergy Corporation and
the domestic utility companies are vigorously defending these suits and
deny any liability to the plaintiffs. However, no assurance can be given
as to the outcome of these cases, and at this time management cannot
estimate the total amount of damages sought.

Asbestos and Hazardous Waste Suits (Entergy Gulf States)

 Plaintiffs have filed numerous lawsuits in state and federal courts
in Texas and Louisiana seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States as well as
numerous other defendants for damages caused to the plaintiffs or others
by the alleged exposure to hazardous waste and asbestos on the
defendants' premises. The plaintiffs in some suits are also suing
Entergy Gulf States and all other defendants on a conspiracy claim. It
will not be known until discovery is complete how many of the plaintiffs
in any of the foregoing cases actually worked on Entergy Gulf States'
premises, nor can management, at this time, estimate the total amount of
damages sought. Entergy Gulf States believes that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to
its financial position or results of operations.

Ratepayer Lawsuits (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans)

Entergy Louisiana Fuel Clause Lawsuit

 In May 1998, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Power, and Entergy Louisiana in state court in
Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy Louisiana ratepayers.
The plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged injuries arising from
alleged violations by the defendants of Louisiana's antitrust laws in
connection with the costs included in fuel filings with the LPSC and
passed through to ratepayers. Among other things, the plaintiffs allege
that Entergy Louisiana improperly introduced certain costs into the
calculation of the fuel charges, including high-cost electricity
imprudently purchased from its affiliates and high-cost gas imprudently
purchased from independent third party suppliers. In addition,
plaintiffs seek to recover interest and attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs also
requested that the LPSC initiate a review of Entergy Louisiana's monthly
fuel adjustment charge filings and force restitution to ratepayers of all
costs that the plaintiffs allege were improperly included in those fuel
adjustment filings. A few parties have intervened in the LPSC
proceeding. In direct testimony, plaintiffs purport to quantify many of
their claims for the period 1989 through 1998 in an amount totaling
 544 million, plus interest.

 Entergy Louisiana has reached an agreement in principle with the
LPSC staff for the settlement of the matter before the LPSC and has
executed a definitive agreement with the plaintiffs for the settlement of
the matter before the LPSC and the state court. The LPSC approved the
settlement agreement following a fairness hearing before an ALJ in
November 2000. Plaintiffs have sought class certification and approval
of the settlement by the state court, and a hearing on those issues is
scheduled for April 2001.

 Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana
agrees to refund to customers approximately 72 million to resolve all
claims arising out of or relating to Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment
clause filings from January 1, 1975 through December 31, 1999, except
with respect to purchased power and associated costs included in the fuel
adjustment clause filings for the period May 1 through September 30,
1999. Entergy Louisiana previously provided reserves for the refund.
Under the terms of the settlement, Entergy Louisiana also consents to
future fuel cost recovery under a long-term gas contract based on a
formula that would likely result in an under-recovery of actual costs
under that contract for the remainder of its term, which runs through
2013. The future under-recovery cannot be precisely estimated at this
time because it will depend upon factors that are not certain, such as
the price of gas and the amount of gas purchased under the long-term
contract. In recent years, Entergy Louisiana has made purchases under
that contract totaling from 91 million to 121 million annually. Had
the proposed settlement terms been applicable to such purchases, the
under-recoveries would have ranged from 4 million to 9 million per
year.

Vidalia Project Sub-Docket

 Two of the intervenors in the proceeding discussed above, Marathon
Oil Company and Louisiana Energy Users Group, requested that the LPSC
review the prudence of a contract entered into by Entergy Louisiana to
purchase energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the
Vidalia project through the year 2031. Note 9 to the financial
statements contains further discussions of the obligations related to the
Vidalia project. By orders entered by the LPSC in 1985 and 1990, the
LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana's entry into the Vidalia contract and
Entergy Louisiana's right to recover, through the fuel adjustment clause,
the costs of power purchased thereunder. Additionally, the wholesale
electric rates under the Vidalia power purchase contract were filed at
FERC. In December 1999, the LPSC instituted a review of the following
issues relating to the Vidalia project: (i) the LPSC's jurisdiction over
the Vidalia project; (ii) Entergy Louisiana's management of the Vidalia
contract, including opportunities to restructure or otherwise reform the
contract; (iii) the appropriateness of Entergy Louisiana's recovery of
100 of the Vidalia contract costs from ratepayers; (iv) the
appropriateness of the fuel adjustment clause as the method for
recovering all or part of the Vidalia contract costs; (v) the appropriate
regulatory treatment of the Vidalia contract in the event the LPSC
approves implementation of retail competition; and (vi) Entergy
Louisiana's communication of pertinent information to the LPSC regarding
the Vidalia project and contract. Based on its review, the LPSC will
determine whether it should disallow any of the costs of the Vidalia
project included in the fuel adjustment clause.

 In March 2000, Entergy Louisiana filed testimony in this sub-docket
asserting that the prudence of the Vidalia contract already has been
approved by final orders of the LPSC and that recovery of all amounts
paid by Entergy Louisiana related to the Vidalia project pursuant to the
FERC-filed rate is appropriate. Direct testimony was filed by intervenor
Marathon Oil Company in May 2000 and by the LPSC staff and intervenor
Louisiana Energy Users Group in July 2000. In its testimony the LPSC
staff alleges that Entergy Louisiana was imprudent for not declaring to
the LPSC that the Vidalia project had become uneconomic and not
threatening to block the Vidalia project's owners' July 30, 1990 request
that the LPSC clarify the LPSC's 1985 order (approving the Entergy
Louisiana/Vidalia project power purchase agreement), unless the Vidalia
project's owners' shared with Entergy Louisiana's ratepayers some portion
of what the LPSC staff quantifies as approximately 90 million of tax
consequences available to the project. The LPSC staff's testimony does
not quantify how much of the potential tax savings Entergy Louisiana
should have demanded in exchange for not attempting to block the Vidalia
project's owners' request for clarification; however, that testimony does
suggest various alternatives by which some portion of the 90 million,
perhaps 45 million plus interest since 1990, could be returned to the
ratepayers. The direct testimony of the intervenor Louisiana Energy
Users Group alleges that Entergy Louisiana was imprudent for not
attempting to block the Vidalia project's owners' July 30, 1990 request
that the LPSC clarify the LPSC's 1985 order approving the Entergy
Louisiana/Vidalia project power purchase agreement; however, that
intervenor does not quantify the amount of damage alleged to have been
caused by this alleged imprudence. The direct testimony of the intervenor
Marathon Oil Company alleges with respect to Entergy Louisiana that
imprudent Vidalia project costs should be disallowed and that Entergy
Louisiana's customers should not be charged 100 of the Vidalia costs.
It is anticipated that hearings in this sub-docket concerning the Vidalia
contract will begin in April 2001.

Entergy New Orleans Fuel Clause Lawsuit

 In April 1999, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against
Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, and Entergy
Power in state court in Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all
Entergy New Orleans ratepayers. The plaintiffs seek treble damages for
alleged injuries arising from the defendants' alleged violations of
Louisiana's antitrust laws in connection with certain costs passed on to
ratepayers in Entergy New Orleans' fuel adjustment filings with the
Council. In particular, plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans
improperly included certain costs in the calculation of fuel charges and
that Entergy New Orleans imprudently purchased high-cost fuel from other
Entergy affiliates. Plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans and the
other defendant Entergy companies conspired to make these purchases to
the detriment of Entergy New Orleans' ratepayers and to the benefit of
Entergy's shareholders, in violation of Louisiana's antitrust laws.
Plaintiffs also seek to recover interest and attorney's fees. Exceptions
to the plaintiffs' allegations were filed by Entergy, asserting, among
other things, that jurisdiction over these issues rests with the Council
and FERC. If necessary, at the appropriate time, Entergy will also raise
its defenses to the antitrust claims. At present, the suit in state
court is stayed by stipulation of the parties.

 Plaintiffs also filed this complaint with the Council in order to
initiate a review by the Council of the plantiffs' allegations and to
force restitution to ratepayers of all costs they allege were improperly
and imprudently included in the fuel adjustment filings. Discovery has
begun in the proceedings before the Council. In April 2000, testimony
was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in this proceeding. The testimony
asserts, among other things, that Entergy New Orleans and other
defendants have engaged in fuel procurement and power purchasing
practices that could have resulted in New Orleans customers being
overcharged by more than 59 million over a period of years. The
testimony also challenges the implementation of the recovery methodology.
However, it is not clear precisely what periods and damages are being
alleged. Entergy intends to defend this matter vigorously, both in court
and before the Council. The ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and the
Council proceeding cannot be predicted at this time. Hearings are
expected to begin in October 2001.

Entergy New Orleans Rate of Return Lawsuit

 In April 1998, a group of residential and business ratepayers filed
a complaint against Entergy New Orleans in state court in Orleans Parish
purportedly on behalf of all ratepayers in New Orleans. The plaintiffs
allege that Entergy New Orleans overcharged ratepayers by at least 300
million since 1975 in violation of limits on Entergy New Orleans' rate of
return that the plaintiffs allege were established by ordinances passed
by the Council in 1922. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, (i) a
declaratory judgment that such franchise ordinances have been violated;
and (ii) a remand to the Council for the establishment of the amount of
overcharges plus interest. Entergy New Orleans believes the lawsuit is
without merit. Entergy New Orleans has charged only those rates
authorized by the Council in accordance with applicable law. In May
2000, a court of appeal granted Entergy New Orleans' exception to
jurisdiction in the case and dismissed the proceeding. The Louisiana
Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's request for a writ of certiorari.
The plaintiffs then commenced a similar proceeding before the Council.
Management cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding before the
Council.

Entergy Louisiana Formula Ratemaking Plan Lawsuit

 In May 1998, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy
Louisiana in state court in East Baton Rouge Parish purportedly on behalf
of all Entergy Louisiana ratepayers. The plaintiffs allege that the
formula ratemaking plan authorized by the LPSC has allowed Entergy
Louisiana to earn amounts in excess of a fair return. The plaintiffs
seek, among other things, (i) a declaratory judgment that the formula
ratemaking plan is an improper ratemaking practice; and (ii) a refund of
the amounts allegedly charged in excess of proper ratemaking practices.
Entergy Louisiana believes the lawsuit is without merit and is vigorously
defending itself. At this time, management cannot determine the amount
of damages being sought.

July 1999 Power Outages Lawsuit

 In February 2000, a lawsuit was commenced in state court in Orleans
Parish, Louisiana, against Entergy, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans relating to power outages that
occurred in July 1999. The plaintiff, who purports to represent a class
of similarly situated persons, claims unspecified damages as a result of
these outages, which the plaintiff claims were the result of negligence
on the part of the Entergy defendants. Plaintiffs have instituted a
similar proceeding before the LPSC. The defendants will vigorously
contest the plaintiff's allegations, which they believe do not support
any liability to the plaintiff for damages. At this time, management
cannot determine the amount of damages being sought.

Franchise Fee Litigation (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In September 1998, the City of Nederland filed a petition against
Entergy Gulf States and Entergy Services in state court in Jefferson
County, Texas, purportedly on behalf of all Texas municipalities that
have ordinances or agreements with Entergy Gulf States. The lawsuit
alleges that Entergy Gulf States has been underpaying its franchise fees
due to failure to properly calculate its gross receipts. The plaintiff
seeks a judgment for the allegedly underpaid fees and punitive damages.
Entergy Gulf States believes the lawsuit is without merit and is
vigorously defending itself. The trial in this matter is scheduled to
begin in December 2001. At this time, management cannot determine the
amount of damages being sought.

Fiber Optic Cable Litigation (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf
States)

 In May 1998, a group of property owners filed a petition against
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Services, and ETHC in
state court in Jefferson County, Texas purportedly on behalf of all
property owners throughout the Entergy service area who have conveyed
easements to the defendants. The lawsuit alleged that Entergy installed
fiber optic cable across their property without obtaining appropriate
easements. The plaintiffs sought actual damages for the use of the land
and a share of the profits made through use of the fiber optic cables
and punitive damages. The state court petition was dismissed, and the
plaintiffs have commenced an identical lawsuit in the United States
District Court in Beaumont, Texas. Entergy is vigorously defending
itself in the lawsuit and believes that any damages suffered by the
plaintiff landowners are negligible and that there is no basis for the
claim seeking a share of profits. Recently both sides have filed
motions for summary judgment. At this time, management cannot determine
the amount of damages being sought.

Franchise Service Area Litigation (Entergy Gulf States)

 In early 1998, Beaumont Power and Light Company (BP&L)
unsuccessfully sought a franchise to provide electric service in the City
of Beaumont, Texas, where Entergy Gulf States already holds a franchise.
In November 1998, BP&L filed a request before the PUCT to obtain a
certificate of convenience and necessity (CCN) for those portions of
Jefferson County outside the boundaries of any municipality for which
Entergy Gulf States provides retail electric service. BP&L's application
contemplates using Entergy Gulf States' facilities in their provision of
service. In Texas, utilities are required to obtain a CCN prior to
providing retail electric service. Jefferson County is currently singly
certificated to Entergy Gulf States. If BP&L's application is granted,
BP&L would be able to provide retail service to Entergy Gulf States'
customers in the area for which the certificate would apply. BP&L has
amended its application to add a request for a CCN to provide retail
electric service within the City of Beaumont. The amended application
acknowledges that the Texas electric utility restructuring law requires
BP&L to use its own facilities to connect to its customers if it is
granted a CCN. In April 2000, the ALJ recommended denial of BP&L's
application. In May 2000, the PUCT voted to remand the proceeding back
to the ALJ to allow BP&L to provide further evidence. A pre-hearing
conference has been scheduled for May 2001.

Hindusthan Development Corporation, Ltd. (Entergy Corporation)

 In January 1999, Hindusthan Development Corporation (HDC) commenced
an arbitration proceeding in India against Entergy Power Asia Ltd.
(EPAL), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation. The
arbitration is progressing under rules that have been adopted in both
India and the United States. HDC alleges that EPAL did not fulfill its
obligations under a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) to develop a 350 MW
cogeneration plant to be built in Bina, India. HDC also alleges that
EPAL wrongfully withdrew as lead developer. Entergy's management
believes that HDC's allegations are without merit, and that each party to
the JDA had an absolute right of withdrawal. HDC is seeking unspecified
damages of 1.1 billion. EPAL is vigorously defending itself in the
arbitration proceeding.

Ice Storm Litigation (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In January 1997, a group of Entergy Gulf States customers in Texas
filed a lawsuit against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States, and
other Entergy subsidiaries in state court in Jefferson County, Texas
purportedly on behalf of all Entergy Gulf States customers in Texas who
sustained outages in a January 1997 ice storm. The lawsuit alleges that
Entergy failed to properly maintain its electrical distribution system
and respond to the ice storm. The district court certified the class in
April 1999. In March 2000, an appellate court affirmed the district
court's decision to certify the class. In response to Entergy's motion
for rehearing, the appellate court reversed the district court, denied
class certification, and remanded the case to the district court for
proceedings consistent with its ruling. This ruling reduces Entergy's
exposure in the lawsuit to an immaterial level. Entergy believes that
the lawsuit is without merit, and will vigorously defend itself against
the individual named plaintiffs.

Litigation Environment (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
and System Energy)

 The four states in which the domestic utility companies operate, in
particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually
litigious environments. Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including
punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and
business tort cases. Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest
litigation threatened or filed against it, but the litigation environment
in these states poses a significant business risk.

EARNINGS RATIOS OF DOMESTIC UTILITY COMPANIES AND SYSTEM ENERGY

 The domestic utility companies' and System Energy's ratios of

 (1) "Owned and Leased Capability" is the dependable load carrying
 capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based
 on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was
 designed to utilize.

 Entergy's domestic utility business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations, with the peak period occurring in the summer months. The
2000 peak demand of 22,052 MW occurred on August 30, 2000, which was an
all-time high for the Entergy system. Entergy's load and capacity
projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for
additional generating capacity and interconnections in light of the
availability of power, the location of new loads, and maximum economy to
Entergy. Domestically, based on load and capability projections and bulk
power availability, Entergy's domestic utility companies expect to meet
the need for new generation resources by means other than construction of
new base load generating capacity. Entergy's domestic utility companies
expect to meet future capacity needs by, among other things, purchasing
in the wholesale power market, including plans to contract for up to
3,000 MW of purchased power to meet the expected needs of the domestic
utility companies in the summer of 2001. Entergy also reactivated
several units in 1999 and 2000 that were in extended reserve shutdown to
assist in serving customers during periods of peak demand.

 Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and
other power resources are shared among the domestic utility companies.
The System Agreement provides, among other things, that parties having
generating reserves greater than their load requirements (long companies)
shall receive payments from those parties having deficiencies in
generating reserves (short companies). Such payments are at amounts
sufficient to cover certain of the long companies' costs, including
operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on
preferred and preference stock, and a fair rate of return on common
equity investment. Under the System Agreement, these charges are based
on costs associated with the long companies' steam electric generating
units fueled by oil or gas. In addition, for all energy exchanged among
the domestic utility companies under the System Agreement, the short
companies are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating
such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs. FERC
proceedings relating to proposed amendments to the System Agreement are
discussed more thoroughly in "RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION - Rate Matters
- - Wholesale Rate Matters - System Agreement," above.

Global Power Development Business

 Entergy Power owns 665 MW of fossil-fueled capacity at the Ritchie 2
and Independence plants. In addition, Entergy's global power development
business has completed construction of two combined cycle gas turbine
merchant power plants in the UK. Saltend, a 1,200 MW plant located in
northeast England, provides up to 120 tons/hr of steam and 100 MW of
power to BP Chemical's nearby complex with the remaining electricity sold
into the UK national power pool. Commercial operation commenced in
November 2000. The second plant, an 800 MW facility known as Damhead
Creek, is located in southeast England. Commercial operation commenced
in 2001.

 Entergy's global power development business has begun construction
of the Warren Power Project, a 300 MW combined-cycle gas turbine merchant
power plant in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The construction costs are
expected to be approximately 150 million. Management expects that
commercial operation of the plant will begin in the summer of 2001.

Domestic Non-Utility Nuclear Business

 In November 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
purchased NYPA's 825 MW James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant located
near Oswego, New York and NYPA's 980 MW Indian Point 3 nuclear power
plant located in Westchester County, New York. Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business also owns the 670 MW Pilgrim Nuclear Station in
Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Interconnections

 The electric generating facilities of Entergy's domestic utility
companies consist principally of steam-electric production facilities.
These generating units are interconnected by a transmission system
operating at various voltages up to 500 KV. With the exception of a
small portion of Entergy Mississippi's capacity, operating facilities or
interests therein generally are owned or leased by the domestic utility
company serving the area in which the generating facilities are located.
All of these generating facilities are centrally dispatched and operated.

 Entergy's domestic utility companies are interconnected with many
neighboring utilities. In addition, the domestic utility companies are
members of the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). The
primary purpose of SERC is to ensure the reliability and adequacy of the
electric bulk power supply in the southeast region of the United States.
SERC is a member of the North American Electric Reliability Council.

 The electric generating facilities of Entergy's domestic non-utility
nuclear business consist of the Pilgrim nuclear production facility, the
James A. FitzPatrick nuclear production facility, and the Indian Point 3
nuclear production facility. The Pilgrim nuclear production facility has
firm total output power purchase agreements with Boston Edison and other
utilities that expire at the end of 2004. The James A. FitzPatrick
nuclear production facility has two long-term power purchase agreements
with NYPA, one expiring at the end of 2003 and the other expiring at the
end of 2004. The Indian Point 3 nuclear production facility has a long-
term power purchase agreement with NYPA that expires at the end of 2004.

 The Pilgrim plant is dispatched as a part of the New England Power
Pool (NEPOOL). The primary purpose of NEPOOL is to direct the operations
of the major generation and transmission facilities in the New England
region. The James A. FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants are
dispatched by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The
primary purpose of NYISO is to direct the operations of the major
generation and transmission facilities in New York State.

Gas Property

 As of December 31, 2000, Entergy New Orleans distributed and
transported natural gas for distribution solely within the limits of the
City of New Orleans through a total of 1,459 miles of gas distribution
mains and 41 miles of gas transmission pipelines.

 As of December 31, 2000, the gas properties of Entergy Gulf States,
which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material
to Entergy Gulf States' financial position.

Titles

 The generating stations and major transmission substations of
Entergy's public utility companies are generally located on properties
owned in fee simple. The greater portion of the transmission and
distribution lines of the domestic utility companies have been
constructed on property of private owners pursuant to easements or on
public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate franchises. The
rights of each company in the property on which its utility facilities
are located are considered by such company to be adequate for use in the
conduct of its business. Minor defects and irregularities customarily
found in properties of like size and character may exist, but such
defects and irregularities do not, in the opinion of management,
materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby. The
domestic utility companies generally have the right of eminent domain,
whereby they may, if necessary, perfect or secure titles to, or easements
or servitudes on, privately held lands used in or reasonably necessary
for their utility operations.

 Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing the first mortgage
bonds of such company. The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by
GSG&T, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Gulf States, and is not subject to
the lien of the Entergy Gulf States mortgage securing the first mortgage
bonds of Entergy Gulf States, but is leased to and operated by Entergy
Gulf States. All of the debt outstanding under the original first
mortgages of Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans has been retired
and the original first mortgages were cancelled in 1999 and 1997,
respectively. As a result, the general and refunding mortgages of
Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans now each constitute a first
mortgage lien on substantially all of the respective physical properties
and assets of these two companies.

FUEL SUPPLY

 The sources of generation and average fuel cost per KWH for the
domestic utility companies and System Energy for the years 1998-2000

(b) In addition to the nuclear capacity given above for the following
 companies, the Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity and
 energy from System Energy's interest in Grand Gulf 1 as follows:
 Entergy Arkansas - 36 ; Entergy Louisiana - 14 ; Entergy Mississippi
 - 33 ; and Entergy New Orleans - 17 .

Natural Gas

 The domestic utility companies have long-term firm and short-term
interruptible gas contracts. Long-term firm contracts comprise less than
26 of the domestic utility companies' total requirements but can be
called upon, if necessary, to satisfy a significant percentage of the
domestic utility companies' needs. Short-term contracts and spot-market
purchases satisfy additional gas requirements. Entergy Gulf States has a
transportation service agreement with a gas supplier that provides
flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations by using such
supplier's pipeline and gas storage facility. Entergy's global power
development business has entered into 15-year gas supply contracts at the
project level to supply up to 100 of the gas requirements for the
Saltend and Damhead Creek power plants located in the UK.

 Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage and
pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the
availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand
is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices of other energy
sources. Increased demand combined with decreased supply of natural gas
caused a significant increase in the price of natural gas throughout
2000. Entergy's supplies of natural gas are expected to be adequate in
2001. However, pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies
to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage. To the
extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices
significantly increase, the domestic utility companies will use alternate
fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal and nuclear
generation.

Coal

 Entergy Arkansas has long-term contracts for low-sulfur Wyoming coal
for White Bluff and Independence. These contracts, which expire in 2002
and 2011, respectively, provide for approximately 85 of Entergy
Arkansas' expected annual coal requirements. Additional requirements are
satisfied by spot market purchases. Entergy Gulf States has a contract
for the supply of low-sulfur Wyoming coal for Nelson Unit 6, which should
be sufficient to satisfy its fuel requirements for that unit through 2010
if all price re-openers are accepted. If both parties cannot agree upon
a price, then the contract terminates. Effective April 1, 2000,
Louisiana Generating LLC assumed Cajun's ownership interest in the Big
Cajun 2 generating facilities and operates the plant. The management of
Louisiana Generating LLC has advised Entergy Gulf States that it has
executed coal supply and transportation contracts that should provide an
adequate supply of coal for the operation of Big Cajun 2, Unit 3 for the
foreseeable future.

 Entergy Arkansas has a long-term railroad transportation contract
for the delivery of coal to both White Bluff and Independence. This
contract will expire in the year 2011. Entergy Arkansas has settled its
lawsuit against the railroad that claimed breach of contract by the
railroad and requested termination of the contract.

 Entergy Gulf States has transportation requirements contracts with
railroads to deliver coal to Nelson Unit 6 through December 31, 2004.
Each of the two contracts governs the movement of approximately one-half
of the plant's requirements and the base contract provides flexibility
for shipping up to all of the plant's requirements.

Nuclear Fuel

 The nuclear fuel cycle involves the following:

 o mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate;
 o conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas;
 o enrichment of the hexafluoride gas;
 o fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear
 reactors; and
 o disposal of spent fuel.

 System Fuels is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear
material to be used in fueling Entergy Arkansas', Entergy Louisiana's,
and System Energy's nuclear units. System Fuels also maintains
inventories of such materials during the various stages of processing.
Each of these companies purchases enriched uranium hexafluoride from
System Fuels, but contracts separately for the fabrication of its own
nuclear fuel. The requirements for River Bend are pursuant to contracts
made by Entergy Gulf States. The requirements for Pilgrim, FitzPatrick,
and Indian Point 3 are pursuant to contracts made by Entergy's domestic
non-utility nuclear business. Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company is
responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel
fabrication, for these non-utility nuclear plants.

 Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units
currently have contracts and inventory that provide adequate materials
and services. Existing contracts for uranium concentrate, conversion of
the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride, and enrichment of the uranium
hexafluoride will provide a significant percentage of these materials and
services over the next several years. Additional materials and services
required beyond the coverage of these contracts are expected to be
available at a reasonable cost for the foreseeable future.

 Current fabrication contracts will provide a significant percentage
of these materials and services over the next several years. The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel
or high level waste by the DOE. There is a discussion of spent nuclear
fuel disposal in Note 9 to the financial statements.

 It will be necessary for Entergy to enter into additional
arrangements to acquire nuclear fuel in the future. It is not possible
to predict the ultimate cost of such arrangements.

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related
equipment and services. The lessors finance the acquisition and
ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of
notes. These arrangements are subject to periodic renewal. There is a
discussion of nuclear fuel leases in Note 10 to the financial statements.

Natural Gas Purchased for Resale

 Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its
system is interconnected with three interstate and three intrastate
pipelines. Entergy New Orleans' primary suppliers currently are Enron
North America, Inc., an interstate gas marketer, Bridgeline Gas
Distributors, and Pontchartrain Natural Gas via Louisiana Gas Services.
Entergy New Orleans has a "no-notice" service gas purchase contract with
Enron North America, Inc. which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas
delivery at any point after the agreed gas volume has been met. The
Enron North America, Inc. gas supply is transported to Entergy New
Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Koch Gateway
Pipeline Company (now known as Gulf South Pipeline). This service is
subject to FERC-approved rates. Entergy New Orleans has firm contracts
with its two intrastate suppliers and also makes interruptible spot
market purchases. In recent years, natural gas deliveries to Entergy New
Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related curtailments.
However, Entergy New Orleans experienced no such curtailments in 2000.

 As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate
pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply
could occur if Entergy New Orleans' suppliers failed to perform their
obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South
Pipeline could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of
pipeline system constraints. Based on the current supply of natural gas,
and absent extreme weather-related curtailments, Entergy New Orleans does
not anticipate any interruptions in natural gas deliveries to its
customers.

 Entergy Gulf States purchases natural gas for resale under an
agreement with Mid Louisiana Gas Company. Mid Louisiana Gas Company is
not allowed to discontinue providing gas to Entergy Gulf States without
obtaining FERC approval.

Research

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans are members of the Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI). EPRI conducts a broad range of research in
major technical fields related to the electric utility industry. Entergy
participates in various EPRI projects based on Entergy's needs and
available resources. Entergy and its subsidiaries contributed
approximately 5 million in 2000, 6 million in 1999, and 8 million in
1998 to EPRI and other research programs.

Item 5. Market for Registrants' Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters

Entergy Corporation

 The shares of Entergy Corporation's common stock are listed on the
New York Stock, Chicago Stock, and Pacific Exchanges under the ticker
symbol ETR.

 Entergy Corporation's stock price as of February 28, 2001 was
 38.83. The high and low prices of Entergy Corporation's common stock
for each quarterly period in 2000 and 1999 were as follows:

 2000 1999
 High Low High Low
 (In Dollars)

 Third 38.13 26.94 31.56 28.19
 Fourth 43.88 33.50 30.00 23.88

 Consecutive quarterly cash dividends on common stock were paid to
stockholders of Entergy Corporation in 2000 and 1999. In 2000, dividends
of 0.30 per share were paid in the first three quarters, and dividends
of 0.315 per share were paid in the fourth quarter. Quarterly dividends
of 0.30 per share were paid in 1999.

 As of February 28, 2001, there were 67,226 stockholders of record of
Entergy Corporation.

 Entergy Corporation's future ability to pay dividends is discussed
in Note 8 to the financial statements. In addition to the restrictions
described in Note 8, PUHCA provides that, without approval of the SEC,
the unrestricted, undistributed retained earnings of any Entergy
Corporation subsidiary are not available for distribution to Entergy
Corporation's common stockholders until such earnings are made available
to Entergy Corporation through the declaration of dividends by such
subsidiaries.

Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy

 There is no market for the common stock of Entergy Corporation's
wholly owned subsidiaries. Cash dividends on common stock paid by the
domestic utility companies and System Energy to Entergy Corporation
during 2000 and 1999, were as follows:

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

 Management of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries has prepared
and is responsible for the financial statements and related financial
information included herein. The financial statements are based on
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Financial
information included elsewhere in this report is consistent with the
financial statements.

 To meet their responsibilities with respect to financial
information, management maintains and enforces a system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, on a
cost-effective basis, as to the integrity, objectivity, and reliability
of the financial records, and as to the protection of assets. This
system includes communication through written policies and procedures, an
employee Code of Entegrity, and an organizational structure that provides
for appropriate division of responsibility and the training of personnel.
This system is also tested by a comprehensive internal audit program.

 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, composed solely of
Directors who are not employees of our company, meets with the
independent auditors, management, and internal accountants periodically
to discuss internal accounting controls and auditing and financial
reporting matters. Upon recommendation from the Audit Committee, the
Board of Directors appoints the independent accountants. The Committee
reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the
audit effort. The Committee also meets periodically with the independent
auditors and the chief internal auditor without management, providing
free access to the Committee.

 Independent public accountants provide an objective assessment of
the degree to which management meets its responsibility for fairness of
financial reporting. They regularly evaluate the system of internal
accounting controls and perform such tests and other procedures as they
deem necessary to reach and express an opinion on the fairness of the
financial statements.

 Management believes that these policies and procedures provide
reasonable assurance that its operations are carried out with a high
standard of business conduct.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

Business Combination with FPL Group

 On July 30, 2000, Entergy Corporation and FPL Group entered into a
Merger Agreement providing for a business combination that will result in
the creation of a new company. Each outstanding share of FPL Group common
stock will be converted into one share of the new company's common stock,
and each outstanding share of Entergy Corporation common stock will be
converted into 0.585 of a share of the new company's common stock. It is
expected that FPL Group's shareholders will own approximately 57 of the
common equity of the new company and Entergy's shareholders will own
approximately 43 . The initial board of directors of the new company will
consist of eight directors designated by FPL Group and seven directors
designated by Entergy. The new company will be given a new name that will
be agreed upon between the Boards of Directors of FPL Group and Entergy
prior to the consummation of the Merger. The new company will maintain its
principal corporate offices and headquarters in Juno Beach, Florida, and
will maintain its utility headquarters in New Orleans, Louisiana. The
Merger Agreement generally allows Entergy to continue business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and contains certain
restrictions on Entergy's capital activities, including restrictions on the
issuance of securities, capital expenditures, dispositions, incurrence or
guarantee of indebtedness, and trading or marketing of energy. Entergy
generally will be permitted to take actions pursuant to restructuring
legislation in the domestic utility companies' jurisdictions of operation
and to reorganize its transmission business. Under certain circumstances,
if the Merger Agreement is terminated, a termination fee of 215 million
may be payable by one of the parties. The Merger Agreement may be
terminated if the Merger is not consummated by April 30, 2002, unless
automatically extended until October 30, 2002 under certain circumstances.
Both the FPL Group and Entergy Boards of Directors unanimously approved the
Merger, and the shareholders of Entergy Corporation and FPL Group have
approved the Merger. The Merger is conditioned upon, among other things,
the receipt of required regulatory approvals of various local, state, and
federal regulatory agencies and commissions, including the SEC and FERC.
Entergy has filed for approval of the Merger in all of its state and local
regulatory jurisdictions (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and New
Orleans), and at FERC, the SEC, and the NRC. In their filing with the SEC,
Entergy and FPL Group requested to remain in existence as intermediate
holding companies after the Merger is consummated. The objective of
Entergy and FPL Group is to consummate the Merger by late 2001.

Domestic Transition to Competition

 The electric utility industry for years has been preparing for the
advent of competition in its business. For most electric utilities, the
transition from a regulated monopoly to a competitive business is
challenging and complex. The new electric utility environment presents
opportunities to compete for new customers and creates the risk of loss of
existing customers. It presents risks along with opportunities to enter
into new businesses and to restructure existing businesses.

 For Entergy, the domestic transition to competition is a formidable
undertaking, made uniquely difficult because the domestic utility companies
operate in five retail regulatory jurisdictions and are subject to the
System Agreement, which contemplates the integrated operation of Entergy's
electric generation and transmission assets throughout the retail service
territories. Entergy is striving to achieve consistent paths to competition
in all five retail regulatory jurisdictions. In some cases, however,
actions by one jurisdiction may conflict with actions by another. The
Arkansas and Texas legislatures have enacted laws to bring about electric
utility competition. Entergy is continuing to work with regulatory and
legislative officials in all jurisdictions in designing the rules
surrounding a competitive electricity industry. There can be no assurance
given as to the timing or results of the transition to competition in
Entergy's service territories. Following is a summary of the status of the
transition to competition in the five retail jurisdictions:

State Regulatory and Legislative Activity

Arkansas

 In April 1999, the Arkansas legislature enacted a law providing for
competition in the electric utility industry through retail open access.
With retail open access, generation operations would become a competitive
business, but transmission and distribution operations will continue to be
regulated either by federal or state regulatory commissions. In compliance
with the provisions of the deregulation law, Entergy Arkansas has:

 o filed separate generation, transmission, distribution, and customer
 service rates with the APSC and also filed notice of its intent to
 recover stranded costs. In December 2000, the APSC approved the
 unbundled rates as filed. These rates will become effective six months
 prior to retail open access; and
 o filed a functional, but not corporate, unbundling plan with the APSC.
 The functional unbundling plan initially established separate business
 units for distribution, generation, and a new retail energy service
 provider. The plan contemplates the transfer of transmission assets
 to the Transco discussed herein.

 See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional details
concerning provisions of the retail open access law.

Texas

 In June 1999, the Texas legislature enacted a law providing for
competition in the electric utility industry through retail open access.
With retail open access, generation and a new retail electric provider
operation will be competitive businesses, but transmission and distribution
operations will continue to be regulated. The new retail electric provider
will be the primary point of contact with customers. The provisions of the
new law, among other things:

 o require a rate freeze through December 31, 2001 with rates reduced by
 6 beyond that for residential and small commercial customers of most
 incumbent utilities except Entergy Gulf States, whose rates are exempt
 from the 6 reduction requirement. These rates to residential and
 small commercial customers are known as the "Price to Beat", and they
 may be adjusted periodically after January 1, 2002 for fuel and
 purchased power costs according to PUCT rules; and
 o require utilities to charge the Price to Beat rates through 2004, or
 until 40 of customers in the jurisdiction have chosen an alternative
 supplier, whichever comes first. However, the Price to Beat rates must
 continue to be made available through 2006.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

 Pursuant to the provisions of the retail open access law, Entergy Gulf
States filed a business separation plan with the PUCT in January 2000, and
amended that plan in June and December 2000. The plan provides that, by
January 2002, Entergy Gulf States will be divided into:

 o a Texas distribution company;
 o a Texas transmission company;
 o a Texas generation company;
 o at least two Texas retail electricity providers; and
 o a Louisiana company that will encompass distribution, generation,
 transmission, and retail operations.

The plan also provides that the Louisiana company would retain the
liability for all debt obligations of Entergy Gulf States and that the
property of the Texas companies would be released from the lien of Entergy
Gulf States' mortgage. Except for the Texas retail electric providers, each
of the Texas companies would assume a portion of Entergy Gulf States' debt
obligations, which assumptions would not act to release the Louisiana
company's obligations. Except for the Texas retail electric providers,
each of the Texas companies would also grant a lien on its properties in
favor of the Louisiana company to secure its obligations to the Louisiana
company in respect of the assumed obligations. In addition, under the
plan, Entergy Gulf States will refinance or retire the Texas companies'
portion of existing debt by the end of 2004. In July 2000, the PUCT issued
an interim order to approve the amended business separation plan.
Regulatory approvals from FERC, the SEC, and the LPSC, and final approval
from the PUCT will be required before the business separation plan can be
implemented. Remaining business separation issues in Texas subsequent to
the July 2000 interim order will be addressed in the cost unbundling
proceeding before the PUCT.

 The LPSC has opened a docket to identify the changes in corporate
structure of Entergy Gulf States, and their potential impact on Louisiana
retail ratepayers, resulting from restructuring in Texas and Arkansas.
Entergy Gulf States filed testimony in that proceeding in August 2000. The
LPSC staff filed testimony in that proceeding in October 2000 criticizing
Entergy Gulf States' proposal, particularly the part related to the Texas
portion of generation assets being transferred to an unregulated entity.
Entergy Gulf States filed rebuttal testimony in December 2000. A
procedural schedule has not been set. Management cannot predict the
timing or outcome of this proceeding.

 Pursuant to the Texas restructuring legislation, Entergy Gulf States
filed its separated business cost data and proposed transmission,
distribution, and competition tariffs with the PUCT on March 31, 2000. On
March 6, 2001, Entergy Gulf States filed with the PUCT a non-unanimous
settlement agreement in that case that establishes the distribution
revenue requirement. The settlement agreement is between Entergy Gulf
States, the PUCT Staff, and other parties. Pursuant to a generic rule
prescribed by the PUCT, Entergy Gulf States' allowed return on equity will
be 11.25 . The generic capital structure prescribed by the PUCT is 60 
debt and 40 equity. Hearings before the PUCT on approval of the settlement
are scheduled to begin in April 2001. Management cannot predict the timing
or outcome of this proceeding.

 Beginning January 1, 2002, the market power measures in the open
access law will prohibit Entergy Gulf States from owning and controlling
more than 20 of the installed generation capacity located in, or capable
of delivering electricity to, a "power region", which is defined as a
distinct region of NERC. In seeking PUCT approval of the Merger, Entergy
and FPL Group are required to demonstrate that the merged company will not
exceed this threshold. However, all the implications of this limit are
uncertain for Entergy Gulf States and Entergy. It is possible that Entergy
Gulf States could decide to divest some of its generation assets or seek to
reduce transmission constraints if Entergy Gulf States is found to have
generation market power in excess of this limit. The legislation also
requires affected utilities to sell at auction entitlements to at least 15 
of their installed generation capacity in Texas at least 60 days before
January 1, 2002. The obligation to auction capacity entitlements continues
for up to 60 months after January 1, 2002, or until 40 of current
customers have chosen an alternative supplier, whichever comes first.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

 The PUCT and various participants in the industry are currently in the
process of implementing the legislation through various rulemaking and
other proceedings. The Provider of Last Resort (POLR) rule was approved
by the PUCT in October 2000, requiring that such a provider exist in every
area of the state and setting up the process by which such a provider will
be selected and its services priced. The PUCT received bids from retail
electric providers seeking to become the POLR in each area in January 2001.
The PUCT has stated its preference that the POLR not be the retail electric
provider that is affiliated with the incumbent utility in the area.
However, depending on the outcome of the bidding process, Entergy Gulf
States' affiliate retail electric provider may be required to provide POLR
service in Entergy Gulf States' service territory. This may have a material
financial impact on the Entergy Gulf States retail electric provider
depending on the terms and prices eventually approved by the PUCT for POLR
service.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional details concerning
provisions of the Texas retail open access law and the proceedings
occurring in Texas pursuant to that law.

Louisiana

 In March 1999, the LPSC deferred making a decision on whether
competition in the electric industry is in the public interest. However,
the LPSC staff, outside consultants, and counsel were directed to work
together to analyze and resolve issues related to competition and then
recommend a plan for its implementation to be considered by the LPSC. In
January 2001, a draft response was circulated among interested parties. It
is expected that, after a comment period, a final staff response will be
presented to the LPSC in April 2001.

 See above under "Texas" for discussion of the LPSC proceeding
considering Entergy Gulf States' business separation plan.

Mississippi

 In May 2000, after two years of studies and hearings, the MPSC
announced that it was suspending its docket studying the opening of the
state's retail electricity markets to competition. The MPSC based its
decision on its finding that competition could raise the electric rates
paid by residential and small commercial customers. The final decision
regarding the introduction of retail competition ultimately lies with the
Mississippi Legislature, which is holding its 2001 session from January
through March. Management cannot predict when, or if, Mississippi will
deregulate its retail electricity market, but does not expect it to occur
before 2003.

New Orleans

 In 1997, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric business restructuring
plan with the Council. The Council has not established a procedural
schedule to consider electricity restructuring or Entergy's plan.

 After studying retail gas open access, advisors to the Council issued
a final report that proposed various pilot programs and found that retail
gas open access is not in the public interest at this time. The Council
accepted an offer of settlement from Entergy New Orleans in this matter
that allows for a voluntary pilot program for a limited number of large
industrial non-jurisdictional gas customers.

Federal Regulatory and Legislative Activity

Proposed System Agreement Amendments

 In June 2000, Entergy's domestic utility companies filed with FERC
proposed amendments to the System Agreement to facilitate the
implementation of retail competition in Arkansas and Texas and to provide
for continued equalization of costs among the domestic utilities in
Louisiana and Mississippi. The amendments provide the following:

 o cessation of participation in all aspects of the System Agreement,
 other than those related to transmission equalization, for any
 jurisdictional division of a domestic utility operating in a
 jurisdiction that initiates retail open access;
 o certain sections of the System Agreement will no longer apply to the
 sales of generating capacity, whether through the sale of the asset
 or the output thereof, by a domestic utility operating in a jurisdiction
 that has established a date by which it will implement retail open
 access; and
 o modification of the service schedule developed to track changes in
 energy costs resulting from the Entergy-Gulf States Utilities merger
 to include one final true-up of fuel costs upon cessation of one
 company's participation in the System Agreement, after which the
 service schedule will no longer be applicable for any purpose.

 Previously, in April 2000, the LPSC and the Council filed a complaint
with FERC seeking revisions to the System Agreement. The LPSC and the
Council allege that the revisions are necessary to accommodate the
introduction of retail competition in Texas and Arkansas and to protect
Entergy's Louisiana customers from any adverse impact that may occur due to
the introduction of retail competition in some jurisdictions but not
others. The LPSC and the Council requested that FERC cap certain of the
System Agreement obligations of Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and
Entergy New Orleans and fix these companies' access to pool energy at the
average level existing for the three years prior to the date that retail
competition is initiated in Texas and Arkansas. Alternatively, the LPSC
and the Council requested that FERC require Entergy to provide wholesale
power contracts to these companies to satisfy their energy requirements at
costs no higher than would have been incurred if retail competition were
not implemented. The LPSC and the Council requested that the relief be
made available for at least eight years after implementation of retail
competition or the withdrawal of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States
from the System Agreement, or until retail competition is implemented in
Louisiana and New Orleans. In addition, among other things, the LPSC and
the Council asserted in their complaint that:

 o unless the requested relief is granted, the restructuring legislation
 adopted in Texas and Arkansas, to the extent such legislation requires,
 or has the effect of, altering the rights of parties under the System
 Agreement, will violate provisions of the U.S. Constitution; and
 o the failure of the domestic utility companies to honor a right of
 first refusal at cost with respect to any sale of generating capacity
 and associated energy under the System Agreement, and any attempt to
 eliminate a right of first refusal from the System Agreement, would
 violate the Federal Power Act and constitute a breach of the System
 Agreement.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

The proceedings relating to Entergy's proposed amendments have been
consolidated with the complaint by the LPSC and the Council. Several other
parties have also intervened in the proceedings. If FERC considers
Entergy's proposed amendments, the LPSC and the Council have asserted that
FERC also needs to reconsider the charges to the domestic utility companies
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Entergy has requested a final
decision from FERC by October 2001. A procedural schedule has been
established, with the hearing beginning in March 2001 and an initial ALJ
decision scheduled in June 2001. These proceedings have been consolidated
with a previous complaint filed with FERC by the LPSC in 1995. In that
complaint, the LPSC requests, among other things, modification of the
System Agreement to exclude curtailable load from the cost allocation
determination. Neither the timing, nor the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings at FERC, can be predicted at this time.

Open Access Transmission and Entergy's Transco Proposal

 FERC issued Order 2000 in December 1999, which calls for owners and
operators of transmission lines in the United States to join regional
transmission organizations (RTOs) on a voluntary basis. Order 2000
requires that RTOs commence independent operations no later than December
15, 2001.

 It appears that FERC will be flexible regarding the structure of RTOs.
For example, it appears that RTOs may be for-profit or not-for-profit and
may be organized as joint ventures or legal entities of various other
types. However, RTOs will be required, among other things, to be
independent market participants, to have sufficient regional scope to
maintain reliability and efficiency, to be non-discriminatory in granting
service, and to maintain operational control over their regional
transmission systems.

 In October 2000, in compliance with Order 2000, Entergy made a filing
with FERC that requested:

 o authorization to establish an RTO referred to as Transco;
 o authorization to transfer the domestic utility companies' transmission
 assets to the Transco; and
 o a determination that the partnership arrangement with the Southwest
 Power Pool (SPP) that the Transco proposes to operate in would qualify
 as an independent RTO. The partnership arrangement provides for
 operations under the oversight of, and within, the SPP RTO.

The amounts of the domestic utility companies' net transmission utility
plant assets recorded in their financial statements are provided in Note 1
to the financial statements under the heading "Utility Plant."

 The proposed Transco will be a limited liability company. The
managing member of the Transco will be a separate corporation with a board
of directors independent of Entergy. The Transco will be:

 o regulated by FERC;
 o composed of the transmission system transferred to it by the domestic
 utility companies and other transmission owners in Entergy's current
 service territory region;
 o operated and maintained by employees who would work exclusively for
 the Transco and would not be employed by Entergy or the domestic
 utility companies; and
 o passively owned by the domestic utility companies and other member
 companies who will transfer assets but not control or otherwise direct
 its operation and management.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

Entergy filed in December 2000 for FERC approval of the rates for
transmission service across the Transco's facilities. Included in this
rate filing is a request to cancel the service schedule in the System
Agreement related to equalization of certain transmission costs. In March
2001, Entergy, Entergy Services, and the domestic utility companies
requested SEC approval under PUHCA of certain elements of the Transco plan.
The domestic utility companies have also made filings with their local
regulators seeking authorization to implement the Transco plan. Under its
planned timeline, Entergy expects to have the necessary regulatory
approvals by the third quarter of 2001, with the transmission asset
transfers occurring before Transco commences independent operations in
December 2001.

Deregulation legislation

 Over the past several years, a number of bills have been introduced in
the United States Congress to deregulate the generation function of the
electric power industry. The bills generally have provisions that would
give retail consumers the ability to choose their own electric service
provider. Entergy Corporation has supported some deregulation legislation
in Congress that would lead to an orderly transition to competition and
would also repeal PUHCA and PURPA. Congressional sentiment appears to be
against mandating retail competition by a certain date and in favor of
clarifying state authority to order retail choice for consumers. Congress
adjourned in 2000 without final action on a deregulation bill by a
committee of the House or Senate, and has not taken final action on such a
bill in its 2001 session thus far.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

 The domestic utility companies face the risk of losing customers due
to competition. Some of their large industrial and commercial customers
are exploring ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular,
cogeneration is an option available to a significant portion of the
domestic utility companies' industrial customer base. The domestic utility
companies have responded by working with some industrial and commercial
customers and negotiating electric service contracts that provide service
at rates lower than would otherwise be charged. Despite these actions,
Entergy Gulf States and Entergy Louisiana have lost an immaterial amount of
operating income in recent years from large industrial customers who have
completed cogeneration projects. Material losses to cogeneration are not
expected in 2001.

State and Local Rate Regulation

 The retail regulatory basis for setting rates for electric service is
shifting in some jurisdictions from traditional, exclusively cost-of-
service regulation to include performance-based elements. Performance-
based formula rate plans are designed to reward increased efficiency and
productivity, with utility shareholders and customers sharing in the
benefits. Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Louisiana have implemented
performance-based rate plans. Entergy Mississippi's 2000 filing indicated
that no change in rate levels was warranted. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
Gulf States had the following rate activity in 2000:

Filing Rate Activity Implementation Date

Entergy Louisiana 4th annual 6.4 million refund July 2000
 performance-based rate plan
Entergy Louisiana 5th annual 24.8 million base August 2000
 performance-based rate plan rate reduction 
Entergy Gulf States 2nd, 3rd, 83 million refund, July to September 2000
 4th, and 5th annual earnings including interest
 reviews

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

Entergy Louisiana is proposing to increase prospectively the allowed
rate of return on common equity from 10.5 to 11.6 , which, if approved by
the LPSC, would reduce the amount of the rate reduction.

 The domestic utility companies' retail and wholesale rate matters and
proceedings are discussed more thoroughly in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Other Electric Utility Trends

 In some areas of the country, utilities have either sold or are
attempting to sell all or a substantial portion of their generation assets
in order to focus their businesses on transmission and/or distribution
services. Entergy, through its global power development and domestic non-
utility nuclear businesses, intends to expand its generation business.
While the global power development business is focused on building new
power plants or modifying existing plants, the nuclear business expansion
plan focuses on acquiring generation assets of other utilities.

 In 1998, California implemented electricity deregulation legislation.
The law required the major investor-owned utilities in the state to
effectively divest their generation assets by requiring them to sell their
output to the Power Exchange. The Power Exchange is an independent spot
market power pool in which electricity is bought and sold at wholesale
prices. The deregulation law requires the investor-owned utilities to buy
power from the Power Exchange at market set rates, but freezes the amount
that those utilities can recover from their customers. Therefore, the
investor-owned utilities' short positions were not covered by generation
assets and were exposed to increases in the Power Exchange prices. The
jurisdictions in which Entergy's domestic utility companies operate
currently allow recovery of all prudently incurred fuel and purchased power
costs through various recovery mechanisms. In addition, the deregulation
legislation enacted in Arkansas and Texas allows for adjustments to the
prices that the distribution businesses will be allowed to recover based on
changes in fuel and purchased power costs.

 In 2000, the California Power Exchange prices that the California
investor-owned utilities have to pay for their electricity supplies soared
above the amounts that they are allowed to recover from their customers.
The California utilities therefore have accumulated billions of dollars of
under-recovered purchased power expenses. These under-recovered costs have
caused the California utilities to default on certain of their credit
obligations and have spawned several lawsuits and legislative and
regulatory activity. The ultimate effect of these events on the investor-
owned utilities in California and the electric energy industry nationwide
is uncertain.

Continued Application of SFAS 71 and Stranded Cost Exposure

 The domestic utility companies' and System Energy's financial
statements primarily reflect assets and costs based on existing cost-based
ratemaking regulation in accordance with SFAS 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." Under traditional ratemaking
practice, regulated electric utilities are granted exclusive geographic
franchises to sell electricity. In return, the utilities must make
investments and incur obligations to serve customers. Prudently incurred
costs are recovered from customers along with a return on investment.
Regulators may require utilities to defer collecting from customers some
operating costs until a future date. These deferred costs are recorded as
regulatory assets in the financial statements. In order to continue
applying SFAS 71 to its financial statements, a utility's rates must be set
by an independent regulator on a cost-of-service basis and the rates must
be charged to and collected from customers.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

As the generation portion of the utility industry moves toward
competition, it is likely that generation rates will no longer be set on a
cost-of-service basis. When that occurs, the generation portion of the
business could be required to discontinue application of SFAS 71. The
result of discontinuing application of SFAS 71 could be the recording of
asset impairments and the removal of regulatory assets and liabilities from
the balance sheet. This result is because some of the costs or commitments
incurred under a regulated pricing system might be impaired or not
recovered in a competitive market. These costs are referred to as stranded
costs.

 Nearly all of Entergy's exposure to potential stranded costs involves
commitments that were approved by regulators. These exposures include the
following:

 o the allowed cost of constructing its nuclear generating plants (the
 domestic utility companies' net investment in nuclear generation is
 provided in Note 1 to the financial statements);
 o long-term contracts to purchase power under the Unit Power Sales
 Agreement and associated with the Vidalia project, which may require
 paying above-market prices in a competitive environment (detail
 concerning these obligations is provided in Note 9 to the financial
 statements);
 o nuclear power plant decommissioning costs (detail concerning these
 costs is provided in Note 9 to the financial statements);
 o the construction cost of some fossil-fueled generating plants and
 related contracts to buy fuel that may be above-market price in a
 competitive market (detail concerning the domestic utility companies'
 net investment in generation other than nuclear, which is primarily
 fossil fueled, is provided in Note 1 to the financial statements,
 and detail concerning certain fuel contracts is provided in Note 9
 to the financial statements); and
 o regulatory assets reflected in the balance sheets.

 As of December 31, 2000, the amount of these potentially strandable
costs for Entergy reflected in the financial statements is approximately
 1.8 billion at Entergy Arkansas, 3.2 billion at Entergy Gulf States,
 2.4 billion at Entergy Louisiana, and 0.3 billion at Entergy Mississippi.
The estimated net present value of the obligations described above that are
not reflected in the financial statements for Entergy is approximately 1.0
billion at Entergy Arkansas, 0.3 billion at Entergy Gulf States, 1.5
billion at Entergy Louisiana, 0.6 billion at Entergy Mississippi, and
 0.3 billion at Entergy New Orleans. These amounts can increase due to
increased capital spending; however, in the normal course of business,
depreciation, amortization, and payments under the contractual obligations
should reduce these amounts. The actual amount of these costs and
obligations that will be identified as stranded will be determined in
regulatory proceedings. The outcome of the proceedings cannot be predicted
and will depend upon a number of variables, including the timing of
stranded cost determination, the values attributable to certain strandable
assets, assumptions concerning future market prices for electricity, and
other factors. In addition, because transition legislation or regulation
is not in place in Louisiana, Mississippi, or New Orleans, Entergy cannot
predict how those jurisdictions will treat stranded costs and whether
Entergy will be able to recover all or a part of the costs in those
jurisdictions.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

 In June 2000, Entergy Arkansas filed an application to continue the
stranded cost mitigation efforts agreed upon in the 1997 settlement
agreement approved by the APSC. The filing included a stranded cost
estimate intended to support Entergy Arkansas' recommendation that the
mitigation efforts continue. The filing presents an estimated range of
stranded costs based upon the comparison of possible generation asset
market values to the generation assets' book values and contractual
obligations. The range of possible generation asset market values used in
the estimate was determined using generation asset sales from other
jurisdictions. Rebuttal testimony filed by Entergy Arkansas in November
2000 estimates that stranded costs in Arkansas could be from 227.8
million to 1.58 billion. The wide range in the estimate is because of
the wide range in the comparable asset sales used in the estimate.

 In the non-unanimous settlement agreement filed with the PUCT by
Entergy Gulf States in March 2001, the parties agree that Entergy Gulf
States will not implement a charge to recover stranded costs in Texas. A
rider to recover nuclear decommissioning costs will be implemented.
Hearings before the PUCT for approval of the settlement are scheduled to
begin in April 2001.

 Management believes that definitive outcomes have not yet been
determined regarding the transition to competition in each of Entergy's
jurisdictions. Arkansas and Texas have enacted retail open access laws as
described above, but Entergy believes that significant issues remain to be
addressed by Arkansas and Texas regulators, and the enacted laws do not
provide sufficient detail to determine definitively the impact on Entergy
Arkansas' and Entergy Gulf States' regulated operations. Until the
regulatory proceedings in Arkansas and Texas provide a greater level of
certainty, both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States will continue to
apply SFAS 71 to their regulated operations. Final approval of the
settlement agreement in Texas will likely result in Entergy Gulf States
discontinuing application of SFAS 71 to its Texas generation operations.
SFAS 71 will continue to be applied in the Louisiana, Mississippi, and New
Orleans jurisdictions pending legislative or regulatory developments
relating to transition to competition. If SFAS 71 is no longer applied by
the respective domestic utility companies and System Energy, and regulation
or legislation does not allow for recovery of all or a portion of its
stranded costs, there could be a material adverse impact on the respective
domestic utility companies' and Entergy's financial statements. The impact
of approval of the Texas settlement agreement will depend upon a final
determination of the market value of generation assets in Texas. Entergy
believes that the amount of costs that will be stranded without a means of
recovery or mitigation for the domestic utility companies will be
significantly less than the strandable cost amounts given above. The
specifics of the accounting application of SFAS 71 are discussed more
thoroughly in Note 1 to the financial statements.

Market Risks Disclosure

 Entergy is exposed to the following market risks:

 o the commodity price risk associated with its power marketing and
 trading business;
 o the interest rate risk associated with certain of its variable rate
 credit facilities;
 o the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of its
 contractual obligations; and
 o the interest rate and equity price risk associated with its
 investments in decommissioning trust funds.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

Entergy's power marketing and trading business enters into sales and
purchases of electricity and natural gas for delivery in the future.
Because the market prices of electricity and natural gas can be volatile,
Entergy's power marketing and trading business is exposed to risk arising
from differences between the fixed prices in its commitments and
fluctuating market prices. To mitigate its exposure, Entergy's power
marketing and trading business enters into electricity and natural gas
futures, swaps, option contracts, and electricity forward agreements. The
business also manages its exposure with policies limiting its exposure to
market risk and daily monitoring of its potential financial exposure.

 Entergy's power marketing and trading business uses a value-at-risk
model (VAR) as one measure of the market risk of a loss in fair value for
the traded portfolio. VAR acts in conjunction with stress testing,
position reporting, and profit and loss reporting in order to measure and
control the risk inherent in the traded portfolio. The primary use of VAR
is to provide a benchmark for market risk contained in the trading
portfolio. VAR does not function as a comprehensive measure of all risks
in a portfolio. Furthermore, VAR is only an appropriate risk measure for
products traded in relatively liquid markets.

 Management's VAR methodology uses a variance/covariance approach to
the measurement of market risk. The variance/covariance approach assumes
that prices follow a "random-walk" process in which prices are lognormally
distributed. This approach requires the following inputs:

 o a one-tailed test with a 95 confidence interval that measures the
 probability of loss;
 o a 20-day window for measuring volatility;
 o a cross-product correlation matrix that measures the tendency of
 different basis products to move together; and
 o an inter-temporal correlation matrix that measures the tendency of
 commodities with different delivery periods to move together.

 Power marketing and trading's VAR was approximately 2.9 million as of
December 31, 2000 and 3.3 million as of December 31, 1999. During 2000,
the average month-end VAR was 4.2 million, with a high month-end VAR of
 8.5 million and a low month-end VAR of 2.5 million.

 Management's calculation of VAR exposure represents an estimate of
reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of
derivative financial instruments, assuming hypothetical movements in
prices. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or an expected
loss that may occur, because actual future gains and losses will differ
from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates,
operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in the portfolio
of derivative financial instruments during the year.

 In November 2000, System Fuels and Entergy's domestic non-utility
nuclear business entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
the Euro denominated payments due under certain purchase contracts. The
notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts were 82.8
million Euro 73.2 million) and the forward currency rates range from
 .8690 to .8981. The maturities of these forward contracts depend on the
contractual payment dates and range in time from August 2001 to February
2004. The mark-to-market valuation of the forward contracts at December
31, 2000 was a net asset of 5.9 million. The counterparty banks obligated
on these agreements are rated by Standard and Poor's Rating Services at A-1
or above on their short-term obligations and AA- on their long-term
obligations.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS

Entergy uses interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate
changes on certain variable-rate credit facilities associated with its
global power development business. Under the interest rate swap
agreements, Entergy receives floating-rate interest payments and pays fixed-
rate interest rate payments over the life of the agreements. The floating-
rate interest that Entergy receives is approximately equal to the interest
it must pay on the variable-rate credit facilities. Therefore, through the
use of the swap agreements, Entergy effectively achieves a fixed rate of
interest on the credit facilities. The following details information about
the interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2000:

 Average
 Notional Fixed Maturity Fair value
 Amount Pay Rate

 Saltend 443.3 million 6.44 2013 16.6 million)
 Damhead Creek 414.5 million 6.52 2010 18.4 million)

 Entergy is exposed to fluctuations in equity prices and interest rates
through its nuclear decommissioning trust funds. The NRC requires Entergy
to maintain trusts to fund the costs of decommissioning ANO 1, ANO 2, River
Bend, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, and Pilgrim. The funds are invested
primarily in equity securities; fixed-rate, fixed-income securities; and
cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that its exposure to market
fluctuations will not affect results of operations for the ANO, River Bend,
Grand Gulf, and Waterford 3 trust funds because of the application of
regulatory accounting principles. The Pilgrim trust fund holds
approximately 314 million of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities as of
December 31, 2000. These securities have an average coupon rate of 6.7 ,
an average duration of 5.8 years, and an average maturity of 8.8 years.
The Pilgrim trust fund also holds equity securities worth approximately
 116 million as of December 31, 2000. These securities are held in a fund
that is designed to approximate the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The
decommissioning trust funds are discussed more thoroughly in Notes 1 and 9
to the financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncement

 In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which will be implemented by Entergy
in 2001. See Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
expected effect of this pronouncement on Entergy.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow

Operations

 Net cash flow from operations for Entergy, the domestic utility
companies, and System Energy for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999,
and 1998 was:

 2000 1999 1998
 (In Millions)

 Entergy 1,967.8 1,389.0 1,835.7
 Entergy Arkansas 421.6 352.6 448.7
 Entergy Gulf States 403.9 387.6 491.3
 Entergy Louisiana 270.4 410.4 342.4
 Entergy Mississippi 182.3 142.4 125.0
 Entergy New Orleans 30.5 60.2 40.3
 System Energy 395.6 102.8 298.8

 Entergy's consolidated cash flow from operations increased in 2000
primarily due to the domestic utility companies and System Energy providing
an additional 277.5 million and the competitive businesses providing an
additional 223.7 million to operating cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

 Fuel cost recovery activity in 2000 significantly affected the
operating cash flows for the domestic utility companies. Historically high
natural gas and purchased power costs in 2000 caused the domestic utility
companies' fuel payments to increase significantly during the year. In the
case of Entergy Arkansas, the Texas portion of Entergy Gulf States, and
Entergy Mississippi, the 2000 under-recoveries have been treated as
regulatory investments in the cash flow statements because those companies
are allowed by their regulatory jurisdictions to recover the fuel costs
accumulated in 2000 over longer than a twelve month period, and the
companies will earn a return on the under-recovered balances.

 Entergy Arkansas' and Entergy Gulf States' operating cash flows were
also affected by increases in their net income for the year ended December
31, 2000. The increase in operating cash flow for Entergy Gulf States was
partially offset by the increased use of cash for fuel costs related to the
Louisiana jurisdiction and refunds of 83 million paid to Louisiana
customers during the third quarter of 2000 as a result of earnings reviews
settled with the LPSC, as discussed further in Note 2 to the financial
statements. The decrease in operating cash flow for Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy New Orleans was partially caused by the increased use of cash
related to fuel costs in 2000.

 The operating cash flows of the domestic utility companies and System
Energy were affected by money pool activity for 2000 as a result of the use
of a portion of the proceeds from debt issuances in 2000 to pay down
payables to the money pool in the following amounts:

 Entergy Arkansas 9.9 million
 Entergy Gulf States 36.1 million
 Entergy Louisiana 91.5 million
 Entergy Mississippi 16.7 million
 Entergy New Orleans 3.9 million

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

System Energy's operating cash flow increased in part due to payments of
 78.9 million received on its money pool receivables from affiliated
companies.

 The money pool is an inter-company funding arrangement designed to
reduce the domestic utility companies' and System Energy's dependence on
external short-term borrowings. The money pool provides a means by which,
on a daily basis, the excess funds of Entergy Corporation, the domestic
utility companies, and System Energy may be used by the domestic utility
companies or System Energy to fulfill short-term cash requirements. See
"Capital Resources - Sources of Capital" below for a discussion of the
limitations on these borrowings.

 The increase in operating cash flow for the competitive businesses is
attributable to the following:

 o the operations of Pilgrim, Indian Point 3, and FitzPatrick that
 primarily caused an increase of 73.9 million in operating cash flow
 from the domestic non-utility nuclear business; and
 o net income generated by and improved operations in the power
 marketing and trading and global power development businesses in
 2000, which resulted in an additional 40.2 million and 91.0 million
 of operating cash flow, respectively, compared with net losses from
 their operations in 1999.

Pilgrim was purchased in July 1999 and provided operating cash flow for all
of 2000 compared with only six months in 1999. Indian Point 3 and
FitzPatrick were purchased in November 2000 and provided operating cash
flow for two months in 2000.

 Entergy's consolidated cash flow from operations for 1999 decreased as
compared to 1998 primarily due to less cash provided by competitive
businesses. The decrease was also due to the completion of rate phase-in
plans for some of the domestic utility companies during 1998. Entergy Gulf
States' Louisiana retail phase-in plan for River Bend was completed in
February 1998, Entergy Mississippi's phase-in plan for Grand Gulf 1 was
completed in September 1998, and Entergy Arkansas' phase-in plan for Grand
Gulf 1 was completed in November 1998. Therefore, these phase-in plans did
not contribute to operating cash flow in 1999 or 2000. Entergy New
Orleans' phase-in plan for Grand Gulf 1 will be completed in 2001. System
Energy's operating cash flow decreased in 1999 primarily due to an increase
in its money pool receivables from affiliated companies.

 In 1999, competitive businesses used 9.3 million of operating cash
flow from operations compared with providing 151.7 million of operating
cash flow for 1998. This change was primarily due to the sales of London
Electricity and CitiPower in December 1998. Both businesses contributed
operating cash flow in 1998 but did not contribute at all in 1999.
Offsetting the decrease in operating cash flow in 1999 were the sales of
Efficient Solutions, Inc. in September 1998 and Entergy Security, Inc. in
January 1999. These businesses used operating cash flow in 1998 and used
none in 1999. Also, the power marketing and trading business used less
operating cash flow in 1999 than in 1998.

Investing Activities

 Net cash used in investing activities increased for 2000 due to
increased construction expenditures, decreased proceeds from sales of
businesses, decreased net proceeds from maturities of notes receivable, and
higher fuel costs.

 The increased construction expenditures were primarily due to:

 o spending on customer service and reliability improvements by the
 domestic utility companies;
 o costs incurred related to the December 2000 ice storms, primarily at
 Entergy Arkansas; and
 o costs incurred for replacement of the steam generators at ANO 2.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The following items also contributed to the overall increase in cash
used in 2000:

 o the maturity of notes receivable in August 1999 when only a portion of
 the proceeds were reinvested in other temporary investments;
 o payments made by Entergy's global power development business in 2000
 for turbines; and
 o the under-recovery of deferred fuel costs incurred in 2000 at certain
 of the domestic utility companies due to significantly higher market
 prices of fuel and purchased power expenses. Entergy Arkansas, the
 Texas portion of Entergy Gulf States, and Entergy Mississippi have
 treated these costs as regulatory investments because those companies
 are allowed by their regulatory jurisdictions to recover the fuel
 cost regulatory asset accumulated in 2000 over longer than a twelve
 month period, and the companies will earn a return on the
 under-recovered balances.

Partially offsetting the overall increase in cash used is the maturity of
other temporary investments and proceeds from the sale of the Freestone
power project in 2000.

 Investing activities used cash in 1999 compared to 1998 due to the
sales in 1998 of London Electricity and CitiPower, and higher construction
expenditures in 1999 compared with 1998. The increased construction
expenditures were primarily due to construction of the Saltend and Damhead
Creek power plants by Entergy's global power development business, spending
on customer service and reliability improvements by the domestic utility
companies, and the return to service of generation plants at Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. The maturity and
reinvestment of a portion of the proceeds of notes receivable in August
1999, and the sales in 1999 of Entergy Security, Entergy Power Edesur
Holding, LTD and several other telecommunications businesses partially
offset the overall decrease in 1999.

Financing Activities

 Financing activities provided cash for 2000 primarily due to:

 o new long-term debt issuances by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States,
 Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans; and
 o increased borrowings under the Entergy Corporation credit facility.

 Partially offsetting the overall cash provided were the following in
2000:

 o increased repurchases of Entergy Corporation common stock;
 o redemption of Entergy Gulf States' preference stock; and
 o decreased borrowings under the credit facilities for the construction
 of the Saltend and Damhead Creek power projects by Entergy's global
 power development business.

 Net cash used in financing activities decreased in 1999 compared to
1998 primarily due to:

 o the retirement in 1998 of debt associated with the acquisition of
 London Electricity and CitiPower;
 o increased borrowings in 1999 under the credit facilities for the
 construction of the Saltend and Damhead Creek power plants by Entergy's
 global power development business; and
 o a reduction in dividend payments made by Entergy Corporation in 1999
 compared to 1998.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Partially offsetting the 1999 overall decrease were the following
uses:

 o the 1999 repayment of bank borrowings by Entergy Corporation and ETHC
 with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Entergy Security, Inc.;
 o the redemption of preferred stock in 1999 at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
 Gulf States, and Entergy Louisiana; and
 o the repurchase of Entergy Corporation common stock.

Capital Resources

 Entergy's sources to meet its capital requirements include:

 o internally generated funds;
 o cash on hand;
 o debt or preferred stock issuances;
 o common stock issuances;
 o bank financing under new or existing facilities;
 o short-term borrowings; and
 o sales of assets.

 Entergy requires capital resources for:

 o working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and
 purchased power costs;
 o construction and other capital expenditures;
 o debt and preferred stock maturities;
 o common stock repurchases;
 o capital investments;
 o funding of subsidiaries; and
 o dividend and interest payments.

Sources of Capital

 All of the domestic utility companies issued new debt in 2000. The
net proceeds of these issuances have been or will be used for general
corporate purposes including capital expenditures, the retirement of short-
term indebtedness incurred for working capital or other purposes, and, in
the case of Entergy Gulf States, the mandatory redemption of preference
stock. The domestic utility companies and System Energy expect to continue
refinancing or redeeming higher cost debt and preferred stock prior to
maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates
are favorable. The domestic utility companies plan to issue debt in 2001
for similar purposes as in 2000. In addition, rising fuel prices in 2000
and the resulting increases in the domestic utility companies' fuel costs
have increased these companies' needs for working capital financing in
2001. Entergy Arkansas' liquidity was also affected by incurring
approximately 195 million of restoration costs associated with ice storms
in December 2000. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more
information regarding the December 2000 ice storms.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by the domestic
utility companies and System Energy require prior regulatory approval.
Preferred stock and debt issuances are subject to issuance tests set forth
in corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. The domestic
utility companies have sufficient capacity under these issuance tests to
consummate the financings planned for 2001. The domestic utility companies
may also establish special purpose trusts or limited partnerships as
financing subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred securities.

 On January 31, 2001, Entergy Mississippi issued 70 million of 6.25 
Series First Mortgage Bonds due February 1, 2003. Proceeds of the issuance
will be used for general corporate purposes, including the retirement of
short-term indebtedness incurred from money pool borrowings for capital
expenditures and working capital needs.

 On February 23, 2001, Entergy New Orleans issued 30 million of 6.65 
Series First Mortgage Bonds due March 1, 2004. Proceeds of the issuance
will be used for general corporate purposes, including the retirement of
short-term indebtedness incurred from money pool borrowings for capital
expenditures and working capital needs.

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi each
obtained 364-day credit facilities in 2001, and the lines have been fully
drawn. Entergy Arkansas will primarily use the proceeds to pay for costs
incurred in the December 2000 ice storms. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
Mississippi will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and
working capital needs. The facilities have variable interest rates and the
average commitment fee is 0.13 . The amounts and dates obtained for the
facilities follow:

 Amount of
 Company Facility Date Obtained

 Entergy Arkansas 63 million January 31, 2001
 Entergy Louisiana 30 million January 31, 2001
 Entergy Mississippi 25 million February 2, 2001

 In 2001, Entergy, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
requested an increase from the SEC in their current authorized short-term
borrowing limits, which includes borrowings under the money pool. The
increases requested are as follows:

 Company Current Limit Requested Limit

 Entergy Mississippi 103 million 160 million
 Entergy New Orleans 35 million 100 million
 Other Entergy subsidiaries 265 million 420 million

SEC approval of the request will increase the current SEC authorized short-
term borrowing limits for the domestic utility companies and System Energy,
which are effective through November 30, 2001, from 1.078 billion to
 1.2 billion. Note 4 to the financial statements contains details of the
amount of short-term indebtedness outstanding for Entergy, the domestic
utility companies, and System Energy as of December 31, 2000.

 In 2000, long-term debt on Entergy's balance sheet were increased by
approximately 750 million by the issuance of notes payable to NYPA in the
Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick acquisition. Also in 2000, the global power
development business increased its borrowings under the Damhead Creek
credit facility by approximately 164 million to finance construction of
the plant. Damhead Creek commenced commercial operation in 2001. Note 7
to the financial statements more thoroughly discusses these long-term debts.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Uses of Capital

 For the years 2001 through 2003, Entergy plans to spend 8.2 billion
in a capital investment plan focused on improving service at the domestic
utility companies and growing its global power development and domestic non-
utility nuclear businesses. The estimated allocation in the plan is 2.6
billion to the domestic utility companies, 3.6 billion to the global power
development business, and 2.0 billion to the domestic non-utility nuclear
business. Management provides more information on construction expenditures
and long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5, 6, 7, and 9
to the financial statements.

 The capital investment plan discussed above is subject to modification
based on the ongoing effects of transition to competition planning, the
ability to recover the regulated utility costs in rates, and the proposed
business combination with FPL Group. The Merger Agreement generally allows
Entergy to continue business in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice and contains certain restrictions on Entergy's activities,
including restrictions on the issuance of securities, capital expenditures,
dispositions, incurrence or guarantee of indebtedness, and trading or
marketing of energy. Entergy does not believe that these covenants will
constrain its capital investment plan. Under certain circumstances, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, a termination fee of 215 million may be
payable by one of the parties. Additionally, the plan is contingent upon
the ability to access the capital necessary to finance the planned
expenditures, and significant borrowings may be necessary to implement
these capital spending plans.

PUHCA Restrictions on Uses of Capital

 Entergy's ability to invest in domestic and foreign generation
businesses is subject to the SEC's regulations under PUHCA. Absent SEC
approval, these regulations limit Entergy Corporation's aggregate
investment in domestic and foreign generation businesses at the time an
investment is made to an amount equal to 50 of average consolidated
retained earnings for the previous four quarters. In June 2000, the SEC
issued an order that allows Entergy's EWG and FUCO investments to increase
from 50 to 100 of Entergy's average consolidated retained earnings. As
of December 31, 2000 Entergy's investments subject to this rule totaled
 770 million constituting 25 of its average consolidated retained
earnings.

 Entergy's ability to guarantee obligations of its non-utility
subsidiaries is also limited by SEC regulations under PUHCA. In August
2000, the SEC issued an order, effective through December 31, 2005, that
allows Entergy to issue up to 2 billion of guarantees to its non-utility
companies, excluding guarantees outstanding as of that date that were
issued under a previous order.

 Under PUHCA, the SEC imposes a limit equal to 15 of consolidated
capitalization on the amount that may be invested in "energy-related"
businesses without specific SEC approval. Entergy has made investments in
energy-related businesses, including power marketing and trading.
Entergy's available capacity to make additional investments at December 31,
2000 was approximately 1.8 billion.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Other Uses of Capital by Entergy Corporation

 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Entergy will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase in open market transactions
 430 million of its common stock prior to the close of the Merger. As of
December 31, 2000, Entergy has repurchased 4.2 million shares for an
aggregate amount of 145.6 million after the signing of the Merger
Agreement. Prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, Entergy had been
repurchasing shares under two Board authorizations. In October 1998, the
Board approved a plan for the repurchase of Entergy common stock through
December 31, 2001 to fulfill the requirements of various compensation and
benefit plans. This stock repurchase plan provided for open market
purchases of up to 5 million shares for an aggregate consideration of up to
 250 million. In July 1999, the Board approved the commitment of up to an
additional 750 million for the repurchase of Entergy common stock through
December 31, 2001. Shares were repurchased on a discretionary basis.
Prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, Entergy had repurchased 25.3
million shares for an aggregate amount of 652.5 million under these two
Board authorizations.

 In 2000, Entergy Corporation paid 271.0 million in cash dividends on
its common stock and received dividend payments and returns of capital
totaling 918.3 million from subsidiaries. Declarations of dividends on
Entergy's common stock are made at the discretion of the Board. The Board
evaluates the level of Entergy common stock dividends based upon Entergy's
earnings and financial strength. Dividend restrictions are discussed in
Note 8 to the financial statements. Under the Merger Agreement, Entergy
can continue to pay dividends at existing levels with increases permitted
up to 5 over the amount of the previous twelve-month period. In October
2000 and January 2001, the Board declared quarterly dividends of 0.315 per
share on Entergy's common stock. This dividend level is an increase of 5 
over the dividend level for the twelve-month period prior to the Merger
Agreement.

Global Power Development Business

 Included in the capital investment plan for Entergy's global power
development business are payments under an option it obtained in October
1999 to acquire twenty-four GE7FA advanced technology gas turbines, four
steam turbines, and eight GE7EA advanced technology gas turbines. In the
sale of the Freestone power project in June 2000, Entergy sold the rights
to acquire four of the GE7EA turbines and two of the steam turbines.
Deliveries of the remaining turbines are scheduled for 2001 through 2004.
Management plans to use the turbines in future generation projects of the
global power development business, and anticipates that the acquisition of
the turbines will be funded by a combination of cash on hand, project
financing, and other external financing. In addition, management expects
that up to 225 million of the turbine acquisitions will be supported by
Entergy Corporation guarantees.

 In 2000, Entergy's global power development business began
construction of the Warren Power Project, a 300 MW combined-cycle gas
turbine merchant power plant in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The construction
costs are expected to be approximately 150 million. Management expects
that commercial operation of the plant will begin in the summer of 2001.

Domestic Non-Utility Nuclear Business

 In November 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
purchased NYPA's 825 MW James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant located
near Oswego, New York and NYPA's 980 MW Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant
located in Westchester County, New York. Entergy paid NYPA 50 million in
cash at the closing of the purchase, and will pay seven annual installments
of approximately 108 million commencing one year from the date of the
closing, and eight annual installments of 20 million commencing eight
years from the date of the closing. Entergy currently projects that these
installments will be paid primarily from the proceeds of the sale of power
from the plants and that Entergy will provide an additional 100 million of
funding.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with NYPA, the installment
payments due by Entergy to NYPA must be secured by a letter of credit from
an eligible financial institution. On November 21, 2000, upon closing of
the acquisition of the NYPA plants, Entergy delivered a 577 million letter
of credit, with NYPA as beneficiary, in accordance with the terms of such
agreement. The letter of credit was backed by cash collateral, and this
cash is reflected in the balance sheet as "Special deposits." In February
2001, Entergy replaced 440 million of the cash collateral with an Entergy
Corporation guarantee. Most of the cash released by this guarantee was used
to fund Entergy's cash contribution made for its interest in the
Entergy/Koch Industries joint venture discussed below under "Joint
Ventures."

 Included in the domestic non-utility nuclear business' capital
investment plan is the acquisition of Consolidated Edison's (Con Edison)
957 MW Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant (IP2) located in Westchester
County, New York. In November 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear
business signed an agreement with Con Edison to purchase the plant.
Entergy will pay 600 million in cash at the closing of the purchase and
will receive the plant, nuclear fuel, and other assets, including a
purchase power agreement (PPA). The financing of the purchase may require
the support of an Entergy Corporation guarantee. On the second anniversary
of the IP2 acquisition, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
will also begin to pay NYPA 10 million per year for up to 10 years in
accordance with the Indian Point 3 purchase agreement. Under the PPA, Con
Edison will purchase 100 of IP2's output through 2004. Con Edison will
also transfer a 430 million decommissioning trust fund, along with the
liability to decommission IP2 and Indian Point 1, to Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business. Management expects to close the acquisition by
mid-2001, pending the approvals of the NRC, the New York Public Service
Commission, and other regulatory agencies.

Joint Ventures

 On January 31, 2001, subsidiaries of Entergy and Koch Industries, Inc.
formed a new limited partnership called Entergy-Koch, L.P. Entergy
contributed its power marketing and trading business in the United States
and the United Kingdom and made other contributions, including equity and
loans, totaling 414 million. Koch Energy, Inc. contributed to the venture
its 9,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline, gas storage facilities including the
Bistineau storage facility near Shreveport, Louisiana, and Koch Energy
Trading, which markets and trades electricity, gas, weather derivatives and
other energy-related commodities and services.

 Entergy's global power development business has a 50 interest in RS
Cogen LLC, a joint venture with PPG Industries. In August 2000, RS Cogen
LLC completed a 242 million non-recourse financing for a 425 MW natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant, known as the Riverside project. In
September 2000, construction of the plant began at estimated construction
costs approximately equal to the amount of the financing arrangement.
Management expects that commercial operation of the plant will begin in
2002.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Entergy's consolidated earnings applicable to common stock were 679.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2000 resulting in increases in
basic and diluted earnings per share of 33 and 32 , respectively. The
increase in earnings per share was also affected by Entergy's share
repurchase program. Entergy's consolidated earnings applicable to common
stock were 552.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 resulting in
a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of 25 compared with
1998.

 The changes in earnings applicable to common stock by operating
segments for 2000 and 1999 as compared to the prior year are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Operating Segments 2000 1999
 (In Thousands)

 Domestic Utility and System Energy 75,684 29,020
 Power Marketing & Trading 20,133 15,049
 Domestic Non-Utility Nuclear 33,453 16,768
 Global Power Development 46,246 (23,550)
 Entergy London and CitiPower - (120,852)
 Other, including parent company (48,681) (103,045)
 -------- ---------
 Total 126,835 (186,610)
 ======== =========

Other for 1998 included the results of operations for Efficient
Solutions, Inc., Entergy Security, Inc., Entergy Power Edesur
Holdings, and several telecommunications businesses that were sold
between late 1998 and mid-1999. It also included the gains on the
1998 sales of Entergy London and CitiPower. See Note 14 to the
financial statements for additional business segment information.

 The increase in 2000 earnings at the domestic utility companies and
System Energy was primarily due to:

 o an increase in energy usage by customers;
 o an increase in revenues as a result of a warmer than normal spring and
 summer and a colder than normal winter;
 o a decrease of 21.4 million in interest and other charges;
 o a decrease of 45.5 million in reserves recorded in 2000 for potential
 rate actions; and
 o a 10.9 million decrease in preferred dividend requirements primarily
 due to the retirement of Entergy Gulf States' preference stock.

 The increases were partially offset by:

 o an increase of 95.8 million in operation and maintenance expense;
 o an increase of 44.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense;
 o an increase of 23.5 million in taxes other than income taxes; and
 o an increase in the effective income tax rate.

 The increase at the power marketing and trading business in 2000 was
primarily due to:

 o improved trading performance in electricity;
 o increased long-term marketing of electricity; and
 o trading gains in natural gas in the current year due to natural gas
 prices reaching record high levels compared to trading losses in the
 prior year.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The increase at the domestic non-utility nuclear business in 2000 was
primarily due to the ownership of Pilgrim for the entire year compared to
only six months in 1999, and the increase for 1999 was due to the purchase
of Pilgrim in July 1999.

 The increase at the global power development business in 2000 was
primarily due to 55.1 million of liquidated damages received from the
Saltend contractor as compensation for lost operating margin from the plant
due to construction delays.

 Other decreased in 2000 primarily due to the write-down of Entergy's
investments in Latin America to their fair market values. Other decreased
in 1999 primarily due to the non-recurring gains recorded on business sales
in 1998.

 Entergy's income before taxes is discussed in two business categories,
"Domestic Utility Companies and System Energy" and "Competitive
Businesses". Competitive Businesses primarily includes power marketing and
trading, domestic non-utility nuclear, global power development, and
several businesses that were sold in 1998 and 1999.

Domestic Utility Companies and System Energy

 The changes in electric operating revenues for Entergy's domestic
utility companies for 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Description 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

 Base revenues 94.2) 81.2
 Rate riders (17.1) (164.1)
 Fuel cost recovery 792.5 188.7
 Sales volume/weather 107.1 5.3
 Other revenue (including unbilled) 135.8 74.3
 Sales for resale 24.2 (50.3)
 ------ ------
 Total 948.3 135.1
 ====== ======

Base revenues

 Base revenues decreased in 2000 primarily due to the non-recurring
effect on 1999 revenues of the reversal of regulatory reserves associated
with the accelerated amortization of accounting order deferrals discussed
below.

 In 1999, base revenues increased primarily due to:

 o a 93.6 million reversal in June 1999 of regulatory reserves
 associated with the accelerated amortization of accounting order
 deferrals in conjunction with the settlement agreement in Entergy
 Gulf States' Texas 1996 and 1998 rate filings. The settlement
 agreement was approved by the PUCT in June 1999. The net income
 effect of this reversal is largely offset by the amortization of
 rate deferrals discussed below; and
 o a reduction in the amount of reserves recorded in 1999 at Entergy
 Gulf States compared to 1998 for the anticipated effects of rate
 proceedings in Texas.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Partially offsetting these increases were:

 o annual base rate reductions implemented for Entergy Gulf States'
 Louisiana and Texas retail customers in 1998 and 1999 and Entergy
 Mississippi customers in 1999; and
 o reserves recorded by Entergy Gulf States related to the Louisiana
 jurisdiction, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans in 1999 for
 potential rate actions or rate refunds.

Rate riders

 Rate rider revenues do not impact earnings since specific incurred
expenses offset them. In 1999, rate rider revenues decreased 164.1
million due to a revised Grand Gulf rider implemented at Entergy Arkansas
and Entergy Mississippi, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the
amortization of rate deferrals. The revised rider eliminated revenues
attributable to the Grand Gulf phase-in plans, which were completed in
1998, and implemented the Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery Tariff (GGART),
allowing accelerated recovery and payment of a portion of the two
companies' Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. The tariffs became
effective in January 1999 and October 1998, respectively.

Fuel cost recovery

 The domestic utility companies are allowed to recover certain fuel and
purchased power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates
that are recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between
revenues collected and current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded
as deferred fuel costs on Entergy's financial statements such that these
costs generally have no net effect on earnings.

 Fuel cost recovery revenues increased in 2000 primarily due to:

 o increased fuel recovery factors at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
 States in the Texas jurisdiction, and Entergy Mississippi; and
 o higher fuel and purchased power costs at Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
 New Orleans due to the increased market price of natural gas.

 Along with the increase in fuel cost recovery revenue, fuel and
purchased power expenses increased by 794.2 million in 2000 primarily due
to:

 o an increase in the market prices of purchased power, natural gas, and
 fuel oil; and
 o an increase in volume due to an increase in demand.

The increase in fuel and purchased power expenses was partially offset by a
 23.5 million adjustment to the Entergy Arkansas deferred fuel balance to
record deferred fuel costs that Entergy Arkansas expects to recover in the
future through its fuel adjustment clause.

 In 1999, fuel cost recovery revenues increased primarily due to:

 o an increased fuel factor and a new fuel surcharge implemented by
 Entergy Gulf States in the Texas jurisdiction in 1999;
 o recovery of higher-priced fuel and purchased power costs at Entergy
 Louisiana due to nuclear outages at Waterford 3 in 1999; and
 o an increase in the energy cost recovery rate effective April 1999 and
 the completion of a customer refund obligation in 1998 which lowered
 1998 fuel cost recovery at Entergy Arkansas.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, fuel and purchased power expenses increased due to:

 o higher natural gas and purchased power prices as well as increased gas
 usage at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana;
 o higher fuel recovery due to an increased fuel factor and fuel
 surcharge in Entergy Gulf States' Texas jurisdiction; and
 o an increased energy cost recovery rate in 1999 and the completion of a
 customer refund obligation in 1998 which lowered 1998 fuel cost
 recovery at Entergy Arkansas.

These increases were partially offset by decreased fuel expenses at Entergy
Mississippi as a result of lower total generation.

Other effects on revenue

 Electric operating revenues also increased in 2000 due to:

 o increased sales volume due to increased usage by industrial,
 commercial, and residential customers;
 o increased sales due to weather conditions in 2000;
 o increased generation and subsequent sales from River Bend in 2000 as a
 result of a refueling outage in 1999; and
 o higher fuel prices included in unbilled revenues.

 Electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather, and usually
peak in the summer. The effect of colder than normal winter weather
conditions in 2000 contributed to the increase in electric sales. In 2000,
electricity sales volume in the domestic utility companies' service
territories increased 1,522.7 GWH due to the impact of weather conditions.
Electric sales volume also increased 1,173.9 GWH due to higher demand by
industrial, commercial, and residential customers. The number of customers
in the domestic utility companies' service territories remained constant
during these periods.

 Electric operating revenues also increased in 1999 primarily due to a
change in estimated unbilled revenues, which more closely aligned the fuel
component of unbilled revenues with regulatory treatment. This increase
was partially offset by a decline in sales for resale due to the loss of
certain municipal and co-op customer contracts at Entergy Arkansas.

Other operation and maintenance expenses

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased 95.8 million in
2000 primarily due to:

 o increased property insurance expenses of 22.8 million primarily due
 to storm damage accruals related to the December 2000 ice storms at
 Entergy Arkansas and due to changes in storm damage reserve
 amortization at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy
 Mississippi in accordance with regulatory treatment;
 o increased customer service expenses of 11.4 million primarily related
 to spending on vegetation management at Entergy Arkansas;
 o increased nuclear expenses of 17.2 million primarily from Entergy
 Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States;
 o an increase of 28.4 million primarily due to an increase in legal and
 contract expenses for the transition to retail open access at Entergy
 Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States and for legal services employed for
 rate-related proceedings at Entergy Louisiana; and
 o an increase of 21.9 million in plant maintenance expense primarily at
 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy
 Mississippi.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The increase in other operation and maintenance expenses in 2000 was
 partially offset by the following:

 o a 9.5 million larger nuclear insurance refund in 2000 compared to
 1999; and
 o a decrease in injury and damages claims of 12.3 million.

 In 1999, other operation and maintenance expenses increased 68.3
million primarily due to:

 o increased customer service and reliability improvements throughout the
 system;
 o increases in storm damage accruals, employee pension and benefits, and
 environmental expenses; and
 o increases in maintenance work at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy
 Mississippi.

Depreciation and amortization

 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 44.5 million in 2000
primarily due to:

 o the review of plant-in-service dates for consistency with regulatory
 treatment that reduced depreciation expense by 17.7 million in August
 1999;
 o increased depreciation of 14.0 million associated with the principal
 payment on the sale and leaseback of Grand Gulf 1; and
 o net capital additions primarily at Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
 Mississippi.

 In 1999, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 32.8
million due to:

 o lower depreciation at Entergy Gulf States as a result of the write-
 down of the River Bend abeyed plant as required by the Texas rate
 settlement and a review of plant in-service dates; and
 o reduction in principal payments associated with the sale and leaseback
 in 1989 of a portion of Grand Gulf 1 at System Energy.

Other regulatory charges

 In 1999, other regulatory charges decreased due to:

 o lower accruals for transition costs in 1999 at Entergy Arkansas;
 o a change in the amortization period for deferred River Bend finance
 charges in the Entergy Gulf States' Texas retail jurisdiction; and
 o deferral of Year 2000 costs at Entergy Gulf States and Entergy
 Louisiana in accordance with an LPSC order.

 These decreases were partially offset by increased charges at System
Energy as a result of the implementation of the GGART at Entergy Arkansas
and Entergy Mississippi.

Interest charges

 Interest charges decreased 21.4 million in 2000 primarily due to an
adjustment in 1999 at System Energy to the interest recorded for the
potential refund to customers of its proposed rate increase pending at
FERC. System Energy's proposed rate increase is discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, interest charges decreased due to the retirement and
refinancing of long-term debt, partially offset by the interest recorded on
the potential refund of System Energy's proposed rate increase.

Competitive Businesses

 The changes in operating revenues for the competitive businesses by
operating segments in 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

 Power Marketing & Trading (117.9) (605.7)
 Domestic Non-Utility Nuclear 188.4 104.6
 Global Power Development 201.4 0.1
 Entergy London and CitiPower - (2,215.1)
 Other (16.9) (108.2)
 ------ ---------
 Total 255.0 (2,824.3)
 ====== =========

 The decrease in 2000 for the power marketing and trading business
results from decreased electricity and gas trading volumes. Although
revenues decreased, the power marketing and trading business had an
increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2000,
primarily due to:

 o decreased purchased power expenses as discussed below;
 o improved trading performance in electricity;
 o increased long-term marketing of electricity; and
 o trading gains in natural gas in the current year due to natural gas
 prices reaching record high levels compared to trading losses in the
 prior year.

 The decrease in 1999 for the power marketing and trading business
resulted primarily from decreased electricity trading volume due to
significantly warmer weather in 1998 than in 1999. However, the impact on
net income from these decreased revenues was more than offset by decreased
fuel and purchased power expenses as discussed below, resulting in a
smaller operating loss for this business for the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to 1998.

 The increase in 2000 for the domestic non-utility nuclear business was
primarily from the operation of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 3, and
FitzPatrick plants. Pilgrim was purchased in July 1999 and Indian Point 3
and FitzPatrick were purchased in November 2000. The increase in 1999 for
the domestic non-utility nuclear business was primarily from the operation
of Pilgrim.

 The increase in 2000 for the global power development business was
primarily due to the results from its interest in Highland Energy, which
was acquired in June 2000, and the results from the Saltend plant, which
began commercial operation in late November 2000. However, the impact on
net income from increased revenues from the global power development
business is offset by increased fuel and purchased power as discussed
below.

 The decrease in 1999 for Entergy London and CitiPower was due to the
sale of these businesses in 1998.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fuel and purchased power expenses

 Fuel costs constitute the largest expense for the competitive
businesses. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased 20.4 million in
2000, primarily due to Highland Energy's operations and increased expenses
for the domestic non-utility nuclear business from Pilgrim contributing for
all of 2000 compared with only six months in 1999, along with the
acquisition of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick in November 2000.

 Partially offsetting the overall increase in 2000 in fuel and
purchased power expenses is the decrease of 206.9 million from the power
marketing and trading business attributable to decreased electricity and
gas trading volumes.

 Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased in 1999 primarily due to:

 o the sales of London Electricity and CitiPower;
 o decreased electricity trading volume in the power marketing and
 trading business; and
 o a 44 million 27 million net of tax) counterparty default incurred
 in 1998 by the power marketing and trading business.

These decreases were partially offset by increased gas trading volume in
the power marketing and trading business.

Other operation and maintenance expenses

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased 98.6 million in
2000 primarily from the operation of Pilgrim for all of 2000 compared with
only six months in 1999, partially offset by a decrease in the elimination
of mark-to-market profits on intercompany power transactions.

 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased 349.7 million in
1999 primarily due to the sales of London Electricity and CitiPower. The
decrease was partially offset by:

 o an increase for the power marketing and trading business resulting
 primarily from increased risk management and back-office support; and
 o an increase for the domestic non-utility nuclear business resulting
 primarily from the operation of Pilgrim for six months in 1999.

Other income

 Other income decreased 38.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2000 primarily due to a 42.5 million 27.6 million net of tax) write-down
in 2000 to their estimated fair values of investments in Latin American
projects. The decrease is also due to the absence of the following items
that occurred in 1999:

 o a 26.7 million 17 million net of tax) gain on the sale of Entergy
 Power Edesur Holdings in June 1999;
 o a 12.9 million 8 million net of tax) gain on the sale of Entergy
 Hyperion Telecommunications in June 1999;
 o a 22.0 million 6.4 million net of tax) gain on the sale of Entergy
 Security, Inc. in January 1999, including a true-up recognized in
 December 1999;
 o a 7.6 million 4.9 million net of tax) favorable adjustment to the
 final sale price of CitiPower in January 1999; and
 o a more favorable experience on warranty reserves in 1999 for the
 businesses sold during 1998.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Partially offsetting the overall decrease was the following in 2000:

 o liquidated damages of 55.1 million 38.6 million net of tax)
 received from the Saltend contractor as compensation for lost operating
 margin from the Saltend plant due to construction delays;
 o an increase of 16.2 million in interest and dividend income; and
 o a 20.5 million 13.3 million net of tax) gain in June 2000 on the
 sale of the global power development business' investment in the
 Freestone project located in Fairfield, Texas.

 Other income decreased in 1999 primarily due to the gains recorded in
1998 on the sales of Entergy London of 327.3 million 246.8 million net
of tax) and CitiPower of 29.8 million 19.3 million net of tax). The
decrease in 1999 was partially offset by the following:

 o interest income of 58.5 million in 1999 on the proceeds of the sales
 of Entergy London and CitiPower;
 o gains on sales of businesses in 1999, as listed above;
 o a 68.6 million 35.9 million net of tax) loss on the sale of
 Efficient Solutions, Inc. (formerly Entergy Integrated Solutions,
 Inc.) in September 1998;
 o 32.8 million 21.3 million net of tax) of write-downs of Entergy's
 investments in two Asian projects in 1998; and
 o favorable experience on warranty reserves for the businesses sold
 during 1998.

Interest charges

 Other interest charges increased 29.0 million in 2000 primarily due
to:

 o the accretion of the decommissioning liability associated with
 Pilgrim; and
 o increased interest expense of 16.0 million related to borrowings on
 Entergy Corporation's short-term credit facility.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 40.3 ,
37.5 , and 25.3 , respectively. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to
the recognition in 1999 of deferred tax benefits related to the expected
utilization of foreign tax credits resulting in lower income taxes.

 The effective income tax rate increased in 1999, partially offset by
the recognition of foreign tax credits discussed above, primarily due to
the following in 1998:

 o the recognition of 44 million of deferred tax benefits in 1998
 related to expected utilization of Entergy's capital loss
 carryforwards; and
 o a 31.7 million reduction in taxes because of reductions in the UK
 corporation tax rate from 31 to 30 in the third quarter of 1998.

financial position of Entergy Arkansas, Inc. at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States

statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

February 1, 2001

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

 Net income increased in 2000 primarily due to increased electric
operating revenues and lower regulatory charges, partially offset by
increased operation and maintenance expenses.

 Net income decreased in 1999 primarily due to decreased electric
operating revenues and increased operation and maintenance expenses,
partially offset by lower regulatory charges.

Revenues and Sales

 The changes in electric operating revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Description 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

Base revenues 6.5) 4.5
Rate riders (21.8) (68.2)
Fuel cost recovery 61.8 36.4
Sales volume/weather 30.8 3.8
Other revenue (including unbilled) 47.6 (25.2)
Sales for resale 108.8 (18.1)
 ------ ------
Total 220.7 66.8)
 ====== ======

Rate riders

 Rate rider revenues have no material effect on net income because
specific incurred expenses offset them.

 In 2000, rate rider revenues decreased as a result of the decreased
ANO Decommissioning and Grand Gulf rate riders, both of which became
effective in January 2000. The ANO Decommissioning rider allows Entergy
Arkansas to recover the decommissioning costs associated with ANO 1 and 2.
The Grand Gulf rate rider allows Entergy Arkansas to recover its
recoverable share of operating costs for Grand Gulf 1.

 In 1999, rate rider revenues decreased as a result of a revised Grand
Gulf rider, which includes the completion of the Grand Gulf 1 phase-in plan
in November 1998, partially offset by the Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery
Tariff (GGART). The GGART is designed to allow Entergy Arkansas to pay
down a portion of its Grand Gulf purchased power obligation in advance of
the implementation of retail access in Arkansas. The rider and GGART
became effective with the first billing cycle in January 1999. The GGART
is discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Fuel cost recovery

 Entergy Arkansas is allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates that are
recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues
collected and current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as
deferred fuel costs on Entergy Arkansas' financial statements such that
these costs generally have no net effect on earnings.

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fuel cost recovery revenues increased in 2000 primarily due to an
increase in the energy cost rate in April 2000, which is determined
annually by a formula in the energy cost recovery rider (Rider ECR) in
April 2000. The increase in the energy cost rate allows Entergy Arkansas
to recover previously deferred fuel expenses. Rider ECR is discussed
further in Note 2 to the financial statements.

 Fuel cost recovery revenues increased in 1999 due to an increase in
the energy cost recovery rider, effective in April 1999, and the completion
of a customer refund obligation in 1998, which lowered 1998 fuel cost
recovery.

Sales volume/weather

 Sales volume increased in 2000 primarily due to increased usage by
industrial, commercial, and residential customers, as well as the effect of
more favorable weather on the residential and commercial sectors.

Other revenue (including unbilled)

 In 2000, other revenue increased primarily as a result of a change in
estimated unbilled revenues and a 13.4 million adjustment to third quarter
1999 unbilled revenues that excluded fuel recovery and rate rider revenues
from the unbilled balance in accordance with regulatory treatment. The
change in estimate is discussed below. Unbilled revenues also increased
due to greater unbilled volume and the addition of unbilled revenue for
wholesale customers to the unbilled balance.

 In 1999, other revenue decreased primarily as a result of a change in
estimated unbilled revenues in the second quarter and, to a lesser extent,
less favorable weather for the unbilled period of 1999. The changed
estimate more closely aligns the fuel component of unbilled revenue with
its regulatory treatment. Comparative impacts are also affected by
seasonal impacts on demand.

Sales for resale

 In 2000, sales for resale increased primarily due to an increase in
the market price of electricity.

 In 1999, sales for resale decreased due to the loss of certain
municipal and co-op customer contracts.

Expenses

Fuel and purchased power expenses

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to:

 o an increase in the market price of natural gas;
 o an increase in the market price of purchased power; and
 o increased purchased power volume due to increased demand for
 electricity and to offset decreased nuclear generation due to
 maintenance, inspection, and refueling outages during the year.

The increased fuel and purchased power expenses were partially offset by a
 23.5 million adjustment to the deferred fuel balance as a result of the
1999 and 2000 ECR filings. This adjustment reflects deferred costs that
Entergy Arkansas expects to recover in the future.

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to:

 o higher-priced gas generation as a result of refueling outages at ANO 1
 and ANO 2, a mid-cycle maintenance outage at ANO 2, limited coal
 capability at White Bluff during parts of the year, and displacement
 of higher priced purchased power;
 o increased purchased power costs due to higher market prices in July
 and August 1999; and
 o an increase in the energy cost recovery rate in April 1999 and the
 completion of a customer refund obligation in 1998 which lowered 1998
 fuel cost recovery.

The increase in the energy cost recovery rate allows Entergy Arkansas to
recover previously under-recovered fuel expenses.

Other operation and maintenance

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased for 2000 primarily
due to:

 o an increase in property damage expense of 14.5 million due to
 December 2000 ice storms;
 o an increase in nuclear expenses of 7.9 million related to maintenance
 and inspection outages and the steam generator replacement project at
 ANO 2;
 o an increase in spending of 7.1 million on vegetation management;
 o an increase in plant maintenance expense of 5.0 million; and
 o an increase in spending of 4.5 million for outside services employed
 related primarily to legal and contract services for transition work.

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased for 1999 primarily
due to:

 o an increase in customer service costs of 12.9 million related to tree
 trimming around power lines;
 o an increase in plant maintenance costs of 7.9 million;
 o an increase in employee pension and benefits costs of 5.0 million;
 and
 o an increase in administrative and general salaries expense of 4.5
 million.

Decommissioning

 Decommissioning expense decreased primarily due to a true-up of the
decommissioning liability in June 2000 for previous over-accruals.

Other regulatory charges (credits)

 In 2000, other regulatory credits increased primarily due to:

 o a 16.6 million under-recovery of Grand Gulf 1 costs as a result of a
 decreased rate rider that became effective in January 2000 as ordered
 by the APSC;
 o the recording of a regulatory asset for certain transition costs
 expected to be recovered in a customer transition tariff; and
 o accruals in 1999 of excess earnings in the transition cost account.

Accruals previously made in 2000 for estimated excess earnings were
reversed in order to offset expenses related to the December ice storms.

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, other regulatory charges decreased primarily as a result of
lower accruals for transition costs in 1999, partially offset by the 1998
reversal of the 1997 reserve recorded for the low-level radioactive waste
facility.

 The transition cost account and the December 2000 ice storms are
discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Amortization of rate deferrals

 In 1999, amortization of rate deferrals decreased due to the November
1998 completion of the Grand Gulf 1 rate phase-in plan. These phase-ins
had no material effect on net income.

Other

Interest charges

 Interest charges increased in 2000 due to the issuance of 100 million
of long-term debt in March 2000.

 Interest charges decreased in 1999 due to the retirement of certain
long-term debt and decreased borrowings for funds used during construction.
These decreases were partially offset by an adjustment for interest expense
on an income tax settlement from prior years.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 42.3 ,
43.8 , and 39.1 , respectively.

 The effective income tax rate increased in 1999 primarily due to
accelerated tax depreciation deductions for which deferred taxes have not
been previously normalized, reflecting a shorter tax life on certain
assets.

and pages 147 through 209) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. at December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

ENTERGY GULF STATES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

Net income increased in 2000 primarily due to increased sales volume,
increased unbilled revenue, increased wholesale revenue, and decreased
regulatory reserves.

 Net income increased in 1999 primarily due to increased unbilled
revenues, decreased provisions for rate refunds in 1999, decreased
depreciation and amortization expenses, and decreased interest expense,
partially offset by increased operation and maintenance expenses.

Revenues and Sales

Electric operating revenues

 The changes in electric operating revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Description 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

Base revenues 83.2) 146.4
Fuel cost recovery 342.5 104.9
Sales volume/weather 40.7 1.0
Other revenue (including unbilled) 29.8 31.3
Sales for resale 58.7 21.2
 ------ ------
Total 388.5 304.8
 ====== ======

Base revenues

 In 2000, base revenues decreased primarily due to the reversal in 1999
of regulatory reserves discussed below associated with the accelerated
amortization of accounting order deferrals and rate refunds in conjunction
with the Texas rate settlement.

 In 1999, base revenues increased due to:

 o a 93.6 million reversal in June 1999 of regulatory reserves
 associated with the accelerated amortization of accounting order
 deferrals in conjunction with the settlement agreement in Entergy
 Gulf States' Texas November 1996 and 1998 rate filings. The settlement
 agreement was approved by the PUCT in June 1999. The net income effect
 of this reversal is largely offset by the amortization of rate deferrals
 discussed below; and
 o a reduction in the amount of reserves recorded in 1999 compared to
 1998 for the anticipated effects of rate proceedings in Texas.

 Partially offsetting these increases in 1999 were:

 o annual base rate reductions of 87 million and 18 million that were
 implemented for Louisiana retail customers in February and August 1998,
 respectively;
 o annual base rate reductions of 69 million and 4.2 million that were
 implemented for Texas retail customers in December 1998 and March 1999,
 respectively; and
 o reserves recorded in the Louisiana jurisdiction in 1999 for the
 estimated outcomes of earnings reviews.

ENTERGY GULF STATES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The LPSC and PUCT rate issues are discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Fuel cost recovery

 Entergy Gulf States is allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates that are
recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues
collected and current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as
deferred fuel costs on Entergy Gulf States' financial statements such that
these costs generally have no net effect on earnings.

 In 2000, fuel cost recovery revenues increased primarily due to
increased market prices for fuel and purchased power, resulting in an
increased recovery of 226.7 million in the Louisiana jurisdiction. Fuel
cost recovery revenues increased in the Texas jurisdiction by 82.4 million
due to a higher fuel recovery factor that became effective in September
1999 and by 33.4 million due to a fuel surcharge implemented in January
2000.

 In 1999, fuel cost recovery revenues increased due to a higher fuel
factor in 1999 and a fuel surcharge implemented in February 1999 in the
Texas jurisdiction. This increase was partially offset by reduced fuel
recovery in the Louisiana jurisdiction primarily due to lower fuel and
purchased power costs in 1999.

Sales volume/weather

 In 2000, sales volume increased due to more favorable weather
affecting residential and commercial customers, as well as an increase in
the number of residential and commercial customers.

Other revenue

 In 2000, other revenue increased primarily due to increased unbilled
revenues due to the effect of a change in estimate on unbilled revenue,
more favorable weather, and increased sales volume.

 In 1999, other revenue increased primarily due to a change in
estimated unbilled revenues. The estimate more closely aligns the fuel
component of unbilled revenues with regulatory treatment.

Sales for resale

 In 2000, sales for resale increased primarily due to increased sales
volume including sales of energy from the non-regulated piece of River Bend
to affiliated companies. Sales for resale also increased due to increased
generation, particularly nuclear generation, resulting in more energy
available for resale. Nuclear generation was down in 1999 as a result of a
nuclear refueling outage.

 In 1999, sales for resale increased primarily due to increased sales
to associated companies due to higher market prices and outages at
affiliate plants in 1999.

Gas and steam operating revenues

 Gas operating revenues increased in 2000 due to an increase in the
market price for natural gas as well as increased sales volume in the
residential and commercial sectors.

ENTERGY GULF STATES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, gas operating revenues decreased primarily due to lower
prices of gas purchased for resale as well as decreased usage as a result
of warmer winter weather, particularly in the residential and commercial
sectors.

 In 2000 and in 1999, steam operating revenues decreased primarily due
to a new lease arrangement that began in June 1999 for the Louisiana
Station generating facility. Under the terms of this new lease, revenues
and expenses are now classified as other income. The previous
classifications were steam operating revenues and other operation and
maintenance expenses.

Expenses

Fuel and purchased power

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to:

 o higher market prices for gas and purchased power;
 o increased nuclear generation; and
 o an adjustment in March 2000 of 11.5 million to the Texas jurisdiction
 deferred fuel balance as a result of a fuel reconciliation settlement
 with the PUCT.

 In 1999, fuel and purchased power expenses increased due to:

 o increased gas expenses resulting from a shift to gas generation during
 the first six months of 1999 because of the reduced availability of
 Nelson 6 and an extended refueling outage at River Bend;
 o increased purchased power expenses due to higher market prices; and
 o a higher fuel factor and fuel surcharge in the Texas jurisdiction in
 1999.

Other operation and maintenance expenses

 In 2000, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to increased expenses of 12.6 million on outside services employed
related to legal and contract services for transition work and increased
nuclear plant operations costs of 5.8 million. These increases were
largely offset by decreases in pension and benefits costs of 7.3 million
and decreased environmental reserves of 5.7 million.

 In 1999, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to increased spending of 8.4 million for vegetation management,
increased miscellaneous customer expenses of 2.5 million, and due to
increased property and environmental reserves of 4.9 million. These
increases were offset primarily by decreases of 8.8 million for pension
and benefits expenses.

Depreciation and amortization

 In 2000, depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a
review of plant-in-service dates for consistency with regulatory treatment
reducing depreciation expense by 6.7 million in 1999, as well as
additional depreciation expense related to net capital additions in 2000.

ENTERGY GULF STATES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, depreciation and amortization decreased due to:

 o lower depreciation as a result of the write-down of the River Bend
 abeyed plant as required by the Texas rate settlement;
 o reduced amortization of the River Bend Unit 2 cancellation loss as a
 result of the completion of amortization for the Louisiana portion of
 the loss and the reduction in amortization of the Texas portion in
 accordance with a PUCT rate order; and
 o lower depreciation due to a review of plant in-service dates for
 consistency with regulatory treatment.

Other regulatory credits

 In 2000, other regulatory credits decreased due to:

 o the amortization of the Year 2000 regulatory asset deferred in 1999;
 and
 o the completion of the amortization of the deferred financing costs in
 accordance with the December 1998 rate order settlement with the PUCT.

 In 1999, other regulatory credits increased due to:

 o change in the amortization period for deferred River Bend finance
 charges for the Texas retail jurisdiction in accordance with the Texas
 settlement agreement; and
 o deferral of Year 2000 costs in accordance with an LPSC order. These
 costs are to be amortized over a five-year period.

Amortization of rate deferrals

 In 2000, the amortization of rate deferrals decreased primarily due to
the large reduction in the rate deferral balance upon the PUCT's approval
in June 1999 of the Texas rate settlement. This settlement increased
amortization expense in 1999 but was offset by increased revenues.

 In 1999, the amortization of rate deferrals increased due to the
reduction of accounting order deferrals in accordance with the June 1999
Texas settlement agreement. This settlement substantially reduced the
unamortized balance of rate deferrals, while decreasing the amortization
period for the remaining deferrals from a ten-year period to a three-year
period.

Other

Other income

 In 2000, other income decreased primarily due to decreased non-utility
operating income from Louisiana Station as well as the 1999 adjustment to
the depreciation balance of River Bend abeyed plant.

ENTERGY GULF STATES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Interest charges

 In 2000, interest charges increased as a result of the issuance of
 300 million of long term debt in 2000.

 In 1999, interest charges decreased as a result of the retirement,
redemption, and refinancing of certain long-term debt in 1998 and 1999, as
well as lower accruals of interest on certain Louisiana fuel and earnings
reviews in 1998.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 are 36.5 ,
37.6 , and 40.6 , respectively.

 The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 1999 is due to
accelerated tax depreciation deductions for which deferred taxes have not
been previously normalized, reflecting a shorter tax life on certain
assets.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

 Net income decreased in 2000 primarily due to increased depreciation
and amortization costs, increased other operation and maintenance expenses,
and decreased unbilled revenue and other regulatory credits, partially
offset by decreased provisions for rate refunds.

 Net income increased in 1999 primarily due to increased unbilled
revenue and other regulatory credits, and decreased nuclear refueling
outage expenses and interest charges, partially offset by increased
provisions for rate refunds.

Revenues and Sales

 The changes in electric operating revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

Sales for resale (20.7) 11.6

 ====== =====

Base revenues

 In 2000, base revenues decreased primarily due to additional formula
rate plan reductions in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors, partially offset by lower accruals for potential rate refunds.

 In 1999, base revenues decreased primarily due to accruals for
potential rate refunds.

Fuel cost recovery revenues

 Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates that are
recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues
collected and current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as
deferred fuel costs on Entergy Louisiana's financial statements such that
these costs generally have no net effect on earnings.

 In 2000, fuel cost recovery revenues increased as a result of higher
fuel and purchased power expenses primarily due to the increased market
price of natural gas.

 In 1999, fuel cost recovery revenues increased due to a shift from
lower priced nuclear fuel to higher priced gas and purchased power due to
nuclear outages at Waterford 3 in 1999.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales volume/weather

 In 2000, sales volume increased primarily due to more favorable
weather in the residential and commercial sectors, and increased usage by
industrial customers.

 In 1999, sales volume decreased primarily due to less favorable
weather, partially offset by increased usage by residential and industrial
customers.

Other revenue (including unbilled)

 In 2000, other revenue decreased primarily due to the effect of a
change in estimate on 1999 unbilled revenues, in addition to rent received
for electric property in 1999.

 In 1999, other revenue increased primarily due to a change in
estimated unbilled revenues. The changed estimate more closely aligns the
fuel component of unbilled revenues with regulatory treatment.

Sales for resale

 In 2000, sales for resale decreased as a result of increased sales to
retail customers resulting in less electricity available for resale.

 In 1999, sales for resale increased as a result of increased sales to
affiliates due to outages at affiliate plants, in addition to favorable
unit prices.

Expenses

Fuel and purchased power expenses

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power expenses increased due to an
increase in the market price of natural gas.

 In 1999, fuel and purchased power expenses increased due to:

 o higher natural gas prices;
 o higher purchased power market prices; and
 o a shift in generation from lower priced nuclear fuel to higher priced
 gas as a result of refueling and other outages at Waterford 3.

Other operation and maintenance expenses

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased in 2000 primarily
due to:

 o an increase in expenses from maintenance and planned maintenance
 outages at Waterford 3 and certain fossil plants of 17.9 million;
 o an increase of 11 million in outside services employed for legal
 services for potential rate actions; and
 o an increase in property insurance reserves of 5 million primarily
 due to changes in storm damage reserves effective August 1999.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The overall increase in other operation and maintenance expenses in
2000 was partially offset by the following:

 o a decrease in injury and damages claims of 3.5 million;
 o a decrease of 3 million in benefits expense; and
 o higher nuclear insurance refunds of 1.8 million.

Nuclear refueling outage expenses

 In 1999, nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased as a result of
the amortization of higher outage expenses in 1998 due to the extended
nuclear refueling outage in 1997.

Depreciation and amortization

 In 2000, depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily
due to a review of plant-in-service dates for consistency with regulatory
treatment reducing depreciation expense by 3.4 million in August 1999, as
well as depreciation expense related to net capital additions in 2000.

Other regulatory charges (credits)

 In 2000, other regulatory credits decreased due to the LPSC-required
deferral in 1999 of Year 2000 costs and the amortization of these costs in
2000. The deferred costs are being recovered over a five-year period.

Other

Other income

 In 2000, other income increased primarily due to interest recorded on
deferred fuel costs.

Interest charges

 In 2000 and 1999, interest on long-term debt decreased primarily due
to the refinancing and net redemption of 77 million of long-term debt in
1999. The decrease in 2000 is partially offset by interest expense
incurred on the issuance of 150 million of long-term debt in May 2000.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 40.9 ,
38.9 , and 37.8 , respectively.

1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

 Net income decreased in 2000 primarily due to increases in other
operation and maintenance expenses, interest expense, depreciation expense,
and an increase in the effective income tax rate. These decreases were
partially offset by increases in unbilled revenues and sales volume.

 Net income decreased in 1999 primarily due to a decrease in unbilled
revenues and an increase in other operation and maintenance expenses.

Revenues and Sales

 The changes in electric operating revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Description 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

Base revenues 3.8) 9.7)
Grand Gulf rate rider 4.7 (95.9)
Fuel cost recovery 54.8 (11.6)
Sales volume/weather 9.6 4.1
Other revenue (including unbilled) 23.9 (12.1)
Sales for resale 15.4 (18.3)
 ------ -------
Total 104.6 143.5)
 ====== =======

Base revenues

 Base revenues decreased in 2000 primarily due to an annual rate
reduction of 13.3 million under the formula rate plan, which was effective
May 1999.

 Base revenues decreased in 1999 primarily due to the May 1999 rate
reduction and an annual rate reduction of 6.6 million under the formula
rate plan, which was effective May 1998. The formula rate plan reduction
is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Grand Gulf rate rider

 Rate rider revenues have no material effect on net income because
specific incurred expenses offset them.

 In 1999, Grand Gulf rate rider revenue decreased as a result of a new
rider which became effective October 1, 1998. This new rider eliminated
revenues attributable to the Grand Gulf phase-in plan, which was completed
in September 1998. However, this decrease was partially offset by the
Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery Tariff (GGART), which also became effective
October 1, 1998. This tariff provides for accelerated recovery of a
portion of Entergy Mississippi's Grand Gulf purchased power obligation.
The GGART is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fuel cost recovery

 Entergy Mississippi is allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates, recorded as
fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues collected and
current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as deferred fuel costs
on Entergy Mississippi's financial statements such that these costs
generally have no net effect on earnings.

 In 2000, fuel cost recovery revenues increased primarily due to the
MPSC's review and subsequent increase of Entergy Mississippi's energy cost
recovery rider effective in January 2000.

 In 1999, fuel cost recovery revenues decreased primarily due to the
MPSC's review and subsequent decrease of Entergy Mississippi's energy cost
recovery rider effective in January 1999.

Sales volume/weather

 In 2000, sales volume increased as a result of increased usage in the
residential and commercial sectors, as well as the effect of more favorable
weather in the residential sector.

 In 1999, sales volume increased as a result of sales growth in the
residential and commercial sectors, partially offset by unfavorable
weather.

Other revenue (including unbilled)

 In 2000, other revenue increased primarily due to the effect of
favorable weather in 2000 and the effect of a change in estimate on 1999
unbilled revenues.

 In 1999, other revenue decreased primarily due to the effect of a
change in estimate on unbilled revenues. The changed estimate more closely
aligned the fuel component of unbilled revenues with regulatory treatment.

Sales for resale

 In 2000, sales for resale increased primarily due to an increase in
the average price of energy supplied for resale sales. The increase was
partially offset by less energy available for resale sales due to plant
outages early in 2000, which resulted in lower sales volume.

 In 1999, sales for resale decreased as a result of decreased oil
generation due to plant outages. The decrease is also due to higher sales
to associated companies in 1998 as a result of an outage at Entergy
Arkansas.

Expenses

Fuel and purchased power expenses

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to
an increase in the market prices of oil and natural gas.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 1999, fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to:

 o a decrease in total energy consumption requirements; and
 o planned and unplanned plant outages during the year.

 The decrease in fuel and purchased power expenses in 1999 was
partially offset by:

 o a shift from lower priced oil generation to higher priced gas
 generation as a result of plant outages in 1999;
 o an increase in the market price of purchased power; and
 o the GGART implemented by System Energy in October 1998 resulting in an
 increase in the price of System Energy purchased power.

Other operation and maintenance

 In 2000, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to:

 o an increase in property insurance expense of 9.3 million primarily
 due to a change in storm damage reserve amortization in accordance
 with regulatory treatment; and
 o an increase in maintenance of electric plant of 7.0 million.

 In 1999, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to:

 o planned and unplanned plant outages in 1999 of 9.1 million;
 o an increase in customer service and reliability improvement spending
 of 4.0 million;
 o an increase in employee benefit expense of 3.8 million; and
 o an increase in casualty reserves of 4.2 million.

Depreciation and Amortization

 In 2000, depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to a
review of plant-in-service dates for consistency with regulatory treatment
reducing depreciation expense by 2.6 million in August 1999. Capital
additions in 1999 and 2000 also contributed to the increase.

Other regulatory credits

 In 2000, other regulatory credits decreased due to a decrease in the
deferral of Grand Gulf 1 expenses associated with the System Energy rate
increase.

 In 1999, other regulatory credits increased due to greater under-
recovery of Grand Gulf 1 related costs as a result of the new rider
implemented in October 1998.

Amortization of rate deferrals

 In 1999, amortization of rate deferrals decreased due to the
completion of the Grand Gulf 1 rate phase-in plan in September 1998. These
phase-ins had no material effect on net income.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Other

Interest and other charges

 Interest on long-term debt increased in 2000 primarily due to the
issuance of 120 million of long-term debt in February 2000.

 Interest on long-term debt decreased in 1999 primarily due to the
refinancing of certain long-term debt.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 37.0 ,
29.7 , and 30.9 , respectively.

 The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2000 is due to the
effect that the distribution of the Entergy Corporation income tax benefit
had on the 1999 effective income tax rate. In 1999, a tax benefit was
booked related to the 1998 tax return.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

 Net income decreased slightly in 2000 primarily due to increased other
operation and maintenance expenses.

 Net income increased slightly in 1999 primarily due to an increase in
unbilled revenues and sales volume, partially offset by an increase in
other operation and maintenance expenses.

Revenues and Sales

Electric operating revenues

 The changes in electric operating revenues for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

 Increase/(Decrease)
 Description 2000 1999
 (In Millions)

Base revenues 4.0 11.3)
Fuel cost recovery 62.6 (4.6)
Sales volume/weather 2.1 1.7
Other revenue (including unbilled) 4.2 5.5
Sales for resale 15.4 3.7
 ----- -----
Total 88.3 5.0)
 ===== =====

Base revenues

 In 2000, base revenues increased primarily due to a decrease in
provision for rate refunds accrued for potential rate matters.

 In 1999, base revenues decreased primarily due to base rate reductions
effective January 1999 and rate refund provisions accrued for potential
rate matters.

Fuel cost recovery

 Entergy New Orleans is allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric rates, recorded as
fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues collected and
current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as deferred fuel costs
on Entergy New Orleans' financial statements such that these costs
generally have no effect on earnings.

 In 2000, fuel cost recovery increased primarily due to the increased
market price of natural gas.

 In 1999, fuel cost recovery revenues decreased due to an under-
recovery of fuel expenses resulting from higher market prices in 1999
compared to the prior year.

ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Other revenue (including unbilled)

 In 2000 and 1999, other revenue increased primarily due to the effect
of favorable weather and higher fuel and purchased power costs on unbilled
revenues.

Sales for resale

 In 2000, sales for resale increased due to an increase in the average
price of electricity supplied for resale sales, coupled with an increase in
affiliated sales volume.

 In 1999, sales for resale increased due to favorable unit prices
resulting from increased purchased power and gas market prices, coupled
with an increase in affiliated sales volume.

Gas operating revenues

 In 2000, gas operating revenues increased primarily due to the
increased market price of natural gas.

Expenses

Fuel and purchased power expenses

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to
the increased market price of natural gas.

Other operation and maintenance expenses

 In 2000, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to:

 o an increase in uncollectible accounts expense for miscellaneous accounts
 receivable of 1.3 million;
 o an increase in maintenance of fossil plants of 1.1 million; and
 o an increase in advertising expenses of 1.3 million.

 In 1999, other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily
due to:

 o an increase in spending for customer service and reliability
 improvements of 3.0 million; and
 o an increase in customer collection expenses of 2.2 million.

Taxes other than income taxes

 In 2000, taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to
increased local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenue.

ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Other regulatory credits

 In 2000, other regulatory credits decreased due to an over-recovery of
Grand Gulf 1 related costs in 2000 compared to an under-recovery in 1999
and the deferral of Year 2000 costs in 1999.

 In 1999, other regulatory credits increased due to a greater under-
recovery of Grand Gulf 1 costs in 1999.

Amortization of rate deferrals

 In 2000 and 1999, amortization of rate deferrals decreased due to a
scheduled rate change in the amortization of Grand Gulf 1 phase-in
expenses. The Grand Gulf 1 phase-in plan will be completed in 2001.

Other

Other income

 Other income increased in 1999 primarily due to:

 o an increase in AFUDC resulting from increased capital charges on
 projects in 1999; and
 o increased interest related to the Grand Gulf 1 rate deferral plan.

 The Grand Gulf 1 rate deferral plan is discussed in more detail in
Note 2 to the financial statements.

Interest and other charges

 In 2000, interest on long-term debt increased primarily due to the
issuance of 30 million of long-term debt in July 2000.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 41.2 ,
40.7 , and 38.4 respectively.

 The increase in the effective income tax rate for 1999 was primarily
due to the increase in pre-tax income reducing the impact of permanent
differences and flow through items.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of
System Energy Resources, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements
of income, of retained earnings and of cash flows (pages 140 through 145
and pages 147 through 209) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of System Energy Resources, Inc. at December 31, 2000
and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income

 Net income increased in 2000 due to increased interest earnings from
the money pool, an inter-company funding arrangement, and decreased
interest expense associated with the potential refund of System Energy's
proposed rate increase. This increase in net income was partially offset
by a higher effective income tax rate in 2000.

 Net income decreased in 1999 due to the additional reserves and
interest recorded for the potential refund of System Energy's proposed rate
increase, as well as downtime for unplanned outages.

Revenues

 Operating revenues recover operating expenses, depreciation, and
capital costs attributable to Grand Gulf 1. Capital costs are computed by
allowing a return on System Energy's common equity funds allocable to its
net investment in Grand Gulf 1 and adding to such amount System Energy's
effective interest cost for its debt.

 Operating revenues increased in 2000 primarily due to an increase in
recoverable expenses.

 Operating revenues increased in 1999 primarily due to the
implementation of the Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery Tariff (GGART) at
Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi. This increase in revenues is
offset by related regulatory charges and does not affect net income. The
tariff was designed to allow Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to
accelerate the payment of a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power
obligation in advance of the implementation of retail access. It became
effective on January 1, 1999 and October 1, 1998 for Entergy Arkansas and
Entergy Mississippi, respectively. The GGART and System Energy's proposed
rate increase, which is subject to refund, are discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements.

Expenses

Fuel expenses

 In 2000, fuel expenses increased primarily due to increased nuclear
fuel burn as a result of Grand Gulf 1 being operational 358 days, as
compared to 295 days in 1999.

 In 1999, fuel expenses decreased primarily due to an extended nuclear
refueling outage at Grand Gulf 1 in addition to unplanned outages. Grand
Gulf 1 was on-line for 17 fewer days in 1999 compared to 1998.

Depreciation and amortization

 In 2000, depreciation expense increased due to higher depreciation
associated with the principal payment on the sale and leaseback of a
portion of Grand Gulf 1. The depreciation schedule matches the collection
of lease principal and revenues with the depreciation of the asset.

 In 1999, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased as a result
of the reduction in principal payment associated with the sale and
leaseback of a portion of Grand Gulf 1.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

 MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Other regulatory charges

 In both 2000 and 1999, other regulatory charges increased due to the
implementation of the GGART at Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi, as
discussed above.

Other

Other income

 Other income increased in 2000 and 1999 as a result of the interest
earned on System Energy's advances to the money pool, an inter-company
funding arrangement. The money pool is discussed in Note 4 to the
financial statements.

Interest charges

 Interest on long-term debt decreased in 2000 and 1999 as a result of
the retirement and refinancing of higher-cost long-term debt. In 2000,
System Energy retired 75 million of debenture bonds. In 1999, System
Energy retired 160 million of first mortgage bonds and refinanced 102
million of governmental bonds at an annual interest rate of 5.9 .

 Other interest decreased in 2000 primarily due to decreased interest
expense recorded on the potential refund of System Energy's proposed rate
increase. Other interest increased in 1999 due to interest on the
potential refund of System Energy's proposed rate increase.

Income taxes

 The effective income tax rates in 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 46.4 ,
39.5 , and 42.1 , respectively.

 The effective income tax rate for 2000, increased primarily due to
increased pre-tax income and the amortization of investment tax credits
related to Grand Gulf 2 in 1999.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Entergy Corporation,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Entergy Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries,
including the domestic utility companies and System Energy, whose separate
financial statements are included in this document. The financial
statements presented herein result from these companies having registered
securities with the SEC.

 As required by generally accepted accounting principles, all
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements. The domestic utility companies and
System Energy maintain accounts in accordance with FERC and other
regulatory guidelines. Certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current classifications, with no effect on net
income or shareholders' equity.

 Entergy Corporation sold its investments in Entergy London and
CitiPower in December 1998. Accordingly, the consolidated statements of
income and cash flows for 1998 include amounts for Entergy London and
CitiPower through the dates of their respective sales.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

 The preparation of Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries'
financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses. Adjustments to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
may be necessary in the future to the extent that future estimates or
actual results are different from the estimates used.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi generate,
transmit, and distribute electricity primarily to retail customers in
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, respectively. Entergy Gulf States
generates, transmits, and distributes electricity primarily to retail
customers in Texas and Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States also distributes gas
to retail customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Entergy New
Orleans sells both electricity and gas to retail customers in the City of
New Orleans, except for Algiers, where Entergy Louisiana is the electricity
supplier.

 System Energy's operating revenues are intended to recover operating
expenses and capital costs attributable to Grand Gulf 1 from Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.
Capital costs are computed by allowing a return on System Energy's common
equity funds allocable to its net investment in Grand Gulf 1, plus System
Energy's effective interest cost for its debt allocable to its investment
in Grand Gulf 1. System Energy's proposed rate increase is discussed in
Note 2 to the financial statements.

 Entergy recognizes revenue from electricity and gas sales when the
consumers are billed. The domestic utility companies also accrue estimated
revenues for energy delivered since the latest billings on a monthly basis.
The monthly estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and
a receivable and are reversed the following month.

 The domestic utility companies' rate schedules include either fuel
adjustment clauses or fixed fuel factors, both of which allow either
current recovery or deferral of fuel costs until such costs are reflected
in the related revenues. Because the fuel adjustment clause mechanism
allows monthly adjustments to recover fuel costs, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy New Orleans, and the Louisiana portion of Entergy Gulf States
include fuel cost recovery in their unbilled revenue calculations. Fixed
fuel factors remain in effect until changed as part of a general rate case,
fuel reconciliation, or fixed fuel factor filing. In the case of Entergy
Arkansas, the Texas portion of Entergy Gulf States, and Entergy
Mississippi, their fuel under-recoveries are treated as regulatory
investments in the cash flow statements because those companies are allowed
by their regulatory jurisdictions to recover the fuel cost regulatory asset
over longer than a twelve month period, and the companies will earn a
return on the under-recovered balances.

Utility Plant

 Utility plant is stated at original cost. The original cost of
utility plant retired or removed, plus the applicable removal costs, less
salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance, repairs, and
minor replacement costs are charged to operating expenses. Substantially
all of the utility plant is subject to liens from mortgage bond indentures.

 With regard to nuclear refueling outage costs, Entergy records the
costs in accordance with regulatory treatment and the matching principle.
These refueling outage expenses are incurred to prepare the units to
operate for the next 18 months without having to be taken off line. Except
with respect to the River Bend plant, the costs are deferred during the
outage and amortized over the period to the next outage. For the River
Bend plant, the costs are accrued in advance and included in the cost of
service used to establish retail rates, and are then amortized over the
period between outages, which is in accordance with their regulatory
treatment.

 Utility plant includes the portions of Grand Gulf 1 and Waterford 3
that have been sold and leased back. For financial reporting purposes,
these sale and leaseback arrangements are reflected as financing
transactions.

31, 2000, is shown below (in millions):

(1) The decommissioning liabilities related to Grand Gulf 1, Pilgrim, and
 the 30 of River Bend previously owned by Cajun are recorded in the
 applicable Balance Sheets in "Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities -
 Decommissioning."
 Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis at rates based on
the estimated service lives and costs of removal of the various classes of
property. Depreciation rates on average depreciable property are shown
below:

Entergy Entergy Entergy Entergy Entergy System

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of
borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for
construction. Although AFUDC increases both utility plant and earnings, it
is realized in cash through depreciation provisions included in rates.

Jointly-Owned Generating Stations

 Certain Entergy subsidiaries jointly own electric generating
facilities with third parties. The investments and expenses associated
with these generating stations are recorded by the Entergy subsidiaries to
the extent of their respective undivided ownership interests. As of
December 31, 2000, the subsidiaries' investment and accumulated
depreciation in each of these generating stations were as follows:

(1)Includes an 11.5 leasehold interest held by System Energy. System
 Energy's Grand Gulf 1 lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the
 financial statements.

Project Development Costs

 Entergy capitalizes costs incurred in developing projects after
achieving certain milestones that indicate that completion of the project
is probable. These costs include salaries, incremental indirect costs and
amounts paid to outside parties for such expenses as legal, engineering,
accounting, and other incremental direct costs. Capitalized project
development costs are transferred to construction in progress during the
construction phase and to electric plant after commencement of operations.
Capitalized costs are amortized over the life of operational projects or
charged to expense if management determines that the costs are not
recoverable through operations of the project.

Income Taxes

 Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries file a U.S. consolidated
federal income tax return. Income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries
in proportion to their contribution to consolidated taxable income. SEC
regulations require that no Entergy subsidiary pay more taxes than it would
have paid if a separate income tax return had been filed. In accordance
with SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," deferred income taxes are
recorded for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of
assets and liabilities, and for certain credits available for carryforward.

 Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.

 Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized based upon the
average useful life of the related property, in accordance with ratemaking
treatment.

Reacquired Debt

 The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt of the domestic
utility companies and System Energy (except that portion allocable to the
deregulated operations of Entergy Gulf States) are being amortized over the
life of the related new issuances, in accordance with ratemaking treatment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 Entergy considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Investments

 Entergy applies the provisions of SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Investments for Certain Debt and Equity Securities," in accounting for
investments in decommissioning trust funds. As a result, Entergy has
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 128 million of additional value
in its decommissioning trust funds. This increase represents the amount by
which the fair value of the securities held in such funds exceeds the
amounts deposited plus the earnings on the deposits. In accordance with
the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the domestic
utility companies and System Energy have recorded an offsetting amount in
unrealized gains on investment securities as a regulatory liability in
other deferred credits.

 Decommissioning trust funds for Pilgrim do not receive regulatory
treatment. Accordingly, unrealized gains recorded on the assets in
Pilgrim's trust funds are recognized as a separate component of
shareholders' equity because these assets are classified as available for
sale.

Foreign Currency Translation

 All assets and liabilities of Entergy's foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of
the period. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Current
exchange rates are used for U.S. dollar disclosures of future obligations
denominated in foreign currencies.

Earnings per Share

 The average number of common shares outstanding for the presentation
of diluted earnings per share was greater by approximately 1,960,858 shares
in 2000, 199,000 shares in 1999, and 176,000 shares in 1998, than the
number of such shares for the presentation of basic earnings per share due
to Entergy's stock option and other stock compensation plans discussed more
thoroughly in Note 5 to the financial statements.

 Options to purchase approximately 5,205,000 and 149,000 shares of
common stock at various prices were outstanding at the end of 1999 and
1998, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares at the end of each of the years
presented. At the end of 2000, all outstanding options, totaling
11,468,316, were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
as a result of the average market price of the common shares being greater
than the exercise prices.

Application of SFAS 71

 The domestic utility companies and System Energy currently account for
the effects of regulation pursuant to SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation." This statement applies to the financial
statements of a rate-regulated enterprise that meet three criteria. The
enterprise must have rates that (i) are approved by the regulator; (ii) are
cost-based; and (iii) can be charged to and collected from customers.
These criteria may also be applied to separable portions of a utility's
business, such as the generation or transmission functions, or to specific
classes of customers. If an enterprise meets these criteria, it may
capitalize costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the rate
actions of its regulator make it probable that those costs will be
recovered in future revenue. Such capitalized costs are reflected as
regulatory assets in the accompanying financial statements. A significant
majority of Entergy's regulatory assets, net of related regulatory and
deferred tax liabilities, earn a return on investment during their recovery
periods. SFAS 71 requires that rate-regulated enterprises assess the
probability of recovering their regulatory assets at each balance sheet
date. When an enterprise concludes that recovery of a regulatory asset is
no longer probable, the regulatory asset must be removed from the entity's
balance sheet.

 SFAS 101, "Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB
Statement No. 71," specifies how an enterprise that ceases to meet the
criteria for application of SFAS 71 for all or part of its operations
should report that event in its financial statements. In general, SFAS 101
requires that the enterprise report the discontinuation of the application
of SFAS 71 by eliminating from its balance sheet all regulatory assets and
liabilities related to the applicable segment. Additionally, if it is
determined that a regulated enterprise is no longer recovering all of its
costs and therefore no longer qualifies for SFAS 71 accounting, it is
possible that an impairment may exist that could require further write-offs
of plant assets.

 EITF 97-4: "Deregulation of the Pricing of Electricity - Issues
Related to the Application of FASB Statements No. 71 and 101" specifies
that SFAS 71 should be discontinued at a date no later than when the
effects of a transition to competition plan for all or a portion of the
entity subject to such plan are reasonably determinable. Additionally, EITF
97-4 promulgates that regulatory assets to be recovered through cash flows
derived from another portion of the entity that continues to apply SFAS 71
should not be written off; rather, they should be considered regulatory
assets of the segment that will continue to apply SFAS 71.

 As described in "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS," management believes that definitive
outcomes have not yet been determined regarding transition to competition
in any of Entergy's jurisdictions. Therefore, the regulated operations of
the domestic utility companies and System Energy continue to apply SFAS 71.
Arkansas and Texas have enacted retail open access laws, but Entergy
believes that significant issues remain to be addressed by Arkansas and
Texas regulators, and the enacted laws do not provide sufficient detail to
reasonably determine the impact on Entergy Arkansas' and Entergy Gulf
States' regulated operations.

Transition to Competition Liabilities

 In conjunction with the transition to competition of the electric
utility industry in certain jurisdictions in which the domestic utility
companies operate, regulatory mechanisms have been established to mitigate
potential stranded costs. These mechanisms include the transition cost
account at Entergy Arkansas, which is discussed further in Note 2 to the
financial statements. Also included is a provision in the Texas transition
legislation that allows depreciation on transmission and distribution
assets to be directed toward generation assets. The liabilities recorded
as a result of these mechanisms are classified as "transition to
competition" deferred credits.

Domestic Operating Company Deregulated Operations

 Entergy Gulf States does not apply regulatory accounting principles to
its wholesale jurisdiction, steam department, Louisiana retail deregulated
portion of River Bend, and the 30 interest in River Bend formerly owned by
Cajun. The Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend is operated
under a deregulated asset plan representing a portion (approximately 24 of River Bend plant costs, generation, revenues, and expenses established
under a 1992 LPSC order. The plan allows Entergy Gulf States to sell the
electricity from the deregulated assets to Louisiana retail customers at
4.6 cents per KWH or off-system at higher prices, with certain provisions
for sharing such incremental revenue above 4.6 cents per KWH between
ratepayers and shareholders.

 The results of these deregulated operations before interest charges for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 are as follows (in
thousands):

 2000 1999 1998

Operating revenues 200,023 166,509 178,303
Operating expenses
 Fuel, operating, and maintenance 141,822 126,917 137,579
 Depreciation 36,158 35,141 39,497
 -------- -------- --------
Total operating expense 177,980 162,058 177,076
Income tax expense 8,278 628 1,154
 -------- -------- --------
Net income from deregulated utility operations 13,765 3,823 73
 ======== ======== ========

 The net investment associated with these deregulated operations as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999 was approximately 822 million and 835 million,
respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is
uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the
net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets.
Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated
with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and
generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the
remaining life of the assets.

 Assets regulated under traditional cost-of-service ratemaking, and
thereby subject to SFAS 71 accounting, are generally not subject to
impairment because this form of regulation assures that all allowed costs
are subject to recovery. However, certain deregulated assets and other
operations of the domestic utility companies totaling approximately 1.5
billion (pre-tax) could be affected in the future. Those assets include
Entergy Arkansas' and Entergy Louisiana's retained shares of Grand Gulf 1,
Entergy Gulf States' Louisiana deregulated asset plan, the Texas
jurisdictional abeyed portion of the River Bend plant and the portion of
River Bend transferred from Cajun, and wholesale operations. Additionally,
as noted above, the discontinuation of SFAS 71 regulatory accounting
principles would require that Entergy review the affected assets for
impairment.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Derivatives

 As a part of its overall risk management strategy, Entergy uses a
variety of derivative financial instruments and commodity derivatives,
including interest rate swaps and natural gas and electricity futures,
forwards, and options.

 Entergy accounts for derivative financial instruments used to mitigate
interest rate risk in accordance with hedge accounting. Gains or losses
from rate swaps used for such purposes that are sold or terminated are
deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt instrument being
hedged by the interest rate swap. If the debt instrument being hedged by
the interest rate swaps is extinguished, any gain or loss attributable to
the swap would be recognized in the period of the transaction. Additional
information concerning Entergy's interest rate swaps outstanding as of
December 31, 2000 is included in Note 7 to the financial statements.

 Entergy's power marketing and trading business engages in price risk
management activities for trading purposes. To conduct these activities,
the business uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options, and uses the mark-
to-market method of accounting. Under the mark-to-market method of
accounting, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and other financial
instruments with third parties are reflected at market value in the balance
sheets. Changes in the assets and liabilities from these instruments
(resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of
price movements) are recognized currently in the statements of income. The
market prices used to value these transactions reflect management's best
estimate considering various factors including closing exchange and over-
the-counter quotations, time value, and volatility factors underlying the
commitments.

New Accounting Pronouncements

 In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which was implemented effective
January 1, 2001. This statement requires that all derivatives be
recognized in the balance sheet, either as assets or liabilities, measured
at fair value. The changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded
each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on
whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if
it is, the type of hedge transaction. For fair-value hedge transactions in
which Entergy is hedging changes in an asset's, liability's, or firm
commitment's fair value, changes in the fair value of the derivative
instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in
the hedged item's fair value. For cash-flow hedge transactions in which
Entergy is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate
asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of
the derivative instrument will be reported in other comprehensive income.
The gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in
other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods
in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the
hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in
current-period earnings.

 Entergy utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily for the
following purposes:

 o trading activity in its power marketing and trading business;
 o to ensure adequate power supplies and to mitigate certain risks in the
 domestic utility business; and
 o to hedge cash flows for various transactions in its competitive
 businesses.

The implementation of SFAS 133 did not materially impact the power
marketing and trading business, as its derivative portfolio is already
marked-to-market under the provisions of EITF 98-10, "Measuring the Value
of Energy-Related Contracts". Effective January 1, 2001, Entergy recorded
a net-of-tax cumulative-effect-type adjustment of approximately 18.0
million reducing accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize at fair
value all derivative instruments that are designated as cash-flow
hedging instruments, primarily for interest rate swaps and foreign currency
forward contracts related to Entergy's competitive businesses.

 The FASB's Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) is considering a
number of issues affecting the power industry. Entergy's interpretation of
these issues in its initial implementation of SFAS 133 is based on
management's application of existing accounting literature. To the extent
that the DIG ultimately interprets these issues differently than Entergy,
Entergy's financial statements could be materially affected, although the
amount of the possible effect cannot be quantified at this time.

NOTE 2. RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Electric Industry Restructuring

Arkansas

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Arkansas)

 In April 1999, the Arkansas legislature enacted a law providing for
competition in the electric utility industry through retail open access as
of January 1, 2002. With retail open access, generation operations would
become a competitive business, but transmission and distribution operations
will continue to be regulated either by federal or state regulatory
commissions. In November 2000, the APSC issued a report to the General
Assembly on the status of deregulation implementation and recommended that
the deregulation statute remain as passed in 1999 except that the target
date for retail open access be delayed until no sooner than October 1, 2003
and no later than October 1, 2005. The investor-owned utilities in
Arkansas signed a settlement agreement that supported the recommendation.
During the 2001 legislative session, the General Assembly passed an
amendment to the deregulation statute to adopt the APSC recommendation to
amend the target date for retail open access. The amendment was signed
into law by the governor in February 2001. Besides delaying the target
date, the amendment includes two new criteria that will allow the APSC to
delay the retail open access date beyond the October 1, 2003 target. The
additional criteria that could cause further delay include:

 o most customers would not have a reasonable opportunity to realize net
 benefits, specifically including relative price benefits for residential
 and small business customers; or
 o demonstrably effective market structures are not in place,
 particularly a regional transmission organization or insufficient
 generation and transmission capacity.

Other provisions of the currently enacted law:

 o require utilities to separate (unbundle) their costs into generation,
 transmission, distribution, and customer service functions;
 o require customer service functions to be further unbundled into
 competitive and regulated services based on the APSC's determination that
 billing services be competitive as of retail open access;
 o require operation of transmission facilities by an organization
 independent from the generation, distribution, and retail operations;
 o provide for the determination of and mitigation measures for
 generation market power,which could require generation asset divestitures
 or other mitigation measures;
 o allow for recovery of stranded and transition costs if the costs are
 approved by the APSC;
 o allow for the securitization of approved stranded costs; and
 o freeze residential and small business customer rates for three years
 by utilities that will recover stranded costs and one year for other
 utilities.

 Entergy Arkansas filed separate generation, transmission,
distribution, and customer service rates with the APSC in December 1999 and
also filed notice of its intent to recover stranded costs. Should
utilities that have filed notice of stranded cost recovery determine that,
due to the delay in retail open access, stranded cost recovery is not
required, notice of intent to withdraw from seeking stranded cost recovery
must be filed by December 31, 2001. Entergy Arkansas' unbundled rates were
based on the cost-of-service study that formed the basis of the rates
included in the 1997 settlement agreement. In October 2000, a settlement
agreement was filed settling all outstanding issues except one rate design
issue. In December 2000, the APSC approved the unbundled rates as filed,
approved the October 2000 settlement agreement, and ordered compliance
tariffs be filed within 60 days. Bundled rates will continue to be
effective until six months prior to retail open access.

 The APSC and various participants in the industry, including Entergy
Arkansas, are involved in the ongoing process of implementing the
legislation through various rulemaking and other proceedings. Some
rulemakings were suspended in late 2000 in anticipation of a delay in the
target date for retail open access. In compliance with the provisions of
the deregulation law and as a result of rulemakings concluded in 2000,
Entergy Arkansas has:

 o filed a functional, but not corporate, unbundling plan with the APSC
 in August 2000. The functional unbundling plan initially establishes
 separate business units for distribution, generation, and a new retail
 energy service provider. The plan contemplates the transfer of
 transmission assets to the Transco discussed herein. The functional
 unbundling plan is tentative because the regulatory requirements to
 implement the retail open access law have not been finalized, and
 changes to the plan are possible;
 o filed a compliance plan in October 2000 detailing the specific
 procedures to ensure that the affiliate rules are implemented;
 o filed unbundled compliance tariffs in February 2001;
 o filed a market power study in October 2000 in accordance with the
 guidelines adopted by the APSC. The study included both wholesale
 generation and retail markets and examined vertical and horizontal market
 power issues. Due to the delay in retail open access, Entergy Arkansas
 will file an updated study in 2001 reflecting any changes in generation
 supply in the study region;
 o agreed to file the stranded cost proceedings following the market
 power proceeding; and
 o participated in various rulemakings related to standard service
 package offerings, the declaration of billing services as a competitive
 service, electronic data exchange, consumer education, and affiliate
 rules.

 In June 2000, the APSC declared that billing would become a
competitive service at the beginning of retail open access. In December
2000, the APSC issued an order requiring utilities to file further customer
service costs from the competitive services costs. In May 2001, Entergy
Arkansas will file further unbundled customer service rates to separate
those costs associated with those billings services that were declared
competitive as of retail open access from those customer services still
regulated by the APSC.

 In December 2000, Entergy Arkansas filed an application for approval
to transfer Entergy Arkansas' transmission assets to an independent company
(Transco). This transfer of transmission assets is to comply with
establishing independent transmission operations in accordance with federal
and state deregulation requirements. Entergy's Transco proposal is
discussed in "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT
FACTORS AND KNOWN TRENDS - Open Access Transmission and Entergy's Transco
Proposal".

Texas

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In June 1999, the Texas legislature enacted a law providing for
competition in the electric utility industry through retail open access.
The law provides for retail open access by most investor-owned electric
utilities, including Entergy Gulf States, on January 1, 2002. With retail
open access, generation and a new retail electric provider operation will
be competitive businesses, but transmission and distribution operations
will continue to be regulated. The new retail electric provider will be
the primary point of contact with customers. The provisions of the new
law:

 o require a rate freeze through December 31, 2001 with rates reduced by
 6 beyond that for residential and small commercial customers of most
 incumbent utilities except Entergy Gulf States,whose rates are exempt
 from the 6 reduction requirement. These rates to residential and small
 commercial customers are known as the "Price to Beat", and they may be
 adjusted periodically after January 1, 2002 for fuel and purchased power
 costs according to PUCT rules;
 o require utilities to charge the Price to Beat rates through 2004, or
 until 40 of customers in the jurisdiction have chosen an alternative
 supplier, whichever comes first. However, the Price to Beat rates must
 continue to be made available through 2006;
 o require utilities to submit a plan to separate (unbundle) their
 generation, transmission and distribution, and retail electric provider
 functions, which Entergy Gulf States filed in January 2000 as discussed
 below;
 o require utilities to comply with a code of conduct to ensure that
 utilities do not allow affiliates to have a business advantage over
 competitors;
 o require operation in a non-discriminatory manner of transmission and
 distribution facilities by an organization independent from the
 generation and retail operations by the time competition is implemented;
 o allow for recovery of stranded costs incurred in purchasing power and
 providing electric generation service if the costs are approved by the
 PUCT;
 o allow securitization of regulatory assets and PUCT-approved stranded
 costs;
 o provide for the determination of and mitigation measures for
 generation market power; and
 o required utilities to file separated cost data and proposed
 transmission, distribution,and competition transition tariffs by
 April 1, 2000.

 Entergy Gulf States filed its business separation plan with the PUCT
in January 2000 to separate its functions, and amended that plan in June
and December 2000. The plan provides that, by January 2002, Entergy Gulf
States will be divided into a Texas distribution company, a Texas
transmission company, a Texas generation company, at least two Texas retail
electricity providers, and a Louisiana company that will encompass
distribution, generation, transmission, and retail operations. In July
2000, the PUCT issued an interim order approving the amended business
separation plan. The plan provides that the Louisiana company would retain
the liability for all debt obligations of Entergy Gulf States and that the
property of the Texas companies would be released from the lien of Entergy
Gulf States' mortgage. Except for the Texas retail electric providers,
each of the Texas companies would assume a portion of Entergy Gulf States'
debt obligations, which assumptions would not act to release the Louisiana
company's obligations. Except for the Texas retail electric providers,
each of the Texas companies would also grant a lien on its properties in
favor of the Louisiana company to secure its obligations to the Louisiana
company in respect of the assumed obligations. In addition, under the
plan, Entergy Gulf States will refinance or retire the Texas companies'
portion of existing debt by the end of 2004. Regulatory approvals from
FERC, the SEC, and the LPSC, and final approval from the PUCT will be
required before the business separation plan can be implemented. Remaining
business separation issues in Texas subsequent to the July 2000 interim
order will be addressed in the cost unbundling proceeding before the PUCT.

 The LPSC has opened a docket to identify the changes in corporate
structure of Entergy Gulf States, and their potential impact on Louisiana
retail ratepayers, resulting from restructuring in Texas and Arkansas.
Entergy Gulf States filed testimony in that proceeding in August 2000. The
LPSC staff filed testimony in that proceeding in October 2000 criticizing
Entergy Gulf States' proposal, particularly the part related to the Texas
portion of generation assets being transferred to an unregulated entity.
Entergy Gulf States filed rebuttal testimony in December 2000. A
procedural schedule has not been set.

 Beginning January 1, 2002, the market power measures in the open
access law will prohibit Entergy Gulf States from owning and controlling
more than 20 of the installed generation capacity located in, or capable
of delivering electricity to, a "power region", which is defined as a
distinct region of NERC. In seeking PUCT approval of the Merger, Entergy
and FPL Group are required to demonstrate that the merged company will not
exceed this threshold. However, all the implications of this limit are
uncertain for Entergy Gulf States and Entergy. It is possible that Entergy
Gulf States could decide to divest some of its generation assets or seek to
reduce transmission constraints if Entergy Gulf States is found to have
generation market power in excess of this limit. The legislation also
requires affected utilities to sell at auction entitlements to at least 15 
of their installed generation capacity in Texas at least 60 days before
January 1, 2002. The obligation to auction capacity entitlements continues
for up to 60 months after January 1, 2002, or until 40 of current
customers have chosen an alternative supplier, whichever comes first.

 The PUCT and various participants in the industry are currently in the
process of implementing the legislation through various rulemaking and
other proceedings. The Provider of Last Resort (POLR) rule was approved by
the PUCT in October 2000, requiring that such a provider exist in every
area of the state and setting up the process by which such a provider will
be selected and its services priced. The PUCT received bids from retail
electric providers seeking to become the POLR in each area in January 2001.
The PUCT has stated its preference that the POLR not be the retail electric
provider that is affiliated with the incumbent utility in the area.
However, depending on the outcome of the bidding process, Entergy Gulf
States' affiliate retail electric provider may be required to provide POLR
service in Entergy Gulf States' service territory. This may have a
material financial impact on the Entergy Gulf States retail electric
provider depending on the terms and prices eventually approved by the PUCT
for POLR service.

 On March 31, 2000, pursuant to the Texas restructuring legislation,
Entergy Gulf States filed cost data with the PUCT for its unbundled
business functions and proposed tariffs for its unbundled distribution
utility. In the filing, Entergy Gulf States is seeking approval for
recovery of the following, among other things:

 o the unbundled distribution utility's cost of service; and
 o a ten-year nonbypassable charge to recover estimated stranded costs
 and a nonbypassable charge to recover nuclear decommissioning costs.

Also included in the proceeding is consideration of the treatment of the
30 share of River Bend acquired from Cajun, which Entergy Gulf States
treats as an asset not subject to regulation by the PUCT.

 On March 6, 2001, Entergy Gulf States filed with the PUCT a non-
unanimous settlement agreement in the unbundled cost proceeding that
establishes the distribution revenue requirement. The settlement agreement
is between Entergy Gulf States, the PUCT Staff, and other parties. Pursuant
to a generic rule prescribed by the PUCT, Entergy Gulf States' allowed
return on equity will be 11.25 . The generic capital structure prescribed
by the PUCT is 60 debt and 40 equity. Also in the settlement agreement,
the parties agree that Entergy Gulf States' stranded costs and benefits
are 0, and no charge to recover stranded costs will be implemented. A
rider to recover nuclear decommissioning costs will be implemented.
Hearings before the PUCT on approval of the settlement are scheduled to
begin in April 2001. Management cannot predict the timing or outcome of
this proceeding.

Louisiana

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States, and Entergy Louisiana)

 In March 1999, the LPSC deferred making a decision on whether
competition in the electric industry is in the public interest. However,
the LPSC staff, outside consultants, and counsel were directed to work
together to analyze and resolve issues related to competition and then
recommend a plan for its implementation to be considered by the LPSC. In
January 2001, a draft response was circulated among interested parties. It
is expected that, after a comment period, a final staff response will be
presented to the LPSC in April 2001.

 See above under "Texas" for discussion of the LPSC proceeding
considering Entergy Gulf States' business separation plan.

Mississippi

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Mississippi)

 In May 2000, after two years of studies and hearings, the MPSC
announced that it was suspending its docket studying the opening of the
state's retail electricity markets to competition. The MPSC based its
decision on its finding that competition could raise the electric rates
paid by residential and small commercial customers. The final decision
regarding the introduction of retail competition ultimately lies with the
Mississippi Legislature, which is holding its 2001 session from January
through March. Management cannot predict when, or if, Mississippi will
deregulate its retail electricity market, but does not expect it to occur
before 2003.

New Orleans

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy New Orleans filed an electric transition to competition plan
in September 1997. This plan is similar to plans that were filed by the
other domestic utility companies. No procedural schedule has been
established for consideration of that plan by the Council.

 In October 1998, the Council began proceedings to determine if natural
gas retail competition is in the public interest. Advisors to the Council
issued a final report that proposed various pilot programs and found that
retail gas open access is not in the public interest at this time. The
Council accepted an offer of settlement from Entergy New Orleans in this
matter that allows for a voluntary pilot program for a limited number of
large industrial non-jurisdictional gas customers.

Retail Rate Proceedings

Filings with the APSC (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Arkansas)

 Entergy Arkansas is operating under the terms of a settlement
agreement approved by the APSC in December 1997 that provides for the
following:

 o accelerated payment of Entergy Arkansas' Grand Gulf purchased power
 obligation in an amount totaling 165.3 million over the period from
 January 1999 to June 2004;
 o collecting earnings in excess of an 11 return on equity in a
 transition cost account to offset stranded costs when retail access is
 implemented;
 o a rate freeze until at least July 1, 2001; and
 o rate decreases totaling 200 million over the two-year period 1998-
 1999. The net income effect from the rate reductions was approximately
 22 million.

 In June 2000, Entergy Arkansas filed an application to continue the
stranded cost mitigation efforts agreed upon in the settlement agreement
including the funding of a transition cost account and the accelerated
amortization of the Grand Gulf obligation. In December 2000, the APSC
approved a settlement agreement that directed Entergy Arkansas to do the
following:

 o seek FERC approval for the cessation of the accelerated payment of the
 Grand Gulf purchased power obligation as of July 1, 2001,and approval was
 applied for in February 2001; and
 o continue the collection of excess earnings in a transition cost
 account at least through 2002.

Entergy Arkansas' 2000 operating expenses reflect reserves of 4.4 million 2.7 million net of taxes) to record the final determination of 1999
excess earnings. Interest of 5.2 million 3.2 million net of taxes) was
also recorded in the transition cost account for 2000. As of December 31,
2000, the transition cost account balance was 119.6 million. Entergy
Arkansas applied 17.5 million 10.7 million net of tax) of 2000 excess
earnings recorded in the third quarter 2000 against 2000 ice storm damage
expenses. For additional information on the December 2000 ice storms in
Arkansas, refer to "December 2000 Ice Storms" discussed below.

 In March 2000, Entergy Arkansas filed its annually redetermined energy
cost rate with the APSC in accordance with the energy cost recovery rider
formula and special circumstances agreement. The filing reflected that an
increase was warranted to collect an under-recovery of energy costs for
1999. The increased energy cost rate is effective April 2000 through March
2001.

 In October 2000, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to cease collection
of funds to decommission ANO 1 and 2 for the calendar year 2001. Based on
anticipated approval of Entergy's application with the NRC to extend the
license of ANO 1 by 20 years, the APSC concluded that the funds previously
collected will be sufficient to decommission the units. This decision will
be reviewed annually and reflected in Entergy Arkansas' filing of its
annual determination of the nuclear decommissioning rate rider.

Filings with the PUCT and Texas Cities

Rate Proceedings (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In June 1999, the PUCT approved a settlement agreement that Entergy
Gulf States entered into in February 1999. The settlement agreement
resolved Entergy Gulf States' 1996 and 1998 rate proceedings and all of the
settling parties' pending appeals in other matters, except for the appeal
in the River Bend abeyed cost recovery proceeding discussed below. The
Office of Public Utility Counsel, an intervenor in the proceeding, has
appealed certain aspects of this settlement to Travis County District
Court. Entergy Gulf States cannot predict the impact of the appeal.

 The settlement agreement provides for the following:

 o an annual 4.2 million base rate reduction, effective March 1, 1999,
 which is in addition to the annual 69 million base rate reduction
 (net of River Bend accounting order deferrals) in the PUCT's second order
 on rehearing in October 1998;
 o a methodology for semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor
 through December 2001 based on the market price of natural gas;
 o a base rate freeze through June 1, 2000. The Texas restructuring law
 extends the base rate freeze through December 2001;
 o amortization of the remaining River Bend accounting order deferrals as
 of January 1, 1999, over three years on a straight-line basis, and the
 accounting order deferrals will not be recognized in any subsequent base
 rate case or stranded cost calculation;
 o the dismissal of all pending appeals of the settling parties relating
 to Entergy Gulf States' proceedings with the PUCT, except the River Bend
 abeyed plant costs appeal discussed below; and
 o the potential recovery in the River Bend abeyed plant costs appeal is
 limited to 115 million net plant in service as of January 1, 2002, less
 depreciation over the remaining life of the plant beginning January 1,
 2002 through the date the plant costs are included in rate base, and any
 such recovery will not be used to increase rates above the level agreed
 to in the settlement agreement (see "Recovery of River Bend Costs" in
 this note for further discussion).

 As a result of the settlement agreement, in June 1999, Entergy Gulf
States:

 o removed from its balance sheet a 207.3 million deferred asset and the
 associated provision recorded for unrecovered purchased power costs and
 deferred revenue from NISCO, which had no net income impact on Entergy
 Gulf States;
 o removed the reserve recorded in December 1997 for River Bend plant
 costs held in abeyance and reduced the plant asset, resulting in other
 income of 4.8 million; and
 o removed the 93.9 million reserve recorded in 1998 for the
 amortization of River Bend accounting order deferrals to reflect the
 three-year amortization schedule detailed in the agreement. The income
 impact of this removal was largely offset by an increase in the rate of
 amortization of the accounting order deferrals.

 In June 1999, the PUCT instituted a proceeding to consider the final
adjustment of the rate refunds ordered as a result of Entergy Gulf States'
November 1996 rate case. These refunds were required to occur over the
fourteen-month period from August 1998 through September 1999. The PUCT
issued an order in July 1999 adopting a calculation methodology which
required Entergy Gulf States to refund an additional 25 million. This
refund was recorded as a reduction in operating revenues. The PUCT
approved the final refund and concluded the proceeding in June 2000.

Recovery of River Bend Costs (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In March 1998, the PUCT disallowed recovery of 1.4 billion of company-
wide abeyed River Bend plant costs which have been held in abeyance since
1988. Entergy Gulf States appealed the PUCT's decision on this matter to
the Travis County District Court in Texas. In June 1999, subsequent to the
settlement agreement discussed above, Entergy Gulf States removed the
reserve for River Bend plant costs held in abeyance and reduced the value
of the plant asset. The settlement agreement limits potential recovery of
the remaining plant asset, less depreciation, to 115 million, beginning
January 1, 2002 through the date the plant costs are included in rate base,
and any such recovery will not be used to increase rates above the level as
agreed to in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement also
prohibits Entergy Gulf States from acting on its appeal until January 1,
2002. Based on advice of counsel, management believes that it is probable
that the matter will be remanded again to the PUCT for a further ruling on
the prudence of the abeyed plant costs and it is reasonably possible that
some portion of these costs will be added to the net book value of the
River Bend plant for regulatory purposes. However, no assurance can be
given that additional reserves or write-offs will not be required in the
future.

PUCT Fuel Cost Review (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In September 1998, Entergy Gulf States filed an application with the
PUCT for an increase in its fixed fuel factor and for a surcharge to Texas
retail customers for the cumulative under-recovery of fuel and purchased
power costs. The PUCT issued an order in December 1998 approving the
implementation of a revised fuel factor and fuel and purchased power
surcharge that would result in recovery of 112.1 million of under-
recovered fuel costs, inclusive of interest, over a 24-month period. These
increases were implemented in the first billing cycle in February 1999.
North Star Steel Texas, Inc. has appealed the PUCT's order to the State
District Court in Travis County, Texas. Entergy Gulf States cannot predict
the outcome of this appeal.

 Based on the settlement agreement discussed above, Entergy Gulf States
adopted a methodology for calculating its fixed fuel factor based on the
market price of natural gas. This calculation and any necessary
adjustments began semi-annually as of March 1, 1999 and are scheduled to
continue until December 2001, unless otherwise ordered by the PUCT. The
calculation for the factor that was implemented in September 2000 showed
that the fuel factor should be increased. This fuel factor increase was
approved by the PUCT in August 2000. The amounts collected under Entergy
Gulf States' fixed fuel factor are the subject of fuel reconciliation
proceedings before the PUCT, including a fuel reconciliation case filed by
Entergy Gulf States in January 2001. In connection with the implementation
of restructuring in Texas, Entergy Gulf States anticipates that it will
file a final fuel reconciliation in March 2003 for the period ending
December 31, 2001.

 Entergy Gulf States filed a fuel reconciliation case in July 1999
reconciling approximately 731 million (after excluding approximately 14
million related to Cajun issues to be handled in a subsequent proceeding)
of fuel and purchased power costs incurred from July 1996 to February 1999.
In February 2000, Entergy Gulf States reached a settlement with all but one
of the parties to the proceeding. The settlement reduced Entergy Gulf
States' requested surcharge in the reconciliation filing from 14.7 million
to 2.2 million. In April 2000, the PUCT approved this settlement allowing
Entergy Gulf States to recover the 2.2 million surcharge beginning with
the April 2000 billing cycle and continuing until January 2001.

 In September 1999, Entergy Gulf States filed an application with the
PUCT requesting an interim fuel surcharge to collect under-recovered fuel
and purchased power expenses incurred from March 1999 through July 1999.
In December 1999, the PUCT approved the collection of 33.9 million over a
five-month period beginning January 2000. An administrative appeal of the
interim fuel surcharge was filed by certain cities in Travis County
District Court. Entergy Gulf States cannot predict the outcome of this
appeal. The fuel and purchased power expenses contained in this surcharge
are subject to the current fuel reconciliation proceeding.

 In September 2000, Entergy Gulf States requested an interim surcharge
to collect the under-recovered fuel and purchased power expenses, including
accrued interest, incurred from August 1999 through July 2000. In December
2000, the PUCT issued an order approving Entergy Gulf States' request for
the collection of 79.0 million over an eleven-month period beginning
February 2001.

 In January 2001, Entergy Gulf States filed a fuel reconciliation case
covering the period from March 1, 1999 to August 31, 2000. Entergy Gulf
States is reconciling approximately 583 million of fuel and purchased
power costs. As part of this filing, Entergy Gulf States requested the
collection of 28 million plus interest of under-recovered fuel and
purchased power costs.

 In March 2001, Entergy Gulf States filed an application with the PUCT
requesting an interim surcharge to collect under-recovered fuel and
purchased power expenses incurred from September 2000 through January
2001. Entergy Gulf States is requesting the recovery of 82 million, plus
interest, from July through December 2001. The request is currently pending
before the PUCT and an order is expected by June 2001. The fuel and
purchased power expenses contained in this surcharge will be subject to
future fuel reconciliation proceedings.

Filings with the LPSC

Annual Earnings Reviews (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 In June 2000, the LPSC approved a settlement between Entergy Gulf
States and the LPSC staff to refund 83 million, including interest,
resolving refund issues in Entergy Gulf States' second, third, fourth, and
fifth post-merger earnings reviews filed with the LPSC in May 1995, 1996,
1997, and 1998, respectively. The refund was made over a three-month
period beginning July 2000.

 Although refund issues in the third, fourth, and fifth post-merger
earnings reviews were resolved by the June 2000 settlement, certain
prospective issues remained in dispute following the settlement. On remand
from the Louisiana Supreme Court in the third earnings review, Entergy Gulf
States' allowed return on common equity was reset at 10.83 . The fourth
earnings review is currently on appeal at the Nineteenth Judicial District
Court. A final decision from the LPSC in the fifth earnings review is
expected in the first or second quarter of 2001.

 In May 1999, Entergy Gulf States filed its sixth required post-merger
earnings analysis with the LPSC. Hearings were held in February and June
2000. The timing of a final decision in the proceeding is not certain.

 In May 2000, Entergy Gulf States filed its seventh required post-
merger earnings analysis with the LPSC. This filing will be subject to
review by the LPSC, which may result in a change in rates. Entergy Gulf
States also is proposing that the allowed return on common equity be
increased to 11.60 . Hearings are scheduled for April 2001.

Formula Rate Plan Filings (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana)

 In May 1997, Entergy Louisiana made its second annual performance-
based formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 1996 test year. This
filing resulted in a total rate reduction of approximately 54.5 million,
which was implemented in July 1997. At the same time, rates were reduced
by an additional 0.7 million and by an additional 2.9 million effective
March 1998. Upon completion of the hearing process in December 1998, the
LPSC issued an order requiring an additional rate reduction and refund,
although the resulting amounts were not quantified. Entergy Louisiana has
appealed this order and obtained a preliminary injunction pending a final
decision on appeal.

 In April 1999, Entergy Louisiana submitted its fourth annual
performance-based formula rate plan filing for the 1998 test year. A rate
reduction of 15.0 million was implemented effective August 1, 1999. In
May 2000, the LPSC ordered a 6.4 million refund. This refund was made in
July 2000.

 In May 2000, Entergy Louisiana submitted its fifth annual performance-
based formula rate plan filing for the 1999 test year. As a result of this
filing, Entergy Louisiana implemented a 24.8 million base rate reduction
in August 2000. Entergy Louisiana is proposing to increase prospectively
the allowed return on common equity from 10.5 to 11.6 , which, if
approved, would reduce the amount of any rate reduction implemented. This
filing will be subject to review by the LPSC. A procedural schedule has not
yet been established by the LPSC.

 As approved by the LPSC, Entergy Louisiana will continue its annual
performance-based formula rate plan filings for an additional year with a
filing to be made in April 2001.

Fuel Adjustment Clause Litigation (Entergy Corporation and Entergy
Louisiana)

 In May 1998, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Power, and Entergy Louisiana in state court in Orleans
Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy Louisiana ratepayers. The
plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged injuries arising from alleged
violations by the defendants of Louisiana's antitrust laws in connection
with the costs included in fuel filings with the LPSC and passed through to
ratepayers. Among other things, the plaintiffs allege that Entergy
Louisiana improperly introduced certain costs into the calculation of the
fuel charges, including high-cost electricity imprudently purchased from
its affiliates and high-cost gas imprudently purchased from independent
third party suppliers. In addition, plaintiffs seek to recover interest
and attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs also requested that the LPSC initiate a
review of Entergy Louisiana's monthly fuel adjustment charge filings and
force restitution to ratepayers of all costs that the plaintiffs allege
were improperly included in those fuel adjustment filings. A few parties
have intervened in the LPSC proceeding. In direct testimony, plaintiffs
purport to quantify many of their claims for the period 1989 through 1998
in an amount totaling 544 million, plus interest.

 Entergy Louisiana has reached an agreement in principle with the LPSC
staff for the settlement of the matter before the LPSC and has executed a
definitive agreement with the plaintiffs for the settlement of the matter
before the LPSC and the state court. The LPSC approved the settlement
agreement following a fairness hearing before an ALJ in November 2000.
Plaintiffs have sought class certification and approval of the settlement
by the state court, and a hearing on those issues is scheduled for April
2001.

 Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana agrees
to refund to customers approximately 72 million to resolve all claims
arising out of or relating to Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment clause
filings from January 1, 1975 through December 31, 1999, except with respect
to purchased power and associated costs included in the fuel adjustment
clause filings for the period May 1 through September 30, 1999. Entergy
Louisiana previously provided reserves for the refund. Under the terms of
the settlement, Entergy Louisiana also consents to future fuel cost
recovery under a long-term gas contract based on a formula that would
likely result in an under-recovery of actual costs under that contract for
the remainder of its term, which runs through 2013. The future under-
recovery cannot be precisely estimated at this time because it will depend
upon factors that are not certain, such as the price of gas and the amount
of gas purchased under the long-term contract. In recent years, Entergy
Louisiana has made purchases under that contract totaling from 91 million
to 121 million annually. Had the proposed settlement terms been
applicable to such purchases, the under-recoveries would have ranged from
 4 million to 9 million per year.

Filings with the MPSC

Formula Rate Plan Filings (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Mississippi)

 In March 2000, Entergy Mississippi submitted its annual performance-
based formula rate plan for the 1999 test year. The filing indicated that
no change in rate levels was warranted and the current rate levels remain
in effect.

 In March 1999, Entergy Mississippi submitted its annual performance-
based formula rate plan filing for the 1998 test year. In April 1999, the
MPSC approved a prospective rate reduction of 13.3 million, effective May
1999. In June 1999, Entergy Mississippi revised its March 1999 filing to
include a portion of refinanced long-term debt not included in the original
filing. This revision resulted in an additional rate reduction of
approximately 1.5 million, effective July 1999.

MPSC Fuel Cost Review (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Mississippi)

 In December 2000, the MPSC approved an increase in Entergy
Mississippi's energy cost recovery rider to collect the under-recovered
fuel and purchased power costs incurred as of September 30, 2000. The
recovery of 136.7 million, plus carrying charges, will occur over a 24-
month period effective with the first billing cycle of January 2001. As
approved by the MPSC, Entergy Mississippi will be making quarterly energy
cost recovery filings beginning in January 2001 to reflect under-recovered
fuel and purchased power costs from the second prior calendar quarter.

Filings with the Council

1997 Settlement (Entergy Corporation and Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy New Orleans submitted its cost of service and revenue
requirement filing in September 1997 to the Council. In connection with
this filing, Entergy New Orleans filed a settlement agreement with the
Council, which was approved in November 1998. The settlement agreement
required the following:

 o base rate reductions for Entergy New Orleans' electric customers of
 7.1 million effective January 1, 1999, 3.2 million effective October 1,
 1999, and 16.1 million effective October 1, 2000;
 o a base rate reduction for Entergy New Orleans' gas customers of 1.9
 million effective January 1999; and
 o no base rate increases prior to October 1, 2001.

Natural Gas (Entergy Corporation and Entergy New Orleans)

 The Council held hearings in May 1999 regarding the prudence of
Entergy New Orleans' natural gas purchasing practices. Entergy New Orleans
made an offer to settle this matter in conjunction with the offer to settle
the gas retail open access issue, and the offer was accepted by the
Council. Management has provided adequate reserves for the outcome of this
proceeding.

Fuel Adjustment Clause Litigation (Entergy Corporation and Entergy New
Orleans)

 In April 1999, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy
New Orleans, Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power in
state court in Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy New
Orleans ratepayers. The plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged
injuries arising from the defendants' alleged violations of Louisiana's
antitrust laws in connection with certain costs passed on to ratepayers in
Entergy New Orleans' fuel adjustment filings with the Council. In
particular, plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans improperly included
certain costs in the calculation of fuel charges and that Entergy New
Orleans imprudently purchased high-cost fuel from other Entergy affiliates.
Plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans and the other defendant Entergy
companies conspired to make these purchases to the detriment of Entergy New
Orleans' ratepayers and to the benefit of Entergy's shareholders, in
violation of Louisiana's antitrust laws. Plaintiffs also seek to recover
interest and attorneys' fees. Exceptions to the plaintiffs' allegations
were filed by Entergy, asserting, among other things, that jurisdiction
over these issues rests with the Council and FERC. If necessary, at the
appropriate time, Entergy will also raise its defenses to the antitrust
claims. At present, the suit in state court is stayed by stipulation of
the parties.

 Plaintiffs also filed this complaint with the Council in order to
initiate a review by the Council of the plantiffs' allegations and to force
restitution to ratepayers of all costs they allege were improperly and
imprudently included in the fuel adjustment filings. Discovery has begun
in the proceedings before the Council. In April 2000, testimony was filed
on behalf of the plaintiffs in this proceeding. The testimony asserts,
among other things, that Entergy New Orleans and other defendants have
engaged in fuel procurement and power purchasing practices that could have
resulted in New Orleans customers being overcharged by more than 59
million over a period of years. However, it is not clear precisely what
periods and damages are being alleged. Entergy intends to defend this
matter vigorously, both in court and before the Council. Hearings will be
held in October 2001. The ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and the Council
proceeding cannot be predicted at this time.

Purchased Power for Summer 2000 (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy
New Orleans)

 The domestic utility companies filed applications with the APSC, the
LPSC, the MPSC, and the Council to approve the sale of power by Entergy
Gulf States from its unregulated, undivided 30 interest in River Bend
formerly owned by Cajun to the other domestic utility companies during the
summer of 2000. In addition, Entergy Gulf States and Entergy Louisiana
filed an application with the LPSC for authorization to purchase capacity
and electric power from third parties for the summer of 2000. The
commissions and Council approved the applications, with a reservation of
their right to review the prudence of the purchases and the appropriate
categorization of the costs as either capacity or energy charges for
purposes of recovery.

 The LPSC reviewed the purchases and found that Entergy Louisiana's and
Entergy Gulf States' costs were prudently incurred, but decided that
approximately 34 of the costs should be categorized as capacity charges,
and therefore should be recovered through base rates and not through the
fuel adjustment clause. In November 2000, the LPSC ordered refunds of
 11.1 million for Entergy Louisiana and 3.6 million for Entergy Gulf
States, for which adequate reserves have been made. These costs
categorized as capacity charges will be included in the costs of service
used to determine the base rates of those companies.

River Bend Cost Deferrals (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Gulf States)

 Entergy Gulf States was amortizing 182 million of River Bend
operating and purchased power costs, depreciation, and accrued carrying
charges over a 20-year period. In accordance with the June 1999 Texas
settlement agreement discussed above, Entergy Gulf States reduced these
deferred costs by 93.9 million, for which adequate reserves had been
recorded. Entergy Gulf States also was allowed to amortize the remainder
of the accelerated balance as of January 1, 1999, over three years on a
straight-line basis ending December 31, 2001.

Grand Gulf 1 Deferrals and Retained Shares

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Arkansas)

 Under the settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and
amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22 of its 36 share of Grand
Gulf 1-related costs and recovers the remaining 78 of its share in rates.
In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share
to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a
price equal to its avoided energy cost, which is currently less than
Entergy Arkansas' cost of energy from its retained share.

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana)

 In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late
1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to
costs associated with Entergy Louisiana's share of capacity and energy from
Grand Gulf 1, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana
retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers, 18 of its 14 share
of the costs of Grand Gulf 1 capacity and energy and recovers the remaining
82 of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through
the fuel adjustment clause 4.6 cents per KWH for the energy related to its
retained portion of these costs. Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs
for Grand Gulf 1 are recovered through Entergy Louisiana's base rates.
Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to nonaffiliated
parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject
to the LPSC's approval.

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy New Orleans)

 Under various rate settlements with the Council in 1986, 1988, and
1991, Entergy New Orleans agreed to absorb and not recover from ratepayers
a total of 96.2 million of its Grand Gulf 1 costs. Entergy New Orleans
was permitted to implement annual rate increases in decreasing amounts each
year through 1995, and to defer certain costs and related carrying charges
for recovery on a schedule extending from 1991 through 2001. As of
December 31, 2000, the uncollected balance of Entergy New Orleans' deferred
costs was 11 million.

FERC Settlement (Entergy Corporation and System Energy)

 In November 1994, FERC approved an agreement settling a long-standing
dispute involving income tax allocation procedures of System Energy. In
accordance with the agreement, System Energy will refund a total of
approximately 62 million, plus interest, to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans through June 2004.
System Energy also reclassified from utility plant to other deferred debits
approximately 81 million of other Grand Gulf 1 costs. Although such costs
are excluded from rate base, System Energy is amortizing and recovering
these costs over a 10-year period. Interest on the 62 million refund and
the loss of the return on the 81 million of other Grand Gulf 1 costs will
reduce Entergy's and System Energy's net income by approximately 10
million annually.

Proposed Rate Increase

(System Energy)

 System Energy applied to FERC in May 1995 for a 65.5 million rate
increase. The request sought changes to System Energy's rate schedule,
including increases in the revenue requirement associated with
decommissioning costs, the depreciation rate, and the rate of return on
common equity. The request also includes a proposed change in the
accounting recognition of nuclear refueling outage costs from that of
expensing those costs as incurred to the deferral and amortization method
described in Note 1 to the financial statements. In December 1995, System
Energy implemented the 65.5 million rate increase, subject to refund, for
which a portion has been reserved. After holding hearings in 1996, a FERC
ALJ found that portions of System Energy's request should be rejected,
including a proposed increase in return on common equity from 11 to 13 
and a requested change in decommissioning cost methodology. The ALJ
recommended a decrease in the return on common equity from 11 to 10.8 .
Other portions of System Energy's request for a rate increase were approved
by the ALJ.

 After a hearing, FERC issued an order in July 2000 in the proceeding.
FERC affirmed the ALJ's adoption of a 10.8 return on equity, but modified
the return to reflect changes in capital market conditions since the ALJ's
decision. FERC adjusted the rate of return to 10.58 for the period
December 1995 to the date of FERC's decision, and prospectively adjusted
the rate of return to 10.94 from the date of FERC's decision. FERC's
decision also changed other aspects of System Energy's proposed rate
schedule, including the depreciation rate and decommissioning costs and
their methodology.

 System Energy has provided reserves for a potential refund to the rate
level of the initial ALJ decision, including interest. Management has
analyzed the effect of FERC's decision, and, given the reserve in place,
has concluded that a refund to the FERC decision rate level is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on Entergy's, System Energy's, or the
domestic utility companies' results of operations. System Energy has filed
a request for rehearing of FERC's order, which defers any refunds until
after further FERC action.

(Entergy Mississippi)

 Entergy Mississippi's allocation of the proposed System Energy
wholesale rate increase is 21.6 million annually. In July 1995, Entergy
Mississippi filed a schedule with the MPSC that defers the retail recovery
of the System Energy rate increase. The deferral plan, which was approved
by the MPSC, began in December 1995, the effective date of the System
Energy rate increase, and will end after the issuance of a final order by
FERC. Under this plan, the deferral period was anticipated to have ended
by September 1998, and the deferred amount would have been amortized over
48 months beginning in October 1998. Entergy Mississippi filed a revised
deferral plan with the MPSC in August 1998 that provided for recovery,
effective with October 1998 billings, of 11.8 million of the System Energy
rate increase that was approved by the FERC ALJ's initial decision in July
1996. The 11.8 million was being amortized over the original 48-month
period, which began in October 1998. In August 2000, as a result of the
July 2000 FERC Order and Entergy's request for rehearing, Entergy
Mississippi filed a second revised deferral plan with the MPSC that
provides for a one year suspension of the recovery of the ALJ amount
deferred prior to October 1998. The amount of System Energy's proposed
increase in excess of the 11.8 million will also continue to be deferred
until the issuance of a final order by FERC, or October 2002, whichever
occurs first. These deferred amounts, plus carrying charges, will be
amortized over a 36-month period beginning in October 2002.

(Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy New Orleans' allocation of the proposed System Energy
wholesale rate increase is 11.1 million annually. In February 1996,
Entergy New Orleans filed a plan with the Council to defer 50 of the
amount of the System Energy rate increase. The deferral began in February
1996 and will end after the issuance of a final order by FERC.

Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery Tariff

(Entergy Arkansas)

 In April 1998, FERC approved the Grand Gulf Accelerated Recovery
Tariff (GGART) that Entergy Arkansas filed as part of the settlement
agreement that the APSC approved in December 1997. The GGART was designed
to allow Entergy Arkansas to pay down a portion of its Grand Gulf purchased
power obligation in advance of the implementation of retail access in
Arkansas. The GGART provides for the acceleration of 165.3 million of its
obligation over the period January 1, 1999 through June 30, 2004. In
December 2000, the APSC approved an amendment to the settlement agreement
that directed Entergy Arkansas to seek FERC approval for the cessation of
the GGART as of July 1, 2001. The settlement agreement with the APSC is
discussed above in "Filings with the APSC".

(Entergy Mississippi)

 In September 1998, FERC approved the GGART for Entergy Mississippi's
allocable portion of Grand Gulf, which was filed with FERC in August 1998.
The GGART provides for the acceleration of Entergy Mississippi's Grand Gulf
purchased power obligation in an amount totaling 221.3 million over the
period October 1, 1998 through June 30, 2004.

December 2000 Ice Storms (Entergy Arkansas)

 In mid- and late December 2000, two separate ice storms left 226,000
and 212,500 Arkansas customers, respectively, without electric power in its
service area. The storms were the most severe natural disasters ever to
affect Entergy Arkansas, causing damage to transmission and distribution
lines, equipment, poles, and facilities. Of the 195 million of estimated
storm-related costs, approximately 23 million were capitalized in 2000.
Entergy Arkansas has applied 2000 excess earnings to offset some of these
costs, and Entergy Arkansas intends to seek approval from the APSC for
recovery of the remaining storm-related costs. Historically, the APSC
has allowed recovery of costs associated with the restoration of service
from storms and other natural disasters.

The valuation allowance is provided primarily against foreign tax
credit carryforwards, which can be utilized against future United States
taxes on foreign source income. If these carryforwards are not utilized,
they will expire between 2001 and 2004.

 At December 31, 2000, unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were
approximately 58.7 million. Since it is Entergy's intention to
indefinitely reinvest these earnings, no U.S. taxes have been provided.
Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise,
Entergy could be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to foreign tax
credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.

NOTE 4. LINES OF CREDIT AND RELATED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 The short-term borrowings of the domestic utility companies and System
Energy are limited to amounts authorized by the SEC. The current limits
authorized are effective through November 30, 2001. In addition to
borrowing from commercial banks, Entergy companies are authorized to borrow
from the Entergy System Money Pool (money pool). The money pool is an
inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the domestic utility
companies' dependence on external short-term borrowings. Borrowings from
the money pool and external borrowings combined may not exceed the SEC
authorized limits. The following are the SEC-authorized limits and
borrowings from the money pool for the domestic utility companies and
System Energy as of December 31, 2000 (there were no borrowings outstanding
from external sources):

 Other Entergy companies have SEC authorization to borrow from Entergy
Corporation through the money pool and from external sources in an
aggregate principal amount up to 265 million. These Entergy companies had
 153.2 million outstanding as of December 31, 2000 borrowed from the money
pool. Some of these borrowings are restricted as to use and are
collateralized by certain assets.

 In May 2000, Entergy Corporation amended its 364-day bank credit
facility, increasing the capacity from 250 million to 500 million, of
which 387 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2000. The weighted-
average interest rate on Entergy's outstanding borrowings as of December
31, 2000 and 1999 was 7.43 and 7.48 , respectively. The commitment fee
for this facility is currently 0.15 of the line amount. Commitment fees
and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate
depending on the senior debt ratings of the domestic utility companies.
There is further discussion of commitments for long-term financing
arrangements in Note 7 to the financial statements.
 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi each
obtained 364-day credit facilities in 2001, and the lines have been fully
drawn. Entergy Arkansas will primarily use the proceeds to pay for costs
incurred in the December 2000 ice storms. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
Mississippi will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and
working capital needs. The facilities have variable interest rates and the
average commitment fee is 0.13 . The amounts and dates obtained for the
facilities follow:

 Amount of
 Company Facility Date Obtained

 Entergy Arkansas 63 million January 31, 2001
 Entergy Louisiana 30 million January 31, 2001
 Entergy Mississippi 25 million February 2, 2001

 In 2001, Entergy, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
requested an increase from the SEC in their current authorized short-term
borrowing limits, which includes borrowings through the money pool. The
increases requested are as follows:

 Company Current Limit Requested Limit

 Entergy Mississippi 103 million 160 million
 Entergy New Orleans 35 million 100 million
 Other Entergy subsidiaries 265 million 420 million

The request will increase the current SEC authorized short-term borrowing
limits for the domestic utility companies and System Energy, which are
effective through November 30, 2001, from 1.078 billion to 1.2 billion.

 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Entergy will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase in open market transactions
 430 million of its common stock prior to the close of the Merger. As of
December 31, 2000, Entergy has repurchased 4.2 million shares for an
aggregate amount of 145.6 million after the signing of the Merger
Agreement. Prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, Entergy had been
repurchasing shares under two Board authorizations. In October 1998, the
Board approved a plan for the repurchase of Entergy common stock through
December 31, 2001 to fulfill the requirements of various compensation and
benefit plans. This stock repurchase plan provided for open market
purchases of up to 5 million shares for an aggregate consideration of up to
 250 million. In July 1999, the Board approved the commitment of up to an
additional 750 million for the repurchase of Entergy common stock through
December 31, 2001. Shares were repurchased on a discretionary basis.
Prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, Entergy had repurchased 25.3
million shares for an aggregate amount of 652.5 million under these two
Board authorizations.

 Entergy Corporation reissues treasury shares to meet the requirements
of the Stock Plan for Outside Directors (Directors' Plan), the Equity
Ownership Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (Equity Ownership
Plan), and certain other stock benefit plans. The Directors' Plan awards
to nonemployee directors a portion of their compensation in the form of a
fixed number of shares of Entergy Corporation previously repurchased common
stock. Shares awarded under the Directors' Plan were 5,650 during 2000;
11,400 during 1999; and 5,100 during 1998.

 During 2000, Entergy Corporation issued 89,425 shares of its
previously repurchased common stock to satisfy stock options exercised and
stock purchases under the Equity Ownership Plan. In addition, Entergy
Corporation received proceeds of 2.0 million from the issuance of 89,894
shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase
plan during 2000.

 The Equity Ownership Plan grants stock options, equity awards, and
incentive awards to key employees of the domestic utility companies. The
costs of equity and incentive awards are charged to income over the period
of the grant or restricted period, as appropriate. In 2000, 14 million
was charged to compensation expense. Stock options are granted at exercise
prices not less than market value on the date of grant. The options
granted prior to 1999 were generally exercisable six months from the date
of grant, with the exception of 40,000 options granted on December 1, 1998,
which became exercisable on January 1, 2000. The majority of options
granted in 2000 and 1999 will become exercisable in equal amounts on each
of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. Options are not
exercisable beyond ten years from the date of the grant.

 In April 2000, the Board authorized the establishment of the Equity
Awards Plan in substantially the same form as the Equity Ownership Plan.
Equity awards and incentive awards earned under this plan will be in the
form of performance units, which are equal to the cash value of shares of
Entergy Corporation common stock at the time of payment. Performance units
will earn the cash equivalent of the dividends paid during the performance
period applicable to each plan. Beginning January 2001, most stock options
will be granted under the Equity Awards Plan. Stock options under this plan
will be granted on the same general terms as stock options granted under
the Equity Ownership Plan.

 Entergy does not recognize compensation expense for stock options
issued with exercise prices at market value on the date of grant. The
impact on Entergy's net income for each of the years 2000, 1999, and 1998
would have been 19.0 million, 15.5 million, and 278,000, respectively,
had compensation cost for the stock options been recognized based on the
fair value of options at the grant date for awards under the option plan.
The impact on earnings per share for each of the years 2000 and 1999 would
have been a reduction of .08 and .06, respectively. The impact on
earnings per share for 1998 would have been less than .01 per share.

 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following stock
option weighted-average assumptions:

 2000 1999 1998

 Stock price volatility 24.4 20.3 20.9

Near the end of January 2001, an additional 3,274,774 options became
exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 25.32.

 To meet the requirements of the Employee Stock Investment Plan (ESIP),
the SEC had authorized Entergy Corporation to issue or acquire, through
March 31, 2000, up to 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to be held as
treasury shares. The ESIP was authorized through the 1999 plan year ending
March 31, 2000 and was not renewed for the 2000 plan year. Entergy
Corporation could issue either treasury shares or previously authorized but
unissued shares to satisfy ESIP requirements. Under the terms of the ESIP,
employees could choose each year to have up to 10 of their regular annual
salary (not to exceed 25,000) withheld to purchase the Company's common
stock at a purchase price equal to 85 of the lower of the market value on
the first or last business day of the plan year ending March 31. Under the
plan, the number of subscribed shares was 382,878 in 2000; 285,505 in 1999;
and 294,108 in 1998.

 The fair value of ESIP shares granted was estimated on the date of the
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with expected ESIP
weighted-average assumptions:

 2000 1999 1998

 Stock price volatility 35.6 20.9 24.1 
 Expected term in years 1 1 1
 Risk-free interest rate 5.9 4.6 5.1 
 Dividend yield 5.9 4.3 6.1 
 Dividend payment 1.20 1.20 1.80

 The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted was
 3.39, 5.90, and 6.32 in 2000, 1999, and 1998 respectively. The impact
on, or (benefit) to Entergy's net income would have been 1 million, 3,086), and 256,000) in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, had
compensation cost for the ESIP been determined based on the fair value at
the grant date for awards under the ESIP. The impact on earnings per share
for each of the years would have been less than .01 per share.

 Entergy sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries (Savings Plan). The Savings Plan is a defined contribution
plan covering eligible employees of Entergy and its subsidiaries who have
completed certain service requirements. The Savings Plan provides that the
employing Entergy subsidiary may make matching contributions to the plan in
an amount equal to 50 of the participant's basic contribution, up to 6 of
their salary, in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock. Entergy's
subsidiaries' contributions to the Savings Plan, and any income thereon,
are invested in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock. Effective
January 1, 2001, participants in the Savings Plan may direct their matching
contributions from the employing Entergy subsidiary in an amount equal to
50 of the employee's contribution to other investment funds. Employees
who continue to direct their company-matching contributions to the purchase
of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock will receive matching
contributions in the amount of 75 of their basic contribution, which is
limited to 6 of their salary. Entergy's subsidiaries contributed 16.1
million in 2000, 14.5 million in 1999, and 13.6 million in 1998 to the
Savings Plan.

 EPDC maintains a credit facility of BPS45 million 67.2 million) to
finance the acquisition of the Damhead Creek Project, to assist in the
financing of the Saltend project, and for general corporate purposes in
connection with the acquisition and development of power generation,
distribution or transmission facilities. No cash advances were outstanding
under this facility at December 31, 2000 and 1999. The interest rate on
the facility was 6.55 and 5.88 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The commitment fee is 0.17 of the undrawn amount. As of
December 31, 2000, EPDC had BPS40.3 million 60.2 million) of letters of
credit outstanding under the credit facility to support project commitments
on the Saltend and Damhead Creek projects and for other development
purposes. In February 2001, after the Damhead Creek project reached
commercial operation, EPDC paid its equity commitment of BPS36.1 million 53.9 million) on the project and cancelled the letter of credit securing
that commitment. The amount of letters of credit outstanding under this
facility was therefore reduced to BPS4.2 million 6.3 million).

 Saltend Cogeneration Company Limited (SCCL), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of EPDC, maintains a BPS402.8 million 601.4 million) non-
recourse senior credit facility. This facility provides term loan
facilities, cost overrun and working capital facilities, and contingent
letter of credit and guarantee facilities to finance the construction and
operation of the Saltend power plant. Borrowings under the senior credit
facility are repayable over a 15-year period that began December 31, 2000.
In addition, SCCL maintains a BPS68.2 million 101.8 million) subordinated
credit facility, which was drawn August 31, 2000. SCCL used the proceeds
from the subordinated credit facility to repay a portion of the senior
credit facility. The subordinated credit facility is repayable over a 10-
year period that began December 31, 2000. All of the assets of SCCL are
pledged as collateral under these two credit facilities. Under the
facilities, SCCL's ability to make distributions of dividends, loans, or
advances to EPDC is restricted by, among other things, the requirement to
pay permitted project costs, make debt repayments, and maintain cash
reserves.

 In February 1998, SCCL entered into 15-year interest rate swap
agreements for 85 of the debt outstanding under the bridge and term loan
portion of its senior credit facility on an average fixed-rate basis of
6.44 . At December 31, 2000, SCCL had outstanding interest rate swap
agreements totalling a notional amount of BPS296.9 million 443.3
million). The mark-to-market valuation of the interest rate swap
agreements at December 31, 2000, was a net liability of BPS11.1 million 16.6 million).

 Damhead Finance LDC (DFLDC), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
EPDC, maintains a BPS463.4 million 691.9 million) non-recourse senior
credit facility. The facility provides bridge and term loan facilities,
cost overrun and working capital facilities, and contingent letters of
credit and guarantee facilities to finance the construction and operation
of the Damhead Creek power plant. Borrowings under the senior credit
facility are repayable over a fifteen-year period beginning December 31,
2001. DFLDC also maintains a BPS36.1 million 53.9 million) subordinated
credit facility, which was drawn in February 2001. DFLDC used the proceeds
from the subordinated credit facility to repay a portion of the senior
credit facility. The subordinated credit facility is payable over a ten-
year period beginning December 31, 2001. After EPDC paid its equity
commitment in February 2001, an equity bridge facility of BPS35.8 million 53.5 million) under the senior credit facility was repaid. All of the
assets of DFLDC are pledged as collateral under the senior credit facility
and the subordinated credit facility. DFLDC's ability to make
distributions of dividends, loans, or advances to EPDC is restricted by,
among other things, the requirement to pay permitted project costs, make
debt repayments, and maintain cash reserves.

 In 2000, a subsidiary of DFLDC entered into 10-year interest rate swap
agreements with an average fixed rate of 6.52 for approximately 80.9 of
the debt outstanding under the bridge and senior term loan portion of the
senior credit facility. At December 31, 2000, the interest rate swap
agreements outstanding totalled a notional amount of BPS277.6 million 414.5 million). The mark-to-market valuation of the interest rate swap
agreements at December 31, 2000, was a net liability of BPS12.3 million 18.4 million).

 In November 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
purchased the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 power plants in a seller-
financed transaction. Entergy issued notes to NYPA with seven annual
installments of approximately 108 million commencing one year from the
date of the closing, and eight annual installments of 20 million
commencing eight years from the date of the closing. These notes do not
have a stated interest rate.

NOTE 8. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, System Energy)

 Provisions within the Articles of Incorporation or pertinent
indentures and various other agreements relating to the long-term debt and
preferred stock of certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict
the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on their common and
preferred stock. Additionally, PUHCA prohibits Entergy Corporation's
subsidiaries from making loans or advances to Entergy Corporation. As of
December 31, 2000, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi had restricted
retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of
 199.3 million and 15.8 million, respectively. In 2000, Entergy
Corporation received dividend payments and returns of capital totaling
 918.3 million from subsidiaries.

 Under the Merger Agreement, Entergy can continue to pay dividends at
existing levels with increases permitted up to 5 over the amount of the
previous twelve-month period. In October 2000 and January 2001, the Board
declared quarterly dividends of 0.315 per share on Entergy's common stock.
This dividend level is an increase of 5 over the dividend level for the
twelve-month period prior to the Merger Agreement.

NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital Requirements and Financing (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, and System Energy)

 For the years 2001 through 2003, Entergy plans to spend 8.2 billion
in a capital investment plan focused on improving service at the domestic
utility companies and growing the global power development and domestic non-
utility nuclear businesses. It is estimated that 2.6 billion will be
spent by the domestic utility companies, 3.6 billion by the global power
development business, and 2.0 billion by the domestic non-utility nuclear
business. The capital investment plan is subject to modification based on
the ongoing effects of transition to competition planning, the ability to
recover regulated utility costs in rates, and the proposed business
combination with FPL Group. Additionally, the plan is contingent upon the
ability to access the capital necessary to finance the planned
expenditures, and significant borrowings may be necessary to implement
these capital spending plans. Capital expenditures (including nuclear fuel
but excluding AFUDC) for Entergy are estimated at 3.2 billion in 2001,
 2.5 billion in 2002, and 2.6 billion in 2003. Included in these totals
are estimated construction expenditures for the domestic utility companies
and System Energy as follows:

 2001 2002 2003 Total
 (In Millions)

Entergy Arkansas 297 200 205 702
Entergy Gulf States 293 216 220 729
Entergy Louisiana 222 175 168 565
Entergy Mississippi 147 128 113 388
Entergy New Orleans 53 46 48 147
System Energy 41 14 12 67

 The domestic utility companies will mainly focus their planned
spending on distribution and transmission projects that will support
continued reliability improvements and transitioning to a more competitive
environment.

 The global power development business will mainly focus its planned
spending on several merchant power plant projects either under construction
or in the planning stages in the U.S. and Europe, including the purchase of
gas turbines scheduled for delivery in 2001 through 2004 under an option to
purchase obtained from GE Power Systems.

 The domestic non-utility nuclear business will mainly focus its
planned spending on the acquisition of U.S. nuclear power plants from other
utilities, including the anticipated purchase in 2001, pending regulatory
approvals, of the 957 MW Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant located in
Westchester County, New York.

 Entergy will also require 2.4 billion during the period 2001-2003 to
meet long-term debt and preferred stock maturities and cash sinking fund
requirements. Entergy plans to meet these requirements primarily with
internally generated funds and cash on hand, supplemented by proceeds from
the issuance of debt, outstanding credit facilities, and project financing.
Certain domestic utility companies and System Energy may also continue the
reacquisition or refinancing of all or a portion of certain outstanding
series of preferred stock and long-term debt. See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" for additional
discussion of Entergy's capital spending plans.

Sales Warranties and Indemnities (Entergy Corporation)

 In the Entergy London and CitiPower sales transactions, Entergy or its
subsidiaries made certain warranties to the purchasers. These warranties
include representations regarding litigation, accuracy of financial
accounts, and the adequacy of existing tax provisions. Notice of a claim
on the CitiPower warranties must have been given by December 2000, and
Entergy's potential liability is limited to A 100 million 56 million).
Notice of a claim on the Entergy London warranties had to be given for
certain items by December 1999, and for the tax warranties, must be given
by June 30, 2001. Entergy's liability is limited to BPS1.4 billion 2.1
billion) on certain tax warranties and BPS140 million 209 million) on the
remaining warranties relating to the Entergy London sale. No such notices
have been received. Entergy has also agreed to maintain the net asset
value of the subsidiary that sold Entergy London at 700 million through
June 30, 2001. Management periodically reviews reserve levels for these
warranties and believes it has adequately provided for the ultimate
resolution of such matters as of December 31, 2000.

Fuel Purchase Agreements

(Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi)

 Entergy Arkansas has long-term contracts for the supply of low-sulfur
coal to White Bluff and Independence (which is also 25 owned by Entergy
Mississippi). These contracts, which expire in 2002 and 2011,
respectively, provide for approximately 85 of Entergy Arkansas' expected
annual coal requirements. Additional requirements are satisfied by spot
market purchases.

(Entergy Gulf States)

 Entergy Gulf States has a contract for a supply of low-sulfur coal for
Nelson Unit 6, which should be sufficient to satisfy the fuel requirements
at Nelson Unit 6 through 2010. Effective April 1, 2000, Louisiana
Generating LLC assumed ownership of Cajun's interest in the Big Cajun
generating facilities. The management of Louisiana Generating LLC has
advised Entergy Gulf States that it has executed coal supply and
transportation contracts that should provide an adequate supply of coal for
the operation of Big Cajun 2, Unit 3 for the foreseeable future.

(Entergy Louisiana)

 In June 1992, Entergy Louisiana agreed to a 20-year natural gas supply
contract. Entergy Louisiana agreed to purchase natural gas in annual
amounts equal to approximately one-third of its projected annual fuel
requirements for certain generating units. Annual demand charges
associated with this contract are estimated to be 7.2 million. Such
charges aggregate 87 million for the years 2001 through 2012.

(Entergy Corporation)

 Entergy's global power development business has entered into gas
supply contracts at the project level to supply up to 100 of the gas
requirements for the Saltend and Damhead Creek power plants located in the
UK. Both contracts have 15-year terms and include a take-or-pay obligation
for approximately 75 of the gas requirement for each plant.

Sales Agreements/Power Purchases

(Entergy Gulf States)

 In 1988, Entergy Gulf States entered into a joint venture with a
primary term of 20 years with Conoco, Inc., Citgo Petroleum Corporation,
and Vista Chemical Company (collectively the Industrial Participants).
Under this joint venture, Entergy Gulf States' Nelson Units 1 and 2 were
sold to NISCO, a partnership consisting of the Industrial Participants and
Entergy Gulf States. The Industrial Participants supply the fuel for the
units, while Entergy Gulf States operates the units at the discretion of
the Industrial Participants and purchases the electricity produced by the
units. Entergy Gulf States purchased electricity from the joint venture
totaling 62.8 million in 2000, 51.4 million in 1999, and 57.5 million in
1998.

(Entergy Louisiana)

 Entergy Louisiana has an agreement extending through the year 2031 to
purchase energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia
project. Entergy Louisiana made payments under the contract of
approximately 58.6 million in 2000, 70.3 million in 1999, and
 77.8 million in 1998. If the maximum percentage (94 of the energy is
made available to Entergy Louisiana, current production projections would
require estimated payments of approximately 88.8 million in 2001, and a
total of 3.4 billion for the years 2002 through 2031. Entergy Louisiana
currently recovers the costs of the purchased energy through its fuel
adjustment clause.

(Entergy Corporation)

 In the purchase transaction with Boston Edison, Entergy entered into
firm power purchase agreements with Boston Edison and other utilities that
expire at the end of 2004. One hundred percent of Pilgrim's output is
committed to those parties through 2001, and that commitment decreases to
50 by 2003. In the purchase transaction with NYPA, Entergy entered into
firm power purchase agreements with NYPA that expire at the end of 2004.
The Indian Point 3 power purchase agreement is for 100 of the plant's
output. The FitzPatrick power purchase agreement is for 100 of the
plant's output through 2003 and approximately 45 of the plant's output in
2004.

System Fuels (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 The domestic utility companies that are owners of System Fuels have
made loans to System Fuels to finance its fuel procurement, delivery, and
storage activities. The following loans outstanding to System Fuels as of
December 31, 2000 mature in 2008:

 Owner Ownership Loan Outstanding at December 31, 2000
 Percentage

Entergy Arkansas 35 11.0 million
Entergy Louisiana 33 14.2 million
Entergy Mississippi 19 5.5 million
Entergy New Orleans 13 3.3 million

Nuclear Insurance (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, System
Energy)

 The Price-Anderson Act limits public liability of a nuclear plant
owner for a single nuclear incident to approximately 9.5 billion.
Protection for this liability is provided through a combination of private
insurance (currently 200 million each for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business) and an industry assessment program. Under the
assessment program, the maximum payment requirement for each nuclear
incident would be 88.1 million per reactor, payable at a rate of
 10 million per licensed reactor per incident per year. Entergy has eight
licensed reactors, including Pilgrim, Indian Point 3, and FitzPatrick. As
a co-licensee of Grand Gulf 1 with System Energy, SMEPA would share 10 of
this obligation. In addition, each owner/licensee of Entergy's eight
nuclear units participates in a private insurance program that provides
coverage for worker tort claims filed for bodily injury caused by radiation
exposure. The program provides for a maximum assessment of approximately
 24.8 million for the eight nuclear units in the event that losses exceed
accumulated reserve funds.

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, System
Energy, and Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business are also
members of certain insurance programs that provide coverage for property
damage, including decontamination and premature decommissioning expense, to
members' nuclear generating plants. As of December 31, 2000, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy were
each insured against such losses up to 2.3 billion. Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business is insured for 1.115 billion in property damages
under these insurance programs. In addition, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
and Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business are members of an
insurance program that covers certain replacement power and business
interruption costs incurred due to prolonged nuclear unit outages. Under
the property damage and replacement power/business interruption insurance
programs, these Entergy subsidiaries could be subject to assessments if
losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurers. As of
December 31, 2000, the maximum amounts of such possible assessments were:
Entergy Arkansas - 12.0 million; Entergy Gulf States - 9.4 million;
Entergy Louisiana - 10.7 million; Entergy Mississippi - 0.7 million;
Entergy New Orleans - 0.3 million; System Energy - 9.6 million, and
Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business - 25.3 million. Under its
agreement with System Energy, SMEPA would share in System Energy's
obligation.

 Entergy maintains property insurance for each of its nuclear units in
excess of the NRC's minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees
of 1.06 billion per site. NRC regulations provide that the proceeds of
this insurance must be used, first, to render the reactor safe and stable,
and second, to complete decontamination operations. Only after proceeds
are dedicated for such use and regulatory approval is secured would any
remaining proceeds be made available for the benefit of plant owners or
their creditors.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Costs (Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, System
Energy, and Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business provide for
estimated future disposal costs for spent nuclear fuel in accordance with
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The affected Entergy companies
entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE will furnish disposal
service at a cost of one mill per net KWH generated and sold after April 7,
1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date. Entergy
Arkansas is the only Entergy company that generated electricity with
nuclear fuel prior to that date and has recorded a liability as of
December 31, 2000 of approximately 144 million for the one-time fee. The
fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full
recovery. Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business has accepted
assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick, and Indian Point 3 spent fuel
disposal contracts with the DOE previously held by Boston Edison and NYPA.
Boston Edison and NYPA have paid or retained liability for the fees for all
generation prior to the purchase dates of those plants. Entergy considers
all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued
interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense. Provisions to
recover such costs have been or will be made by the domestic utility
companies in applications to regulatory authorities.

 Delays have occurred in the DOE's program for the acceptance and
disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository. Considerable
uncertainty exists regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin
to accept spent fuel from Entergy facilities for storage or disposal.

 Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners
of nuclear plants are responsible for their own spent fuel storage.
Current on-site spent fuel storage capacity at Grand Gulf 1 and River Bend
is estimated to be sufficient until approximately 2005 and 2003,
respectively. The spent fuel pool at Waterford 3 was recently expanded
through the replacement of the existing storage racks with higher density
storage racks. This expansion should provide sufficient storage for
Waterford 3 until after 2010. An ANO storage facility using dry casks
began operation in 1996 and was expanded in 2000. Current on-site spent
fuel storage capacity at ANO, including the current expansion, is estimated
to be sufficient until approximately 2002. This facility will be further
expanded as required. The spent fuel storage facility at Pilgrim is
licensed to provide enough storage capacity until approximately 2012.
FitzPatrick has sufficient spent fuel storage capacity until 2002, and
additional dry cask storage capacity is being constructed that will provide
sufficient storage capacity through 2004. FitzPatrick will begin accepting
dry casks this year. Indian Point 3 currently has sufficient spent fuel
storage capacity until approximately 2010.

 During 2000, a contract was signed with a spent fuel storage provider
to develop on-site dry cask storage capacity for ANO, River Bend, and
potentially Grand Gulf. This additional capacity will meet the spent fuel
storage requirements for those plants through at least 2005. In addition,
a contract is in place to provide dry cask storage capacity for FitzPatrick
through at least 2003, with further extensions possible.

 Total approved decommissioning costs for rate recovery purposes as of
December 31, 2000, for the domestic utility companies' nuclear power
plants, excluding the co-owner share of Grand Gulf 1, are as follows:

Total Estimated Approved
 Decommissioning Costs

Entergy Arkansas filed a request with the NRC for a 20-year life
extension for ANO 1 in February 2000. In October 2000, the APSC ordered
Entergy Arkansas to reflect 20-year license extensions in its determination
of the ANO 1 and ANO 2 decommissioning revenue requirements for rates to be
effective January 1, 2001. Entergy Arkansas will not recover
decommissioning costs in 2001 for ANO 1 and 2 based on the assumption that
the licenses will be extended and that the existing decommissioning trust
funds, together with their expected future earnings, will meet the
estimated decommissioning costs.

 Entergy Louisiana prepared a decommissioning cost update for Waterford
3 in 1999 and produced a revised decommissioning cost update of 481.5
million. This cost update was filed with the LPSC in the third quarter of
2000.

 In the Texas retail jurisdiction in a case filed with the PUCT in
March 2000, Entergy Gulf States included River Bend decommissioning costs
of 481.5 million based on a 1999 cost update amount of 525.8 million.
PUCT substantive rules for rate requests for decommissioning limit the
allowance for contingencies to ten percent, although the actual estimate
employs greater contingency amounts. In LPSC rate reviews filed in May
1999 and 2000, Entergy Gulf States included decommissioning costs based on
a 1998 update of 562.7 million and a 1999 update of 525.8 million,
respectively. The decommissioning liability for the 30 percent share of
River Bend formerly owned by Cajun was funded by a transfer of 132 million
to the River Bend Decommissioning Trust at the completion of Cajun's
bankruptcy proceedings.

 System Energy was previously recovering amounts through rates
sufficient to fund 198 million (in 1989 dollars) of its Grand Gulf 1
decommissioning costs. System Energy included updated decommissioning
costs (based on the 1994 study) in its pending rate increase filing with
FERC. Rates requested in this proceeding were placed into effect in
December 1995, subject to refund. In July 2000, FERC issued an order
approving a lower decommissioning cost than what was requested by System
Energy. System Energy filed a motion for rehearing, which has been
granted, and System Energy continues to collect decommissioning revenue at
the requested level. A 1999 decommissioning cost update of 540.8 million
for Grand Gulf has not yet been filed with FERC.

 As part of the Pilgrim purchase, Boston Edison funded a 471.3 million
decommissioning trust fund, which was transferred to Entergy's domestic non-
utility nuclear business. After a favorable tax determination regarding
the trust fund, Entergy returned 43 million of the trust fund to Boston
Edison. Based on cost estimates provided by an outside consultant, Entergy
believes that Pilgrim's decommissioning fund will be adequate to cover
future decommissioning costs for the Pilgrim plant without any additional
deposits to the trust.

 For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000, NYPA
retains the decommissioning trusts and the decommissioning liability. NYPA
and Entergy executed decommissioning agreements, which specify their
respective obligations with respect to decommissioning. NYPA has the
right, but not the obligation, to require Entergy to assume the
decommissioning liability provided the corresponding decommissioning trust,
up to a specified level, is assigned to Entergy. If the decommissioning
liability is retained by NYPA, Entergy will perform the decommissioning of
the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the
amount in the respective trusts. Entergy believes that amounts available to
it under either scenario are sufficient to cover the future decommissioning
costs without any additional contributions to the trusts.

 Entergy periodically reviews and updates estimated decommissioning
costs. Although Entergy is presently under-recovering for Grand Gulf,
Waterford 3, and River Bend based on the above estimates, applications have
been and will continue to be made to the appropriate regulatory authorities
to reflect projected decommissioning costs in rates.

 Entergy amounts recovered in rates are deposited in trust funds and
reported at market value based upon market quotes or as determined by
widely used pricing services. These trust fund assets largely offset the
accumulated decommissioning liability that is recorded as accumulated
depreciation for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, and Entergy
Louisiana, and are recorded as deferred credits for System Energy and
Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business. The liability associated
with the trust funds received from Cajun with the transfer of Cajun's 30 
share of River Bend is also recorded as a deferred credit by Entergy Gulf
States.

 The cumulative liabilities and actual decommissioning expenses
recorded in 2000 by Entergy were as follows:

 Cumulative 2000 Cumulative
 Liabilities as of 2000 Trust Decommissioning Liabilities as of
 December 31, 1999 Earnings Expenses December 31, 2000

 ======== ===== ===== ========

 (a) Trust earnings on the decommissioning trust fund for Pilgrim are
 recorded as income and, therefore, are not included in the
 decommissioning liability.

 In 1999 and 1998, ANO's decommissioning expense was 10.7 million and
 15.6 million, respectively; River Bend's decommissioning expense was 7.6
million and 3.4 million, respectively; Waterford 3's decommissioning
expense was 8.8 million in both years; and Grand Gulf 1's decommissioning
expense was 18.9 million in both years. Pilgrim's decommissioning expense
was 6.8 million for 1999. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from
the estimates because of regulatory requirements, changes in technology,
and increased costs of labor, materials, and equipment.

 The EPAct contains a provision that assesses domestic nuclear
utilities with fees for the decontamination and decommissioning of the
DOE's past uranium enrichment operations. The decontamination and
decommissioning assessments are being used to set up a fund into which
contributions from utilities and the federal government will be placed.
Annual assessments (in 2000 dollars), which will be adjusted annually for
inflation, are for 15 years and are approximately 4.0 million for Entergy
Arkansas, 1.0 million for Entergy Gulf States, 1.5 million for Entergy
Louisiana, and 1.7 million for System Energy. At December 31, 2000, six
years of assessments were remaining. DOE fees are included in other
current liabilities and other non-current liabilities and, as of December
31, 2000, recorded liabilities were 23.9 million for Entergy Arkansas,
 4.2 million for Entergy Gulf States, 9.1 million for Entergy Louisiana,
and 8.8 million for System Energy. Regulatory assets in the financial
statements offset these liabilities. FERC requires that utilities treat
these assessments as costs of fuel as they are amortized and recover these
costs through rates in the same manner as other fuel costs.

Environmental Issues

(Entergy Arkansas)

 Entergy Arkansas has received notices from the EPA and the Arkansas
Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) alleging that Entergy Arkansas,
along with others, may be a potentially responsible party (PRP) for clean-
up costs associated with a site in Arkansas. As of December 31, 2000, a
remaining recorded liability of approximately 5.0 million existed related
to the cleanup of that site.

(Entergy Gulf States)

 Entergy Gulf States has been designated as a PRP for the cleanup of
certain hazardous waste disposal sites. Entergy Gulf States is currently
negotiating with the EPA and state authorities regarding the cleanup of
these sites. Several class action and other suits have been filed in state
and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States and others for
damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related
disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Gulf States' premises.
While the amounts at issue in the clean-up efforts and suits may be
substantial, Entergy Gulf States believes that its results of operations
and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected by the
outcome of the suits. As of December 31, 2000, a remaining provision of
 16.8 million existed relating to the cleanup of the remaining sites at
which the EPA has designated Entergy Gulf States as a PRP.

(Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans)

 During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules for solid waste regulation,
including regulation of wastewater impoundments. Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy New Orleans have determined that certain of their power plant
wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and have chosen
to upgrade or close them. As a result, a remaining recorded liability in
the amount of 5.8 million for Entergy Louisiana and 0.5 million for
Entergy New Orleans existed at December 31, 2000 for wastewater upgrades
and closures. Completion of this work is pending LDEQ approval.

City Franchise Ordinances (Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of
New Orleans pursuant to franchise ordinances. These ordinances contain a
continuing option for the city to purchase Entergy New Orleans' electric
and gas utility properties. A resolution to study the advantages for
ratepayers that might result from an acquisition of these properties has
been filed in a committee of the Council. The committee has deferred
consideration of that resolution until May 2001. The full Council must
approve the resolution to commence such a study before it can become
effective.

Waterford 3 Lease Obligations (Entergy Louisiana)

 On September 28, 1989, Entergy Louisiana entered into three identical
transactions for the sale and leaseback of undivided interests (aggregating
approximately 9.3 in Waterford 3. In July 1997, Entergy Louisiana caused
the lessors to issue 307.6 million aggregate principal amount of Waterford
3 Secured Lease Obligation Bonds, 8.76 Series due 2017, to refinance the
outstanding bonds originally issued to finance the purchase of the
undivided interests by the lessors. The lease payments were reduced to
reflect the lower interest costs. Upon the occurrence of certain events,
Entergy Louisiana may be obligated to pay amounts sufficient to permit the
termination of the lease transactions and may be required to assume the
outstanding bonds issued to finance, in part, the lessors' acquisition of
the undivided interests in Waterford 3.

Employment Litigation (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans are defendants in numerous lawsuits
filed by former employees asserting that they were wrongfully terminated
and/or discriminated against on the basis of age, race, and/or sex.
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans are vigorously defending these suits and
deny any liability to the plaintiffs. However, no assurance can be given
as to the outcome of these cases.

Grand Gulf 1-Related Agreements

Capital Funds Agreement (Entergy Corporation and System Energy)

 Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient
capital to (i) maintain System Energy's equity capital at an amount equal
to a minimum of 35 of its total capitalization (excluding short-term
debt), and (ii) permit the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf 1
and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed money of System Energy when
due. In addition, under supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement
assigning System Energy's rights as security for specific debt of System
Energy, Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions
to enable System Energy to make payments on such debt when due.

 System Energy has entered into agreements with Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans whereby
they are obligated to purchase their respective entitlements of capacity
and energy from System Energy's 90 ownership and leasehold interest in
Grand Gulf 1, and to make payments that, together with other available
funds, are adequate to cover System Energy's operating expenses. System
Energy would have to secure funds from other sources, including Entergy
Corporation's obligations under the Capital Funds Agreement, to cover any
shortfalls from payments received from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under these agreements.

Unit Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 System Energy has agreed to sell all of its 90 owned and leased share
of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf 1 to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans in accordance with
specified percentages (Entergy Arkansas-36 , Entergy Louisiana-14 , Entergy
Mississippi-33 , and Entergy New Orleans-17 as ordered by FERC. Charges
under this agreement are paid in consideration for the purchasing
companies' respective entitlement to receive capacity and energy and are
payable irrespective of the quantity of energy delivered so long as the
unit remains in commercial operation. The agreement will remain in effect
until terminated by the parties and the termination is approved by FERC,
most likely upon Grand Gulf 1's retirement from service. Monthly
obligations for payments under the agreement are approximately 19 million
for Entergy Arkansas, 7 million for Entergy Louisiana, 17 million for
Entergy Mississippi, and 9 million for Entergy New Orleans.

Availability Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy
New Orleans are individually obligated to make payments or subordinated
advances to System Energy in accordance with stated percentages (Entergy
Arkansas-17.1 , Entergy Louisiana-26.9 , Entergy Mississippi-31.3 , and
Entergy New Orleans-24.7 in amounts that, when added to amounts received
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement or otherwise, are adequate to cover
all of System Energy's operating expenses as defined, including an amount
sufficient to amortize the cost of Grand Gulf 2 over 27 years. (See
Reallocation Agreement terms below.) System Energy has assigned its rights
to payments and advances to certain creditors as security for certain
obligations. Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf 1, payments under
the Unit Power Sales Agreement have exceeded the amounts payable under the
Availability Agreement. Accordingly, no payments under the Availability
Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy
Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and
System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands
by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the
Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference
between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their
required Availability Agreement payments.

Reallocation Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

 System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans entered into the Reallocation
Agreement relating to the sale of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf and
the related costs, in which Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans agreed to assume all of Entergy Arkansas'
responsibilities and obligations with respect to Grand Gulf under the
Availability Agreement. FERC's decision allocating a portion of Grand Gulf
1 capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas supersedes the Reallocation
Agreement as it relates to Grand Gulf 1. Responsibility for any Grand Gulf
2 amortization amounts has been individually allocated (Entergy Louisiana-
26.23 , Entergy Mississippi-43.97 , and Entergy New Orleans-29.80 under
the terms of the Reallocation Agreement. However, the Reallocation
Agreement does not affect Entergy Arkansas' obligation to System Energy's
lenders under the assignments referred to in the preceding paragraph.
Entergy Arkansas would be liable for its share of such amounts if Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans were unable to meet
their contractual obligations. No payments of any amortization amounts
will be required so long as amounts paid to System Energy under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement, including other funds available to System Energy,
exceed amounts required under the Availability Agreement, which is expected
to be the case for the foreseeable future.

Reimbursement Agreement (System Energy)

 In December 1988, System Energy entered into two separate, but
identical, arrangements for the sale and leaseback of an approximate
aggregate 11.5 ownership interest in Grand Gulf 1. In connection with the
equity funding of the sale and leaseback arrangements, letters of credit
are required to be maintained to secure certain amounts payable for the
benefit of the equity investors by System Energy under the leases. The
current letters of credit are effective until March 20, 2003.

 Under the provisions of a bank letter of credit reimbursement
agreement, System Energy has agreed to a number of covenants relating to
the maintenance of certain capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios.
System Energy agreed, during the term of the reimbursement agreement, to
maintain its equity at not less than 33 of its adjusted capitalization
(defined in the reimbursement agreement to include certain amounts not
included in capitalization for financial statement purposes). In addition,
System Energy must maintain, with respect to each fiscal quarter during the
term of the reimbursement agreement, a ratio of adjusted net income to
interest expense (calculated, in each case, as specified in the
reimbursement agreement) of at least 1.60 times earnings. As of December
31, 2000, System Energy's equity approximated 42.76 of its adjusted
capitalization, and its fixed charge coverage ratio for 2000 was 2.47.

Litigation (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans)

 In addition to those discussed above, Entergy and the domestic utility
companies are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims in the
ordinary course of their business. While management is unable to predict
the outcome of such litigation, it is not expected that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on results
of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of these entities.

NOTE 10. LEASES

General

 As of December 31, 2000, Entergy had capital leases and non-cancelable
operating leases for equipment, buildings, vehicles, and fuel storage
facilities (excluding nuclear fuel leases and the sale and leaseback
transactions) with minimum lease payments as follows:

 Rental expense for Entergy's leases (excluding nuclear fuel leases and
the Grand Gulf 1 and Waterford 3 sale and leaseback transactions) amounted
to approximately 53.3 million, 65.2 million, and 69.4 million, in 2000,
1999, and 1998, respectively. These amounts include 18.9 million, 23.9
million, and 19.4 million, respectively, for Entergy Arkansas; 18.9
million, 19.2 million, and 18.1 million, respectively, for Entergy Gulf
States; and 7.9 million, 13.1 million, and 13.3 million, respectively,
for Entergy Louisiana. In addition to the above rental expense, Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States railcar operating lease payments, which
are recorded in fuel expense, amounted to approximately 13.7 million and
 2.7 million, respectively, for each of the years 2000, 1999, and 1998.
The railcar lease payments are recorded as fuel expense in accordance with
regulatory treatment.

Nuclear Fuel Leases (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, System Energy)

 As of December 31, 2000, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States,
Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each had arrangements to lease nuclear
fuel in an aggregate amount up to 135 million, 115 million, 90 million,
and 100 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2000, the unrecovered
cost base of Entergy Arkansas', Entergy Gulf States', Entergy Louisiana's,
and System Energy's nuclear fuel leases amounted to approximately
 107.0 million, 57.5 million, 63.9 million, and 49.3 million,
respectively. The lessors finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear
fuel through loans made under revolving credit agreements, the issuance of
commercial paper, and the issuance of intermediate-term notes. The credit
agreements for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana,
and System Energy have termination dates of November 2003, November 2003,
January 2002, and November 2003, respectively. Such termination dates may
be extended from time to time with the consent of the lenders. The
intermediate-term notes issued pursuant to these fuel lease arrangements
have varying maturities through March 15, 2002. It is expected that
additional financing under the leases will be arranged as needed to acquire
additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing debt. However, if
such additional financing cannot be arranged, the lessee in each case must
repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its
obligations.

 Lease payments are based on nuclear fuel use. The table below
represents the total nuclear fuel lease payments (principal and interest)
as well as the separate interest component charged to operations by the
domestic utility companies and System Energy in 2000, 1999, and 1998:

Sale and Leaseback Transactions

Waterford 3 Lease Obligations (Entergy Louisiana)

 In 1989, Entergy Louisiana sold and leased back 9.3 of its interest
in Waterford 3 for the aggregate sum of 353.6 million. The lease has an
approximate term of 28 years. The lessors financed the sale-leaseback
through the issuance of Waterford 3 Secured Lease Obligation Bonds. The
lease payments made by Entergy Louisiana are sufficient to service the
debt.

 In 1994, Entergy Louisiana did not exercise its option to repurchase
the 9.3 interest in Waterford 3. As a result, Entergy Louisiana issued
 208.2 million of non-interest bearing first mortgage bonds as collateral
for the equity portion of certain amounts payable under the lease.

 In 1997, the lessors refinanced the outstanding bonds used to finance
the purchase of Waterford 3 at lower interest rates, which reduced the
annual lease payments.

 Upon the occurrence of certain events, Entergy Louisiana may be
obligated to assume the outstanding bonds used to finance the purchase of
the unit and to pay an amount sufficient to withdraw from the lease
transaction. Such events include lease events of default, events of loss,
deemed loss events, or certain adverse "Financial Events." "Financial
Events" include, among other things, failure by Entergy Louisiana,
following the expiration of any applicable grace or cure period, to
maintain (i) total equity capital (including preferred stock) at least
equal to 30 of adjusted capitalization, or (ii) a fixed charge coverage
ratio of at least 1.50 computed on a rolling 12 month basis.

 As of December 31, 2000, Entergy Louisiana's total equity capital
(including preferred stock) was 48.7 of adjusted capitalization and its
fixed charge coverage ratio for 2000 was 3.32.

 As of December 31, 2000, Entergy Louisiana had future minimum lease
payments (reflecting an overall implicit rate of 7.45 in connection with
the Waterford 3 sale and leaseback transactions, which are recorded as long-
term debt, as follows (in thousands):

Grand Gulf 1 Lease Obligations (System Energy)

 In December 1988, System Energy sold 11.5 of its undivided ownership
interest in Grand Gulf 1 for the aggregate sum of 500 million.
Subsequently, System Energy leased back its interest in the unit for a term
of 26-1/2 years. System Energy has the option of terminating the lease and
repurchasing the 11.5 interest in the unit at certain intervals during the
lease. Furthermore, at the end of the lease term, System Energy has the
option of renewing the lease or repurchasing the 11.5 interest in Grand
Gulf 1.

 System Energy is required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing
transaction in its financial statements. For financial reporting purposes,
System Energy expenses the interest portion of the lease obligation and the
plant depreciation. However, operating revenues include the recovery of
the lease payments because the transactions are accounted for as a sale and
leaseback for ratemaking purposes. Until 2004, the total of interest and
depreciation expense exceeds the corresponding revenues realized.
Consistent with a recommendation contained in a FERC audit report, System
Energy recorded as a net deferred asset the difference between the recovery
of the lease payments and the amounts expensed for interest and
depreciation and is recording this difference as a deferred asset on an
ongoing basis. The amount of this deferred asset was 100.8 million and
 104.5 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 As of December 31, 2000, System Energy had future minimum lease
payments (reflecting an implicit rate of 7.02 ), which are recorded as long-
term debt as follows (in thousands):

Other Postretirement Benefits

 Entergy also provides health care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees. Substantially all domestic employees may become
eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while still
working for Entergy.

 Effective January 1, 1993, Entergy adopted SFAS 106, which
required a change from a cash method to an accrual method of accounting
for postretirement benefits other than pensions. At January 1, 1993,
the actuarially determined accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) earned by retirees and active employees was estimated
to be approximately 241.4 million and 128 million for Entergy (other
than Entergy Gulf States) and for Entergy Gulf States, respectively.
Such obligations are being amortized over a 20-year period which began
in 1993.

 Entergy Arkansas, the portion of Entergy Gulf States regulated by
the PUCT, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans have received
regulatory approval to recover SFAS 106 costs through rates. Entergy
Arkansas began recovery in 1998, pursuant to an APSC order. This order
also allowed Entergy Arkansas to amortize a regulatory asset
(representing the difference between SFAS 106 costs and cash
expenditures for other postretirement benefits incurred for a five-year
period that began January 1, 1993) over a period of 15 years beginning
in January 1998.

 The LPSC ordered the portion of Entergy Gulf States regulated by
the LPSC and Entergy Louisiana to continue the use of the pay-as-you-go
method for ratemaking purposes for postretirement benefits other than
pensions. However, the LPSC retains the flexibility to examine
individual companies' accounting for postretirement benefits to
determine if special exceptions to this order are warranted.

 Pursuant to regulatory directives, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, the portion of Entergy Gulf States
regulated by the PUCT, and System Energy fund postretirement benefit
obligations collected in rates. System Energy is funding on behalf of
Entergy Operations postretirement benefits associated with Grand Gulf
1. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States continue to recover a
portion of these benefits regulated by the LPSC and FERC on a pay-as-
you-go basis. The assets of the various postretirement benefit plans
other than pensions include common stocks, fixed-income securities, and
a money market fund.

NOTE 12. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS (Entergy Corporation)

Asset Acquisitions

Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick

 On November 21, 2000, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear
business acquired from NYPA the 825 MW James A. FitzPatrick nuclear
power plant near Oswego, New York, and the 980 MW Indian Point 3
nuclear power plant located in Westchester County, New York, in
exchange for 50 million at closing and notes to NYPA with payments
totaling 906 million. Entergy will also be required to make certain
additional payments to NYPA in the event that the plants' license lives
are extended, or in the event that the acquisition of Indian Point 2 is
ultimately consummated.

 The acquisition encompassed the nuclear plants, materials and
supplies, and nuclear fuel, as well as the assumption of 123.7 million
in liabilities. The purchase agreement provides that NYPA will retain
the decommissioning obligations and related trust funds through the
original license expiration date (approximately 2015). At that time,
NYPA is required either to transfer the decommissioning liability to
Entergy along with a specified amount in the decommissioning trust
funds, or to retain Entergy to perform decommissioning services for a
specified price that may be limited by the amount in the trust. The
purchase agreement also provides that NYPA will purchase a substantial
majority of the output of the units at specified prices through 2004.

 The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method. The
results of operations of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick subsequent to
November 21, 2000 have been included in Entergy's consolidated
statements of income. The purchase price has been allocated to the
acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the
purchase date. Intangible assets are being amortized straight-line
over the remaining lives of the plants.

Pilgrim Nuclear Station

 On July 13, 1999, Entergy's domestic non-utility nuclear business
acquired the 670 MW Pilgrim Nuclear Station located in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, from Boston Edison. The acquisition included the plant,
real estate, materials and supplies, and nuclear fuel, for a total
purchase price of 81 million. The purchase price was funded with a
portion of the proceeds from the sales of non-regulated businesses. As
part of the Pilgrim purchase, Boston Edison funded a 471 million
decommissioning trust fund, which was transferred to an Entergy
subsidiary. Based on a favorable tax determination regarding the trust
fund, Entergy returned 43 million of the trust fund to Boston Edison.

Business Dispositions

 As part of the new strategic plan adopted by Entergy in August
1998, Entergy sold several businesses during 1998, including the
following:

 Business Pre-tax Gain (Loss) on Sale
 (In Millions)

 London Electricity 327
 CitiPower (a) 38
 Efficient Solutions, Inc. (69)

(a) The gain on the CitiPower sale reflects a 7.6 million favorable
 adjustment to the final sale price in January 1999.

 In keeping with this plan, in January 1999, Entergy disposed of
its security monitoring subsidiary, Entergy Security, Inc. at a minimal
gain. Several telecommunication businesses were sold in June 1999,
also at small gains.

 The results of operations of these businesses are included in
Entergy's consolidated statements of income through their respective
dates of sale. Gains and losses arising from sales of businesses are
included in "Other Income, Gain (loss) on sale of assets - net" in that
statement.

NOTE 13. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
and System Energy)

 The domestic utility companies purchase electricity from and/or
sell electricity to the other domestic utility companies, System
Energy, and Entergy Power (in the case of Entergy Arkansas) under rate
schedules filed with FERC. In addition, the domestic utility companies
and System Energy purchase fuel from System Fuels; receive management,
technical, advisory, operating, and administrative services from
Entergy Services; and receive management, technical, and operating
services from Entergy Operations. Pursuant to SEC rules under PUHCA,
these transactions are on an "at cost" basis.

 As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, all of System
Energy's operating revenues consist of billings to Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

NOTE 14. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION (Entergy Corporation and
Entergy New Orleans)

 Entergy's reportable segments as of December 31, 2000 are domestic
utility and power marketing and trading. Entergy's operating segments
below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure principally
include global power development and the domestic non-utility nuclear
businesses. They are reported in the "All Other" column along with the
parent, Entergy Corporation, and other business activities, which are
principally the gains or losses on the sales of businesses. Entergy's
international electric distribution businesses, Entergy London and
CitiPower, were sold in December 1998. These businesses would have
been a reportable segment had they been held as of December 31, 1998,
and financial information regarding them is also provided below for
1998.

 Domestic utility provides retail electric service in portions of
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and provides natural gas
utility service in portions of Louisiana. Entergy's power marketing
and trading segment markets wholesale electricity, gas, other
generating fuels, and electric capacity, and markets financial
instruments to third parties. Entergy's operating segments are
strategic business units managed separately due to their different
operating and regulatory environments.

NOTE 15. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Entergy Corporation)

Commodity Derivatives

 Entergy uses a variety of commodity derivatives, including natural
gas and electricity futures, forwards, and options, as a part of its
overall risk management strategy.

 The power marketing and trading business engages in the trading of
commodity instruments and, therefore, experiences net open positions.
The business manages open positions with policies that limit its
exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of
potential financial exposure. These policies include statistical risk
tolerance limits using historical price movements to calculate a value
at risk measurement. The weighted-average life of the business'
commodity risk portfolio was less than 18 months at December 31, 2000
and less than 12 months at December 31, 1999.

 At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the power marketing and trading
business had outstanding absolute notional contract quantities as
follows (power volumes in thousands of megawatt hours, natural gas
volumes in thousands of British thermal units):

 2000 1999
 Energy Commodities:
 Power 116,513 23,015
 Natural gas 657,463 1,075,660

 Market risk is the potential loss that Entergy may incur as a
result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument
or commodity. All financial and commodity-related instruments,
including derivatives, are subject to market risk. Entergy's exposure
to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size,
duration, composition, and diversification of positions held, as well as
market volatility and liquidity. For instruments such as options, the
time period during which the option may be exercised and the
relationship between the current market price of the underlying
instrument and the option's contractual strike or exercise price also
affect the level of market risk. The most significant factor
influencing the overall level of market risk to which Entergy is exposed
is its use of hedging techniques to mitigate such risk. Entergy manages
market risk by actively monitoring compliance with stated risk
management policies as well as monitoring the effectiveness of its
hedging policies and strategies. Entergy's risk management policies
limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net exposure during
the stated periods. These policies, including related risk limits, are
regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given Entergy's
objectives.

 The New York Mercantile Exchange (Exchange) guarantees futures and
option contracts traded on the Exchange, which assures nominal credit
risk. On all other transactions described above, Entergy is exposed to
credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. For
each counterparty, Entergy analyzes the financial condition prior to
entering into an agreement, establishes credit limits, and monitors the
appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis. In some
circumstances, Entergy requires letters of credit or parental
guarantees. Entergy also uses netting arrangements whenever possible to
mitigate Entergy's exposure to counterparty risk. Netting arrangements
enable Entergy to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty.

 The change in market value of Exchange-traded futures and options
contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with
brokers. Swap contracts and most other over-the-counter instruments are
generally settled at the expiration of the contract term and may be
subject to margin requirements with the counterparty.

 Entergy's principal markets for power and natural gas marketing
services are utilities and industrial end-users located throughout the
United States and the UK. The power marketing and trading business has
a concentration of receivables due from those customers. These industry
concentrations may affect the power marketing and trading business'
overall credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that changes in
economic, industry, regulatory, or other conditions may similarly affect
certain customers. Trade receivables are generally not collateralized.
However, Entergy analyzes customers' credit positions prior to extending
credit, establishes credit limits, and monitors the appropriateness of
these limits on an ongoing basis.

Fair Values

Commodity Instruments

 Fair value estimates of the power marketing and trading business'
commodity instruments are made at discrete points in time based on
relevant market information. These estimates may be subjective in
nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment;
therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates. At December
31, 2000 and 1999, the fair values of the power marketing and trading
business' energy-related commodity contracts used for trading purposes
were as follows:

 2000 1999
 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities
 (In Thousands)
 Commodity Instruments:
 Natural Gas 362,221 343,726 44,675 39,361
 Electricity 260,969 219,721 190,850 130,209

Financial Instruments

 The estimated fair value of Entergy's financial instruments is
determined using bid prices reported by dealer markets and by
nationally recognized investment banking firms. The estimated fair
value of derivative financial instruments is based on market quotes of
the applicable interest rates. Considerable judgment is required in
developing the estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a
current market exchange. In addition, gains or losses realized on
financial instruments held by regulated businesses may be reflected in
future rates and therefore do not accrue to the benefit or detriment of
stockholders.

 Entergy considers the carrying amounts of financial instruments
classified as current assets and liabilities to be a reasonable
estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. In addition, Entergy does not expect that performance of
its obligations will be required in connection with certain off-balance
sheet commitments and guarantees considered financial instruments. For
these reasons, and because of the related-party nature of these
commitments and guarantees, determination of fair value is not
considered practicable. Additional information regarding financial
instruments and their fair values is included in Notes 4, 5, 6, and 7
to the financial statements.

NOTE 16. ENTERGY-FPL GROUP MERGER (Entergy Corporation)

 On July 30, 2000, Entergy Corporation and FPL Group entered into a
Merger Agreement providing for a business combination that will result
in the creation of a new company. For accounting purposes, the Merger
will be recorded under the purchase method of accounting as an
acquisition of Entergy by FPL Group. Each outstanding share of FPL
Group common stock will be converted into the right to receive one
share of the new company's common stock, and each outstanding share of
Entergy Corporation common stock will be converted into the right to
receive 0.585 of a share of the new company's common stock. It is
expected that FPL Group's shareholders will own approximately 57 of
the common equity of the new company and Entergy's shareholders will
own approximately 43 . The Merger Agreement generally allows Entergy
to continue business in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice and contains certain restrictions on Entergy's capital
activities, including restrictions on the issuance of securities,
capital expenditures, dispositions, incurrence or guarantee of
indebtedness, and trading or marketing of energy. Entergy generally
will be permitted to take actions pursuant to restructuring legislation
in the domestic utility companies' jurisdictions of operation and to
reorganize its transmission business. Under certain circumstances, if
the Merger Agreement is terminated, a termination fee of 215 million
may be payable by one of the parties. The Merger Agreement may be
terminated if the Merger is not consummated by April 30, 2002, unless
automatically extended until October 30, 2002 under certain
circumstances. Both the FPL Group and Entergy Boards of Directors
unanimously approved the Merger, and the shareholders of Entergy
Corporation and FPL Group have approved the Merger. The Merger is
conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of required
regulatory approvals of various local, state, and federal regulatory
agencies and commissions, including the SEC and FERC. Entergy has
filed for approval of the Merger in all of its state and local
regulatory jurisdictions (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and
New Orleans), and at FERC, the SEC, and the NRC. In their filing with
the SEC, Entergy and FPL Group requested to remain in existence as
intermediate holding companies after the Merger is consummated.
The objective of Entergy and FPL Group is to consummate the Merger by
late 2001.

(a) Amounts include the value of restricted shares that vested in
 2000 (see note (c) below) under Entergy's Equity Ownership Plan.

(b) Includes the following:

 (1) 2000 benefit accruals under the Defined Contribution Restoration
 Plan as follows: Ms. Conley 3,459; Mr. Domino 2,044; Mr. Gallaher
 8,810; Mr. Hintz 13,618; Mr. Jackson 10,269; Mr. McDonald 1,183;
 Mr. Packer 1,558; Mr. Wilder 9,393; Mr. Wright 2,340; and Mr.
 Yelverton 7,816.

 (2) 2000 employer contributions to the System Savings Plan as
 follows: Ms. Conley 5,100; Mr. Domino 5,040; Mr. Gallaher 5,100;
 Mr. Hintz 4,882; Mr. Jackson 4,893; Mr. McDonald 5,100; Mr. Packer
 5,100; Ms. Shanks 4,858; Mr. Wilder 4,526; Mr. Wright 5,100; and
 Mr. Yelverton 4,916.

 (3) 2000 reimbursements for moving expenses as follows: Mr. Hintz
 8,016; Mr. McDonald 48,595; and Mr. Wright 25,481.

(c) Restricted unit awards (equivalent to shares of Entergy
 Corporation common stock) in 2000 are reported under the "Long-Term
 Incentive Plan Awards" table, and reference is made to this table for
 information on the aggregate number of restricted units awarded during
 2000 and the vesting schedule for such units. At December 31, 2000,
 the number and value of the aggregate restricted unit holdings were as
 follows: Ms. Conley 8,700 units, 368,119; Mr. Domino 3,100 units,
 131,169; Mr. Gallaher 11,800 units, 499,288; Mr. Hintz 28,500 units,
 1,205,906; Mr. Jackson 12,700 units, 537,369; Mr. Leonard 58,000
 units, 2,454,125; Mr. McDonald 3,700 units, 156,556; Mr. Packer
 3,100 units, 131,169; Ms. Shanks 3,100 units, 131,169; Mr. Wilder
 21,367 units, 904,091; Mr. Wright 7,500 units, 317,344; and Mr.
 Yelverton 22,700 units, 960,494. Accumulated dividends are paid on
 restricted units when vested. The value of restricted unit holdings
 as of December 31, 2000 is determined by multiplying the total number
 of units held by the closing market price of Entergy Corporation
 common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on
 December 31, 2000 42.3125 per share). The value of stock for which
 restrictions were lifted in 2000, and the applicable portion of
 accumulated cash dividends, are reported in the LTIP payouts column in
 the above table.

(d) Restricted units were granted to the following individuals in
 addition to those granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan. Ms.
 Conley was granted 3,000 units in 1999. The units will vest
 incrementally over a three-year period that began in 2000, based on
 continued service with Entergy Corporation. Accumulated dividends
 will be paid. Mr. Leonard and Mr. Wilder were granted 30,000 and
 26,000 restricted units, respectively, in 1998. Restricted units
 awarded vest incrementally over a three-year period that began in
 1999, based on continued service with Entergy Corporation.
 Restrictions are lifted annually. Accumulated dividends will not be
 paid on Mr. Leonard's units and 21,000 units of Mr. Wilder's
 restricted units when vested. Accumulated dividends will be paid on
 5,000 units of Mr. Wilder's restricted units. Mr. Yelverton was
 granted 10,000 units in 2000. Restrictions will be lifted on 3,000
 units in 2001 and 2002, and the remaining 4,000 units in 2003.
 Accumulated dividends will not be paid. The value these individuals
 may realize is dependent upon both the number of units that vest and
 the future market price of Entergy Corporation common stock.

(e) Mr. Jackson is the former Chief Executive Officer of Entergy Gulf
 States, LA and Entergy Louisiana. Mr. Wright is the former Chief
 Executive Officer of Entergy Arkansas.

(f) Includes living expenses, including taxes and housing, for Mr.
 Packer of approximately 24,000 in 1998. Includes closing costs for a
 home purchase for Mr. Wright of approximately 34,000 in 2000 and
 approximately 30,000 in 1999 and 465,000 in 1998 related to various
 overseas living expenses associated with Mr. Wright's assignments in
 London and Australia.

(g) Includes approximately 596,000 of performance bonus for service
 years 1996-1998. A portion of the bonus was paid during 1999 with the
 remaining amount paid in 2000.

(a) Restricted units awarded will vest at the end of a three-year
 period, subject to the attainment of approved performance goals for
 Entergy. Restrictions are lifted based upon the achievement of the
 cumulative result of these goals for the performance period. The
 value any Named Executive Officer may realize is dependent upon both
 the number of units that vest and the future market price of Entergy
 Corporation common stock.

(b) The threshold, target, and maximum levels correspond to the
 achievement of 50 , 100 , and 150 , respectively, of Equity Ownership
 Plan goals. Achievement of a threshold, target, or maximum level
 would result in the award of the number of units indicated in the
 respective column. Achievement of a level between these three
 specified levels would result in the award of a number of units
 calculated by means of interpolation.

 All of the Named Executive Officers participate in a Retirement
Income Plan, a defined benefit plan, that provides a benefit for
employees at retirement from Entergy based upon (1) generally all
years of service beginning at age 21 through termination, with a
forty-year maximum, multiplied by (2) 1.5 , multiplied by (3) the
final average compensation. Final average compensation is based on
the highest consecutive 60 months of covered compensation in the last
120 months of service. The normal form of benefit for a single
employee is a lifetime annuity and for a married employee is a 50 
joint and survivor annuity. Other actuarially equivalent options are
available to each retiree. Retirement benefits are not subject to any
deduction for Social Security or other offset amounts. The amount of
the Named Executive Officers' annual compensation covered by the plan
as of December 31, 2000, is represented by the salary column in the
Summary Compensation Table above.

 The credited years of service under the Retirement Income Plan,
as of December 31, 2000, for the following Named Executive Officers is
as follows: Ms. Conley 1; Mr. Domino 30; Mr. Gallaher 31; Mr. Jackson
21; Mr. Leonard 2; Mr. McDonald 18; Mr. Packer 18; Ms. Shanks 17; Mr.
Wright 31; and Mr. Yelverton 21. The credited years of service under
the Retirement Income Plan, as of December 31, 2000 for the following
Named Executive Officers, as a result of entering into supplemental
retirement agreements, is as follows: Mr. Hintz 29 and Mr. Wilder 17.

 The maximum benefit under the Retirement Income Plan is limited
by Sections 401 and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended; however, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy
have elected to participate in the Pension Equalization Plan sponsored
by Entergy Corporation. Under this plan, certain executives,
including the Named Executive Officers, would receive an additional
amount equal to the benefit that would have been payable under the
Retirement Income Plan, except for the Sections 401 and 415
limitations discussed above.

 In addition to the Retirement Income Plan discussed above,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, and System Energy participate in the Supplemental Retirement
Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and the Post-Retirement
Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Participation is limited
to one of these two plans and is at the invitation of Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
and System Energy. The participant may receive from the appropriate
Entergy company a monthly benefit payment not in excess of .025 (under
the Supplemental Retirement Plan) or .0333 (under the Post-Retirement
Plan) times the participant's average basic annual salary (as defined
in the plans) for a maximum of 120 months. Mr. Hintz, Mr. Packer and
Mr. Yelverton have entered into a Supplemental Retirement Plan
participation contract, and Mr. Gallaher, Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Wright
have entered into Post-Retirement Plan participation contracts.
Current estimates indicate that the annual payments to each Named
Executive Officer under the above plans would be less than the
payments to that officer under the System Executive Retirement Plan
discussed below.

(1) Covered pay includes the average of the highest three years of
 annual base pay and incentive awards earned by the executive
 during the ten years immediately preceding his retirement.
 Benefits shown are based on a target replacement ratio of 50 
 based on the years of service and covered compensation shown. The
 benefits for 10, 15, and 20 or more years of service at the 45 
 and 55 replacement levels would decrease (in the case of 45 or
 increase (in the case of 55 by the following percentages: 3.0 ,
 4.5 , and 5.0 , respectively.

 In 1993, Entergy Corporation adopted the System Executive
Retirement Plan (SERP). This plan was amended in 1998. Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy are participating employers in
the SERP. The SERP is an unfunded defined benefit plan offered at
retirement to certain senior executives, which would currently include
all the Named Executive Officers. Participating executives choose, at
retirement, between the retirement benefits paid under provisions of
the SERP or those payable under the Supplemental Retirement Plan or
the Post-Retirement Plan discussed above. The plan was amended in
1998 to provide that covered pay is the average of the highest three
years annual base pay and incentive awards earned by the executive
during the ten years immediately preceding his retirement. Benefits
paid under the SERP are calculated by multiplying the covered pay
times target pay replacement ratios (45 , 50 , or 55 , dependent on
job rating at retirement) that are attained, according to plan design,
at 20 years of credited service. The target ratios are increased by
1 for each year of service over 20 years, up to a maximum of 30 years
of service. In accordance with the SERP formula, the target ratios
are reduced for each year of service below 20 years. The credited
years of service under this plan are identical to the years of service
for Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Jackson, Mr. Thompson,
and Mr. Yelverton) disclosed above in the section entitled "Pension
Plan Tables-Retirement Income Plan Table". Mr. Jackson, Mr. Thompson,
and Mr. Yelverton have 27 years, 19 years, and 31 years, respectively,
of credited service under this plan.

 The amended plan provides that a single employee receives a
lifetime annuity and a married employee receives the reduced benefit
with a 50 surviving spouse annuity. Other actuarially equivalent
options are available to each retiree. SERP benefits are offset by
any and all defined benefit plan payments from Entergy. SERP benefits
are not subject to Social Security offsets.

 Eligibility for and receipt of benefits under any of the
executive plans described above are contingent upon several factors.
The participant must agree, without the specific consent of the
Entergy company for which such participant was last employed, not to
take employment after retirement with any entity that is in
competition with, or similar in nature to, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, and System Energy or any affiliate thereof. Eligibility for
benefits is forfeitable for various reasons, including violation of an
agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System
Energy, certain resignations of employment, or certain terminations of
employment without Company permission.

 In addition to the Retirement Income Plan discussed above,
Entergy Gulf States provides, among other benefits to officers, an
Executive Income Security Plan for key managerial personnel. The plan
provides participants with certain retirement, disability,
termination, and survivors' benefits. To the extent that such
benefits are not funded by the employee benefit plans of Entergy Gulf
States or by vested benefits payable by the participants' former
employers, Entergy Gulf States is obligated to make supplemental
payments to participants or their survivors. The plan provides that
upon the death or disability of a participant during his employment,
he or his designated survivors will receive (i) during the first year
following his death or disability an amount not to exceed his annual
base salary, and (ii) thereafter for a number of years until the
participant attains or would have attained age 65, but not less than
nine years, an amount equal to one-half of the participant's annual
base salary. The plan also provides supplemental retirement benefits
for life for participants retiring after reaching age 65 equal to one-
half of the participant's average final compensation rate, with one-
half of such benefit upon the death of the participant being payable
to a surviving spouse for life.

 Entergy Gulf States amended and restated the plan effective March
1, 1991, to provide such benefits for life upon termination of
employment of a participating officer or key managerial employee
without cause (as defined in the plan) or if the participant separates
from employment for good reason (as defined in the plan), with 1/2 of
such benefits to be payable to a surviving spouse for life. Further,
the plan was amended to provide medical benefits for a participant and
his family when the participant separates from service. These medical
benefits generally continue until the participant is eligible to
receive medical benefits from a subsequent employer; but in the case
of a participant who is over 50 at the time of separation and was
participating in the plan on March 1, 1991, medical benefits continue
for life. By virtue of the 1991 amendment and restatement, benefits
for a participant under such plan cannot be modified once he becomes
eligible to participate in the plan. Mr. Domino is a participant in
this plan.

 Upon completion of the merger with FPL Group, benefits already
accrued under Entergy's System Executive Retirement Plan, Post-
Retirement Plan, Supplemental Retirement Plan and Pension Equalization
Plan will be funded in an irrevocable trust, the assets of which may
be used only to pay benefits under such plans and become fully vested
if the participant is involuntarily terminated without "cause" or
terminates employment for "good reason" (as such terms are,
respectively, defined in such plans), and (b) all amounts credited to
participants' accounts under Entergy's Deferred Compensation Plan will
be funded in an irrevocable trust, the assets of which may be used
only to pay amounts under such agreements (unless Entergy becomes
insolvent, in which case the assets in the trust will be available
to satisfy the claims of creditors) (a "rabbi trust").

 Compensation of Directors

 For information regarding compensation of the directors of
Entergy Corporation, see the Proxy Statement under the heading
"Director Compensation", which information is incorporated herein by
reference. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy currently
have no non-employee directors, and none of the current directors of
these companies are compensated for their responsibilities as
director.

 Retired non-employee directors of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans with a minimum
of five years of service on the respective Boards of Directors are
paid 200 a month for a term of years corresponding to the number of
years of active service as directors. Retired non-employee directors
with over ten years of service receive a lifetime benefit of 200 a
month. Years of service as an advisory director are included in
calculating this benefit. System Energy has no retired non-employee
directors.

 Retired non-employee directors of Entergy Gulf States receive
retirement benefits under a plan in which all directors who served
continuously for a period of years will receive a percentage of their
retainer fee in effect at the time of their retirement for life. The
retirement benefit is 30 percent of the retainer fee for service of
not less than five nor more than nine years, 40 percent for service of
not less than ten nor more than fourteen years, and 50 percent for
fifteen or more years of service. For those directors who retired
prior to the retirement age, their benefits are reduced. The plan
also provides disability retirement and optional hospital and medical
coverage if the director has served at least five years prior to the
disability. The retired director pays one-third of the premium for
such optional hospital and medical coverage and Entergy Gulf States
pays the remaining two-thirds. Years of service as an advisory
director are included in calculating this benefit.

 Executive Retention and Employment Agreements and Change-in-Control
 Arrangements

Entergy Gulf States

 As a result of the Merger, Entergy Gulf States is obligated to
pay benefits under the Executive Income Security Plan to those persons
who were participants at the time of the Merger and who later
terminated their employment under circumstances described in the plan.
For additional description of the benefits under the Executive Income
Security Plan, see the "Pension Plan Tables-System Executive
Retirement Plan Table" section noted above.

agreement with Mr. Leonard.

Retention Agreement with Mr. Leonard - Entergy has entered into a

are defined in the agreement, other than a termination of employment
described in the next paragraph, or (b) by reason of Mr. Leonard's
death or disability:

 o Entergy will pay to him a lump sum cash severance payment

Board that for reasons other than "cause" and in the best interests
of Entergy's shareholders in connection with the completion of the
merger with FPL Group, it is necessary that Mr. Leonard no longer
serve as Chief Executive Officer of Entergy:

 o Entergy will pay to him a lump sum severance payment equal to
 five times the sum of his base salary and maximum annual incentive
 award;

 o Entergy will pay to him a pro rata annual incentive award,
 based on an assumed maximum achievement of applicable performance

at any time, or by Mr. Leonard without "good reason" and without
Entergy's permission prior to his attainment of age 55, Mr. Leonard
will forfeit his supplemental retirement benefit. If Mr. Leonard's
employment is terminated by Mr. Leonard without "good reason" with
the Entergy's permission prior to his attainment of age 55, Mr.
Leonard will be entitled to a supplemental retirement benefit,
reduced by 6.5 for each year that the termination date precedes his
attainment of age 55, payable commencing upon Mr. Leonard's attainment
of age 62. If Mr. Leonard's employment is terminated by Mr. Leonard
without "good reason" following his attainment of age 55, Mr. Leonard
will be entitled to his full supplemental retirement benefit. The
amounts payable under the agreement will be funded in a rabbi trust.

 Additionally, the Board of Directors has approved a grant to Mr.
Leonard of 200,000 restricted stock units pursuant to Entergy's
Equity Ownership Plan. 50,000 of the restricted stock units (without
dividends) will vest on each of December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002,
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004. In addition, the restricted

Employment Agreement with Mr. Leonard - WCB Holding has entered into
an employment agreement with Mr. Leonard pursuant to which Mr.

following the consummation of the merger with FPL Group (until the
earlier of (a) a vacancy on WCB Holding's Board of Directors with
respect to a director designated by FPL Group which follows the first
anniversary of the consummation of the merger and (b) the third
annual shareholder meeting of WCB Holding which occurs following the
calendar year in which the merger is consummated), Mr. Leonard may be
removed or replaced from his positions with WCB Holding (and any
person other than Mr. Leonard may be elected to such positions) only
upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of WCB Holding's
entire Board of Directors. The agreement is for an initial three-year
term commencing upon consummation of the merger with FPL Group, with
opportunity for extension. The agreement also provides the following:

 o During the first year following the merger, Mr. Leonard's
 compensation will be determined by the compensation committee of the
 WCB Holding Board of Directors based on competitive practices for the
 chief executive officer of companies of comparable size and standing,
 but in no event will Mr. Leonard's base salary, annual incentive
 compensation, long-term incentives, fringe benefits, and eligibility
 to participate in all savings and retirement plans, practices,
 policies and programs be less favorable than that of Mr. Broadhead,
 currently Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FPL Group, and also
 designated to be the Chairman of the Board of WCB Holdings. Mr.
 Broadhead's annual base salary will be no less than 1,050,000, his
 annual incentive compensation target will be no less than 75 of base
 salary, and his long-term incentive compensation target will be no
 less than 185 of base salary.

 o Thereafter, Mr. Leonard's base salary and additional compensation
 will be reviewed by the compensation committee of WCB Holding for
 possible increase at least annually during the term of his employment.

 o Mr. Leonard will participate in supplemental executive plans,
 agreements and arrangements such that the aggregate value of
 retirement benefits available to Mr. Leonard and his beneficiaries at
 the end of his employment with WCB Holding will not be less than that
 to which he would have been entitled had he remained in Entergy's
 employment for the same period of time under his current arrangements
 with Entergy.

 If Mr. Leonard's employment is involuntarily terminated without
"cause" or if he terminates for "good reason", as such terms are
defined in his employment agreement, Mr. Leonard will be entitled to
receive, in lieu of benefits, a cash severance payment equal to three
times the sum of his Annual Base Salary and Highest Bonus, as such
terms are defined in the agreement, continued benefits for three
additional years, certain additional benefits and a "gross-up" payment
in respect of any excise taxes he might incur.

 with all compensation and benefits payable to Executive

 3.2 Termination of Employment by Executive Without Good

 reason, other than termination by Company for Cause,
 Executive shall be entitled to the Supplemental

 Supplemental Retirement Benefit. Executive shall be
 entitled only to Executive's Accrued Obligations and
 Normal Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits.

 (c) With Company Permission - Prior to Attainment of
 Age 55. If Executive should terminate his Employment
 with the System without Good Reason, but with Company
 permission, at any time prior to his attainment of age
 55, he shall be entitled to the Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit, but reduced at the annual rate of
 6.5 per year for each year Executive's Date of

 Obligations and Normal Post-Termination Compensation
 and Benefits.

 Benefits, Executive's Accrued Obligations, EAIP Bonus
 Award, Three-Times Severance Payment, Target LTIP Award and
 Other EOP Awards. In addition, Executive shall: (a)

 (B) of this Agreement, and (b) be entitled to elect a
 benefit commencement date without the consent of the
 Company, which shall be on the first day of any month
 following Executive's attainment of age 55.

3.5 Termination On Account of Death or Disability. If
 Executive's employment should terminate on account of death
 or Disability prior to the earlier of the Closing or
 termination of the Merger Agreement, Executive or his
 personal or legal representatives, executors,
 administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees
 and legatees (in the event of death) shall receive
 Executive's Accrued Obligations, Normal Post-Termination
 Compensation and Benefits, EAIP Bonus Award, Three-Times
 Severance Payment, Target LTIP Award and Other EOP Awards.

 In addition, in the event of Executive's death at any time
 prior to termination of his System employment, or after
 Executive's retirement but before his Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit income commencement date, his surviving
 spouse, if any, shall be entitled to a Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit death benefit payable monthly for her
 lifetime, and commencing as of the first day of the month
 next following the later of: (a) the date on which
 Executive would have attained age 55 had he lived, or (b)
 the date of Executive's death. The amount of each such
 monthly benefit shall be in the same amount as the spouse
 would have received after Executive's subsequent death if
 he had not died on his actual date of death but instead
 had: (v) separated from System Company service on his date
 of death; (w) survived to age 55; (x) retired at age 55
 with the same Final Monthly Earnings as of his date of
 death; (y) elected the 50 joint and survivor annuity form
 of payment; and (z) then died immediately thereafter.

 If Executive becomes Disabled at any time prior to
 termination of his System employment, then for
 purposes of determining his eligibility for a
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit, Executive shall be
 treated as if he remained employed by the System for
 any year for which Executive receives monthly
 disability payments under the Company's sponsored
 long-term disability plan then in effect.

3.6 Merger Related Termination. If Executive's employment is
 terminated due to a Merger Related Termination prior to the
 earlier of the Closing or termination of the Merger
 Agreement, then Executive shall be entitled to Normal Post-
 Termination Compensation and Benefits, Executive's Accrued
 Obligations, EAIP Bonus Award, Five-Times Severance
 Payment, Maximum LTIP Award and Other EOP Awards. In
 addition, Executive shall: (a) immediately vest in the
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit (determined as if Executive
 had remained employed with the System until attainment of
 age 55), subject, however to the forfeiture and repayment
 provisions of Section 2.2(A) and (B) of this Agreement, and
 (b) be entitled to elect a benefit commencement date
 without the consent of the Company, which shall be on the
 first day of any month following Executive's attainment of
 age 55.

4. Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to
 any payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any
 of the payments or benefits received or to be received
 by Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this
 Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement
 with any System Company) (all such payments and
 benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being
 hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will
 be subject to the Excise Tax, Company shall pay to
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
 Payment") such that the net amount retained by
 Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the
 Total Payments and any federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up
 Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
 amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total
 Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments"
 (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code)
 unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
 reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the
 accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the
 Closing, Company's independent auditor (the
 "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in whole or in
 part) do not constitute parachute payments, including
 by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii)
 all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as
 subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of
 Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole
 or in part) represent reasonable compensation for
 services actually rendered (within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the
 Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation,
 or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and
 (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any
 deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
 Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections
 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of
 determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment.
 Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at
 the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation
 in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is
 to be made and state and local income taxes at the
 highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination,
 then the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is
 calculated for purposes of this Section 4), net of the
 maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
 be obtained from deduction of such state and local
 taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined
 to be less than the amount taken into account
 hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment,
 Executive shall repay to Company, within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of
 such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally
 determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of
 the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax
 and federal, state and local income and employment
 taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results
 in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-
 dollar reduction in Executive's taxable income and
 wages for purposes of federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of
 such repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the
 Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken
 into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up
 Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at
 the time of the Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make
 an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such
 excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions
 payable by Executive with respect to such excess)
 within five (5) business days following the time that
 the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 Executive and Company shall each reasonably cooperate
 with the other in connection with any administrative
 or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or
 amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to the
 Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust: Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries (`Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive
 experienced a Qualifying Termination event December 31, 2000.
 Company shall deposit such additional amounts as determined by
 the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to pay amounts
 due under the Agreement. Except as otherwise provided under
 the terms of this Agreement with respect to Executive's
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit, the payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made no later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Company shall pay to
 Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith
 by Executive or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Company fails to make such payments when due) at
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the
 Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in
 no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date of
 Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated
 payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have
 been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by Company to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand by
 Company (together with interest at 120 of the rate provided
 in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). At the time that
 payments are made under this Agreement, Company shall provide
 Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in
 which such payments were calculated and the basis for such
 calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or
 other advice Company has received from Tax Counsel, the
 Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such
 opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to
 the statement).

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal fees
 and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith
 any issue hereunder relating to the termination of Executive's
 employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any
 benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection
 with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
 the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be made
 within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's
 written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of
 fees and expenses incurred as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including, but not limited to the March 13, 1998 letter
 agreement between Executive and Company, as amended through
 the Amendment to Employment Agreement execution by Executive
 on March 27, 2000 (and by Entergy Corporation on April 26,
 2000), and any other offers or agreements preceding execution
 of this Agreement, but with the exception of the agreement
 dated July 30, 2000 between Executive and the Merged Entity,
 which agreement shall supersede and replace this Agreement on
 the date of Closing of the Ring-Ranger Merger Agreement, with
 the exception of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit in
 Section 16.30, which section shall remain in full force and
 effect, and with the exception of any compensation, equity or
 equity-based benefits that remain unfulfilled at Closing and
 are not assumed under the agreement dated July 30, 2000
 between Executive and the Merged Entity. Notwithstanding any
 other provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges that
 benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of
 participation in, and any payment that might otherwise have
 been payable under, the System Executive Continuity Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and any other System
 severance or retention plan, and Executive hereby waives any
 right to participate in such plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination
 from one party hereto to the other party hereto in
 accordance with this Section 8. For purposes of this
 Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
 which shall indicate the specific termination provision
 in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
 provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment
 under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of
 Termination for Cause pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
 Section 16.6 is required to include a copy of a
 resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not
 less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
 of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called
 and held for the purpose of considering such termination
 (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity
 for Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be
 heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith
 opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of conduct set
 forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause
 herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean
 (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for
 Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination
 is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned
 to the full-time performance of Executive's duties during
 such thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if Executive's
 employment is terminated for any other reason, the date
 specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the
 case of a termination by Company, shall not be less than
 thirty (30) days (except in the case of a termination for
 Cause) and, in the case of a termination by Executive,
 shall not be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than
 sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice
 of Termination is given).

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if
 later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
 without regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving
 such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that
 a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of
 Termination shall be extended until the date on which the
 dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written
 agreement of the parties or by a final judgment, order or
 decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent
 jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
 which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no
 appeal has been perfected); provided, however, that the
 Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
 dispute given by Executive only if such notice is given
 in good faith and Executive pursues the resolution of
 such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, Company shall
 continue to pay Executive the full compensation in effect
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given
 (including, but not limited to, salary) and continue
 Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit
 and insurance plans in which Executive was participating
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given,
 until the Date of Termination, as determined in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof. Amounts paid under
 this Section 8.4 are in addition to all other amounts due
 under this Agreement (other than Executive's Accrued
 Obligations) and shall not be offset against or reduce
 any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not required
 to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce
 any amounts payable to Executive by Company pursuant to
 Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the
 amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this
 Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by
 Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by
 retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to
 be owed by Executive to Company, or otherwise (except as
 otherwise provided in subsection 16.30 and subsection 2.2 (A)
 and (B)).

10. Successors: Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Company, Company will require any successor
 (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
 consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all
 of the business and/or assets of Company to expressly
 assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
 manner and to the same extent that Company would be
 required to perform it if no such succession had taken
 place. Failure of Company to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall
 entitle Executive to compensation from Company in the
 same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be
 entitled to hereunder if Executive were to experience a
 Qualifying Termination, except that, for purposes of
 implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such
 succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
 Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive
 shall die while any amount would still be payable to
 Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their
 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if
 Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
 otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
 with the terms of this Agreement to the executors,
 personal representatives or administrators of Executive's
 estate.

11. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and
 all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall
 be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
 delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the following address

12. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be
 modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification
 or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive
 and such officer as may be specifically designated by the
 Board. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
 breach by the other party hereto of, or of any lack of
 compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement
 to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
 similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or
 at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement supersedes any
 other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express
 or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof which
 have been made by either party. The laws of the State of
 Delaware shall govern the validity, interpretation,
 construction and performance of this Agreement. All references
 to sections of the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any
 successor provisions to such sections. Any payments provided
 for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding
 required under federal, state or local law and any additional
 withholding to which Executive has agreed.

13. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which
 shall remain in full force and effect.

14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
 counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
 but all of which together will constitute one and the same
 instrument.

15. Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration.

 15.1 All claims by Executive for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be directed to and determined by the Committee and
 shall be in writing. Any denial by the Committee of a claim
 for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered to
 Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific
 reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this
 Agreement relied upon. The Committee shall afford a
 reasonable opportunity to Executive for a review of the
 decision denying a claim and shall further allow Executive
 to appeal to the Committee a decision of the Committee
 within sixty (60) days after notification by the Committee
 that Executive's claim has been denied.

 15.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in
 connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively
 by arbitration in the metropolitan area in which Executive
 resides on the Date of Termination (or the date that the
 Merger Agreement is terminated, as applicable) in
 accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
 Association then in effect; provided, however, that the
 evidentiary standards set forth in subsections 16.6 and
 16.19 of this Agreement shall be applied by the
 arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
 award in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any
 provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Executive
 shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
 Executive's right to be paid until the Date of Termination
 during the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising
 under or in connection with this Agreement.

and

 WHEREAS, Executive wishes to remain in the employ of a

 Company.

 2.2 Executive's Covenants. Executive agrees to the following:

 which any System Company services customers during
 such period. In the event of any violation by
 Executive of this paragraph (A) of subsection 2.2,
 Executive shall repay to Company, within 5 business
 days of Company's written request therefor, any
 amounts previously paid to him pursuant to subsection
 3.3, and Executive shall have no further entitlement

 to any other person, which disparages any System
 Company, its management, directors or shareholders,
 or its practices, or which disrupts or impairs their
 normal operations, including actions or statements
 (i) that would harm the reputation of any System
 Company with its clients, suppliers, employees or the
 public; or (ii) that would interfere with existing or
 prospective contractual or employment relationships
 with any System Company or its clients, suppliers or
 employees. In the event of any violation by Executive
 of this paragraph (B) of this subsection 2.2,

 entitlement of Executive or his beneficiary(ies) to certain
 payments and benefits under specified circumstances described
 in each subsection, and, with the exception of subsection 3.1,
 in no event shall Executive and his beneficiary(ies) be
 entitled to payments and benefits under more than one such
 subsection.

 3.1 Physical or Mental Illness. During any period that
 Executive fails to perform Executive's full-time duties
 within the System as a result of incapacity due to
 physical or mental illness, his System employer shall pay
 Executive's full salary to Executive at the rate in effect
 at the commencement of any such period, together with all
 compensation and benefits payable to Executive under the
 terms of any compensation or benefit plan, program or
 arrangement (other than Company's short- or long-term
 disability plan, as applicable) maintained by Company
 during such period, until Executive's employment is
 terminated by his System employer for Disability.

 3.2 Termination of Employment by Company For Cause, or by
 Executive Without Good Reason, at Any Time. If Company
 should terminate Executive's employment with the System
 for Cause at any time or if Executive should
 terminate his System employment without Good Reason
 at any time, Executive shall be entitled only to
 Executive's Accrued Obligations and Normal Post-Termination
 Compensation and Benefits.

 3.3 Qualifying Termination. If Executive's employment is
 terminated due to a Qualifying Termination, then Executive
 shall be entitled to (a) either the Service Bridge or
 Normal Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits and (b)
 receive Executive's Accrued Obligations, Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit (in accordance with Executive's
 election), EAIP Bonus Award, Four-Times Severance Payment,
 Maximum LTIP Award and Other EOP Awards. However, as a
 condition of receipt of the Four-Times Severance Payment,
 the Chief Executive Officer of Company may require
 Executive to remain employed for a period of time not to
 extend beyond the Closing, such employment to be on
 substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect
 on the date of execution of this Agreement. In the event
 Executive is entitled to the Service Bridge, Normal Post-
 Termination Compensation and Benefits shall be due at the
 conclusion of the Service Bridge.

 3.4 Termination On Account of Death or Disability. If
 Executive's employment should terminate on account of
 death or Disability prior to the earlier of termination of
 the Merger Agreement or the second anniversary of Closing,
 Executive or his personal or legal representatives,
 executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
 distributees, devisees and legatees (in the event of
 death) shall receive Executive's Accrued Obligations, EAIP
 Bonus Award, Normal Post-Termination Compensation and
 Benefits, Four-Times Severance Payment, Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit (in accordance with the election of
 Executive or his beneficiary, if applicable), Maximum LTIP
 Award and Other EOP Awards. The benefits provided under
 this subsection shall be reduced by the benefits provided
 to Executive prior to his death or Disability under any
 other subsection of this Agreement, with the exception of
 subsection 3.1.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the
 payments or benefits received or to be received by
 Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
 or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with any
 System Company) (all such payments and benefits, excluding
 the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the
 "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax,
 Company shall pay to Executive an additional amount (the
 "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by
 Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total
 Payments and any federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment,
 shall be equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
 section 280G(b) (2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was,
 immediately prior to the Closing, Company's independent
 auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in
 whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments,
 including by reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the
 Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the
 meaning of section 280G(b) (1) of the Code shall be
 treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the
 opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in
 whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for
 services actually rendered (within the meaning of section
 280G(b) (4) (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount
 allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the
 value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or
 benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance
 with the principles of sections 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the
 Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-
 Up Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal
 income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income
 taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 4), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall repay to
 Company, within five (5) business days following the time
 that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by Executive,
 to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction
 in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in
 Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes, plus
 interest on the amount of such repayment at 120 of the
 rate provided in section 1274(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In
 the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the
 amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the
 Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the
 time of the Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make an
 additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess
 (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by
 Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of such
 excess is finally determined. Executive and Company shall
 each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection
 with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust: Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive experienced
 a Qualifying Termination event on December 31, 2000. Company
 shall deposit such additional amounts as determined by the
 Auditor from time to time to be necessary to pay amounts due
 under the Agreement. The payments provided in Sections 3 and 4
 hereof shall be made no later than the fifth business day
 following the Date of Termination; provided, however, that if
 the amounts of such payments cannot be finally determined on or
 before such day, Company shall pay to Executive on such day an
 estimate, as determined in good faith by Executive or, in the
 case of payments under Section 4 hereof, in accordance with
 Section 4 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments to
 which Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder
 of such payments (together with interest on the unpaid
 remainder (or on all such payments to the extent Company fails
 to make such payments when due) at 120 of the rate provided in
 section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
 thereof can be determined, but in no event later than the
 thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the event that
 the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount
 subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall
 constitute a loan by Company to Executive, payable on the fifth
 business day after demand by Company (together with interest at
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b) (2) (B) of the
 Code). At the time that payments are made under this Agreement,
 Company shall provide Executive with a written statement
 setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated
 and the basis for such calculations including, without
 limitation, any opinions or other advice Company has received
 from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants
 (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be
 attached to the statement).

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal fees
 and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith
 any issue hereunder relating to the termination of Executive s
 employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any
 benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection
 with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
 the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be made
 within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's
 written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of
 fees and expenses incurred as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including any term sheets, offers, or agreements preceding
 execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
 provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges that benefits
 provided under this Agreement are in lieu of participation in,
 and any payment that might otherwise have been payable under,
 the System Executive Continuity Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries and any other System severance or retention plan,
 and Executive hereby waives any right to participate in such
 plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death) shall
 be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one
 party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with
 this Section 8. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
 Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the
 specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon
 and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
 circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of
 Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
 Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause pursuant to
 clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 16.6 is required to include a
 copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
 not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
 of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called and
 held for the purpose of considering such termination (after
 reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for
 Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be heard
 before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of
 the Board, Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in
 clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause herein, and
 specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean (i)
 if Executive's employment is terminated for Disability,
 thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given
 (provided that Executive shall not have returned to the full-
 time performance of Executive's duties during such thirty
 (30) day period), and (ii) if Executive's employment is
 terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the
 Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination
 by Company, shall not be less than thirty (30) days (except
 in the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the case of
 a termination by Executive, shall not be less than fifteen
 (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from
 the date such Notice of Termination is given). Solely for
 purposes of determining Executive's "Date of Termination"
 for any reason other than termination of the Service Bridge,
 Executive's employment shall be considered terminated, even
 though he receives the Service Bridge.

 8.3Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later,
 prior to the Date of Termination (as determined without
 regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving such Notice
 of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute
 exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination
 shall be extended until the date on which the dispute is
 finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the
 parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of an
 arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which is
 not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal
 therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected);
 provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be
 extended by a notice of dispute given by Executive only if
 such notice is given in good faith and Executive pursues the
 resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in accordance
 with Section 8.3 hereof, Company shall continue to pay
 Executive the full compensation in effect when the notice
 giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not
 limited to, salary) and continue Executive as a participant
 in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which
 Executive was participating when the notice giving rise to
 the dispute was given, until the Date of Termination, as
 determined in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof. Amounts
 paid under this Section 8.4 are in addition to all other
 amounts due under this Agreement (other than Executive s
 Accrued Obligations) and shall not be offset against or
 reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not required to
 seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any
 amounts payable to Executive by Company pursuant to Sections 3,
 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the amount of
 any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not
 be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the
 result of employment by another employer, by retirement
 benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by
 Executive to Company, or otherwise (other than (i) as otherwise
 provided in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B) and (ii) offsets in
 accordance with the provisions of the System Executive
 Retirement Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, should
 Executive be entitled to and elect to receive the Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit in accordance with subsection 16.29(b)).

10. Successors: Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Company, Company will require any successor
 (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
 consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
 the business and/or assets of Company to expressly assume
 and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and
 to the same extent that Company would be required to
 perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure
 of Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior
 to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a
 breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to
 compensation from Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as Executive would be entitled to hereunder if
 Executive were to experience a Qualifying Termination,
 except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing,
 the date on which any such succession becomes effective
 shall be deemed the Date of Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive
 shall die while any amount would still be payable to
 Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their
 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if Executive
 had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise
 provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the
 terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal
 representatives or administrators of Executive's estate.

11. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all
 other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in
 writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
 delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the following address
 shown below or thereafter to such other address as either party
 may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance

12. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be
 modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification
 or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive
 and such officer as may be specifically designated by the
 Board. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
 breach by the other party hereto of, or of any lack of
 compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement
 to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
 similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or
 at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement supersedes any
 other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express
 or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof which
 have been made by either party. The laws of the State of
 Delaware shall govern the validity, interpretation,
 construction and performance of this Agreement. All references
 to sections of the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any
 successor provisions to such sections. Any payments provided
 for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding
 required under federal, state or local law and any additional
 withholding to which Executive has agreed.

13. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which
 shall remain in full force and effect.

14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
 counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
 but all of which together will constitute one and the same
 instrument.

15. Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration.

 15.1All claims by Executive for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be directed to and determined by the Committee and
 shall be in writing. Any denial by the Committee of a
 claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered
 to Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific
 reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this
 Agreement relied upon. The Committee shall afford a
 reasonable opportunity to Executive for a review of the
 decision denying a claim and shall further allow Executive

 that Executive's claim has been denied.

 15.2Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in
 connection with this Agreement shall be settled

 applicable) in accordance with the rules of the American
 Arbitration Association then in effect; provided, however,
 that the evidentiary standards set forth in subsections
 16.6 and 16.19 of this Agreement shall be applied by the
 arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
 award in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
 any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Executive
 shall be entitled to seek specific performance of

 Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness

 Executive pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof) that has not
 been cured within 30 days after a written demand for
 substantial performance is delivered to Executive by the
 Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in
 which the Board believes that Executive has not
 substantially performed Executive's duties; (ii) the
 willful engaging by Executive in conduct which is
 demonstrably and materially injurious to a System Company,

 suggestions regarding, or proposed improvements to, the
 merger implementation process. For purposes of clauses (i)
 and (ii) of this definition, (x) no act, or failure to
 act, on Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless
 done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith and
 without reasonable belief that Executive's act, or failure
 to act, was in the best interest of the System; and (y) in
 the event of a dispute concerning the application of this
 provision, no claim by Company that Cause exists shall be
 given effect unless Company establishes to the Committee

 compensation plan in which Executive participates on or

 that is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination
 satisfying the requirements of Section 8.1 hereof; for
 purposes of this Agreement, no such purported
 termination shall be effective.

 Executive's right to terminate Executive's employment for
 Good Reason shall not be affected by Executive's
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness. Executive's
 continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a

 act constituting Good Reason hereunder. For purposes of
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason,
 any claim by Executive that Good Reason exists shall be
 presumed to be correct unless Company establishes to the

 employ of any System Company.

 2.2 Executive's Covenants. Executive agrees to the
 following:

 (A) For a period of two years following the Date of

 normal operations, including actions or statements
 (i) that would harm the reputation of any System
 Company with its clients, suppliers, employees or

 the entitlement of Executive or his beneficiary(ies) to
 certain payments and benefits under specified circumstances
 described in each subsection, and, with the exception of
 subsection 3.1, in no event shall Executive and his
 beneficiary(ies) be entitled to payments and benefits under
 more than one such subsection.

 3.1 Physical or Mental Illness. During any period that
 Executive fails to perform Executive's full-time duties
 within the System as a result of incapacity due to
 physical or mental illness, his System employer shall pay
 Executive's full salary to Executive at the rate in

 with all compensation and benefits payable to Executive
 under the terms of any compensation or benefit plan,
 program or arrangement (other than Company's short- or

 conditions as in effect on the date of execution of this
 Agreement.

 Severance Payment, Supplemental Retirement Benefit (in
 accordance with the election of Executive or his
 beneficiary, if applicable), Maximum LTIP Award and Other
 EOP Awards.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the
 payments or benefits received or to be received by
 Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this
 Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement
 with any System Company) (all such payments and benefits,
 excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter
 referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to
 the Excise Tax, Company shall pay to Executive an
 additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the
 net amount retained by Executive, after deduction of any
 Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state
 and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon
 the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total
 Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
 section 280G(b) (2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive
 and selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately
 prior to the Closing, Company's independent auditor (the
 "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in whole or in
 part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by
 reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the Code, (ii) all
 "excess parachute payments' within the meaning of section
 280G(b) (1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to
 the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel,
 such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part)
 represent reasonable compensation for services actually
 rendered (within the meaning of section 250G(b) (4) (B)
 of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not
 subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-
 cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the
 principles or sections 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the Code.
 For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
 Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
 tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income
 taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 4), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined
 to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder
 in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall
 repay to Company, within five (5) business days
 following the time that the amount of such reduction in
 the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction plus
 that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the
 Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being
 repaid by Executive, to the extent that such repayment
 results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-
 for-dollar reduction in Executive's taxable income and
 wages for purposes of federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of
 such repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In the event that the
 Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into
 account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment
 (including by reason of any payment the existence or
 amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the
 Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make an additional
 Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any
 interest, penalties or additions payable by Executive
 with respect to such excess) within five (5) business
 days following the time that the amount of such excess
 is finally determined. Executive and Company shall each
 reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with
 any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive
 experienced a Qualifying Termination event on December 31,
 2000. Company shall deposit such additional amounts as
 determined by the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to
 pay amounts due under the Agreement. The payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made no later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Company shall pay to
 Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith
 by Executive or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Company fails to make such payments when due) at
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the
 Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in
 no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date of
 Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated
 payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have
 been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by Company to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand by
 Company (together with interest at 120 of the rate provided
 in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). At the time that
 payments are made under this Agreement, Company shall provide
 Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in
 which such payments were calculated and the basis for such
 calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or
 other advice Company has received from Tax Counsel, the
 Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such
 opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to
 the statement).

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal
 fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good
 faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination of
 Executive's employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or
 enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in
 connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent
 attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code
 to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Any such
 payments shall be made within five (5) business days after
 delivery of Executive's written request for payment
 accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred
 as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including, but not limited to, the Term Sheet executed by J.
 Wayne Leonard on September 29, 2000, and any other term
 sheets, offers, or agreements preceding execution of this
 Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
 contrary, Executive acknowledges that benefits provided under
 this Agreement are in lieu of participation in, and any
 payment that might otherwise have been payable under, the
 System Executive Continuity Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries and any other System severance or retention
 plan, and Executive hereby waives any right to participate in
 such plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination
 from one party hereto to the other party hereto in
 accordance with this Section 8. For purposes of this
 Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
 which shall indicate the specific termination provision
 in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
 provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment
 under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of

 of the business and/or assets of Company to expressly
 assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
 manner and to the same extent that Company would be
 required to perform it if no such succession had taken
 place. Failure of Company to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall
 entitle Executive to compensation from Company in the
 same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be
 entitled to hereunder if Executive were to experience a
 Qualifying Termination, except that, for purposes of
 implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such
 succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of

 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if
 Executive had continued to live, all such amounts,
 unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
 accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the
 executors, personal representatives or administrators of
 Executive's estate.

 or termination of the Merger Agreement, Executive or his
 personal or legal representatives, executors,
 administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees
 and legatees (in the event of death) shall receive
 Executive's Accrued Obligations, EAIP Bonus Award, Normal
 Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits, Four-Times
 Severance Payment, Supplemental Retirement Benefit (in
 accordance with the election of Executive or his
 beneficiary, if applicable), Maximum LTIP Award and Other
 EOP Awards.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the payments
 or benefits received or to be received by Executive (whether
 pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
 arrangement or agreement with any System Company) (all such
 payments and benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being
 hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject
 to the Excise Tax, Company shall pay to Executive an additional
 amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained
 by Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total
 Payments and any federal, state and local income and employment
 taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to
 the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such
 Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as
 "parachute payments" (within the meaning of section 280G(b) (2)
 of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel (`Tax
 Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the
 accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Closing,
 Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the
 Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
 section 280G(b) (I) of the Code shall be treated as subject to
 the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess
 parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable
 compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning
 of section 280G(b) (4) (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base
 Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of
 any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of
 sections 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of
 determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall
 be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate
 of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the
 Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes
 at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of Termination (or
 if there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the
 Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section 4),
 net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
 be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall repay to
 Company, within five (5) business days following the time
 that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by Executive,
 to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction
 in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in
 Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes, plus
 interest on the amount of such repayment at 120 of the
 rate provided in section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In
 the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the
 amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the
 Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the
 time of the Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make an
 additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess
 (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by
 Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of such
 excess is finally determined. Executive and Company shall
 each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection
 with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust: Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive
 experienced a Qualifying Event on December 31, 2000. Company
 shall deposit such additional amounts as determined by the
 Auditor from time to time to be necessary to pay amounts due
 under the Agreement. The payments provided in Sections 3 and 4
 hereof shall be made no later than the fifth business day
 following the Date of Termination; provided, however, that if
 the amounts of such payments cannot be finally determined on
 or before such day, Company shall pay to Executive on such day
 an estimate, as determined in good faith by Executive or, in
 the case of payments under Section 4 hereof, in accordance
 with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments
 to which Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the
 remainder of such payments (together with interest on the
 unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the extent
 Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120 of the
 rate provided in section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the Code) as soon
 as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later
 than the thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the
 event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the
 amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess
 shall constitute a loan by Company to Executive, payable on
 the fifth business day after demand by Company (together with
 interest at 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)
 (2)(B) of the Code). At the time that payments are made under
 this Agreement, Company shall provide Executive with a written
 statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were
 calculated and the basis for such calculations including,
 without limitation, any opinions or other advice Company has
 received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or
 consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in
 writing shall be attached to the statement).

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal fees
 and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith
 any issue hereunder relating to the termination of Executive's
 employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any
 benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection
 with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
 the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be made
 within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's
 written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of
 fees and expenses incurred as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including, but not limited to, the Term Sheet executed by J.
 Wayne Leonard on September 29, 2000, and any other term
 sheets, offers, or agreements preceding execution of this
 Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
 contrary, Executive acknowledges that benefits provided under
 this Agreement are in lieu of participation in, and any
 payment that might otherwise have been payable under, the
 System Executive Continuity Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries and any other System severance or retention plan,
 and Executive hereby waives any right to participate in such
 plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination

 circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination
 of Executive's employment under the provision so
 indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause
 pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 16.6 is
 required to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted
 by the affirmative vote of not less than three-
 quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Board at
 a meeting of the Board which was called and held for the
 purpose of considering such termination (after

 Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be
 heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith
 opinion of the Board. Executive was guilty of conduct
 set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of
 Cause herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in
 detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. `Date of Termination, shall mean
 (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for
 Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination
 is given (provided that Executive shall not have
 returned to the full-time performance of Executive's
 duties during such thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if
 Executive's employment is terminated for any other
 reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination
 (which, in the case of a termination by Company, shall
 not be less than thirty (30) days (except in the case of
 a termination for Cause) and, in the case of a
 termination by Executive, shall not be less than fifteen
 (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively,
 from the date such Notice of Termination is given).

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if
 later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
 without regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving
 such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that
 a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of
 Termination shall be extended until the date on which
 the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual
 written agreement of the parties or by a final judgment,
 order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent
 jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
 which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no
 appeal has been perfected); provided, however, that the
 Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
 dispute given by Executive only if such notice is given
 in good faith and Executive pursues the resolution of
 such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, Company shall
 continue to pay Executive the frill compensation in
 effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was
 given (including, but not limited to, salary) and
 continue Executive as a participant in all compensation,
 benefit and insurance plans in which Executive was
 participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute
 was given, until the Date of Termination, as determined
 in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof. Amounts paid under
 this Section 8.4 are in addition to all other amounts due
 under this Agreement (other than Executive's Accrued
 Obligations) and shall not be offset against or reduce
 any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not required
 to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce
 any amounts payable to Executive by Company pursuant to
 Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the
 amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this
 Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by
 Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by
 retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to
 be owed by Executive to Company, or otherwise (other than (i)
 as otherwise provided in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B) and (ii)
 offsets in accordance with the provisions of the System

 substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this
 Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that Company would be required to perform it if no
 such succession had taken place. Failure of Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach
 of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to
 compensation from Company in the same amount and on
 the same terms as Executive would be entitled to
 hereunder if Executive were to experience a Qualifying
 Termination, except that, for purposes of implementing
 the foregoing, the date on which any such succession
 becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
 Termination.

 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If

 which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of
 Executive) if Executive had continued to live, all
 such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall
 be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
 to the executors, personal representatives or
 administrators of Executive's estate.

 designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto
 at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or
 of any lack of compliance with, any condition or provision
 of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
 be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
 conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
 This Agreement supersedes any other agreements or
 representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied,
 with respect to the subject matter hereof which have been
 made by either party. The laws of the State of Delaware

 provisions to such sections. Any payments provided for
 hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding
 required under federal, state or local law and any
 additional withholding to which Executive has agreed.

 Committee and shall be in writing. Any denial by the
 Committee of a claim for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be delivered to Executive in writing and shall
 set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the

 Executive's death) Executive's surviving spouse
 shall receive the death benefit associated with
 Executive's Supplemental Retirement Benefit, but
 only to the extent not already received by or on
 behalf of Executive.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the
 payments or benefits received or to be received by
 Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
 or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with any
 System Company) (all such payments and benefits, excluding
 the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the
 "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax,
 Company shall pay to Executive an additional amount (the
 "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by
 Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total
 Payments and any federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment,
 shall be equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was,
 immediately prior to the Closing, Company's independent
 auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in
 whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments,
 including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code,
 (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as subject
 to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel,
 such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part)
 represent reasonable compensation for services actually
 rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of
 the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such
 reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to
 the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-cash
 benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the
 principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For
 purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
 Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
 tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income
 taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 4), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall repay to
 Company, within five (5) business days following the time
 that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by Executive,
 to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction
 in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in
 Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes, plus
 interest on the amount of such repayment at 120 of the
 rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the
 event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the
 amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the
 Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the
 time of the Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make an
 additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess
 (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by
 Executive with respect to such excess) within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of such
 excess is finally determined. Executive and Company shall
 each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection
 with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive
 experienced a Qualifying Termination event on December 31,
 2000. Company shall deposit such additional amounts as
 determined by the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to
 pay amounts due under the Agreement. The payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Company shall pay to
 Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith
 by Executive or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Company fails to make such payments when due) at
 120 of the rate provided in section I 274(b)(2)(B) of the
 Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in
 no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date of
 Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated
 payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have
 been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by Company to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand
 by Company (together with interest at 120 of the rate
 provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). At the time
 that payments are made under this Agreement, Company shall
 provide Executive with a written statement setting forth the
 manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis
 for such calculations including, without limitation, any
 opinions or other advice Company has received from Tax
 Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any
 such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached
 to the statement). Notwithstanding any provision of this
 Section 5 to the contrary, if Executive is entitled to receive
 the First Retention Bonus or the Second Retention Bonus in
 accordance with subsection 3.1, such benefit shall be payable
 under the circumstances described in subsection 3.1, without
 regard to termination of employment. In addition, if Executive
 (or his surviving spouse) is entitled to receive the
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit, such benefit shall be payable
 in accordance with the form of benefit elected by the
 Executive, or payable to the surviving spouse, in accordance
 with the terms and conditions of the System Executive
 Continuity Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, as
 applicable to Executive on the date of this Agreement.

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal fees
 and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith
 any issue hereunder relating to the termination of Executive's
 employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any
 benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection
 with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
 the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be made
 within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's
 written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of
 fees and expenses incurred as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including, but not limited to, the Employment Agreement dated
 July 29, 1999, and as amended April 4, 2000, and any other
 term sheets or offers preceding execution of this Agreement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not
 supercede Executive's Deferred Compensation Agreement dated
 December 31, 1990, and as amended on May 20, 1997, nor the
 terms and conditions of Executive's participation in the
 System Executive Retirement Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries, the Pension Equalization Plan of Entergy
 Corporation and Subsidiaries, and the Supplemental Retirement
 Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
 any other provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges
 that benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of
 participation in, and any payment that might otherwise have
 been payable under, the System Executive Continuity Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and any other System
 severance or retention plan, and Executive hereby waives any
 right to participate in such plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination
 from one party hereto to the other party hereto in
 accordance with this Section 8. For purposes of this
 Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
 which shall indicate the specific termination provision
 in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
 provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment
 under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of
 Termination for Cause pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
 Section 16.6 is required to include a copy of a
 resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not
 less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
 of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called
 and held for the purpose of considering such termination
 (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity
 for Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be
 heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith
 opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of conduct set
 forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause
 herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean
 (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for
 Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination
 is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned
 to the full-time performance of Executive's duties during
 such thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if Executive's
 employment is terminated for any other reason, the date
 specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the
 case of a termination by Company, shall not be less than
 thirty (30) days (except in the case of a termination for
 Cause) and, in the case of a termination by Executive,
 shall not be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than
 sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice
 of Termination is given).

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if
 later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
 without regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving
 such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that
 a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of
 Termination shall be extended until the date on which the
 dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written
 agreement of the parties or by a final judgment, order or
 decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent
 jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
 which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no
 appeal has been perfected); provided, however, that the
 Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
 dispute given by Executive only if such notice is given
 in good faith and Executive pursues the resolution of
 such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, Company shall
 continue to pay Executive the full compensation in effect
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given
 (including, but not limited to, salary) and continue
 Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit
 and insurance plans in which Executive was participating
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given,
 until the Date of Termination, as determined in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof. Amounts paid under
 this Section 8.4 are in addition to all other amounts due
 under this Agreement (other than Executive's Accrued
 Obligations) and shall not be offset against or reduce
 any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not required
 to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce
 any amounts payable to Executive by Company pursuant to
 Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the
 amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this
 Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by
 Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by
 retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to
 be owed by Executive to Company, or otherwise (other than (i)
 as otherwise provided in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B)) and (ii)
 offsets to the Supplemental Retirement Benefit in accordance
 with the provisions of the System Executive Retirement Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.

10. Successors: Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Company, Company will require any successor
 (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
 consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all
 of the business and/or assets of Company to expressly
 assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
 manner and to the same extent that Company would be
 required to perform it if no such succession had taken
 place. Failure of Company to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall
 entitle Executive to compensation from Company in the
 same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be
 entitled to hereunder if Executive were to experience a
 Qualifying Termination, except that, for purposes of
 implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such
 succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
 Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. if Executive
 shall die while any amount would still be payable to
 Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their
 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if
 Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
 otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
 with the terms of this Agreement to the executors,
 personal representatives or administrators of Executive's
 estate.

11. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all
 other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in
 writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
 delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the following address
 shown below or thereafter to such other address as either party
 may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance

12. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be
 modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver,
 modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
 by Executive and such officer as may be specifically
 designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto at
 any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of any
 lack of compliance with, any condition or provision of this
 Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
 a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at

 supersedes any other agreements or representations, oral or
 otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject
 matter hereof which have been made by either party. The laws

 state or local law and any additional withholding to which
 Executive has agreed.

 provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which

 counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
 but all of which together will constitute one and the same
 instrument.

15. Settlement of Disputes: Arbitration.

 15.1 All claims by Executive for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be directed to and determined by the Committee and
 shall be in writing. Any denial by the Committee of a
 claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered
 to Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific
 reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this
 Agreement relied upon. The Committee shall afford a

 16.6 and 16.19 of this Agreement shall be applied by the
 arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
 award in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
 any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Executive
 shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
 Executive's right to be paid until the Date of Termination

 subsection shall be reduced by the benefits provided
 to Executive prior to his death or Disability under
 any other subsection of this Agreement, with the
 exception of subsection 3.1.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to
 any payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any
 of the payments or benefits received or to be received
 by Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this
 Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement
 with any System Company) (all such payments and
 benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being
 hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will
 be subject to the Excise Tax, Company shall pay to
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
 Payment") such that the net amount retained by
 Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the
 Total Payments and any federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up
 Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
 amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total
 Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments"
 (within the meaning of section 280G(b) (2) of the
 Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax
 Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive and
 selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately
 prior to the Closing, Company's independent auditor
 (the "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in whole
 or in part) do not constitute parachute payments,
 including by reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the
 Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the
 meaning of section 280G(b) (I) of the Code shall be
 treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the
 opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments
 (in whole or in part) represent reasonable
 compensation for services actually rendered (within
 the meaning of section 280G(b) (4) (B) of the Code) in
 excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable
 compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the
 Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-cash
 benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the
 principles of sections 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the
 Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
 Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay
 federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of
 federal income taxation in the calendar year in which
 the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local
 income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation
 in the state and locality of Executive's residence on
 the Date of Termination (or if there is no Date of
 Termination, then the date on which the Gross-Up
 Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section 4),
 net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
 which could be obtained from deduction of such state
 and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined
 to be less than the amount taken into account
 hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment,
 Executive shall repay to Company, within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of
 such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally
 determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of
 the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax
 and federal, state and local income and employment
 taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results
 in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-
 dollar reduction in Executive's taxable income and
 wages for purposes of federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of
 such repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 1274(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In the event that the
 Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken
 into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up
 Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at
 the time of the Gross-Up Payment), Company shall make
 an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such
 excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions
 payable by Executive with respect to such excess)
 within five (5) business days following the time that
 the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 Executive and Company shall each reasonably cooperate
 with the other in connection with any administrative
 or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or
 amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to the
 Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days
 from the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit
 in the Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation
 and Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the
 Auditor (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay
 all amounts that would be due under this Agreement if
 Executive experienced a Qualifying Termination event on
 December 31, 2000. Company shall deposit such additional
 amounts as determined by the Auditor from time to time to
 be necessary to pay amounts due under the Agreement. The
 payments provided in Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made
 no later than the fifth business day following the Date of
 Termination; provided, however, that if the amounts of such
 payments cannot be finally determined on or before such
 day, Company shall pay to Executive on such day an
 estimate, as determined in good faith by Executive or, in
 the case of payments under Section 4 hereof, in accordance
 with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum amount of such
 payments to which Executive is clearly entitled and shall
 pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest
 on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the
 extent Company fails to make such payments when due) at
 120 of the rate provided in section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of
 the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined,
 but in no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date
 of Termination. In the event that the amount of the
 estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently
 determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
 loan by Company to Executive, payable on the fifth business
 day after demand by Company (together with interest at 120 
 of the rate provided in section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the
 Code). At the time that payments are made under this
 Agreement, Company shall provide Executive with a written
 statement setting forth the manner in which such payments
 were calculated and the basis for such calculations
 including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice
 Company has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other
 advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice
 which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal
 fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in
 good faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination
 of Executive's employment, in seeking in good faith to
 obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this
 Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding
 to the extent attributable to the application of section

 hereunder. Any such payments shall be made within five (5)
 business days after delivery of Executive's written request

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement
 supercedes any other agreements or representations, oral or
 otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject
 matter hereof which have been made by Executive or any
 System Company, including, but not limited to, the Term
 Sheet executed by J. Wayne Leonard on September 29, 2000,
 and any other term sheets, offers, or agreements preceding
 execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
 provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges that
 benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of
 participation in, and any payment that might otherwise have
 been payable under, the System Executive Continuity Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and any other System
 severance or retention plan, and Executive hereby waives
 any right to participate in such plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination
 from one party hereto to the other party hereto in
 accordance with this Section 8. For purposes of this
 Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
 notice which shall indicate the specific termination
 provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set
 forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
 claimed to provide a basis for termination of
 Executive's employment under the provision so
 indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause
 pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 16.6 is
 required to include a copy of a resolution duly
 adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-
 quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Board
 at a meeting of the Board which was called and held
 for the purpose of considering such termination (after
 reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for
 Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be
 heard before the Board) finding that, in the good
 faith opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of
 conduct set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the
 definition of Cause herein, and specifying the
 particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean
 (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for
 Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of
 Termination is given (provided that Executive shall
 not have returned to the full-time performance of
 Executive's duties during such thirty (30) day
 period), and (ii) if Executive's employment is
 terminated for any other reason, the date specified in
 the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a
 termination by Company, shall not be less than thirty
 (30) days (except in the case of a termination for
 Cause) and, in the case of a termination by Executive,
 shall not be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than
 sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such
 Notice of Termination is given). Solely for purposes
 of determining Executive's "Date of Termination" for
 any reason other than termination of the Service
 Bridge, Executive's employment shall be considered
 terminated, even though he receives the Service
 Bridge.

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if
 later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
 without regard to this Section 8.3), the party
 receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the
 other party that a dispute exists concerning the
 termination, the Date of Termination shall be extended
 until the date on which the dispute is finally
 resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the
 parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of an
 arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which
 is not appealable or with respect to which the time
 for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has
 been perfected); provided, however, that the Date of
 Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute
 given by Executive only if such notice is given in
 good faith and Executive pursues the resolution of
 such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported
 termination occurs and the Date of Termination is
 extended in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof,
 Company shall continue to pay Executive the ff11
 compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to
 the dispute was given (including, but not limited to,
 salary) and continue Executive as a participant in all
 compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which
 Executive was participating when the notice giving
 rise to the dispute was given, until the Date of
 Termination, as determined in accordance with Section
 8.3 hereof. Amounts paid under this Section 8.4 are in
 addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement
 (other than Executive's Accrued Obligations) and shall
 not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due
 under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not
 required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way
 to reduce any amounts payable to Executive by Company
 pursuant to Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4
 hereof. Further, the amount of any payment or benefit
 provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any
 compensation earned by Executive as the result of
 employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by
 offset against any amount claimed to be owed by Executive
 to Company, or otherwise (other than (i) as otherwise
 provided in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B) and (ii) offsets in
 accordance with the provisions of the System Executive
 Retirement Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries,
 should Executive be entitled to and elect to receive the
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit in accordance with
 subsection 16.27(b)).

10. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Company, Company will require any
 successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
 merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
 substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this
 Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that Company would be required to perform it if no
 such succession had taken place. Failure of Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach
 of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to
 compensation from Company in the same amount and on
 the same terms as Executive would be entitled to
 hereunder if Executive were to experience a Qualifying
 Termination, except that, for purposes of implementing
 the foregoing, the date on which any such succession
 becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
 Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators,
 successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and
 legatees. If Executive shall die while any amount
 would still be payable to Executive hereunder (other
 than amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the
 death of Executive) if Executive had continued to
 live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
 herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
 this Agreement to the executors, personal
 representatives or administrators of Executive's
 estate.

11. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and
 all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall
 be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
 delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the following address
 shown below or thereafter to such other address as either
 party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance
 herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be

12.Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be
 modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver,
 modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and
 signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically
 designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto
 at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or
 of any lack of compliance with, any condition or provision
 of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
 be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
 conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
 This Agreement supersedes any other agreements or
 representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied,
 with respect to the subject matter hereof which have been
 made by either party. The laws of the State of Delaware
 shall govern the validity, interpretation, construction and
 performance of this Agreement. All references to sections
 of the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor
 provisions to such sections. Any payments provided for
 hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding
 required under federal, state or local law and any
 additional withholding to which Executive has agreed.

13. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity
 or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement,
 which shall remain in full force and effect.

14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
 several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
 an original but all of which together will constitute one
 and the same instrument.

15. Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration.

 15.1All claims by Executive for benefits under this
 Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the
 Committee and shall be in writing. Any denial by the
 Committee of a claim for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be delivered to Executive in writing and shall
 set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the
 specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The
 Committee shall afford a reasonable opportunity to

 and shall further allow Executive to appeal to the
 Committee a decision of the Committee within sixty
 (60) days after notification by the Committee that
 Executive's claim has been denied.

 15.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in

 Merger Agreement is terminated, as applicable) in accordance
 with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in
 effect; provided, however, that the evidentiary standards set
 forth in subsections 16.6 and 16.19 of this Agreement shall be
 applied by the arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on the
 arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the

 performance of Executive's right to be paid until the Date of
 Termination during

 4. Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the
 payments or benefits received or to be received by
 Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this
 Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement
 with any System Company) (all such payments and benefits,
 excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter
 referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to
 the Excise Tax, Executive's System Company employer shall
 pay to Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
 Payment") such that the net amount retained by Executive,
 after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments
 and any federal, state and local income and employment
 taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be
 equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such
 Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as
 "parachute payments" (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of
 the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
 reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the accounting
 firm which was, immediately prior to the Closing, Executive's
 System Company employers independent auditor (the "Auditor"),
 such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute
 parachute payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A)
 of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the
 meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as
 subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel,
 such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent
 reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within
 the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of
 the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of
 any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of
 sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of
 determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall
 be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate
 of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the
 Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes
 at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of Executive's residence on the Date of Termination (or
 if there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the
 Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section 4),
 net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
 be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined
 to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder
 in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall
 repay to Executive's System Company employer, within
 five (5) business days following the time that the
 amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally
 determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in
 a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollarfor-dollar
 reduction in Executive's taxable income and wages for
 purposes of federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of such
 repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise
 Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into
 account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment
 (including by reason of any payment the existence or
 amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the
 Gross-Up Payment), Executive's System Company employer
 shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of
 such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions
 payable by Executive with respect to such excess) within
 five (5) business days following the time that the
 amount of such excess is finally determined. Executive
 and Executive's System Company employer shall each
 reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with
 any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust: Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Executive's System Company
 employer may deposit in the Trust for Deferred Payments of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as
 determined by the Auditor (as defined in Section 4.2) to be
 necessary to pay all amounts that would be due under this
 Agreement if Executive experienced a Qualifying Termination
 event on the Effective Date of this Agreement. Executive's
 System Company employer may deposit such additional amounts as
 determined by the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to
 pay amounts due under the Agreement. The payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Executive's System
 Company employer shall pay to Executive on such day an
 estimate, as determined in good faith by Executive's System
 Company employer, or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Executive's System Company employer fails to make
 such payments when due) at 120 of the rate provided in
 section 1 274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
 thereof can be determined, but in no event later than the
 thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the event that
 the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount
 subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall
 constitute a loan by Executive's System Company employer to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand by
 Executive's System Company employer (together with interest at
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the
 Code). At the time that payments are made under this
 Agreement. Executive's System Company employer shall provide
 Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in
 which such payments were calculated and the basis for such
 calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or
 other advice Executive's System Company employer has received
 from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants
 (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be
 attached to the statement). Notwithstanding any provision of
 this Section 5 to the contrary, if Executive is entitled to
 receive payment of a portion of the Retention Bonus in
 accordance with subsection 3.1, such benefit shall be payable
 under the circumstances described in subsection 3.1, without
 regard to termination of employment.

6.Legal Fees. Executive's System Company employer also shall pay
 to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive
 in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to the
 termination of Executive's employment, in seeking in good
 faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by
 this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or
 proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of
 section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided
 hereunder. Any such payments shall be made within five (5)
 business days after delivery of Executive's written request
 for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and
 expenses incurred as Executive's System Company employer
 reasonably may require.

7. Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement does not
 supercede the terms and conditions of Executive's
 participation in the System Executive Retirement Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and the Pension
 Equalization Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.
 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,
 Executive acknowledges that benefits provided under this
 Agreement are in lieu of participation in, and any payment
 that might otherwise have been payable under, the System
 Executive Continuity Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries and any other System severance or retention
 plan, and Executive hereby waives any right to participate in
 such plans.

8. Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death) shall be
 communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party
 hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with this Section
 8. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination"
 shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination
 provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide
 a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the
 provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for
 Cause pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of Section 14.6 is required
 to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative
 vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire
 membership of the terminating employer's board of directors at a
 meeting of such board of directors which was called and held for
 the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable
 notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive, together
 with Executive's counsel, to be heard before that board) finding
 that, in the good faith opinion of the board, Executive was
 guilty of conduct set forth in clause (a) or (b) of the
 definition of Cause herein, and specifying the particulars
 thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean (a)
 if Executive's Employment is terminated for Disability, thirty
 (30) days after Notice of Termination
 is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned
 to the full-time performance of Executive's duties during
 such thirty (30) day period), and (b) if Executive's
 employment is terminated for any other reason, the date
 specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the
 case of a termination by Executive's System Company
 employer, shall not be less than thirty (30) days (except
 in the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the case
 of a termination by Executive, shall not be less than
 fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days,
 respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is
 given).

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if
 later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
 without regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving
 such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that
 a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of
 Termination shall be extended until the date on which
 the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual
 written agreement of the parties or by a final judgment,
 order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent
 jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
 which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no
 appeal has been perfected); provided, however, that the
 Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
 dispute given by Executive only if such notice is given
 in good faith and Executive pursues the resolution of
 such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, Executive's System
 Company employer shall continue to pay Executive the
 full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise
 to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to,
 salary) and continue Executive as a participant in all
 compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which
 Executive was participating when the notice giving rise
 to the dispute was given, until the Date of Termination,
 as determined in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof.
 Amounts paid under this Section 8.4 are in addition to
 all other amounts due under this Agreement (other than
 Executive's Accrued Obligations) and shall not be offset
 against or reduce any other amounts due under this
 Agreement.

9. No Mitigation. Executive's System Company employer agrees
 that Executive is not required to seek other employment or to
 attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Executive
 by Executive's System Company employer pursuant to Sections
 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the amount
 of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement
 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive
 as the result of employment by another employer, by
 retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to
 be owed by Executive to Executive's System Company employer,
 or otherwise (other than as otherwise provided in subsection
 2.2 (a) and (b)).

10. Successors: Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Executive's System Company employer,
 Executive's System Company employer will require any
 successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
 merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
 substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 Executive's System Company employer to expressly assume
 and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
 and to the same extent that Executive's System Company
 employer would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of Executive's
 System Company employer to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of thisAgreement and shall
 entitle Executive to compensation from Executive's
 System Company employer in the same amount and on the
 same terms as Executive would be entitled to hereunder
 if Executive were to experience a Qualifying
 Termination,

 except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing,
 the date on which any such succession becomes effective
 shall be deemed the Date of Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive
 shall die while any amount would still be payable to
 Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their
 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if
 Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
 otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
 with the terms of this Agreement to the executors,
 personal representatives or administrators of Executive's
 estate.

11. Settlement of Disputes: Arbitration.

 11.1 All claims by Executive for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be directed to and determined by the Committee and
 shall be in writing. Any denial by the Committee of a
 claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be
 delivered to Executive in writing and shall set forth the
 specific reasons for the denial and the specific
 provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The Committee
 shall afford a reasonable opportunity to Executive for a
 review of the decision denying a claim and shall further
 allow Executive to appeal to the Committee a decision of
 the Committee within sixty (60) days after notification
 by the Committee that Executive's claim has been denied.

 11.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in
 connection with this Agreement shall be settled
 exclusively by arbitration in the metropolitan area in
 which Executive resides on the Date of Termination (or
 the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated, as
 applicable) in accordance with the rules of the American
 Arbitration Association then in effect; provided,
 however, that the evidentiary standards set forth in
 subsections 14.6 and 14.16 of this Agreement shall be
 applied by the arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on
 the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
 contrary, Executive shall be entitled to seek specific
 performance of Executive's right to be paid until the
 Date of Termination during the pendency of any dispute or
 controversy arising under or in connection with this
 Agreement.

 employment with Employer or any other System Company has

 12.4Terms of the Agreement. Executive understands and
 acknowledges that the terms and conditions of this

 12.5Assignment of Rights. Executive agrees to and hereby does
 assign to Executive's System Company employer all rights
 in and to all inventions, business plans, work models or
 procedures, whether patentable or not, which are made or

 Executive's breach of any provision of this Section would
 constitute a material breach of this Agreement and could
 subject Executive to disciplinary action, including,
 without limitation, termination of employment for Cause.
 Executive acknowledges that money damages would be an
 insufficient remedy for any breach of this Section by
 Executive, and Employer or any other System Company
 employer shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of
 this Section by terminating any payments then owing to
 Executive under this Agreement and/or to seek specific
 performance and injunctive relief as remedies for a
 breach or threatened breach of this Section. In the event

 provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges that
 irreparable injury could result to Employer and agrees
 that Employer shall be entitled to a temporary
 restraining order or injunction, without bond,
 restraining Executive from violating the confidentiality
 provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other
 relief to which Company may be entitled. Such remedies

 of this Section, but shall be in addition to all remedies
 available at law or in equity.

4.Qualifying Termination. The following provisions shall apply
 in the event Executive's System employment ends because of a
 Qualifying Termination.

 terminated due to a Qualifying Termination, then
 Executive shall be entitled to the following, provided,
 however, that to the extent Executive has received or is
 receiving any of the compensation or benefits described

 B.Executive's Accrued Obligations, Three-Times Severance

 received or to be received by Executive (whether pursuant
 to Section 4 of this Agreement or any other plan,
 arrangement or agreement with any System Company) (all
 such payments and benefits, excluding the Gross-Up
 Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the "Total
 Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax, Executive's
 System Company employer shall pay to Executive an
 additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the
 net amount retained by Executive, after deduction of any
 Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state
 and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon
 the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total
 Payments.

 A.For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
 amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total
 Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments"
 (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code)
 unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
 reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the
 accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the
 Closing, Executive's System Company employer's
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute
 parachute payments, including by reason of section
 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute
 payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of
 the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax
 unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess
 parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent
 reasonable compensation for services actually rendered
 (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the
 Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such
 reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-cash
 benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the
 principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
 For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
 Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal
 income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the
 Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local
 income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation
 in the state and locality of Executive's residence on
 the Date of Termination (or if there is no Date of
 Termination, then the date on which the Gross-Up
 Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section,
 net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
 which could be obtained from deduction of such state
 and local taxes.

 B.In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined
 to be less than the amount taken into account
 hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment,
 Executive shall repay to Executive's System Company
 employer, within five (5) business days following the
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise
 Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up
 Payment attributable to such reduction plus that
 portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the
 Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being
 repaid by Executive, to the extent that such repayment
 results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-
 for-dollar reduction in Executive's taxable income and
 wages for purposes of federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of
 such repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the
 Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken
 into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up
 Payment (including by reason of any payment the
 existence or amount of which cannot be determined at
 the time of the Gross-Up Payment), Executive's System
 Company employer shall make an additional

 Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any
 interest, penalties or additions payable by Executive
 with respect to such excess) within five (5)
 business days following the time that the amount of
 such excess is finally determined. Executive and
 Executive's System Company employer shall each
 reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with
 any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax
 with respect to the Total Payments.

 4.3 Legal Fees. In the event of a Qualifying Termination,
 Executive's System Company employer also shall pay to
 Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by
 Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder
 relating to the termination of Executive's employment, in
 seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or
 right provided by Section 4 of this Agreement or in
 connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent
 attributable to the application of section 4999 of the
 Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Any
 such payments shall be made within five (5) business days
 after delivery of Executive's written request for payment
 accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses
 incurred as Executive's System Company employer
 reasonably may require.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Executive's System Company
 employer may deposit in the Trust for Deferred Payments of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as
 determined by the Auditor to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under Section 4 of this Agreement if
 Executive experienced a Qualifying Termination event on the
 Effective Date of this Agreement. Executive's System Company
 employer may deposit such additional amounts as determined by
 the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to pay amounts
 due under Section 4 of this Agreement. The payments provided
 in Section 4 hereof shall be made no later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Executive's System
 Company employer shall pay to Executive on such day an esti
 mate, as determined in good faith by Executive's System
 Company employer or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Executive's System Company employer fails to make
 such payments when due) at 120 of the rate provided in
 section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
 thereof can be determined, but in no event later than the
 thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the event that
 the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount
 subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall
 constitute a loan by Executive's System Company employer to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand by
 Executive's System Company employer (together with interest at
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the
 Code). At the time that payments are made under Section 4 of
 this Agreement, Executive's System Company employer shall
 provide Executive with a written statement setting forth the
 manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis
 for such calculations including, without limitation, any
 opinions or other advice Executive's System Company employer
 has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors
 or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in
 writing shall be attached to the statement).

 provisions of subsection 2.2 of this Agreement, the benefits
 that become payable, or in which Executive vests, solely upon
 a Qualifying Termination, shall nonetheless be subject to
 forfeiture and repayment under the conditions outlined in this
 Section 6, as follows:

 concerning any System Company, in which case Executive

 request; or

 C.Executive engages in any employment (without the prior
 written consent of Executive's System Company employer)
 either individually or with any person, corporation,
 governmental agency or body, or other entity in competition
 with, or similar in nature to, any business conducted by
 any System Company at any time within two (2) years
 commencing upon termination of employment, where such
 competing employer is located in, or servicing in any way
 customers located in, those parishes and counties in which
 any System Company services customers during such two- (2-)
 year period, in which case Executive shall be required to

 exception of a determination of Cause in accordance with
 paragraph F.6. of Section 22 of this Agreement, for purposes of
 any determination under Article 4 of this Agreement regarding the
 existence of Good Reason or Cause for a Qualifying Termination,
 any position taken by Executive shall be presumed correct unless
 Executive's System Company employer establishes by clear and
 convincing evidence to the Committee that such position is not
 correct.

8. Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration.

 8.1 All claims by Executive for benefits under Section 4 of
 this Agreement shall be directed to and determined by
 the Committee and shall be in writing. Any denial by
 the Committee of a claim for benefits under Section 4
 of this Agreement shall be delivered to Executive in
 writing and shall set forth the specific reasons for
 the denial and the specific provisions of this
 Agreement relied upon. The Committee shall afford a
 reasonable opportunity to Executive for a review of the
 decision denying a claim and shall further allow
 Executive to appeal to the Committee a decision of the
 Committee within sixty (60) days after notification by
 the Committee that Executive's claim has been denied.

 8.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in
 connection with Section 4 of this Agreement shall be
 settled exclusively by arbitration in the metropolitan
 area in which Executive resides on the Date of
 Termination (or the date that the Merger Agreement is
 terminated, as applicable) in accordance with the rules
 of the American Arbitration Association then in effect;
 provided, however, that the evidentiary standards set
 forth in Section 7 or, if applicable, paragraph F.6. of
 Section 22 of this Agreement shall be applied by the
 arbitrator(s). Judgment may be entered on the
 arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
 contrary, Executive shall be entitled to seek specific
 performance of Executive's right to be paid until the
 Date of Termination during the pendency of any dispute
 or controversy arising under or in connection with
 Section 4 of this Agreement.

 8.3 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, as
 a condition of receipt of the benefits under this
 Section 4, the Chief Executive Officer of Company may
 require Executive to remain employed for a period of
 time not to extend beyond the Closing, such employment
 to be on substantially the same terms and conditions as
 in effect on the date of execution of this Agreement.

9. Benefit Plans & Arrangements. Except as otherwise provided in
 subsection 9.2 and in Section 10 of this Agreement, the
 benefits provided under this Agreement shall in no way alter
 or affect the terms and conditions of any Company or other
 System Company sponsored employee benefit plans in which
 Executive may already participate, and Executive's
 eligibility to participate in any such qualified or
 non-qualified employee benefit plans and any welfare benefit
 plans shall continue to be determined in accordance with the
 terms and conditions of such plans, as may be amended from
 time to time.

 9.1 Unless specifically provided for in a written plan
 document properly adopted pursuant to such plan,
 none of the benefits or arrangements described in
 this Agreement shall be secured or funded in any
 way, and each shall instead constitute an unfunded
 and unsecured promise to pay money in the future
 exclusively from the general assets of Executive's
 System Company employer.

 9.2 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,
 Executive acknowledges that benefits provided under this
 Agreement are in lieu of participation in, and any
 payment that might otherwise have been payable under, the
 Continuity Plan and any other System severance or
 retention plan, and Executive hereby waives any right to
 participate in such plans. Further, the Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit represents payment in lieu of all non-
 qualified supplemental retirement benefits to which
 Executive might otherwise be entitled under the PEP,
 other non-qualified plans, and any supplemental credited
 service granted Executive under the PEP or such other non-
 qualified plans, and by electing to receive the
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit, Executive hereby
 expressly waives any rights to benefits under the PEP,
 other non-qualified plans, and any supplemental credited
 service granted Executive under the PEP or such other non-
 qualified plans. Executive shall not require permission
 to retire and commence receipt of benefit payments.

10. Offset. In addition to the specific offset provisions of
 this Agreement and those of the PEP and Continuity Plan, in
 all cases, the compensation and cash severance benefits
 payable to Executive under this Agreement upon termination of
 the employment relationship shall be offset against any
 amounts to which Executive may otherwise be entitled under any
 and all severance plans, or programs or policies of the
 terminating employer. Provided, however, that the Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit payable in accordance with the terms of
 this Agreement shall not be subject to this offset provision,
 and shall only be subject to the applicable offset provisions
 under the PEP used in calculating Executive's Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit.

11. Successors.

 11.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Executive's System Company employer,
 Executive's System Company employer will require any
 successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
 merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
 substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 Executive's System Company employer to expressly assume
 and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
 and to the same extent that Executive's System Company
 employer would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of Executive's System
 Company employer to obtain such assumption and agreement
 prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall
 be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive
 to compensation from Executive's System Company employer
 in the same amount and on the same terms as Executive
 would be entitled to hereunder if Executive were to
 experience a Qualifying Termination, except that, for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination.

 11.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive
 shall die after the occurrence of a Qualifying Event and
 while any amount would still be payable to Executive
 hereunder if Executive had continued to live (other than
 amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the death
 of Executive), all such amounts, unless otherwise
 provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the
 terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal
 representatives or administrators of Executive's estate.

12. Provisions of Referenced Plans. To the extent this
 Agreement references or incorporates provisions of any other
 System Company plan and (a) such other plan is amended,
 supplemented, modified or terminated during the two-year
 period commencing on the date of a Potential Change in Control
 and (b) such amendment, supplementation, modification or
 termination adversely affects any benefit under this Plan,
 whether it be in the method of calculation or otherwise, then
 for purposes of this Agreement, the parties shall rely upon
 the version of such other plan in existence immediately prior
 to any such amendment, supplementation. modification or
 termination, unless such change is agreed to in writing and
 signed by the parties, or by their legal representatives and
 successors.

13. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement shall
 be in writing and deemed received (a) on the date delivered if
 hand-delivered, or (b) on the fifth business day after being
 deposited in the mail, first class, registered or certified,
 return receipt requested, with proper postage prepaid, and

 Company, its management, directors or shareholders,
 or its practices, or which disrupts or impairs their
 normal operations, including actions or statements

 Company with its clients, suppliers, employees or

 subsection 2.2, Executive shall repay to Company,
 within 5 business days of Company's written request
 therefor, any amounts in respect of the Retention
 Bonus previously paid to him pursuant to subsections

 entitlement to receive any additional payments or
 benefits under and of such subsections.

3.Compensation Upon Certain Events. This Section 3 sets forth
 the entitlement of Executive or his beneficiary (ies) to
 certain payments and benefits under specified circumstances
 described in each subsection, and, with the exception of

 more than one such subsection.

 3.1 Retention Payments. If at the first anniversary of the

 merged entity, Executive shall receive payment of one-
 third of the Retention Bonus at such first anniversary
 date. If Executive remains employed by the surviving

 anniversary of the Closing, then Executive shall receive
 payment of one-half of the remaining unpaid Retention
 Bonus at such second anniversary date. If Executive
 remains employed by the surviving merged entity through
 and including the third anniversary of the Closing, then
 Executive shall receive payment of the remaining unpaid
 Retention Bonus at such third anniversary date.

 3.2 Physical or Mental Illness. During any period that
 Executive fails to perform Executive's full-time duties
 within the System as a result of incapacity due to
 physical or mental illness, his System employer shall pay
 Executive's full salary to Executive at the rate in
 effect at the commencement of any such period, together
 with all compensation and benefits payable to Executive
 under the terms of any compensation or benefit plan,
 program or arrangement (other than Company's short- or
 long-term disability plan, as applicable) maintained by
 Company during such period, until Executive's employment
 is terminated by his System employer for Disability.

 3.3 Termination of Employment by Company For Cause at Any
 Time. If Company should terminate Executive's employment
 with the System for Cause at any time, Executive shall be
 entitled only to Executive's Accrued Obligations and
 Normal Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits.

 3.4 Termination of Employment by Executive Without Good
 Reason at Any Time. If Executive terminates employment
 with the System without Good Reason, Executive shall be
 entitled to Executive's Accrued Obligations and Normal
 Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits. In addition,

 2001, and provided Executive gives Company at least three
 months advance notice of such intention to retire,
 Executive shall have Company's permission to retire for
 purposes of receiving benefits under the Supplemental
 Retirement Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
 and under the System Executive Retirement Plan of Entergy
 Corporation and Subsidiaries, subject, however, to the
 forfeiture provisions contained therein.

 Termination (if any) and in lieu of any retention,
 severance, termination or similar benefit otherwise
 payable to Executive under any plan, program, arrangement
 or agreement of or with any System Company.

 of Executive's death) shall receive Executive's Accrued
 Obligations, Target LTIP Award, Other EOP Awards, Normal
 Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits, and any
 remaining unpaid Retention Bonus.

4.Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled to any
 payments or benefits under this Agreement, if any of the
 payments or benefits received or to be received by
 Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this
 Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement
 with any System Company) (all such payments and benefits,
 excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter
 referred to as the "Total Payments") will be subject to
 the Excise Tax, Company shall pay to Executive an
 additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the
 net amount retained by Executive, after deduction of any
 Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state
 and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon
 the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total
 Payments.

4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Total
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of
 such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
 section 280G(b) (2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was,
 immediately prior to the Closing, Company's independent
 auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in whole
 or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including
 by reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the Code, (ii) all
 "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of section
 280G(b) (I) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the
 Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such
 excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent
 reasonable compensation for services actually rendered
 (within the meaning of section 280G(b) (4) (B) of the Code)
 in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable
 compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise
 Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any
 deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
 Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections
 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining
 the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall be
 deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal
 rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in
 which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local
 income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the
 state and locality of Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then the
 date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 4), net of the maximum reduction in
 federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction
 of such state and local taxes.

4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to be
 less than the amount taken into account hereunder in
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall repay to
 Company, within five (5) business days following the time
 that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment
 attributable to such reduction plus that portion of the
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal,
 state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the
 Gross-Up Payment being repaid by Executive, to the extent
 that such repayment results in a reduction in the Excise Tax
 and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in Executive's taxable
 income and wages for purposes of federal, state and local
 income and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of
 such repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section 12
 74(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax
 is determined to exceed the amount taken into account
 hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by
 reason of any payment the existence or amount of which
 cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment),
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect
 of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions
 payable by Executive with respect to such excess) within
 five (5) business days following the time that the amount of
 such excess is finally determined. Executive and Company
 shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection
 with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning
 the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with
 respect to the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days from
 the execution of this Agreement, Company shall deposit in the
 Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as determined by the Auditor
 (as defined in Section 4.2) to be necessary to pay all amounts
 that would be due under this Agreement if Executive
 experienced a Qualifying Termination event on December 31,
 2000. Company shall deposit such additional amounts as
 determined by the Auditor from time to time to be necessary to
 pay amounts due under the Agreement. The payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth
 business day following the Date of Termination; provided,
 however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
 finally determined on or before such day, Company shall pay to
 Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith
 by Executive or, in the case of payments under Section 4
 hereof, in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of the minimum
 amount of such payments to which Executive is clearly entitled
 and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with
 interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to
 the extent Company fails to make such payments when due) at
 120 of the rate provided in section 12 74(b) (2) (B) of the
 Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in
 no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date of
 Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated
 payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have
 been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by Company to
 Executive, payable on the fifth business day after demand by
 Company (together with interest at 120 of the rate provided
 in section 1274(b) (2)(B) of the Code). At the time that
 payments are made under this Agreement, Company shall provide
 Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in
 which such payments were calculated and the basis for such
 calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or
 other advice Company has received from Tax Counsel, the
 Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such
 opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to
 the statement). Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
 5 to the contrary, if Executive is entitled to receive payment
 of a portion of the Retention Bonus in accordance with
 subsection 3.1, such benefit shall be payable under the
 circumstances described in subsection 3.1, without regard to
 termination of employment.

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all legal fees
 and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith
 any issue hereunder relating to the termination of Executive's
 employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any
 benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection
 with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
 the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be made
 within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's
 written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of
 fees and expenses incurred as Company reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement supercedes
 any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
 express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof
 which have been made by Executive or any System Company,
 including, but not limited to, the Retention Agreement dated
 July 12, 2000, and any other term sheets or offers preceding
 execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 this Agreement does not supercede the terms and conditions of
 Executive's participation in the System Executive Retirement
 Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and the
 Supplemental Retirement Plan of Entergy Corporation and
 Subsidiaries (except for guaranteed Company permission to
 retire under either plan if the conditions set forth in
 Section 3.4 of this Agreement are satisfied). Notwithstanding
 any other provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges
 that benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of
 participation in, and any payment that might otherwise have
 been payable under, the System Executive Continuity Plan of
 Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and any other System
 severance or retention plan, and Executive hereby waives any
 right to participate in such plans.

8.Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of
 Executive's employment (other than by reason of death)
 shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination
 from one party hereto to the other party hereto in
 accordance with this Section 8. For purposes of this
 Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
 which shall indicate the specific termination provision
 in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
 provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment
 under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of
 Termination for Cause pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
 Section 16.6 is required to include a copy of a
 resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not
 less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
 of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called
 and held for the purpose of considering such termination
 (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity
 for Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be
 heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith
 opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of conduct set
 forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause
 herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall mean
 (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for
 Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination
 is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned
 to the full-time performance of Executive's duties during
 such thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if Executive's
 employment is terminated for any other reason, the date
 specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the
 case of a termination by Company, shall not be less than
 thirty (30) days (except in the case of a termination for
 Cause) and, in the case of a termination by Executive,
 shall not be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than
 sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice
 of Termination is given).

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later,
 prior to the Date of Termination (as determined without regard
 to this Section 8.3), the party receiving such Notice of
 Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists
 concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall
 be extended until the date on which the dispute is finally
 resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the parties
 or by a final judgment, order or decree of an arbitrator or
 a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or
 with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired
 and no appeal has been perfected); provided, however, that the
 Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute
 given by Executive only if such notice is given in good faith
 and Executive pursues the resolution of such dispute with
 reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination
 occurs and the Date of Termination is extended in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, Company shall
 continue to pay Executive the full compensation in effect
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given
 (including, but not limited to, salary) and continue
 Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit
 and insurance plans in which Executive was participating
 when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given,
 until the Date of Termination, as determined in
 accordance with Section 8.3 hereof. Amounts paid under
 this Section 8.4 are in addition to all other amounts due
 under this Agreement (other than Executive s Accrued
 Obligations) and shall not be offset against or reduce
 any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not required
 to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce
 any amounts payable to Executive by Company pursuant to
 Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4 hereof. Further, the
 amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this
 Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by
 Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by
 retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to
 be owed by Executive to Company, or otherwise (other than (i)
 as otherwise provided in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B)).

10. Successors: Binding Agreement.

 10.1In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
 successor to Company, Company will require any successor
 (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
 consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all
 of the business and/or assets of Company to expressly
 assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
 manner and to the same extent that Company would be
 required to perform it if no such succession had taken
 place. Failure of Company to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall
 entitle Executive to compensation from Company in the
 same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be
 entitled to hereunder if Executive were to experience a
 Qualifying Termination, except that, for purposes of
 implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such
 succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
 Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive
 shall die while any amount would still be payable to
 Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their
 terms, terminate upon the death of Executive) if
 Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
 otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
 with the terms of this Agreement to the executors,
 personal representatives or administrators of Executive's
 estate.

11. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and
 all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall
 be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
 delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the following address
 shown below or thereafter to such other address as either
 party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance

12. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be
 modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver,
 modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
 by Executive and such officer as may be specifically
 designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto at
 any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of any
 lack of compliance with, any condition or provision of this
 Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
 a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
 the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement
 supersedes any other agreements or representations, oral or
 otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject
 matter hereof which have been made by either party. The laws
 of the State of Delaware shall govern the validity,
 interpretation, construction and performance of this
 Agreement. All references to sections of the Code shall be
 deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such
 sections. Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid
 net of any applicable withholding required under federal,
 state or local law and any additional withholding to which
 Executive has agreed.

13. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which
 shall remain in full force and effect.

14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
 counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
 but all of which together will constitute one and the same
 instrument.

15. Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration.

 15.1 All claims by Executive for benefits under this
 Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the
 Committee and shall be in writing. Any denial by the
 Committee of a claim for benefits under this Agreement
 shall be delivered to Executive in writing and shall set
 forth the specific reasons for the denial and the
 specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The
 Committee shall afford a reasonable opportunity to
 Executive for a review of the decision denying a claim
 and shall further allow Executive to appeal to the
 Committee a decision of the Committee within sixty (60)
 days after notification by the Committee that Executive's
 claim has been denied.

 15.2 Any further dispute or controversy arising
 under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
 settled exclusively by arbitration in the metropolitan
 area in which Executive resides on the Date of
 Termination (or the date that the Merger Agreement is
 terminated, as applicable) in accordance with the rules
 of the American Arbitration Association then in effect;
 provided, however, that the evidentiary standards set
 forth in subsections 16.6 and 16.16 of this Agreement
 shall be applied by the arbitrator(s). Judgment may be
 entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having
 jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision of this
 Agreement to the contrary, Executive shall be entitled to
 seek specific performance of Executive's right to be paid
 until the Date of Termination during the pendency of any
 dispute or controversy arising under or in connection
 with this Agreement.

 which the Board believes that Executive has not
 substantially performed Executive's duties; (ii) the

 suggestions regarding, or proposed improvements to, the
 merger implementation process. For purposes of clauses (i)
 and (ii) of this definition, (x) no act, or failure to
 act, on Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless
 done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith and

 the event of a dispute concerning the application of this
 provision, no claim by Company that Cause exists shall be

 for a period of six (6) consecutive months, Company shall
 have given Executive a Notice of Termination for Disability,

 due to physical or mental illness, his System
 employer shall pay Executive's full salary to
 Executive at the rate in effect at the
 commencement of any such period, together with all
 compensation and benefits payable to Executive
 under the terms of any compensation or benefit

 3.4 Termination of Employment by Executive Without

 3.5 Termination of Employment by Executive Without

 Termination Compensation and Benefits and (b)
 receive Executive's Accrued Obligations,
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit (in accordance
 with Executive's election), EAIP Bonus Award,

 the Closing, he shall receive payment of the
 Supplemental Retirement Benefit (if Executive
 elects to receive such benefit in accordance with
 subsection 16.28 (a)) on the date of the Closing,

 shall receive payment of the Supplemental

 16.28(a)) on the date of the Closing, which
 payment shall not prejudice Executive's right to
 receive the other benefits described in this
 subsection upon occurrence of a Qualifying
 Termination.

 3.7 Termination On Account of Death or Disability. If
 Executive's employment should terminate on account
 of death or Disability prior to the termination of

 Four-Times Severance Payment, Supplemental
 Retirement Benefit (in accordance with the

 Awards. Benefits provided under this subsection
 shall be reduced by the benefits provided to
 Executive prior to his death or Disability under
 any other subsection of this Agreement, with the
 exception of subsection 3.1.

4. Gross-Up Payment.

 4.1 Regardless of whether Executive becomes entitled
 to any payments or benefits under this Agreement,
 if any of the payments or benefits received or to
 be received by Executive (whether pursuant to the
 terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
 arrangement or agreement with any System Company)
 (all such payments and benefits, excluding the
 Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as
 the "Total Payments") will be subject to the
 Excise Tax, Company shall pay to Executive an
 additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such
 that the net amount retained by Executive, after
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments
 and any federal, state and local income and
 employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up
 Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments.

 4.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the
 Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax
 and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the
 Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute
 payments" (within the meaning of section 280G(b)
 (2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax
 counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm
 which was, immediately prior to the Closing,
 Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"),
 such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do
 not constitute parachute payments, including by
 reason of section 280G(b) (4) (A) of the Code,
 (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the
 meaning of section 280G(b) (1) of the Code shall
 be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in
 the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute
 payments (in whole or in part) represent
 reasonable compensation for services actually
 rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)
 (4) (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount
 allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii)
 the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred
 payment or benefit shall be determined by the
 Auditor in accordance with the principles of
 sections 280G(d) (3) and (4) of the Code. For
 purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
 Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal
 income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the
 Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local
 income taxes at the highest marginal rate of
 taxation in the state and locality of Executive's
 residence on the Date of Termination (or if there
 is no Date of Termination, then the date on which
 the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of
 this Section 4), net of the maximum reduction in
 federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 4.3 In the event that the Excise Tax is finally
 determined to be less than the amount taken into
 account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up
 Payment, Executive shall repay to Company, within
 five (5) business days following the time that the
 amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up
 Payment attributable to such reduction plus that
 portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to
 the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income
 and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up
 Payment being repaid by Executive, to the extent
 that such repayment results in a reduction in the
 Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in
 Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes
 of federal, state and local income and employment
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such
 repayment at 120 of the rate provided in section
 1274(b) (2) (B) of the Code. In the event that the
 Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount
 taken into account hereunder in calculating the
 Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any
 payment the existence or amount of which cannot be
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment),
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment
 in respect of such excess (plus any interest,
 penalties or additions payable by Executive with
 respect to such excess) within five (5) business
 days following the time that the amount of such
 excess is finally determined. Executive and
 Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the
 other in connection with any administrative or
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or
 amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to
 the Total Payments.

5.Rabbi Trust; Timing of Payments. No later than 180 days
 from the execution of this Agreement, Company shall
 deposit in the Trust for Deferred Payments of Entergy
 Corporation and Subsidiaries ("Trust") an amount as
 determined by the Auditor (as defined in Section 4.2) to
 be necessary to pay all amounts that would be due under
 this Agreement if Executive experienced a Qualifying
 Termination event on December 31, 2000. Company shall
 deposit such additional amounts as determined by the
 Auditor from time to time to be necessary to pay amounts
 due under the Agreement. The payments provided in
 Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made not later than the
 fifth business day following the Date of Termination;
 provided, however, that if the amounts of such payments
 cannot be finally determined on or before such day,
 Company shall pay to Executive on such day an estimate,
 as determined in good faith by Executive or, in the case
 of payments under Section 4 hereof, in accordance with
 Section 4 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments
 to which Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the
 remainder of such payments (together with interest on the
 unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the extent
 Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120 of
 the rate provided in section 1274 (b) (2) (B) of the
 Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined,
 but in no event later than the thirtieth day after the
 Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the
 estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently
 determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute
 a loan by Company to Executive, payable on the fifth
 business day after demand by Company (together with
 interest at 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)
 (2) (B) of the Code). At the time that payments are made
 under this Agreement, Company shall provide Executive
 with a written statement setting forth the manner in
 which such payments were calculated and the basis for
 such calculations including, without limitation, any
 opinions or other advice Company has received from Tax
 Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants
 (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing
 shall be attached to the statement). Notwithstanding any
 provision of this Section 5 to the contrary, if Executive
 elects to receive the Supplemental Retirement Benefit in
 accordance with subsection 16.28(a), such benefit shall
 be payable at the Closing under the circumstances
 described in subsections 3.5 and 3.6, unless paid prior
 to the Closing in accordance with Section 3 and this
 Section 5.

6.Legal Fees. Company also shall pay to Executive all
 legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in
 disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to
 the termination of Executive's employment, in seeking in
 good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right
 provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax
 audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the
 application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or
 benefit provided hereunder. Any such payments shall be
 made within five (5) business days after delivery of
 Executive's written request for payment accompanied with
 such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Company
 reasonably may require.

7.Superceded Agreements and Benefits. This Agreement
 supercedes any other agreements or representations, oral
 or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
 subject matter hereof which have been made by Executive
 or any System Company, including, but not limited to, the
 June 4, 1998 letter agreement, as amended March 20, 2000,
 the Term Sheet executed by J. Wayne Leonard on September
 29, 2000, and any other term sheets or offers preceding
 execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
 provision to the contrary, Executive acknowledges that
 benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of
 participation in, and any payment that might otherwise
 have been payable under, the System Executive Continuity
 Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and any
 other System severance or retention plan, and Executive
 hereby waives any right to participate in such plans.

8. Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute.

 8.1 Notice of Termination. Any purported termination
 of Executive's employment (other than by reason of
 death) shall be communicated by written Notice of
 Termination from one party hereto to the other
 party hereto in accordance with this Section 8.
 For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
 Termination" shall mean a notice which shall
 indicate the specific termination provision in
 this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in
 reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
 claimed to provide a basis for termination of
 Executive's employment under the provision so
 indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for
 Cause pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of Section
 16.6 is required to include a copy of a resolution
 duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
 than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
 of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was
 called and held for the purpose of considering
 such termination (after reasonable notice to
 Executive and an opportunity for Executive,
 together with Executive's counsel, to be heard
 before the Board) finding that, in the good faith
 opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of
 conduct set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the
 definition of Cause herein, and specifying the
 particulars thereof in detail.

 8.2 Date of Termination. "Date of Termination," shall
 mean (i) if Executive's employment is terminated
 for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of
 Termination is given (provided that Executive
 shall not have returned to the full-time
 performance of Executive's duties during such
 thirty (30) day period), and (ii) if Executive's
 employment is terminated for any other reason, the
 date specified in the Notice of Termination
 (which, in the case of a termination by Company,
 shall not be less than thirty (30) days (except in
 the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the
 case of a termination by Executive, shall not be
 less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty
 (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice
 of Termination is given). Solely for purposes of
 determining Executive's "Date of Termination" for
 any reason other than his termination of
 employment in the Special Project Coordinator
 Position, Executive's employment shall be
 considered terminated, even though he accepts the
 Special Project Coordinator Position.

 8.3 Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15)
 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later,
 prior to the Date of Termination (as determined without
 regard to this Section 8.3), the party receiving such Notice
 of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute
 exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination
 shall be extended until the date on which the dispute is
 finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the
 parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of an
 arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which is
 not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal
 therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected);
 provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be
 extended by a notice of dispute given by Executive only if
 such notice is given in good faith and Executive pursues the
 resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.

 8.4 Compensation During Dispute. If a purported
 termination occurs and the Date of Termination is
 extended in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof,
 Company shall continue to pay Executive the full
 compensation in effect when the notice giving rise
 to the dispute was given (including, but not
 limited to, salary) and continue Executive as a
 participant in all compensation, benefit and
 insurance plans in which Executive was
 participating when the notice giving rise to the
 dispute was given, until the Date of Termination,
 as determined in accordance with Section 8.3
 hereof. Amounts paid under this Section 8.4 are in
 addition to all other amounts due under this
 Agreement (other than Executive's Accrued
 Obligations) and shall not be offset against or
 reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.

9.No Mitigation. Company agrees that Executive is not
 required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way
 to reduce any amounts payable to Executive by Company
 pursuant to Sections 3, 4, or 6 hereof or Section 8.4
 hereof. Further, the amount of any payment or benefit
 provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any
 compensation earned by Executive as the result of employment
 by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset
 against any amount claimed to be owed by Executive to
 Company, or otherwise (other than (i) as otherwise provided
 in subsection 2.2 (A) and (B) and (ii) offsets in accordance
 with the provisions of the System Executive Retirement Plan
 of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, should Executive be
 entitled to and elect to receive the Supplemental Retirement
 Benefit in accordance with subsection 16.28 (b)) .

10. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 10.1 In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon
 any successor to Company, Company will require any
 successor (whether direct or indirect, by
 purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
 all or substantially all of the business and/or
 assets of Company to expressly assume and agree to
 perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
 the same extent that Company would be required to
 perform it if no such succession had taken place.
 Failure of Company to obtain such assumption and
 agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
 succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and
 shall entitle Executive to compensation from
 Company in the same amount and on the same terms
 as Executive would be entitled to hereunder if
 Executive were to experience a Qualifying
 Termination, except that, for purposes of
 implementing the foregoing, the date on which any
 such succession becomes effective shall be deemed
 the Date of Termination.

 10.2 This Agreement shall insure to the benefit of and
 be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal
 representatives, executors, administrators,
 successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and
 legatees. If Executive shall die while any amount
 would still be payable to Executive hereunder
 (other than amounts which, by their terms,
 terminate upon the death of Executive) if

 (b) any successor Administrator appointed in accordance with this
 Section. In the event that either individual designated in (a)

 employment for reasons that would constitute Good Reason under
 this Plan) that has not been cured within 30 days after a written
 demand for substantial performance is delivered to Participant by

 has not substantially performed Participant's duties; (b)
 Participant's engagement in one or more acts of embezzlement,

 retention agreement between Eligible Employee and a System
 Company, offered to and accepted by Eligible Employee prior to
 the public announcement of the Merger Agreement.

 incompetence; (b) to Participant's legal guardian or conservator;
 (c) to Participant's spouse or to any person charged with his
 support, to be expended for his benefit. The decision of the
 Administrator shall be final and binding upon all parties in
 interest. Any such payment shall completely discharge all
 obligations under the Plan and the Agreement.

 acknowledge that the terms and conditions of the Plan and his
 Agreement are confidential. A Participant shall not disclose,
 publicize, or discuss any of the terms or conditions of this Plan
 or his Agreement (and related agreements) with anyone, except his
 or her spouse, attorney, accountant, supervisor, or as required
 by law. In the event a Participant discloses this Plan or his
 Agreement (or related agreements) or any of their terms or
 conditions to his or her spouse, attorney, accountant, or
 supervisor, it shall be Participant's duty to advise said
 individual(s) of the confidential nature of this Plan and his
 Agreement (and related agreements) and to direct them not to
 disclose, publicize, or discuss any of the terms or conditions of
 this Plan (or related agreements) with any other person. If
 Participant discloses, publicizes, or discusses any of the terms
 or conditions of this Plan or his Agreement (or related
 agreements) with any other person, except his spouse, attorney,
 accountant, or supervisor, Participant will forfeit the right to
 Participant's Retention Bonus.

 any other person or entity having or claiming a right to payments
 under this Plan shall be entirely unfunded, and nothing in this
 Plan shall be construed to give such person or entity any right,
 title, interest, or claim in or to any specific asset, fund,
 reserve, account or property of any kind whatsoever, owned by a
 System Company, or in which a System Company may have any right,
 title or interest now or in the future.

4.02 Employer Liability. At its own discretion, a System Company
 may purchase such insurance or annuity contracts or other types

 obligation to fund the benefits provided under this Plan; (b) the
 investment of System Company funds credited to a special account
 established hereunder shall not be restricted in any way; and (c)

 may choose. Nothing stated herein shall prohibit a System
 Company from adopting or establishing a trust or other means as a
 source for paying any obligations created hereunder provided,
 however, any and all rights that any such Participants shall have
 with respect to any such trust or other fund shall be governed by
 the terms thereof.

 this Article IV to the contrary, the Company or any other
 System Company may make contributions to a trust intended to
 qualify as a "grantor trust" under the Internal Revenue

 determine in its or their complete discretion. The trust
 contemplated by this Section is not intended to cause

 extension in writing before the expiration of the initial 60-day
 period. During the appeal, the Claims Appeal Administrator, in

 amount of benefits or adversely affect the manner of payment of
 benefits of any Participant or Beneficiary then receiving
 benefits in accordance with the terms of Article III; or (3) may
 adversely affect the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary
 with respect to any Retention Bonus already awarded; provided,
 however, that any amendment, modification, suspension or
 termination shall be effective if such is agreed to in writing
 and signed by the affected Participant or Beneficiary and by the
 Plan Administrator, or by their legal representatives and
 successors; and

 (b) No provision of this Plan may be modified, waived, or
 discharged unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is
 agreed to in writing and signed by the affected Participant and

 direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or
 otherwise) of all or substantially all of its business and/or
 assets to expressly assume and agree to perform this Plan in the
 same manner the Plan would be performed if no such succession had
 taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption
 and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession
 shall be a breach of this Plan and shall entitle each Participant
 to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as they would be entitled hereunder if terminated for
 Good Reason, except, for the purposes of implementing the
 foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes
 effective shall be deemed the effective date of termination. Any
 successor or surviving entity that assumes or otherwise adopts
 this Plan as contemplated in this Section 6.03 shall succeed to
 all the rights, powers and duties of the Company and the Board
 hereunder, subject to the restrictions on amendment or
 termination of the Plan as set forth in Section 6.02.
