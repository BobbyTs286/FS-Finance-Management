PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

 Heartland Express, Inc. ("Heartland" or the "Company") is a
short-to-medium haul truckload carrier based near Iowa City, Iowa. The
Company provides nationwide transportation service to major shippers, using
late-model tractors and a uniform fleet of 53-foot aluminum plate dry vans.
The Company's primary traffic lanes are between customer locations east of
the Rocky Mountains, with selected service to the West. Management
believes that the Company's service standards and equipment accessibility
have made it a core carrier to many of its major customers.

 Heartland was founded by Russell A. Gerdin in 1978 and became publicly
traded in November 1986. Over the eleven years from 1986 to 1996,
Heartland has grown to 229.0 million in revenue from 21.6 million and net
income has increased to 25.0 million from 3.0 million. Much of this
growth has been attributable to expanding service for existing customers
and acquiring new customers. In addition, in March 1994, the Company
engaged in a merger by which truckload carrier Munson Transportation, Inc.
and two related entities (collectively, "Munson Transportation") became
subsidiaries. Munson Transportation had generated approximately 116
million in revenue during 1993, while serving customers primarily in
Midwest, Northeast, and Western states. Munson Transportation had been
unprofitable, and during 1994 and the first half of 1995 management
eliminated duplicate and undesirable operations, integrated administrative
and operational functions, and upgraded Munson Transportation's older fleet
of tractors and trailers. All of the Company's operations and
administrative functions are now unified at its Iowa City headquarters.

 Heartland Express, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Nevada,
which owns, directly or indirectly, all of the stock of Heartland
Express, Inc. of Iowa, Heartland Equipment, Inc., Munson
Transportation, Inc., Munson Transport Services, Inc., and Munson
Equipment, Inc..

Operations

 Heartland's operations department focuses on serving customer needs
and maximizing equipment utilization. The Company divides its operating
area into geographic regions and appoints a regional dispatcher for each
region. Regional dispatchers communicate with customers and drivers to
coordinate equipment resources with inbound and outbound load demand.
Dispatchers are responsible for monitoring the timeliness of all pickups
and deliveries within their regions. Frequent driver contact enables
dispatchers to closely monitor equipment and load positions to ensure
proper performance. Serving the short to medium haul market (600-mile
average length of haul in 1996) permits the Company to use primarily
single, rather than team drivers and dispatch most trailers directly from
origin to destination without an intermediate equipment change other than
for driver scheduling purposes.

 Heartland also operates three specialized regional distribution
operations for major customers near Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and
Iowa City, Iowa. These short-haul operations concentrate on freight
movements generally within a 400-mile radius of the regional terminal, and
are designed to meet the needs of significant customers in those regions. 
These operations are handled by dispatchers at the regional locations, and
the Company uses a centralized computer network and regular communication
to achieve system-wide load coordination.

 The Company emphasizes customer satisfaction through on-time
performance, dependable late-model equipment, and consistent equipment
availability to serve large customers' volume requirements. The Company
also maintains a high trailer to tractor ratio, which facilitates the
stationing of trailers at customer locations for convenient loading and
unloading. This minimizes waiting time, which increases tractor
utilization and assists with driver retention.

Customers and Marketing

 The Company targets customers in its operating area that require
multiple, time-sensitive shipments, including those employing
"just-in-time" manufacturing and inventory management. In seeking these
customers, Heartland has positioned itself as a provider of premium service
at compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price.
The Company's primary customers include both retailers and manufacturers.
All freight transported is non-perishable and predominantly does not

require driver handling. Heartland's reputation for quality service,
reliable equipment and equipment availability makes it a core carrier to
many of its customers.

 Heartland's sales personnel seek to expand business with existing
customers and establish service with new customers by emphasizing premium
service, regularly monitoring customer needs and the Company's performance,
and coordinating customer requirements with operations personnel.

 Heartland seeks to transport freight that will complement traffic in
its existing service areas and remain consistent with the Company's focus
on short-to-medium haul and regional distribution markets. Management
believes that building additional service in the Company's primary traffic
lanes will assist in controlling empty miles and enhancing driver "home
time."

 The Company's 25, 10, and 5 largest customers accounted for 73 , 58 ,
and 44 of revenue, respectively, in 1996. Major customers of the Company
represent the consumer appliances, food products, and automotive
industries. The distribution of customers is not significantly different
from the previous year. Sears Logistics Services accounted for 15.1 of
revenue in 1996. No other customer accounted for as much as ten percent of
revenue.

Drivers, Independent Contractors, and Other Personnel

 Heartland's workforce is an essential ingredient in achieving its
business objectives. As of December 31, 1996, Heartland employed 1,009
persons. The Company also contracted with independent contractors to
provide and operate tractors. Independent contractors own their own
tractors and are
responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel,
maintenance, insurance, and taxes. The Company historically has operated a
balanced fleet of company and independent contractor tractors. Management
believes that a balanced fleet compliments the Company's recruiting efforts
and offers greater flexibility in responding to fluctuations in shipper
demand.

 Management's strategy for both employee and independent contractor
drivers is to (1) hire the best; (2) promote retention through financial
incentives, positive working conditions, and targeting freight that
requires little or no handling; and (3) minimize safety problems through
careful screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, and
financial rewards for accident-free driving. Heartland also seeks to
minimize turnover of its employee drivers by providing modern, comfortable
equipment and of all drivers by regularly scheduling them to their homes.
All drivers are compensated for empty miles as well as loaded miles. This
provides an incentive for the Company to minimize empty miles and at the
 same time does not penalize drivers for inefficiencies of operations that
are beyond their control.

 Heartland is not a party to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Management believes that the Company has good relationships with its
employees and independent contractors.

Revenue Equipment

 Heartland's management believes that operating high-quality, efficient
equipment is an important part of providing excellent service to customers. 
The Company's policy is to operate its tractors while under warranty to
minimize repair and maintenance cost and reduce service interruptions
caused by breakdowns. The average age of company tractors at year end was
19 months, and all tractors remained covered by manufacturers' warranties.
The average age of company trailers at year end was 37 months.

Competition

 The truckload industry is highly competitive and includes thousands
of carriers, none of which dominates the market. The Company competes
primarily with other truckload carriers, and to a lesser extent with
railroads, intermodal service, less-than-truckload carriers, and private
fleets operated by existing and potential customers. Although intermodal
and rail service has improved in recent years, such service has not been a
major factor in the Company's short-to-medium haul traffic lanes (600-mile
average length of haul). Historically, competition has created downward
pressure on the truckload industry's pricing structure. Management
believes that competition for the freight targeted by the Company is based
primarily upon service and efficiency and to a lesser degree upon freight
rates.

Regulation
 The Company is a common and contract motor carrier of general
commodities. Historically, the Interstate Commerce Commission (the "ICC")
and various state agencies regulated motor carriers' operating rights,
accounting systems, mergers and acquisitions, periodic financial reporting,
and other matters. In 1995 federal legislation preempted state regulation
of prices, routes, and services of motor carriers and eliminated the ICC.
Several ICC functions were transferred to the Department of Transportation
(the "DOT"). Management does not believe that regulation by the DOT or by
the states in their remaining areas of authority will have a material
effect on the Company's operations. The Company's employee and independent
contractor drivers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations
promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol
testing and hours of service.

 The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, and
local environmental laws and regulations, implemented principally by the
EPA and similar state regulatory agencies, governing the management of
hazardous wastes, other discharge of pollutants into the air and surface
and underground waters, and the disposal of certain substances. Management
believes that its operations are in material compliance with current laws
and regulations and does not know of any existing condition that would
cause compliance with applicable environmental regulations to have a
material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position. In the event the Company should fail to comply with
applicable regulations, the Company could be subject to substantial fines
or penalties and to civil or criminal liability.

ITEM 2. FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES

 Heartland's headquarters is located adjacent to Interstate 80, near
Iowa City, Iowa. The facilities include five acres of land, two office
buildings of approximately 25,000 square feet combined and a storage
building, all leased from the Company's president and principal
stockholder. Company-owned facilities at this location include three
tractor and trailer maintenance garages totaling approximately 26,500
square feet, and a safety and service complex adjacent to Heartland's
corporate offices. The adjacent facility provides the Company with six
acres of additional trailer parking space, a drive-through inspection bay,
an automatic truck wash facility, and 6,000 square feet of office space and
driver facilities. The Company also owns a motel located adjacent to its
corporate offices, which functions as a motel and driver recruiting and
driver training center.

 The Company has regional facilities in Ft. Smith, Arkansas; O'Fallon,
Missouri; Forest Park, Georgia; and Columbus, Ohio. A facility in Dubois,
Pennsylvania was closed in 1996 and is being leased to an unrelated third
party. In January 1997, the Company purchased a facility in Jacksonville,
Florida. The Company closed facilities in Woodville, Ohio and Monmouth,
Illinois during 1994 and 1995 and is attempting to dispose of such
facilities. The carrying amount of the closed facilities were reduced in
years prior to 1996 to reflect fair market value less costs to sell.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND INSURANCE

 The Company is a party to routine litigation incidental to its
business, primarily involving claims for personal injury and property
damage incurred in the transportation of freight. The Company believes
that adverse results in these cases, whether individual or in the
aggregate, would not have a material effect upon the Company's financial
position or results of operations. The Company's exposure is minimized by
setting self-insured retention levels based on historical claim experience
and through maximizing safe driving with driver hiring and training
practices. Heartland maintains insurance covering public liability,
property damage, workers compensation, cargo loss or damage, fire, general
liability and other risks, with a 500,000 self insured retention ("SIR")
for liability arising from personal injury and property damage claims. The
Company has a 300,000 SIR for workers' compensation in states where an SIR
is allowed. Liability insurance coverage has been established with
aggregate limits of 25,000,000 per occurrence. During 1994 the company
was granted self insured status by the ICC.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITIES HOLDERS

 During the fourth quarter of 1996, no matters were submitted to a vote
of securities holders.

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY
 AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

 Price Range of Common Stock

 The Company's common stock has been traded on the NASDAQ National
Market under the symbol HTLD, since November 5, 1986, the date of the
Company's initial public offering. During October 1996 the Company
effected a stock split in the form of a dividend that increased the number
of shares outstanding from 20,000,000 to 30,000,000. The following table
sets forth for the calendar period indicated the range of high and low bid
quotations for the Company's common stock as reported by NASDAQ from
January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996. All quotations have been adjusted to
give effect to the stock dividend.

Period High Low
Calendar Year 1996
1st Quarter 18.67 13.17
2nd Quarter 20.83 16.75
3rd Quarter 20.17 16.50
4th Quarter 26.50 18.17

Calendar Year 1995
1st Quarter 12.80 11.63
2nd Quarter 12.27 10.56
3rd Quarter 14.19 11.09
4th Quarter 14.00 11.52

The prices reported reflect interdealer quotations without retail
mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions, and may not represent actual
transactions. As of March 4, 1997 the Company had 267 stockholders of
record of its common stock. However, the Company estimates that it has a
significantly greater number of stockholders because a substantial number
of the Company's shares are held of record by brokers or dealers for their
customers in street names.

Dividend Policy

 The Company has never declared and paid a cash dividend. It is the
current intention of the Company's Board of Directors to retain earnings to
finance the growth of the Company's business. Future payments of cash
dividends will depend upon the financial condition, results of operations
and capital requirements of the Company, as well as other factors deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

 The selected consolidated financial data presented below reflect the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Heartland
Express, Inc., and its subsidiaries. The selected consolidated financial
data are derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements,
which have been restated for years prior to 1995 to reflect the merger of
Munson Transportation in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests. This data should be read in conjunction with "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere herein.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 1995

 Operating revenue increased 19.6 to 229.0 million in 1996 from
 191.5 million in 1995, as a result of the Company's expansion of the
customer base as well as increased volume from existing customers. 

 Salaries, wages, and benefits decreased to 40.3 million in 1996 from
 40.7 million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, salaries, wages and
benefits decreased to 17.6 in 1996 from 21.2 in 1995. A reduction in the
percentage of employee drivers operating the Company's tractor fleet and a
corresponding increase in the percentage of the fleet being provided by
independent contractors was the primary cause. During 1996, employee
drivers accounted for 40 and independent contractors 60 of the total
fleet miles, compared with 51 and 49 , respectively, in 1995. Rent and
purchased transportation increased to 94.0 million in 1996 from 64.0
million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, rent and purchased
transportation increased to 41.0 in 1996 from 33.4 in 1995. This
reflected the Company's increased reliance upon independent contractors.

 Operations and maintenance increased to 22.2 million in 1996 from
 21.0 million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, operations and
maintenance decreased to 9.7 in 1996 from 11.0 in 1995. Higher fuel
prices incurred in 1996 were offset as a result of the increase in the
percentage of the Company's fleet being operated by independent
contractors, who pay their own fuel, maintenance, and repair cost.

Taxes and licenses increased to 5.7 million in 1996 from 5.2
million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, taxes and licenses decreased
to 2.5 in 1996 from 2.7 in 1995. The cost increase was primarily
attributable to the increase in fleet size. The reduction in percentage of
revenue can be attributed to improved utilization of equipment.

 Insurance and claims increased to 10.0 million in 1996 from 8.0
million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, insurance and claims
increased to 4.4 in 1996 from 4.2 in 1995. Insurance and claims expense
will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based
on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well
as changes in claims development trends. Management believed that the
change as a percentage of revenue was insignificant.

 Communications and utilities decreased to 2.2 million in 1996 from
 2.6 in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, communications and utilities
decreased to 0.9 in 1996 from 1.3 in 1995 primarily due to the increase
in percentage of the Company's fleet being operated by independent
contractors.

 Depreciation decreased to 13.6 million in 1996 from 15.1 million in
1995. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation decreased to 5.9 in 1996
from 7.9 in 1995. The decrease resulted from the growth in the
independent contractor fleet.

 Other operating expenses increased to 4.5 million in 1996 from 3.7
million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, other operating expenses
remained unchanged from 1996 to 1995. Other operating expenses consists of
pallet cost, driver recruiting expenses and administrative costs.

 Primarily as a result of the foregoing, the Company's operating ratio
was 83.9 in 1996 compared with 83.7 in 1995.

 Interest income (net) increased to 2.8 million in 1996 from
 1.5 million in 1995. As a percentage of revenue, interest income (net)
increased to 1.2 in 1996 from 0.8 in 1995. At December 31, 1996, the
Company had repaid all debt. The Company had 91.1 million in cash, cash
equivalents, and municipal bonds at December 31, 1996.

 The Company's effective tax rate remained at 37 in 1996 and in 1995.

 As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to 25.0 million
in 1996 (10.9 of revenue) from 20.6 million in 1995 (10.7 of revenue) .

Year Ended December 31, 1995 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 1994

 Operating revenue decreased to 191.5 million in 1995 from
 224.2 million in 1994, as a result of management's decision to curtail
service for customers whose freight did not meet the Company's operating
strategy. The freight that was eliminated included refrigerated and labor
intensive loads.

 Salaries, wages, and benefits decreased to 40.7 million in 1995 from
 56.4 million in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, salaries, wages, and
benefits decreased to 21.2 in 1995 from 25.2 in 1994. A reduction in 
the percentage of employee drivers operating the Company's tractor fleet
and a corresponding increase in the percentage of the fleet being provided
by independent contractors was the primary cause. During 1995, employee
drivers accounted for 51 and independent contractors 49 of the total
fleet miles, compared with 62 and 38 , respectively, in 1994. The decrease
was also attributable to a reduction in the number of non-driver personnel
due to the consolidation of facilities and a reduction in health and
workers' compensation claims due to fewer and less severe claims. Rent and
purchased transportation increased to 64.0 million in 1995 from 57.8
million in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, rent and purchased
transportation increased to 33.4 in 1995 from 25.8 in 1994. This
reflected the Company's increased reliance upon independent contractors.

Operations and maintenance decreased to 21.0 million in 1995 from
 35.6 million in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, operations and
maintenance decreased to 11.0 in 1995 from 15.8 in 1994. Lower repair
and maintenance costs and greater fuel efficiency attributable to the
replacement of older equipment with new tractors and 53-foot aluminum plate
trailers. The decrease is also attributable to efficiencies attained from
the consolidation of maintenance facilities. These costs also decreased
with the elimination of refrigerated trailers, which cost more than dry
vans to operate, and a reduction in the use of toll highways. Such
expenses also were affected by the increase in percentage of Company's
fleet being operated by independent contractors, who pay their own
maintenance, repair and fuel costs.

 Taxes and licenses decreased to 5.2 million in 1995 from 7.3 million
in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, taxes and licenses decreased to 2.7 
in 1995 from 3.3 in 1994. A reduction in the number of miles operated in
those states with a higher tax cost structures effected this change.

 Insurance and claims decreased to 7.9 million in 1995 from 11.9
million in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, insurance and claims
decreased to 4.2 in 1995 from 5.3 in 1994. Management made a decision to
increase driver compensation to attract more experienced drivers. This
decision resulted in fewer and less severe claims. In addition,
managements decision in 1994 to cease using student drivers who typically
experience a higher accident frequency, was effective for the entire year
in 1995.

 Communications and utilities remained essentially constant at 2.6
million in 1994 and 1995. As a percentage of revenue, communications and
utilities increased to 1.3 in 1995 from 1.2 in 1994. The Company
completed the process of equipping its Company owned fleet with
satellite-based tracking and communications systems in 1995.

 Depreciation decreased to 15.1 million in 1995 from 20.1 million in
1994. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation decreased to 7.9 in 1995
from 8.9 in 1994. These results were from a decreasing percentage of
Company tractors in the fleet in favor of tractors owned by independent
contractors.

 Other operating expenses decreased to 3.7 million in 1995 from 5.5
million in 1994. As a percentage of revenue, other operating expenses
decreased to 2.0 in 1995 from 2.4 in 1994, due to efficiencies gained
from the consolidation of operations and decreased service to selected
customers that required the use of palleted freight.

 Primarily as a result of the foregoing, the Company's operating ratio
improved to 83.7 in 1995 from 89.4 in 1994 (87.8 excluding merger and
integration costs).

 Interest income (net) was 1.5 million in 1995 compared with interest
expense (net) of 1.9 million in 1994. At December 31, 1995, the Company
had repaid all long-term debt with the exception of approximately 700,000
in capitalized leases which expire in 1996 and carry prepayment penalties.
Such long-term debt was offset by 50.7 million in cash, cash equivalents,
and municipal bonds at December 31, 1995.

 The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 37 in 1995 from 54 in
1994. This decrease was primarily attributable to the merger with Munson
Transportation in 1994. In 1994 the Company recorded a 2.9 million
deferred tax charge (because Munson was an "S" corporation and did not have
to record deferred taxes), as well as losses attributable to Munson
Transportation prior to the merger on March 21, 1994, and 2.0 million in
merger costs that were not deductible.

 As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to 20.6 million
in 1995 (10.7 of revenue) from 10.1 million in 1994 (4.5 of revenue).

Forward Looking Information

 Certain matters discussed in this annual report and marked with an
asterisk are "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe
harbors from liability established by Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such statements address future plans, objectives,
expectations and events or conditions concerning various matters such as
capital expenditures, litigation, liquidity and capital resources, and
accounting matters. Actual results in each case could differ materially
from those currently anticipated in such statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The growth of the Company's business requires significant investments
in new revenue equipment. Historically the Company has been debt-free,
financing revenue equipment through cash flow from operations. The Company
also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors, who
provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses.

 Cash and cash equivalents and municipal notes increased to 91.1
million as of December 31, 1996 from 50.7 million at December 31, 1995.
The Company's policy is to purchase only investment quality highly liquid
investments.

 Net cash provided by operations was 48.3 million in 1996,
 38.1 million in 1995, and 42.6 million in 1994. The primary source of
funds in 1996 was net income of 25.0 million increased by non-cash
adjustments including depreciation of 14.0 million.

 Net cash used in investment and financing activities was 34.9 million
in 1996, 1.9 million in 1995, and 42.0 million in 1994. Such amounts were
used primarily to purchase municipal bonds, revenue equipment, and to pay
off long term debt. The Company expects to finance future growth in its
company-owned fleet primarily through cash flow from operations and cash
equivalents currently on hand.( 
 Trade receivables decreased to 15.7 million as of December 31, 1996
from 18.0 million as of December 31, 1995 primarily due to management's 
increased emphasis and effectiveness in collecting outstanding balances. 
Cash paid for income taxes increased to 15.3 million in 1996 from 12.4
million in 1995. Higher income taxes on a cash basis are primarily due to
increased income and non-deductible insurance accruals.

 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to 11.4 million
as of December 31, 1996 from 7.4 million as of December 31, 1995 due
mostly to an increase in payables due to revenue equipment suppliers which
was paid in early 1997. Insurance accruals increased to 30.1 million as
of December 31, 1996 from 26.7 million as of December 31, 1995 due to the
significant increase of the Company's fleet in recent years. The Company's
insurance program for liability, physical damage and cargo damage involves
self insurance retentions for the first 500,000. Claims in excess of the
risk retention are covered by insurance in amounts which management
considers adequate. The Company accrues the estimated cost of the
uninsured portion of the pending claims. These accruals are estimated
based on management's evaluation of the nature and severity of individual 
claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical
claim development trends. If adjustments to previously established accruals
are required, such amounts are included in operating expenses. In 1996 and
1995, such adjustments were not significant. In 1994, following the
consummation of the Munson merger certain claims were increased to conform
Munson's outstanding claims to practices utilized by the Company.

 The Company has one customer who accounted for greater than 10 of
the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 1996. As disclosed in
footnote three to the financial statements, historically a small number of
customers generate a substantial percentage of revenue. In 1996 the
Company's largest customer generated approximately 15 of operating
revenue. The loss of a major customer could negatively impact the Company. 
Any negative impact would be mitigated by two factors: (1) the strong
overall financial position of the Company (no long term debt at December
31, 1996 and 91.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and municipal notes)
and (2) the flexibility inherent in having a substantial percentage of
fleet miles being generated by independent contractors who provide their
own tractors.( 
Accounting Pronouncement

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard no. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets" in 1995. This pronouncement outlines criteria for evaluating
long-lived assets when certain conditions occur that may indicate an
impairment problem. Adoption of this new standard in 1996 did not impact
the Company.
 ) Forward - looking statements

Effective January 1, 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement
of Position (SOP) 96-1; Environmental Remediation Liabilities. This
Statement provides authoritative guidance for recognition, measurement,
display and disclosure of environmental remediation liabilities in
financial statements. Based upon current facts and circumstances, SOP 96-1
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position or results of operations as of the date of adoption.( 
Inflation

 Inflation can be expected to have an impact on the Company's operating
costs. The effect of inflation has not been significant over approximately
the last ten years. However, a prolonged period of inflation would
adversely affect the Company's results of operations unless freight rates
could be increased proportionately.

Seasonality

 The nature of the Company's primary traffic (appliances, automotive
parts, paper products, electrical equipment, and packaged foodstuffs)
causes it to be distributed with relative uniformity throughout the year.
However, earnings have historically been affected adversely during the
fourth quarter as a result of reduced shipments by customers during the
winter holiday season. In addition, the Company's operating expenses
historically have been higher during the winter months due to increased
operating costs in colder weather and higher fuel consumption due to
increased engine idling.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
 PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Heartland Express, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Heartland Express, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Heartland Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

 Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
basic financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule II is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and is not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Business And Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Heartland Express, Inc., (the "Company") is a short-to-medium-haul,
irregular
route, truckload carrier of general commodities. The Company's primary
traffic lanes are between customer locations east of the Rocky Mountains,
with selected service to the West.

Significant Accounting Policies:

Principles of Consolidation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the parent
company, Heartland Express, Inc., and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly owned. All material intercompany items and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents consists of municipal
demand bonds, funds and trusts investing in those notes and auction
preferred stocks.

Municipal Bonds:

Municipal bonds are stated at amortized cost which approximates market
primarily because the bonds mature in one year or less. Historically, the
Company has held these investments to maturity.

Revenue and Expense Recognition:

Operating revenues are recognized on the date the freight is delivered and
expenses are recognized as incurred.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment are stated at cost. At the time of trade-in, the
cost of new equipment is recorded at an amount equal to the net book value
of the traded equipment plus cash paid. Depreciation is computed by the
straight-line method for all assets other than tractors, which are
depreciated by the 125 declining balance method. Trailers are
depreciated to a 30 salvage value except for trailers purchased after
January 1, 1996 which have no salvage value. Lives of the assets are as
follows:

Years
 Land improvements and building 3-30
 Furniture and fixtures 2-3
 Shop and service equipment 3-5
 Revenue equipment 5-7

Assets to be disposed of are measured at the lower of carrying amount or
fair market value, as estimated by management, less costs to sell.

HEARTLAND EXPRESS, INC.
 AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Tires and Tubes:

The cost of tires and tubes on new revenue equipment is carried as a
prepayment and amortized over the estimated tire life of two years. 
Replacement tires (including recapped tires) are expensed when purchased. 

Earnings Per Common Share:

Earnings per share is determined using the weighted average shares
outstanding for each period presented. Earnings per share were restated
for the stock splits and due to the merger with Munson Transportation
(Note2).

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year consolidated
financial statements to conform with the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Note 2. Heartland/Munson Merger

Effective March 21, 1994, Heartland consummated a merger with Munson
Transportation, Inc., and two affiliated companies (collectively referred
to as "Munson"). Prior to the merger, Munson had been a truckload carrier
offering service primarily in the Midwest and Northeast states. Pursuant
to the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
dated February 18, 1994, Heartland issued 1,133,150 shares of its common
stock in exchange for all of the stock of Munson. The transaction costs
associated with the merger (consisting primarily of legal and accounting
fees) and the expenses of integrating the operations of the two companies
(consisting primarily of changes in reserve estimates for liability and
workers' compensation claims and other combination costs) resulted in
nonrecurring charge of 1,978,600 which was recorded in the first quarter
of 1994. During the fourth quarter of 1994, management decided to
consolidate certain duplicate activities. As a result of this decision,
the headquarters facility used by Munson in Monmouth, Illinois was closed.
The transaction costs associated with the elimination of this duplicate
facility (consisting primarily of a write down of the facility and
severance pay for the terminated employees) resulted in a nonrecurring
charge of 1,515,774 which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994.

The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively
restated for all periods presented to include the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of the merged entities.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 3. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers

The Company's major customers represent the consumer appliances, food
products and automotive industries. Credit is usually granted to customers
on an unsecured basis. The Company's five largest customers accounted for
44 , 48 , and 43 of revenues for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995,
and 1994, respectively. Operating revenue from customers with revenue
exceeding 10 of total gross revenues in 1994, 1995 or 1996 approximated:

CUSTOMER 1996 1995 1994
1 35,000,000 28,000,000 34,000,000
2 17,000,000 17,000,000 23,000,000
3 22,000,000 21,000,000 14,000,000

Note 4. Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are determined based upon the differences between the
financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. 
Deferred taxes are provided at the enacted tax rates to be in effect when
the differences reverse.

Prior to the merger with Heartland, Munson had been an " S" corporation. "
S" corporations do not typically record income tax liabilities since these
generally represent personal obligations of the stockholders. The change
in Munson's tax status, which resulted from the merger, required a deferred
income tax obligation of 2,925,600 to be recorded in the first quarter of
1994. 

The pro forma income tax expense (unaudited) presented on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations reflects the estimated amount of
income tax that would have been recorded if Heartland and Munson had been
combined for the entire year ended December 31, 1994.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:

 1996 1995
Deferred income tax liabilities, related to
property and equipment 16,266,000 17,393,000

The Company leases two office buildings and a storage building from its
president under a lease which provides for monthly rentals of 23,500 plus
the payment of all property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The lease
expires May 31, 2000 and contains a five year renewal option.

The total minimum rental commitment under the building lease is as follows:

HEARTLAND EXPRESS, INC.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Rent expense to the Company's president totaled 282,000, 239,500, and
 180,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994,
respectively. Rentals paid were increased in June, 1995 as a result of
additional buildings being added to the lease agreement. The amended lease
was on a month-to-month basis from June to December 1995, when the new
lease was signed. The Company also maintains cash accounts with a bank
owned by the Company's president. The Company sold a subsidiary to a
stockholder and former director for 150,000, which approximated book
value, in 1996. The Company also paid this shareholder 242,000 in
connection with the settlement of an employment agreement and the
shareholder repaid the Company 340,000, plus accrued interest, in 1996.

Note 6. Accident and Workers' Compensation Claims

Accident and workers' compensation claims include the estimated
settlements, settlement expenses and an allowance for claims incurred but
not yet reported for property damage, personal injury and public liability
losses from vehicle accidents and cargo losses as well as workers'
compensation claims for amounts not covered by insurance.

Accrued claims are determined based on estimates of the ultimate cost of
settling reported and unreported claims, including expected settlement
expenses. Such estimates are based on management's evaluation of the
nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims
development based on historical claims development trends. Since the
reported liability is an estimate, the ultimate liability may be more or
less than reported. If adjustments to previously established accruals are
required, such amounts are included in operating expenses. In 1996 and
1995, such adjustments were not significant. In 1994, following the
consummation of the Munson merger certain claims were increased to conform
Munson's outstanding claims to practices utilized by the Company.

The Company acts as a self-insurer for liability up to 500,000 for any
single occurrence involving cargo, personal injury or property damage. 
Liability in excess of this amount is assumed by the underwriter.

The Company acts as a self-insurer for workers' compensation liability up
to a maximum liability of 300,000 per claim. Liability in excess of this
amount is assumed by the underwriter. The State of Iowa has required the
Company to deposit 700,000 into a trust fund as part of the self-insurance
program. This deposit has been classified with other long-term assets on
the balance sheet. In addition, the Company has provided its insurance
carriers with letters of credit for approximately 7.8 million in
connection with its liability and workers' compensation insurance
arrangements.

Note 7. Stockholders' Equity

On September 12, 1996 the Company's Board of Directors approved a 1.5 for
1.0 split of the Company's common stock effected in the form of a 50 stock
dividend for stockholders of record as of September 23, 1996. A total of
10,000,000 common shares were issued. On October 26, 1995, the Company's
Board of Directors approved a 1.54 for 1.0 split of the Company's common
stock effected in the form of a 54 stock dividend for stockholders of
record as of November 20, 1995. A total of 7,009,540 common shares were
issued. The stated par value of each share was not changed from .10. All
share and per share amounts, and capital accounts, have been restated to
retroactively reflect the stock splits.

Note 8. Profit Sharing Plan and Retirement Plan

The Company has a profit sharing plan with 401(k) plan features whereby the
Company may make contributions to the plan at its discretion. Individual
employees may make voluntary contributions to the plan. Company
contributions totaled 529,000, 434,000 and 512,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The Munson Transportation
defined contribution retirement plan was terminated in December 1994.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 9. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt and capital lease obligations at December 31, 1995 consisted
of capital lease obligations of 705,437 on revenue equipment, discounted
at rates of 7.9 to 13.2 , due in monthly installments through September
1996. The face value of long term debt was not materially different than
the fair market value of the debt at December 31, 1995. The Company has no
long-term debt and capital lease obligations at December 31, 1996.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

Various claims and legal actions are pending against the Company. In
