NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY

The Company has been inactive since April 2, 1968 when it was discharged from
bankruptcy under its previous name of Sportways, Inc. The expenses the Company
has incurred represent those necessary to keep the Company in good standing in
its state of residence.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of the Company's financial
instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The
amounts shown as notes payable also approximate fair value because current
interest rates offered to the Company for notes payable of similar maturities
are substantially the same.

Estimates

In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2 - LOSS PER SHARE

All per share computations are based on 449,991 shares outstanding. There are no
common stock equivalents.
