 BUSINESS DISCLOSURE
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This
annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 target, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only
predictions and speak only as of their dates. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified under Exhibit 99.1 of this annual report
and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In addition, important factors to consider in evaluating these forward-looking
statements include possible international conflicts, changes in general economic and external market factors, changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally,
the emergence of new or growing competitors and various other competitive factors. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report
will in fact occur. Industry ChipPAC is one of the world s largest independent
providers of semiconductor packaging, test, and distribution services. We offer one of the broadest portfolios of packages and test services for integrated circuits. We supply packaging solutions to some of the leading semiconductor companies
servicing the computing, communications, consumer, automotive and industrial end markets. We are a leader in providing high end packaging solutions, including ball grid array packages, or BGA packages, and chip scale packages, or CSP packages, the
most advanced types of mass produced packages. In addition to providing assembly and test services on a global basis, we are the largest independent semiconductor packaging and test service provider in mainland China. As consumers demand smaller
electronic devices with more functionality, there is a greater requirement for power regulation and generation, which we expect to drive demand for our power packages. We are a leader in high-volume assembly, test and distribution of discrete and
analog power packages. We are also one of the leading providers of advanced packaging products that address the needs of semiconductors used in wireless LAN and handset applications, including chip-scale, stacked die and flip-chip technologies.
 Our online design and characterization process,
referred to as SmartDESIGN , is a proprietary web-based design collaboration system that we believe provides a
higher rate of product qualification, improved technical performance and shorter time-to-market service for our customers. This system enables us to link to our customers via the Internet to aid with the performance of package design, electrical,
thermal and mechanical analysis and to model end system performance. Outsourcing of packaging and test services to independent packagers like ChipPAC continues to expand due to several factors, including time-to-market pressures, cost reduction, resource allocation, equipment utilization, the
increased technological complexity of packaging and the growth of fabless semiconductor manufacturers. Historically, outsourced semiconductor manufacturing services have grown faster than the semiconductor market as a whole. Management believes that
the lack of investments in assembly and test capacity by semiconductor manufacturers over the past two years will position outsource providers well to capture enhanced volume levels. The packaging and test industry is highly fragmented as we compete
against a number of established independent packaging houses as well as the internal capabilities of many of our largest customers. The semiconductor industry has historically experienced volatility with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. These downturns have been
characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices. The semiconductor industry is presently recovering from a downturn, and we expect conditions to continue to
improve in 2003. Our headquarters are located in
Fremont, California, and our manufacturing facilities are strategically located in China, Malaysia and South Korea, to address the global needs of our customers. We have design personnel co-located at customer sites, as well as design centers
located in Arizona, Malaysia and South Korea to provide 24-hour design support to our customers.

 We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the following factors:

High End Technology Expertise We are one of the world s largest providers of outsourced substrate based packages, which accounted for approximately 60.3 
and 53.4 of our packaging revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our substrate based packages are used for most high-end applications such as computing, wireline and wireless communications devices, gaming, and stacked
die packages for portal applications. Our advanced package portfolio also includes next generation flip-chip technology for system on a chip, or SOC, which is used in network servers and telecom switching devices, as well as single and multi-die CSP
packaging for digital signal processors, or DSPs, and other chipsets for wireless handset, wireless LAN, and other portable handheld equipment such as PDAs. In addition, we have critical expertise for testing radio frequency, or RF, devices. We
believe that our advanced technology expertise and our commitment to research and development will enable us to continue to drive the development of solutions for next generation semiconductor packages. 

Leader in Growing Power Discrete, Power Management and Analog Segment We are a leader in high-volume semiconductor assembly and test services for discrete,
analog, RF and mixed-signal technologies, for small signal and power applications. Power products manage the electricity requirements for multiple components, ensuring an accurate and efficient flow of voltage so electronic devices run longer and
more efficiently. These products are used to switch or manage the electrical current requirements within electronic systems, ensuring an accurate and efficient flow of electricity. As electronics become increasingly more complex, portable and
performance-driven, the demand for power regulation and management increases significantly. A broad and fast-growing range of end markets, including portable devices, household appliances, computers, automotive systems and telecommunications, will
continue to drive power semiconductor usage and the demand for our power products. 

Strategic Geographic Diversification We are strategically located to take advantage of industry outsourcing trends. In-Stat predicts that within the next nine
years, China will be the second largest market in the world for semiconductors. Our Shanghai, China facility, which was established in 1994, is the largest packaging and test provider in China, and we are the first independent provider of chip-scale
BGA packages in that country. We provide local content for products sold into the Chinese market, including cellular telephones and portable devices where local content requirements are being driven by the Chinese government. Our high-volume
packaging site for advanced BGA packages is in Ichon, South Korea, which is significant for its proximity to large semiconductor customers and to an available pool of highly-skilled research and development and technical staff. Our Malaysian
facility in Kuala Lumpur positions us to benefit from the growth in fabless manufacturing taking place in Southeast Asia. Our headquarters in Silicon Valley and state-of-the-art research and development facilities in Arizona and South Korea are
located near our customers and provide us with the ability to work on a 24-hour-basis with our customers in the design process and in supply chain management. 

New and Diversifying Customer Base In 2002, we continued to diversify and broaden our customer base to over 80 customers worldwide. Our customers comprise some
of the largest companies in the semiconductor industry. Our largest customer accounted for 16.6 of our total sales in 2002, down from 20.2 of total sales in 2001, and was 13.2 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. 

Among the Leaders in Growing Test Services Through our long-term partnerships and existing customer base, we are well positioned to capitalize on the rapid
growth of outsourced testing by semiconductor producers. This growth in outsourced testing is driven by the increasing demand for RF, mixed-signal and high performance logic devices that require greater capital expenditures on testing equipment. We
have made significant capital expenditures on testing equipment that provides us with the capability to test mixed-signal, digital logic, memory, power and RF devices. By increasing our emphasis on our test business and adding capacity, we have
significantly increased our test revenue over the past several years, and we expect this growth to continue. Our test business revenue grew to 56.2 million in 2002, an increase of 10.7 million from 45.5 million in 2001.
 Our Services We offer semiconductor packaging and test services to the
semiconductor industry for applications in communications, computing, consumer, automotive and industrial end markets. Approximately 84.5 and 86.2 of our revenue were derived from packaging services during the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001 respectively. Approximately 15.5 and 13.8 of our revenue were derived from test and other services during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

 Since
customers require their suppliers to pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that can be costly to the customers, we believe they generally do business with a few suppliers. As our services are considered part of the customer s
manufacturing infrastructure, we must have dedicated resources and systems to provide flexible manufacturing, quick-turns and real-time information transfers. Packaging We have provided semiconductor packaging and test services since 1984, and offer a broad range of packaging formats for a wide variety of
electronics applications. Our two main types of packaging services, leadframe and substrate, contributed approximately 33.6 and 50.9 , respectively, of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Leaded Packaging Leaded or Lead frame packaging is the
most widely used packaging type and is used in almost every electronic application, including automobiles, household appliances, desktop and notebook computers and telecommunications. Leaded packages have been in existence since semiconductors were
first produced. According to Electronic Trends Publication, Leaded devices continue to account for approximately half of the total industry packaging volume. Leaded packages are characterized by a semiconductor die encapsulated in a plastic mold
compound with metal leads surrounding the perimeter of the package. With leaded packages, the die is attached to a leadframe (a flat lattice of leads) and very small gold wires are bonded (welded) to the chip and then welded to the leads to provide
the interconnect. The chip is then encapsulated in plastic to form a package, with the ends of the leadframe leads protruding from the edges of the package to enable connection to a printed circuit board. This packaging type has evolved from
packages designed to be plugged into a printed circuit board by inserting the leads into holes on the printed circuit board to the more modern surface-mount design, in which the leads or pins are soldered to the surface of the printed circuit board.
Specific packaging customization and improvements are continually being engineered to improve electrical and thermal performance, shrink package sizes and enable multi-chip capability. We offer a wide range of lead counts and body sizes within this packaging group to satisfy customer die
design variations. Our traditional leaded packages are at least two millimeters in thickness and include PDIP, PLCC, and SOIC. Our advanced leaded packages are thinner than our traditional leaded packages, approximately 2 millimeters in thickness or
less, and generally have a finer pitch lead spacing, allowing for a higher pin count and greater functionality in a smaller package foot print. Our advanced leaded packages include MQFP, TQFP, iQUAD , TSSOP and SSOP. Our acquisition of the Malaysian business in 2000 added power packages to our portfolio. Power Packaging Power semiconductors are used in a variety of end-markets,
including telecommunications and networking systems, computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics, electronic office equipment, automotive systems and industrial products. These end markets increasingly depend upon power regulation and
control in the trend toward smaller devices and longer operating times. Packaging manufacturers are left to contend with shrinking chip geometries owing to continued emphasis upon greater mobility and portability. Power semiconductors typically
involve higher current and voltage levels than memory, logic and microprocessor devices. The high current involved with switching on/off high voltages and the phase control of AC signals results in considerable power dissipated internally that
produces heat. Thus our power packages are designed in such a way as to conduct the resultant heat away from the chip as power is dissipated, preventing the power device from being destroyed. Power package assembly is somewhat different from non-power IC
assembly as it often employs special solder alloys requiring different semiconductor bonding machines. Higher current levels of power semiconductors likewise require larger diameter aluminum and gold wire than non-power IC s to carry the load.
Our Malaysian facility maintains a vast array of these special machines needed for power semiconductor assembly and test. With a capacity of over 25.0 million units per week, we believe we are the industry leader in power package assembly supporting
a number of the world s major power semiconductor manufacturers, whose products are designed and used in power supplies, battery chargers, ignition modules, voltage regulators, motor controllers, ignition controllers and power management
devices. Substrate Packaging
 Substrate packaging represents one of
the fastest growing areas in the packaging industry and is used primarily in computing platforms, networking, hand held consumer products, wireless communications devices, personal digital assistants, video cameras, home electronic devices such as
DVDs and home video game machines. BGA technology was first introduced as a solution to problems associated with the increasingly high lead counts required for advanced semiconductors. As the number of leads surrounding the integrated circuit
increased, high lead count packages experienced significant electrical shorting problems. The BGA methodology solved this problem by effectively creating leads on the bottom surface of the package in the form of 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 small bumps or solder balls. In a typical BGA package, the semiconductor die is placed on top of a plastic
or tape laminate substrate rather than a lead frame. The die is connected to the circuitry in the substrate by a series of fine gold wires that are bonded to the top of the substrate near its edges. On the bottom of the substrate is a grid of metal
balls that connect the packaged device to a printed circuit board. Benefits of BGA packaging over leaded packaging include: 

smaller size; 

greater pin count, or number of connections to the printed circuit board; 

greater reliability; 

better electrical signal integrity; and higher power dissipation 

easier attachment to a printed circuit board. We supply our customers with substantially the entire family of BGA packaging services offered in the marketplace today, including:

Standard BGA. Standard BGA packaging has a grid array of balls on the underside of the integrated circuit, and is used in high-performance applications, like
personal computer chipsets, graphic controllers and DSPs. A standard BGA package generally has greater than 100 pins. Standard BGA packages have better thermal and electrical performance than leaded packages. They also feature more advanced surface
mount technology, allowing for easier handling in the packaging process. Standard BGA packaging services accounted for 52.2 and 64.4 of our Substrate packaging revenue in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Chip-Scale. Chip-scale BGA, LFCSP, and BCC packaging includes all packages where the package is less than 1.2 times the size of the silicon die. Chip-scale BGA is a
substrate-based package that is designed for memory devices and other medium pin count semiconductors and requires dense ball arrays in very small package sizes, like wireless telephones and personal digital assistants, video cameras, digital
cameras and pagers. We also include LFCSP and BCC packages in this category. While they use a metal lattice instead of a laminate substrate, they are a chip-scale package serving these markets. 

System-in-Package. System-in-Package, or SiP, is a family of chip-scale-packages that contain several (1-4) semiconductor die in one package, either stacked on top
of each other or side by side. This technology allows greater functionality in the same package footprint and thickness without significant cost increase. These packages are used in wireless handsets, consumer products and mobile computing
applications. 

Flip-chip BGA. Flip-chip BGA packaging in which the silicon die is directly attached to the substrate using gold bumps instead of solder balls provides the most
dense interconnect at the lowest cost and highest performance. Flip-chip BGA technology is used in a wide array of applications ranging from consumer products to highly sophisticated application specific integrated circuits, referred to as ASIC,
computer chipsets, graphics and memory packages. While we believe that flip-chip BGA represents the next generation of BGA packaging technology, we believe that standard BGA and chip-scale BGA packaging will experience long life cycles as have many
of our leaded packaging solutions.

 Test Services
 We also provide our customers with
semiconductor test services for a number of device types, including mixed-signal, digital logic, memory, power and RF devices. Semiconductor testing measures and ensures the performance, functionality and reliability of a packaged device, and
requires knowledge of the specific applications and functions of the devices being tested. In order to enable semiconductor companies to improve their time-to-market, streamline their operations and reduce costs, there has been an increasing trend
toward outsourcing both packaging and test services. We have capitalized on this trend by enhancing our test service capabilities. Our test revenue increased 23.5 from 2001 to 2002. Our test revenue was essentially flat in 2001 compared to 2000 in
a year where overall sales in the industry were significantly down compared to the prior year. The acquisition of the Malaysian business expanded our mixed-signal tester base and provided us with critical expertise for testing RF devices, one of the
fastest growth areas for test outsourcing. We have also noted an increased demand from our customers to provide both assembly and test services on a full turn-key basis. In order to test the capability of a semiconductor device, a semiconductor company will provide us with its
proprietary test program and specify the test equipment to run that program. Alternatively, our customers at times may consign their test equipment to us. The devices to be tested are placed into a socket-custom load board by an automated handling
system, which is connected to the test equipment, which then tests the devices using software programs developed and supplied by our customers. The cost of any specific test and the time required to conduct it, ranging from a few milliseconds to
several seconds, varies depending on the complexity of the semiconductor device and the customer s test program.

 Other Services
 We also provide a full range of other
value-added services, including: 

Design and Characterization Services. We offer design and characterization services at our Arizona, South Korea, Malaysia and China facilities. Our design engineers
at these facilities select, design and develop the appropriate package, leadframe or substrate for that device by simulating the semiconductor s performance and end-use environment. 

Dry Pack Services. In order to prevent the failure of any semiconductors due to exposure to moisture during shipping, we dry pack many of our packaged
integrated circuits in specially sealed, environmentally secure containers. 

Tape and Reel Services. Many electronic assembly lines utilize tape and reel methods in which semiconductors are placed into a pocket tape to enable
faster attachment to the printed circuit board. We offer a service in which we ship packaged and tested devices on a tape and reel mechanism rather than in a tray, to facilitate the assembly process. 

Warehousing and Drop Shipment. In order to enable semiconductor companies to improve their time-to-market and reduce supply chain and handling costs, we offer
warehousing and drop shipment services in which we ship packaged semiconductor devices directly to our customers customers. 

Wafer Probe. We offer a wafer sort operation where an electrical test is performed on the die while still in wafer form. This process establishes which die on each
wafer are suitable to be assembled into a final package. Customers In 2002, we
continued to diversify and broaden our customer base to over 80 customers worldwide. Our customers are comprised of companies in the semiconductor industry located primarily in the United States of America. Our customers include some of the largest
semiconductor companies in the world. There were five customers in 2002 and three customers in 2001 that each accounted for more than 10 of our total sales. These customers include Atmel, Fairchild, Intel, Intersil, LSI Logic and nVIDIA. Our
largest single customer accounted for 16.6 and 20.2 of our total sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We anticipate that this customer concentration will decrease as we add new customers for which we have already become qualified and customers
with which we are currently undergoing qualification. Our customers are located around the world, but principally in the United States of America. We report geographic distribution of revenue based on the location of our customers headquarters. The following table details the
percentage of total revenue we received from the United States, Asia and Europe:

In
general, our customers rely on at least two sources for packaging. A packaging and test service company must pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that typically takes three to six months, and typically costs the customer 250,000 to
 300,000. Once a primary packager has been selected, that packager gains insight into its customer s business operations and an understanding of its products as part of the overall working relationship. These factors, combined with the
pressures of a semiconductor company to meet the time-to-market demands of its customers, result in high switching costs for semiconductor companies, making them adverse to changing or adding additional suppliers. We have been successful in
attracting new customers because we are one of a few independent packaging and test companies that offers packaging, test and distribution services for a full portfolio of packages. Also, new customers are drawn to our unique advanced technologies.

specific customer or geographic region. Customers deliver rolling six month forecasts and release production die to us in daily or weekly increments for packaging, test and distribution. These near-term forecasts guide us as to anticipated volumes, but provide no
meaningful backlog statistics. Substantially all of our materials inventory is purchased based on customer forecasts. We carry small quantities of inventory and we have relatively low levels of finished goods inventory. Our marketing efforts focus on creating a brand awareness and
familiarity with our advanced device packaging technologies and an understanding of our end-user market applications in wireless handset and PDA graphics, PC chipsets, wireless LAN, memory, storage and networking. We market our leadership in
advanced packaging, test technology, and distribution and our ability to supply a broad line of packaging and test services to the semiconductor industry. We target engineers and executive level decision makers through a direct sales force, the
delivery of white papers at industry conferences, mailings of technical brochures and newsletters, advertisements in trade journals and our website.

 Suppliers Our packaging operations depend upon obtaining adequate
supplies of materials on a timely basis. The principal materials used in our packaging process are lead frames, rigid and flexible substrates, gold wire and molding compound. We purchase materials based on the demand forecasts of our customers. Our
customers are responsible for the costs of any unique materials that we purchase but do not use, particularly those lead frames and substrates that are ordered on the basis of customer-supplied forecasts. We work closely with our primary materials
suppliers to ensure the timely availability of materials supplies, and we are not dependent on any one supplier for a substantial portion of our materials requirements. We had no significant long-term agreements with materials suppliers in 2002. The
materials we procure are normally available and we are able to meet our production requirements from multiple sources through periodic negotiation and placement of written purchase orders. We typically combine our global requirements into centrally
negotiated blanket purchase orders to gain economies of scale in procurement and more significant volume discounts. Should material become scarce, we would look to enter into long-term supply agreements with key suppliers. Approximately 79.0 and
82.0 of our substrate costs in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were incurred from the purchase of materials from South Korea, with the balance coming primarily from Japan and Taiwan. We expect that in the next several
years, an increasing portion of our materials will be supplied from sources in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Our packaging operations and expansion plans also depend on obtaining adequate quantities of equipment on a timely basis. To that end, we
work closely with our major equipment suppliers to insure that equipment deliveries are on time and the equipment meets our stringent performance specifications. Intellectual Property Our ability to develop and provide advanced packaging technologies and designs for our customers depends in part on our proprietary
know-how, trade secrets and other patented and non-patented, confidential technologies, which we either own or license from third parties. We have licenses to use numerous third party patents, patent applications and other technology rights, as well
as trademark rights, in the operation of our business. We believe that these licenses are renewable under normal commercial terms once they expire. Our primary registered trademark and trade name is ChipPAC . We own or are licensed to use other secondary trademarks. Research and Development Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new packages, design, assembly and test technologies and on improving the
efficiency and capabilities of our existing packaging and test services. Technology development is a basic competence of ChipPAC and a key competitive factor in the packaging industry. We have invested considerable resources and we are among the
leaders in new product and technology development. Our web based proprietary design and performance characterization, SmartDESIGN 
 capability, provides the shortest time-to-market with predictable performance. During the past two years, we have introduced the following new package families: 

M 2 CSP 
 
 Molded multi-die chip scale package family with the following chip-stack combinations in 
package profile thickness ranging from 1.0 to 1.4mm:

 We have
established four design centers where new packages are designed and fully characterized for performance and tested both for package and system level reliability to meet end customer needs. During 2002 and 2001, we spent approximately 10.1 million and 14.2 million, respectively, on research and
development. The reduction in spending in 2002 is due to the timing of projects. Employee headcount in research and development went up by 9.2 in 2002, compared to 2001. Competition The packaging and test industry is highly fragmented. Our primary competitors and their primary locations are as follows: 

Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. Taiwan 

Amkor Technology, Inc. South Korea, Japan and the Philippines 

ASE Test Limited South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia 

Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. Taiwan Each of these companies has significant packaging capacity, financial resources, research and development operations, marketing and other
capabilities, and has some degree of operating experience. These companies also have established relationships with many large semiconductor companies, which are current or potential customers of ours. We also compete with the internal packaging and
testing capabilities of many of our largest customers. We believe the principal elements of competition in the independent semiconductor packaging market include time-to-market, breadth of packaging services, technical competence, design services,
quality, yield, customer service and price. We believe that we compete favorably in these areas. In general, our customers principally rely on at least two independent packagers. A packaging company must pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that can take a minimum of three months for
a typical leaded package and can take more than six months for a typical BGA package. Once a primary packager has been selected, that packager gains insight into its customer s business operations and an understanding of its products as part of
the overall working relationship. These factors, combined with the pressures of a semiconductor company to meet the time-to-market demands of its customers, result in high switching costs for semiconductor companies, making them adverse to changing
or adding additional suppliers. We have been successful in attracting new customers because we are one of a few independent packaging and test companies that offers packaging, test and distribution services for a full portfolio of packages.
 Employees As of December 31, 2002, we employed 5,845 full-time
employees, of whom approximately 119 were employed in research and development, 5,395 in packaging and test services and 331 in marketing, sales, customer service and administration. Approximately 1,215 of our employees at the Ichon, South Korea facility are represented by ChipPAC Korea
Labor Union and are covered by collective bargaining and wage agreements. The collective bargaining agreement, which covers basic union activities, working conditions and welfare programs, among other things and the wage agreement are both effective
to May 1, 2003. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. SEC Reports Our
annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are available for review free of charge on our website at
 www.chippac.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished to the Commission. ITEM 2.

 ITEM 7. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers in part periods prior to our initial
public offering in August 2000. As a result of the initial public offering, we significantly changed our capitalization. Accordingly, the results of operations for periods subsequent to the initial public offering are not necessarily comparable to
prior periods. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report. Overview In 1997, we were incorporated as a distinct entity and established as the parent of a stand-alone worldwide business. Prior to this time,
we operated as a separate division of Hyundai Electronics, now Hynix Semiconductor, one of the world s largest semiconductor manufacturers and a member of the Hyundai Group, the South Korean conglomerate. In 1999, as part of a recapitalization,
a group of equity investors along with management obtained control of ChipPAC. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization. Our revenue consists of fees charged to our customers for packaging, testing, and distribution of their integrated circuits. From 1996 to
2002, revenue increased from 179.2 million to 363.7 million, a cumulative annual growth rate of 12.5 , primarily from the growth of substrate or BGA packaging, the growth of test revenue and the acquisition of our Malaysian business in 2000. The
semiconductor industry is inherently volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling
prices. The semiconductor industry is presently recovering from the worst downturn in its history. Due to the severity of this downturn for the semiconductor industry and for our customers, we experienced the first decline in revenue on a
year-over-year basis in our history in 2001. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased to 363.7 million or by 10.6 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Our continuing growth will depend upon factors influenced by current
economic conditions such as replenishment of inventory in the electronics supply chain, gradual recovery in our end markets and the ramp-up of new customers acquired in 2002. We are positioned in the fastest growth markets. We have re-engineered our
business models over the last two years to focus on products and customers in the fastest growth segments of the industry such as chips for use in wireless, broadband, consumer and automotive products. However, we are still solidly positioned in the
computing and industrial markets, which will benefit from an overall economic recovery when it occurs. Management is continually re-evaluating estimates and the expectations above could and probably will change as the year unfolds.

revenue by product group and test services, as a percentage of total revenue:

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Revenue . Revenue was 363.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 10.6 from the year ended
December 31, 2001. The increase in revenue is primarily due to growth in our substrate and test product lines and the combination of higher end-market demand for our customers products and new customer and program wins in the year 2002 as
compared to 2001. Unit volumes in 2002 also increased 10.2 versus the year 2001. Gross Profit . Gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2002 was 55.6 million, an increase of 78.8 from the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross margin as
a percent of revenue was 15.3 for the year 2002 versus 9.5 for the year 2001. The actions taken by us, including reductions in work force and tight cost controls coupled with increased unit volume and higher equipment utilization, contributed to
the increased gross profit realized for the year ended December 31, 2002. These results were reduced by the effect of higher gold prices and the appreciation of the South Korean Won against the United States Dollar when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2001. Selling, General, and Administrative . Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 38.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 22.4 from the
year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in expenses was primarily due to implementation of strict cost reductions taken in 2001 in reaction to the decline in revenue. The cost controls in 2001 included mandatory shut-down days, salary reductions,
travel restrictions, and deferment of expenditures where the timing could be delayed. In addition, we incurred additional expenses for our various employee incentive programs as a result of our improved results during the year ended December 31,
2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.

 Research
and Development . Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were 10.1 million, or 2.8 of revenue, compared to 14.2 million, or 4.3 of revenue, in the year ended December 31, 2001. Our research and development
expenses in 2002 represent a 28.9 decrease from similar expenses in 2001. Although we increased the number of research and development employees and internal resources in the year 2002 compared to the year 2001, we were engaged in a significant
project that required external spending during 2001. A comparable level of external spending was not required during 2002. Restructuring and Other Charges. In the first and fourth quarter of 2001, we approved restructuring plans to realign our
organization and reduce operating costs. These actions were designed to better align our existing workforce and to reduce operating expenses. These plans were a combination of reductions in work force and employee furloughs. Accordingly, our
restructuring plans included reduction of associated employee positions by approximately 554 and 197 worldwide in connection with the first and fourth quarter plans, respectively. Restructuring and related charges of 3.0 million and 3.3 million
were expensed during the first and fourth quarter of 2001, respectively. The entire first quarter charge of 3.0 million was related to employee separations and furloughs. The fourth quarter charge was comprised of 1.8 million related to employee
separations and 1.5 million of other charges for the forgiveness of loans to executive officers. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we utilized 0.3 million of the restructuring accrual and completed another 92 of the planned 751 employee
separations. We also utilized the 1.5 million of loan reserves. Cumulatively, we have completed 646 of the planned 751 employee separations. Due to stronger than expected performance from our Korean subsidiary and the sale of our plating line in
Korea which we had planned on shutting down, reserve releases in the amount of 1.3 million were credited to restructuring charges in our statement of operations for December 31, 2002. We plan no further terminations or other restructuring
activities related to our planned 2002 actions reserved in 2001. This credit was reduced by a restructuring action in our Malaysian plant in which 0.6 million was incurred to terminate 30 employees. This action was not included in the 2001
reserves. In addition, we wrote down impaired
assets by 34.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. There were no comparable write offs in the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest Expense . Total outstanding interest bearing debt decreased to 267.9 million at December 31, 2002 compared to
 383.6 million at December 31, 2001. The decrease in debt outstanding of 115.7 million from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 was due to the 82.4 million pay down of our term loans and the 50.0 million paydown of our revolving line of
credit, offset by an increase in foreign loans of 16.7 million. The decrease in debt was funded by our January 2002 and May 2002 public offerings of our common stock. Related interest expense was 32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
a decrease of 14.0 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The reduction in interest expense was primarily due to the combination of reduced interest rates along with the reduction in debt outstanding. Foreign Currency Losses . We had net foreign
currency losses of 1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to a net foreign currency gain of 0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2001. These non-cash losses are primarily due to the fluctuations between the exchange rate of
the United States Dollar and the South Korean Won related to long-term pension benefits payable to our South Korean employees. Income Taxes . Global income tax expense was 2.0 million and 2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, for effective tax rates of approximately (7.4 in 2002 and (2.8 in 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a valuation reserve that reversed previously recorded benefits in 2001 and previous years. We have a mix of tax
rates across the various jurisdictions in which we do business. The tax provision for 2002 does not take into account any future benefit from loss carryforwards, which we may realize once we again achieve profitability. Extraordinary Item . A portion of the proceeds
from our May 2002 public offering was used to extinguish term loan A and our capital expenditure loan and substantially pay down term loan B under our senior credit facilities. As a result, capitalized debt issuance costs of 3.0 million were
written off and the charge was included in the results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2002 with no comparable results for the same periods in 2001. There is no tax benefit since the costs were written off in a tax jurisdiction
that provides no benefit. Net Loss
Available to Common Stockholders . As a result of the items above, the net loss available to common stockholders decreased to 28.9 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to a net loss of 93.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. Year Ended December 31,
2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Revenue . Revenue was 328.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of 33.5 from the year ended December 31, 2000. The decline in revenue was a result of lower end-market demand for our customers 
products. This decrease was realized across all the end markets we serve and was not significantly concentrated in any one end market. We believe that our customers purchased product for their inventory in amounts consistent with historical demand.
Thus, as end-user demand dropped, our customers inventories increased, thereby decreasing demand for our products.

 Gross
Profit . Gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2001 was 31.1 million, a decrease of 71.5 from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the decrease was caused by lower demand leading to lower equipment utilization as well
as lower average selling prices in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Equipment utilization was 52.0 and 57.0 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Although reductions in force,
furloughs, plant shutdown days and other cost saving methods were used in the year ended December 31, 2001, they were insufficient to offset the decline in revenue. Selling, General, and Administrative . Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 31.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of 10.3 from the year ended December 31, 2000. Expenses declined compared to 2000, because we implemented strict cost controls in reaction to the decline in revenue and because of the
reductions in force we implemented in the first quarter of 2001. In addition, we incurred staffing expenses in the second half of 2000 related to our initial public offering that did not occur in 2001. Research and Development Expense. Research and
development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were 14.2 million, or 4.3 of revenue, compared to 12.0 million, or 2.4 of revenue, in the year ended December 31, 2000. Our research and development expenses in 2001 represent an 18.3 
increase from similar expenses in 2000. The increases were mainly due to expenses related to power packaging technology, new processes development and flip-chip technology development. Restructuring and Other Charges. Restructuring, write down of impaired assets and other
charges. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we wrote down impaired assets by 34.7 million. The asset write down relates primarily to our manufacturing assets in the assembly and test facilities in South Korea and Malaysia. The Company
determined that due to excess capacity the future expected cash flows related to equipment for certain niche package types will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the manufacturing equipment for those package types in the facility.
The carrying values of these assets were written down to the estimated fair market value and will continue to be depreciated over the remaining useful lives. There were no equivalent write offs in the year ended December 31, 2000. In addition, we recorded expenses associated with reduction in
force and furlough costs of 4.7 million and a loss reserve of 1.5 million on executive officers loans forgiveness in 2002, that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2001 with no comparable costs in 2000. Interest Expense . Total outstanding interest
bearing debt increased to 383.6 million at December 31, 2001 compared to 298.0 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in debt was primarily due to draw down of our revolving credit line for general corporate purposes and issuance of 50.0
million of convertible debt and 15.0 million of additional high yield borrowings in June 2001. Related interest expense was 37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of 5.6 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The
reduction in interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest rates on our debt. Foreign Currency Gains . Net foreign currency gains were 0.2 million and 2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These non-cash gains are primarily due
to the fluctuations between the exchange rate of the United States Dollar and the South Korean Won related to long-term pension benefits payable to our South Korean employees. Other (Income) and Expenses . Other (income) and expenses, net, was 0.4) million and 7.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other expenses for December 31, 2000 includes the one-time payment of 8.0 million, paid to Bain Capital and SXI Group in exchange for the termination of two advisory agreements,
which were entered into during our recapitalization in 1999. There were no equivalent expenditures related to this one-time payment in the year ended December 31, 2001. Accretion of Dividends and Recorded Value of the Intel Warrant . Accretion of dividends on
preferred stock and the recorded value of the Intel Warrant was 0 in the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to 9.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2000. All preferred stock was redeemed or converted to non-dividend bearing Class A
common stock concurrent with our initial public offering in August 2000. The Intel Warrant expired unexercised in February 2001. Income Taxes . Income tax expense was 2.6 million and 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, for an effective tax rates of approximately (2.8 in 2001 and 20.0 in 2000. Concurrently with our recapitalization on August 5, 1999, the company was reorganized and as a result now has operations and earnings in jurisdictions with
relatively low income tax rates, or where we enjoy tax holidays or other similar tax benefits.

 Net
(Loss) Income Available to Common Stockholders . As a result of the items above, we incurred a net loss available to common stockholders of 93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net income of 2.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 We believe the following accounting
policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our significant judgments. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in fixed assets, intellectual property and related intangible assets.
Management evaluates the valuation of these assets every quarter paying special attention to events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. We determine whether or not the assets are
recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets and if not, we calculate the amount of the impairment charge based on estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets or their appraised
fair value. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail rather than those used in estimating future cash flows, significantly different determination of recoverability or of fair value for these assets and results of operations could be
reported. We recorded an asset impairment charge of 34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 with no comparable amount in 2002. In addition, management uses judgment when setting expected asset useful lives for long-lived assets. The asset useful lives used are
based on historical experience and future expectations. However, business conditions or underlying technology may change in the future which could cause a change in asset lives. Any change in lives would cause a significant change in depreciation
and amortization. After the recapitalization (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), we reassessed the asset useful lives for our long-lived assets in 2000 and changed the useful lives from five years to eight years. This change
resulted in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 being 29.0 million lower than would have been recorded using five-year lives. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, price
protection, promotions and other volume-based incentives. If market conditions were to decline, we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is
offered. Furthermore, if anticipated volume levels turn out to be different, this would impact reductions to revenue and accrued customer rebates. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In the year ended December 31, 2002, we have maintained the valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of
utilization of certain deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

 Liquidity and Capital
Resources Our ongoing primary cash needs
are for operations and equipment purchases. We spent 78.9 million on capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 46.4 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2001. We anticipate spending
 80.0 million in capital expenditures in 2003. Under the terms of the agreement relating to our acquisition of the Malaysian business, during the period from June 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003, Intersil is entitled to receive additional contingent incentive payments based upon the
achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of business previously subcontracted by Intersil to a third party. In the event that Intersil was to achieve all the milestones, we would pay Intersil an additional sum of approximately 17.9
million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2002, we have cumulatively paid Intersil 14.5 million under this arrangement. On January 30, 2002, we sold 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering for 6.00 per share. On February
14, 2002, we sold an additional 1,425,600 shares of Class A common stock in conjunction with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option for 6.00 per share. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of
approximately 63.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds of 62.4 million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans. The remaining 1.3 million was
used for general corporate purposes. On May 30,
2002, we sold 12,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering for 8.75 per share. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of approximately 99.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds of 50.0 million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans. The remaining 49.2 million was used for general corporate purposes. Our total potential commitments on our loans, operating
leases, Intersil incentive payments, royalty and license agreements as of December 31, 2002, were as follows: (in thousands)

 Our senior
credit facilities, as amended, contain covenants restricting our operations and requiring that we meet specified financial tests. Our financial tests for 2002 were as follows: (1) a requirement to raise at least 20.0 million in junior capital by
March 1, 2002, which was fulfilled by us through an underwritten public offering of our Class A common stock in January 2002 and (2) a minimum EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization which is a Non-GAAP term defined in
our lending agreement) requirement based on a rolling 12 months ending June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, of 31.0 million and 37.0 million, respectively, with no requirement for December 31, 2002. Our actual 12 months EBITDA for the period
ended September 30, 2002 significantly exceeded the requirement. Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the financial covenants will consist solely of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio based on a
rolling 12 months calculation. There were no violations of the covenants under our senior credit facilities, as amended, through December 31, 2002. During the quarter ended June 30, 2002, an assessment of approximately 16.0 billion Korean Won (approximately 13.3 million U.S. Dollars
at December 31, 2002), was made by the Korean National Tax Administration, or NTA, relating to withholding tax not collected on the loan between our subsidiaries in Korea and Hungary. Withholding on the transactions in question is not required by
the prevailing tax treaty. There were no further assessments made during the quarter ended December 31, 2002. We have appealed the assessment through the NTA s Mutual Agreement Procedure and believe that the assessment will be overturned. As of
December 31, 2002, no accrual has been made. On July 18, 2002, the Icheon tax office of the NTA approved a tax suspension of the proposed assessment until resolution of the disputed assessment. The NTA required a corporate guarantee of 120 of the
assessment in exchange for the suspension. We complied with the guarantee request on August 1, 2002. No further assessments have been made. We believe that our existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and the available borrowings under our senior credit facilities of
 50.0 million will provide sufficient cash resources to meet our projected operating and other cash requirements for the next twelve months. An event of default under any debt instrument, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect
on us. We may require capital sooner than currently expected. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when we need it or, if available, that it will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our senior
credit facilities and senior subordinated notes significantly reduce our ability to incur additional debt. Failure to obtain any such required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our company. Other than the covenants on the debt as discussed above, we
have no performance guarantees or unconsolidated entities. Our off-balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases, royalty/license agreements, leases on office and manufacturing space and additional contingent incentive payments
to Intersil. Our total off-balance sheet obligations are approximately 56.5 million. In 2002, 2001, and 2000 cash provided by (used in) operations was 39.5 million, 3.9) million, and 46.2 million, respectively. Cash from operations mainly consisted of net income (loss) plus
depreciation and amortization as well as the write down of impaired assets in 2001 less utilization for working capital. In 2002, 2001, and 2000 cash used in investing activities was 98.4 million, 59.0 million, and 130.5 million, respectively. In 2002,
cash used in investing activities related mainly to net short-term investments of 10.0 million and property and equipment of 78.9 million. In 2001, cash used in investing activities mainly was invested in property and equipment. In 2000, in
addition to the acquisition of property and equipment, cash was invested in the purchase of the Malaysian business, including purchased intellectual property. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, cash provided by financing activities was 51.2 million, 85.9 million, and 71.0 million, respectively. Cash was
mainly provided by or used in debt issuance, debt repayment, stock issuance, and stock redemption.

 Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
realized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Companies are required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, but early adoption is encouraged. We have determined that
this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical
Corrections. Among other things, SFAS No. 145 rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions are met. SFAS No. 145 provisions
regarding early extinguishment of debt are generally effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 145, we have to reclassify any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary
item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30 for classification as an extraordinary item and show it within income from continuing operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No.
146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under EITF No. 94-3,
 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). The scope of SFAS No. 146 also includes costs related to terminating a contract
that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one-time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred-compensation
contract. SFAS No. 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and early application is encouraged. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The provisions of EITF
No. 94-3 shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of EITF No. 94-3 prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146. The effect on adoption of SFAS No. 146 will change on a prospective basis the timing of
when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45, Guarantor s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires
disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year-end. The Company has met the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 and believes that the adoption of the remaining provisions of this
standard will have no material impact on its financial statements. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.
We believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also
requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the pro
forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements and believes that the adoption of the remaining provisions of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements.

 In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46,
 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for
all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning
after June 15, 2003. We believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements. Acquisition of Malaysian Business On June 30, 2000, we consummated our acquisition of Intersil s packaging and test operations located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia along
with related intellectual property for approximately 71.5 million in cash and preferred stock, which was converted into common stock at the time of our initial public offering. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Intersil to provide Intersil assembly and test services on an exclusive basis. The terms of the acquisition of the Malaysian business require us to pay until June 30, 2003 additional
contingent incentive payments to Intersil based on the achievement of milestones. We have recorded these contingent payments as additional purchase price when they are earned. In the event that Intersil was to achieve all the milestones, Intersil
would receive an additional sum of approximately 17.9 million in the aggregate. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, 6.6 million, 7.4 million, and 0.5 million, respectively, were paid for a cumulative total of 14.5 million.
These payments increased the effective purchase price and were allocated to non-current assets. Additionally, in 2001, 2.4 million of other purchase price adjustments were recorded based on the difference between the final closing balance sheet and
the estimated closing balance sheet of the Malaysian business. As of December 31, 2002, deferred tax of 4.5 million has been recorded on all of these adjustments. This resulted in a further increase in non-current assets. There was no goodwill arising from the acquisition of the
Malaysian business. The fair value of total assets and liabilities exceeded the purchase price by 56.2 million as of July 1, 2000. This amount has been allocated in full to non-current assets as summarized below:

Intellectual property acquired along with the Malaysian business primarily consists of trade secrets and patents. The estimated average useful lives of these assets are between five and nine years. An accrual of 7.4 million was established for expected costs
of restructuring the Malaysian business. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, 2.5 million and 4.9 million of these non-recurring costs were paid in connection with the reorganization of the factory, product discontinuance and
employee related costs. We began formulating exit plans and termination data during the due diligence relating to the acquisition of the Malaysian business. The accrual was originally comprised of 5.0 million for involuntary termination benefits
and 2.4 million for other exit activities. Actual involuntary termination benefits and other exit costs amounted to 7.0 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The projected number of planned reductions in head count as a result of this planned
restructuring was 380 employees, with an actual reduction of 373 employees. All restructuring activities were completed in the year ended December 31, 2001. Intersil assigned to us patents, copyrights, and technical information used exclusively in or associated with the Malaysian business.
Furthermore, Intersil granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under other Intersil patents, copyright and technical information which is also used in or related to the operation of the Malaysian business. This license is
perpetual and irrevocable. Any intellectual property rights in the bonding diagrams, test programs, maskworks and test boards uniquely related to the Intersil products for which we will provide packaging and test services under the supply agreement
with Intersil are licensed to us only for use in providing those services.

Initial Public
Offering In July 2000, a 0.38098771 for 1
reverse stock split was made on our common stock. All share and per share information presented herein has been restated to give effect to the stock split. On August 8, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No.
333-39428) relating to the initial public offering of our Class A common stock. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, we issued 10,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for gross proceeds of 120.0 million. The total
proceeds from the offering and a concurrent private placement of stock, net of issuance costs, were 135.0 million. On August 18, 2000, in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our
Class A common stock, an additional 1,500,000 shares of Class A common stock for gross proceeds of 18.0 million were issued by us. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional shares, net of issuance costs, was 16.9 million. The net proceeds, amounting to 151.8 million, were used to
redeem in full our Class B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of 79.3 million and to repay debt of 64.2 million. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, all outstanding shares of Class A and Class C mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of 4,349,254 shares of Class A common stock. Secondary Public Offerings On January 30, 2002, we sold 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering for 6.00 per share. On February 14, 2002, we sold an additional 1,425,600 shares of Class A
common stock in conjunction with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option for 6.00 per share. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of approximately 63.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds of 62.4 million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans. The remaining 1.3 million was used for general corporate purposes. On May 30, 2002, we sold 12,000,000 shares of Class A common
stock in an underwritten public offering for 8.75 per share. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of approximately 99.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds
of 50.0 million from this offering were used to pay down term loans and revolving loans. The remaining 49.2 million was used for general corporate purposes.

In June
2002, we utilized 50.0 million of the public offering proceeds to extinguish term loan A and the capital expenditure loan and substantially pay down term loan B under the senior credit facilities. As a result, capitalized debt issuance costs of
 3.0 million were written off and the expense is included in the year ended December 31, 2002 as an extraordinary item with no comparable results for the same period in 2001. There was no tax benefit for the write off because the costs were written
off in a tax jurisdiction that provides no such benefit. ITEM
7A.
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We have no derivative financial instruments. We have long-term debt that carries fixed
and variable interest rates. A fluctuation in interest rates of 1 would increase our annual interest charge by approximately 0.9 million. The exposure to foreign currency gains and losses has been significantly mitigated by the fact that we
negotiated with the large majority of our material and equipment suppliers to denominate purchase transactions in U.S. Dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we generated approximately 11.3 , 8.1 , and 16.7 of total revenue, respectively,
from international markets. In addition, all of the facilities currently used to provide packaging services are located in China, Malaysia and South Korea. Moreover, many of our customers operations are located in countries outside of the
United States of America. We cannot determine if our future operations and earnings will be affected by new laws, new regulations, a volatile political climate, armed conflicts, changes in or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or
other consequences of doing business outside the United States of America particularly in China, Malaysia and South Korea. If future operations are negatively affected by these changes, sales or profits may suffer. Investment and Interest Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our investment portfolio and short-term debt obligations. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place our investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer. We mitigate
default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers. Our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure
portfolio liquidity. We have no material cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our results are only affected by the interest rate changes to variable rate short-term borrowings. Due to the short-term nature of these
borrowings, an immediate change to interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results. Our long-term bonds bear a fixed interest rate and the interest does not fluctuate with changes in short-term or long-term rates.

 Foreign Currency Risk
 Based on our overall currency rate exposure
at December 31, 2002, a near term 10 appreciation or depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year. There can be no
assurance, however, that there will not be a material impact further in the future. A portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies like the Chinese Renminbi, the Malaysian Ringgit and the South Korean Won. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or
any other applicable currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect the cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. We cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability. From time
to time, we may have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective.
If it is not effective, we may experience reduced operating margins.

the Stockholders and Board of Directors of ChipPAC, Inc.: In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders equity and of cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ChipPAC, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California January 28, 2003

 ChipPAC,
Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Business, Recapitalization and Merger
 Business and Organization ChipPAC, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company 
or ChipPAC provide packaging and testing services to the semiconductor industry, with service offerings in communications, computing, consumer, automotive, industrial and multi-applications end markets. The Company packages and tests
integrated circuits from wafers provided by its customers. The Company markets its services worldwide, with emphasis on the North American market, based on the headquarters of the Company s customers. The Company s packaging and testing
operations are located in the Republic of Korea South Korea or Korea ), the People s Republic of China China and Malaysia. Recapitalization and Merger Prior to August 5, 1999, the Company represented the combination of four business units of Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd.
(currently Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.) HEI which operated collectively as HEI s worldwide packaging and testing operations. On August 5, 1999, affiliates of Bain Capital, Inc. and SXI Group LLC, a portfolio concern of Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd., which we
refer to collectively as the Equity Investors, and management acquired a controlling interest in the Company from HEI and Hyundai Electronics America HEA through a series of transactions, including a merger into ChipPAC,
Inc. of a special purpose corporation organized by the Equity Investors. The merger was structured to be accounted for as a recapitalization. Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, have been prepared on a consolidated basis. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ChipPAC, Inc. and its majority controlled and owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. Certain prior period balances
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Accounting Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates made by management include: the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as future cash flows to be generated by those
assets; revenue reductions relating to customer programs and incentive offerings; allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns, and deferred tax assets; inventory realizability and contingent liabilities, among others. Actual results could
differ from the estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash and money market
funds at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Short-term Investments
 The Company invests excess cash in auction
rate corporate notes which are high-quality and easily marketable instruments to ensure cash is readily available for use in current operations. These instruments have maturity terms of generally 30 days or less. Short-term investments are
categorized as available for sale and recorded at market. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, cost approximates market value. The average interest rates on the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were 1.4 and 2.1 ,
respectively. Financial Instruments The amounts reported for cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, certain other assets, accounts payable, certain accrued and other liabilities, short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value due to their short maturities or market interest rates. As of December
31, 2002, our senior subordinated notes, which have a fixed interest rate, were trading at 105.

 Comprehensive Income
(Loss) Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive
income (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period from transactions and events from non owner sources. In the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, comprehensive income (loss) equaled net income (loss). Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using
the first-in, first-out method) or market value. The Company generally does not take ownership of its customer supplied semiconductors. The risk of loss associated with the customer supplied semiconductors remains with the customer. These customer
supplied semiconductors are not included as part of the Company s inventories. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company uses the straight-line method to depreciate machinery and equipment over their estimated useful lives from three to eight years. Building facilities and building
improvements located in the Shanghai, China facilities are depreciated over 20 years. Building facilities and building improvements in the Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia facilities are depreciated over 25 and 17 years, respectively. Land use rights in
Shanghai, China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are amortized over 50 and 99 years, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the remaining lease term. Intangibles Intangibles are amortized over their useful lives on a
straight-line basis over a period of three to nine years. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of carrying amounts to
future net cash flows an asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount to which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. The Company s customers are comprised of companies in the semiconductor industry located primarily in the United States of America.
Credit risk with respect to the Company s trade receivables is mitigated by selling to well established companies, performing ongoing credit evaluations and maintaining frequent contact with customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based upon the expected collectability of the Company s accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, three customers accounted for 16 , 15 and 11 of the outstanding trade receivables. At December 31, 2001, three customers accounted for 19 , 12 and 11 of the outstanding trade
receivables. Loss of or default by these customers could have an adverse effect upon the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks in the United States of America, South Korea, China,
Malaysia, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, and Hungary. Deposits in these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, the Company is exposed to loss only to the extent of the amount of cash and cash
equivalents reflected on its balance sheets. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its bank cash deposits.

ChipPAC, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
 Revenue Recognition
 The Company recognizes revenue, net of
rebates and discounts, upon completion of services, generally at the time of shipment of packaged semiconductors to its customers. The Company generally does not take ownership of customer supplied semiconductors as these materials are sent to the
Company on a consignment basis. Accordingly, the value of the customer supplied materials are neither reflected in revenue nor in cost of revenue. The Company warrants its services; warranty claims historically have been insignificant. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to expense as
incurred. Accounting for Income Taxes The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the
liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between amounts reported in the financial statements and amounts that are reported in the Company s income tax returns. A valuation allowance is
provided for deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude, based on the available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized through future operations. The provision for income
taxes represents taxes that are payable for the current period, plus the net change in deferred tax amounts. Computation of Net Income per Share of Common Stock Basic net income available to common stockholders per share of common stock is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share of common stock is computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares result from
stock options and the convertible subordinated notes. Foreign
Exchange Contracts The Company has not
entered into any foreign exchange contracts since 1999, and accordingly, no gains and losses were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. Therefore, gains and losses resulting from
translation from local currencies to the U.S. dollar are included in determining net income or loss for the period.

 Stock-Based
Compensation At December 31, 2002, the
Company had three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 15. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to the stock-based employee
compensation.

 Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
realized in the period which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Companies are required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, but early adoption is encouraged. The Company has determined
that this standard will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical
Corrections. Among other things, SFAS No. 145 rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions are met. SFAS No. 145 provisions
regarding early extinguishment of debt are generally effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 145, the Company has to reclassify any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an
extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30 for classification as an extraordinary item and show it within income from continuing operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting
for Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities that are
currently accounted for under EITF No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). The scope of SFAS No. 146 also
includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one-time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit
arrangement or an individual deferred-compensation contract. SFAS No. 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and early application is encouraged. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2003. The provisions of EITF No. 94-3 shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of EITF No. 94-3 prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146. The effect on adoption of SFAS No.
146 will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred

 In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45, Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the
entity s product warranty liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor s
fiscal year-end. The Company has met the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 and believes that the adoption of the remaining provisions of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF,
reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services
and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact
on its financial statements. In December 2002,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are
effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements and believes that the adoption of
the remaining provisions of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest
entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements. Note 3: Acquisition of Malaysian Business On June 30, 2000, the Company consummated the acquisition of Intersil s packaging and test operations located in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia along with related intellectual property for approximately 71.5 million in cash and preferred stock, which was converted into common stock at the time of the initial public offering. The acquisition has been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Intersil to provide Intersil assembly and test services on an exclusive basis. The terms of the acquisition of the Malaysian business require
the Company to pay until June 30, 2003 additional contingent incentive payments to Intersil based on the achievement of milestones with respect to the transfer of the seller s packaging business. The Company records these contingent payments as
additional purchase price if and when they are earned. In the event that Intersil was to achieve all the milestones, Intersil would receive an additional sum of approximately 17.9 million in the aggregate. For the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, 6.6 million, 7.4 million, and 0.5 million, respectively, were paid for a cumulative total of 14.5 million. These payments increased the effective purchase price and were allocated to non-current assets. Additionally, in 2000, 2.4
million of other purchase price adjustments were recorded based on the difference between the final closing balance sheet and the estimated closing balance sheet of the Malaysian business. As of December 31, 2002, deferred tax of 4.5 million has
been recorded on all of these adjustments. This resulted in a further increase in non-current assets.

 There was
no goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Malaysian business. The fair value of total assets and liabilities exceeded the purchase price by 56.2 million as of July 1, 2000. This amount has been allocated in full to non-current assets as

Intellectual property acquired along with the Malaysian business primarily consists of trade secrets and patents. The estimated average useful lives of these assets are between five and nine years. An accrual of 7.4 million was established for expected costs
of restructuring the Malaysian business. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, 2.5 million and 4.9 million of these non-recurring costs were paid in connection with the Company s factory reorganization, product discontinuance and
employee related costs. The Company began formulating exit plans and termination data during the due diligence relating to the acquisition of the Malaysian business. The accrual was originally comprised of 5.0 million for involuntary termination
benefits and 2.4 million for other exit activities. Actual involuntary termination benefits and other exit costs amounted to 7.0 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The projected number of planned reductions in head count as a result of this
planned restructuring was 380 employees, with an actual reduction of 373 employees. All restructuring activities were completed in the year ended December 31, 2001. Intersil assigned to the Company patents, copyrights, and technical information used exclusively in or
associated with the Malaysian business. Furthermore, Intersil granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under other Intersil patents, copyright and technical information, to the Company, which is also used in or related to the
operation of the Malaysian business. This license is perpetual and irrevocable. Any intellectual property rights in the bonding diagrams, test programs, maskworks and test boards uniquely related to the Intersil products for which the Company will
provide packaging and test services under the supply agreement with Intersil are licensed to the Company only for use in providing those services. The results of operations of the Malaysian business have been included within the Company s results of operations for periods
subsequent to June 30, 2000. Set forth below is the unaudited pro forma combined summary of operations of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2000, as if the acquisition had been made on January 1, 2000 (in thousands, except for per share

 Note 4: Termination of
Advisory Agreements At the time of the 1999
recapitalization, the Company entered into two advisory agreements with certain Equity Investors under which the Equity Investors provided financial, advisory and consulting services to the Company. Each advisory agreement was to remain in effect
for an initial term of ten years. Expenses related to these contracts were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company agreed to terminate the advisory agreements with the Equity Investors upon the closing of the initial public offering for a
one-time aggregate payment of 8.0 million consisting of a 3.6 million cash payment and the issuance of 4.4 million of the Company s Class A common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price of 12.00 per
share. There were no active consulting projects involving the Equity Investors at the time the agreements were cancelled. The one-time charge to income of 8.0 million was classified as other expense and was made in the third quarter of fiscal
2000 for the termination of these agreements. Note 5: Risks
and Uncertainties Industry The Company s business involves certain risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, dependence on a cyclical industry that is characterized by rapid
technological changes, fluctuations in end-user demands, availability of materials and equipment, evolving industry standards, competitive pricing and declines in average selling prices, risks associated with foreign currencies, and enforcement of
intellectual property rights. Additionally, the market in which the Company operates is very competitive. As a result of these industry and market characteristics, key elements of competition in the independent semiconductor packaging market include
breadth of packaging offerings, time-to-market, technical competence, design services, quality, production yields, reliability of customer service and price. As a result of difficult business and market conditions in the semiconductor industry, the Company incurred net losses of
 28.9 million and 93.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company completed two equity offerings in 2002 (see note 12) providing net proceeds of 163.0 million and used 112.4 million to repay debt. The
Company believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and the available borrowings under the senior credit facilities of 50.0 million will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the projected operating and other cash
requirements for the next twelve months. An event of default under any debt instrument, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company may require capital sooner than currently expected. The Company cannot
assure that additional financing will be available when it is needed or, if available, that it will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of the senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes significantly reduce the
Company s ability to incur additional debt. Failure to obtain any such additional financing, if required, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company reduced the concentration of its customers that make up more than 10.0 of sales from two
customers in the year 2000 accounting for 47.0 , three customers in the year 2001 accounting for 51.3 of total revenue, to five customers in 2002 accounting for 66.3 of total revenue. Nonetheless, any decommitment from any major customer for
products could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company had five, three and two customers, which each accounted for more than 10.0 of sales, respectively.
These customers include Atmel, Fairchild, Intel, Intersil, LSI Logic and nVIDIA. Other South Korean,
Chinese, and Malaysian foreign currency exchange regulations may place restrictions on the flow of foreign funds into and out of those countries. The Company is required to comply with these regulations when entering into transactions in foreign
currencies in South Korea, China and Malaysia. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no restrictions on foreign funds flow. The Company procures materials from local vendors in the ordinary course of business. Three vendors in South Korea supply approximately
43.0 of the Company s component parts used in performing packaging services. Loss of a major supplier could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 Debt
issuance costs of 16.8 million were incurred in 2000 and 1999 as a result of raising 300.0 million of debt in connection with the recapitalization and approximately 55.8 million of debt in connection with the Malaysian acquisition, respectively.
In June 2001, the Company issued 50.0 million of convertible subordinated notes and 15.0 million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement. Debt issuance costs of 0.7 million and 4.5 million were incurred in 2002 and 2001,
respectively, in connection with the issuance of these debt obligations. On early retirement of certain debt with proceeds from the secondary public offerings and the initial public offering, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of 3.0 million, net of related tax benefit in the year ended
December 31, 2002 and 2.4 million, net of related tax benefit, in the year ended December 31, 2000 principally representing the write-down of debt issuance costs. There was no extraordinary item in 2001. Accrued expenses and other liabilities were comprised of the

Note 7:
Restructuring, write down of impaired assets and other charges 2002 In 2002, the
Company utilized 0.3 million of the restructuring accrual for reductions in workforce in its South Korean operations and wrote off the executive officer loans against the related 1.5 million loan loss reserve. In 2002, the Company completed
another 92 of the planned 751 employee separations. Cumulatively the Company has completed 646 of the planned 751 employee separations at December 31, 2002. Due to stronger than expected performance from the South Korean subsidiary and the sale of
its plating line in Korea which had been planned to be shut down, reserve releases in the amount of 1.3 million were credited to restructuring charges in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. There are no further
terminations or other restructuring activities planned for which amounts were reserved in 2001. This credit of 1.3 million was reduced by a restructuring action in the Malaysian plant in which 0.6 million was incurred to terminate 30 employees.
This action was not included in the 2001 reserves. 2001
 In the first and fourth quarters of 2001,
ChipPAC s management approved restructuring plans to realign its organization and reduce operating costs. These actions were designed to better align ChipPAC s workforce with the decrease in demand and to reduce selling, general, and
administrative expenses. These plans were a combination of reductions in force and furloughs. Accordingly, ChipPAC planned to reduce associated employee positions by approximately 554 and 197 worldwide in connection with the first and fourth quarter
plans, respectively. Restructuring and related charges of 3.0 million and 3.3 million were expensed during the first and fourth quarters of 2001, respectively. The entire first quarter charge was related to employee separations and furloughs. The
fourth quarter charge was comprised of 1.8 million related to employee separations and a 1.5 million loan loss reserve for executive officer loans. Employee separation benefits under each plan were similar and included severance, medical and other
benefits. As of December 31, 2001, ChipPAC completed 554 of the planned 751 employee separations and all of the furloughs planned for 2001. Components of accrued restructuring costs and amounts charged for restructuring as of December 31, 2002 were as follows (in thousands):

 The
Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company determines whether there has been
an impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by an asset to its carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset is written down to fair value which is either determined based on
discounted cash flows or appraised or estimated values, depending on the nature of the asset. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company wrote down impaired assets by 34.7 million. The asset write down related primarily to the
Company s manufacturing assets in the assembly and test facilities in South Korea and Malaysia. The Company determined that due to excess capacity, the future expected cash flows related to equipment for certain package types would not be
sufficient to recover the carrying value of the manufacturing equipment in the facility for those package types. The carrying values of these assets were written down to the estimated fair value and were continued to be depreciated over their
remaining useful lives. Note 8: Dividends Accreted

Dividends on the Intel Preferred Stock were accrued on a daily basis at a rate of 10.0 per annum. Accumulated and unpaid dividends as of December 31, 1999 were capitalized as part of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock. Total
accreted dividends and liquidation value of 11.0 million were converted into 2,800,438 shares of common stock at the initial public offering. Dividends on the Hyundai Preferred Stock were accrued on a daily basis at a rate of 12.5 per annum. Dividends were recorded as
accumulated and unpaid dividends as part of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock. Total dividends and liquidation value of 79.3 million were paid in full through the proceeds of the initial public offering. Dividends on the Intersil Preferred Stock were accrued on a
daily basis at a rate of 5.0 per annum. Accumulated and unpaid dividends were recorded as part of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock. Total dividends and liquidation value of 17.6 million were converted into 1,548,816 shares of common stock at
the initial public offering. Note 9: Earnings per Share
 Statement of Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128 requires a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations. Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income available to stockholders (numerator)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and all potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and the if-converted method is used for determining the number of
shares assumed issued from the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2002, there were options outstanding to purchase 6.4 million shares of Class A common stock with a weighted average exercise price of 4.14, which could potentially dilute basic
earnings per share in the future, but which were not included in diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been antidilutive. The Company also has outstanding 50.0 million of convertible subordinated notes, which are convertible into
approximately 5.0 million shares of Class A common stock but were not included in diluted earnings per share as their effect would also have been antidilutive. Had these options and the convertible subordinated notes been included in the diluted
earnings per share counts, the total of weighted average shares of Class A common stock would have been 98,828,000 shares.

 Note 11: Term Debt and
Credit Facilities Under the terms of the
recapitalization and merger in 1999 all short and long-term debt, loans and leases and other credit facilities existing prior to the recapitalization were terminated at the recapitalization date. To finance part of the recapitalization, the Company borrowed
 300.0 million of new debt, comprising 150.0 million of term loans and 150.0 million of senior subordinated notes. The term loans bear interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, 1.43 at December 31, 2002) plus 4.3 and the senior
subordinated notes bear interest at 12.75 per annum. The senior subordinated notes mature on August 1, 2009. If a change of control occurs, the Company may be required to allow holders of the senior subordinated notes to sell the Company their
notes at a purchase price of 101.0 of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior subordinated notes and quarterly for the term loans. At December 31, 2002, the Company has a borrowing capacity of
 50.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes under the revolving credit line portion of the senior credit facilities. The revolving credit line under the senior credit facilities matures on July 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2002,
there was no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit and the entire 50.0 million was available to the Company. In June 2001, the Company issued 50.0 million of convertible subordinated notes and 15.0 million of senior subordinated notes in a
private placement. The convertible subordinated notes bear interest of 8.0 per annum and mature on June 15, 2011. The senior subordinated notes bear interest at 12.75 per annum and mature on August 1, 2009. A majority of the proceeds from these
sales were used to pay down the term loans and revolving loans. As of December 31, 2002, the Company s debt consisted of 267.9 million of borrowings, which was comprised of 36.2 million in term loans, 165.0 million of senior subordinated notes, 50.0 million of convertible subordinated
notes and 16.7 million in foreign loans. The foreign loan was established with Cho Hung Bank of South Korea in 2002 providing 16.7 million utilized for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had all 16.7 million
outstanding with an interest rate of 4.18 . This loan matures in 2004. The Company has also established two separate lines of credit with Korean Exchange Bank and Cho Hung Bank, with credit limits of 10.2 million and 8.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, there were no
outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit. Both agreements are subject to an annual review by Korean Exchange Bank and Cho Hung Bank for the continued use of the credit line facility. The Company s senior credit facilities, as amended,
contain covenants restricting the Company s operations and requiring that the Company meet specified financial tests. The financial tests for 2002 were as follows: (1) a requirement to raise at least 20.0 million in junior capital by March 1,
2002, which was fulfilled by the Company through an underwritten public offering of Class A common stock in January 2002 and (2) a minimum EBITDA requirement based on a rolling 12 months ended June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, of 31.0 million
and 37.0 million, respectively, with no requirement for December 31, 2002. Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the financial covenants consist solely of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio based on
a rolling 12 months calculation. There were no violations of the covenants under the senior credit facilities, as amended, through December 31, 2002.

immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 for its initial public offering. In the merger, each outstanding share of ChipPAC California Class A common stock was converted into one share of ChipPAC
Delaware Class A common stock. Each outstanding share of ChipPAC California Class B common stock was converted into one share of ChipPAC Delaware Class B common stock. Each outstanding share of ChipPAC California Class L common stock was converted
into and became one share of ChipPAC Delaware Class A common stock plus an additional number of shares of ChipPAC Delaware Class A common stock which was determined by dividing a preferential distribution, based in part on the original cost of such
share plus an amount which accrued daily at a rate of 12.0 per annum, compounded quarterly, by the per share price of the ChipPAC Delaware Class A common stock in the initial public offering. As a result, Class L common stockholders received
8,880,507 shares of Class A common stock. The
Company currently has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01, which may be issued in one or more series. At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

In June
2002, the Company utilized 50.0 million of the public offering proceeds to extinguish term loan A and the capital expenditure loan and to substantially pay down term loan B under its senior credit facility. As a result, capitalized debt issuance
costs of 3.0 million were written off and the expense is included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2002 as an extraordinary item with no comparable results for the same period in 2001. There was no tax benefit for the write off
because the costs were written off in a tax jurisdiction that provides no such benefit.

 Note 13: Commitments
 On August 5, 1999, the Company and Intel
entered into the Intel Materials Agreement pursuant to which Intel would outsource to the Company a portion of its semiconductor packaging needs. In return, the Company would provide Intel with rebates based upon the volume of packaging services
outsourced to the Company. Rebates were deducted from revenue and accrued as current liabilities when the sale was made. The agreement expired on March 31, 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, there was no rebate amount earned by
Intel. For the year ended December 31, 2000, Intel earned and received 3.6 million. The Company s executive offices in the United States of America were leased from HEA until May 2001. Thereafter, the Company s executive offices were moved to Fremont, California and are
leased from an unrelated party. The Company s facilities in Korea are leased from HEI under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements through 2004 with an option to extend to 2009. Rent expense in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and
2000 was 5.0 million, 6.4 million, and 5.2 million respectively. Future annual minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2002 were as follows (in thousands):

 Note 15: 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan, 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1999 Stock Purchase and Option Plan The Company adopted the 1999 Stock Purchase and Option Plan, or the 1999 Stock Plan, which authorized the granting of stock options and the sale of Class A common stock or Class L common
stock to current or future employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Company. Under the 1999 Stock Plan, a committee of the board of directors is authorized to sell or otherwise issue Class A common stock or Class L common stock at any
time prior to the termination of the 1999 Stock Plan in such quantity, at such price, on such terms and subject to such conditions as established by the committee up to an aggregate of 15,500,000 shares of Class A common stock and 500,000 shares of
Class L common stock, including shares of common stock with respect to which options may be granted, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events to prevent any dilution or expansion of the rights of participants that might
otherwise result from the occurrence of such events. No options or stock grants have been made under the 1999 Stock Plan since the initial public offering, when the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan or 2000 Plan became effective. The Company s 2000 Plan was adopted by the board of
directors and approved by the stockholders on June 14, 2000. Amendments to the 2000 Plan were adopted by the board of directors on January 30, 2001, and approved by the stockholders on March 16, 2001. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options to employees (including officers and employee directors) and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants. A total of (1) 11,615,698 shares of common stock, (2) any shares returned to
the Company s 1999 Stock Plan as a result of termination of options and (3) annual increases to be added on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company commencing in 2001 equal to one percent of the outstanding shares of
common stock, or a lesser amount as may be determined by the board of directors, have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2000 Plan. In 2002, 160,313 shares were returned from the 1999 Stock Plan and pooled into the 2000 Stock Plan. In May 2002, an additional 811,081
shares were added to the 2000 Plan as the result of the annual increase of one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the annual meeting of the stockholders. Options are granted at the fair market value and expire up to ten years after the date of grant. Vesting
occurs usually over a two-to four-year period. The following table summarizes stock option activity under the 1999 Stock Plan:

The
estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 6.02, 2.95 and 5.01, respectively, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions as described below. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan ESPP for the benefit of its employees. The ESPP qualified in the United States of America under section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase the Company s Class A common stock
through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85.0 of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of each specified six-month offering period. Stock purchases are limited to 15.0 of an employee s eligible compensation.
During 2002, a total of 1,092,047 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 3.05 per share, were issued through the ESPP. For the year 2001, a total of 921,656 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 4.48
per share were issued. At December 31, 2002, 9,129,260 shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. The estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value of rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 2002 and 2001 was 1.90
and 1.88, respectively.

 Stock-Based Compensation No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table

At December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 10.0 million of federal and 5.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which
expire in varying amounts from 2006 to 2020. Additionally, the Company had 8.2 million Korean net operating loss which begin to expire in 2005. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of the benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may
be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year, include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50.0 , as
defined over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2002, the Company maintains a partial valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amount the Company deemed, more likely
than not, to be recoverable prior to repatriation. The Company considered, among other factors, the historical profitability prior to one-time charges, projections of future profits and the ability of the Company s foreign subsidiaries to
utilize their deferred tax assets.

 Note 17: Employee
Benefit Plans Retirement and Deferred Savings
Plan United States of America The
Company maintains a retirement and deferred savings plan for its employees (the 401(k) Plan ). The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify as a tax qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan provides that each participant
may contribute up to 15.0 of tax gross compensation (up to a statutory limit). Under the 401(k) Plan, the Company is required to make contributions based on contributions made by employees. The Company s contributions to the 401(k) Plan for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately 0.2 million in each year. All amounts contributed by participants and related earnings are fully vested at all times. Severance Benefits Korea Employees and directors with more than one year of service are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment upon
termination of their employment with ChipPAC Korea, based on their length of service and rate of pay at the time of termination. Accrued severance benefits are adjusted annually for all eligible employees based on their employment as of the balance
sheet date. In accordance with the National
Pension Act of South Korea, a certain portion of severance benefits has been deposited with the Korean National Pension Fund and deducted from accrued severance benefits. The amounts contributed will be refunded to employees from the National
Pension Fund upon retirement. The expense for severance benefits for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 amounted to approximately 3.8 million, 2.6 million, and 3.0 million, respectively. Note 18: Contingent Liabilities On June 30, 2000, the Company consummated the acquisition of
Intersil s packaging and test operations located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, along with related intellectual property for approximately 71.5 million in cash and preferred stock. The terms of the acquisition of the Malaysian business require the Company to pay until June 30, 2003
additional contingent incentive payments to Intersil based on the achievement of milestones with respect to the transfer of the Intersil s packaging business, previously subcontracted by Intersil to third parties, to the Company. The Company
records these contingent payments as additional purchase price if and when they are earned. In the event that Intersil were to achieve all of the milestones, Intersil would receive an additional sum of approximately 17.9 million in the aggregate.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company paid 6.6 million relating to the achievement of milestones and cumulatively 14.5 million of contingent incentive payments have been paid since the acquisition. These payments increased the
effective purchase price and were allocated to non-current assets. During the quarter ended June 30, 2002, an assessment of approximately 16.0 billion Korean Won (approximately 13.3 million U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2002), was made by the Korean National Tax Administration NTA relating to withholding tax not collected and remitted related to a loan between our subsidiaries in Korea and Hungary. Withholding on the transactions in question is not required by the prevailing tax treaty. The Company appealed
the assessment through the Mutual Agreement Procedure and believes that the assessment will be overturned. On July 18, 2002, the Icheon tax office of the NTA approved a tax suspension of the proposed assessment until resolution of the disputed
assessment. The NTA required a corporate guarantee of 120 of the assessment in exchange for the suspension. The Company complied with the guarantee request on August 1, 2002. There were no further assessments made during the remainder of the year
ended December 31, 2002.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES At the beginning of the third quarter, in response to recent legislation and additional requirements, we reviewed our internal control structure and our disclosure of 2002 controls and procedures. As a result of this review we
implemented minor changes, primarily to formalize and document the procedures already in place. We have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information related to ChipPAC, Inc. (including our consolidated
subsidiaries) is made known to our disclosure committee, including our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Accounting Officer on a regular basis, in particular during the period in which the quarterly reports are being prepared. As
required, we will evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, and we did so within 90 days prior to the filing of this annual report. We believe as of that date, such controls and procedures were
operating effectively as designed. We presented
the results of our most recent evaluation to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are adequate to ensure the clarity and material completeness of the Company s disclosures in its periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC and there are no significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls which could significantly affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. There have not been any significant changes in internal controls, or in factors that could significantly affect
internal controls, subsequent to the date the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer completed their evaluation. Certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding, among other items, disclosure controls
and procedures are included immediately after the Signatures section of this annual report. ITEM 15.

 RISK FACTORS DECEMBER 31, 2002

Risk Factors December 31, 2002 

Exhibit 99.1
 CHIPPAC, INC. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors in
addition to the other information set forth in this document in analyzing an investment in the Class A common stock, 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes or 8 convertible subordinated notes of ChipPAC, Inc. We believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are the current material risks facing us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our
business, financial condition or results of operations will likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our publicly traded Class A common stock, 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes or 8 convertible subordinated notes could fall and you may lose all or part of the money you invested. Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002 improved from
the year ended December 31, 2001, but we are still operating at a loss. Our revenue, gross margins and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2002 has
decreased from the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of increased revenue and better gross margin. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 363.7 million, compared to 328.7 million in the year 2001. The increase
is attributable to the growth in our substrate and test product lines as a result of the combination of higher end-market demand for our customers products and new customer and program wins in the year 2002 as compared to 2001. Also, our gross
margin as a percentage of revenue grew from 9.5 in 2001 to 15.3 in 2002, due to cost cutting measures we implemented coupled with increased unit volume and higher equipment utilization. We cannot assure you that our business will continue to
increase or that our performance will continue to improve. We
may not be able to continue to implement our cost saving strategy. Even if we do, it may not reduce our operating expenses by as much as we anticipated and could even compromise the development of our business. In 2001 and 2002, as a response to the weakness in demand for
semiconductors, we implemented cost saving measures, including significant reduction in our workforce, furloughs, reduced work shift schedules, reductions in discretionary spending, reduced materials cost and lower capital expenditures and redesign
of our manufacturing processes to improve productivity. We cannot assure you that these cost saving measures will increase productivity or that any expected net savings will occur. In fact, our cost saving measures could adversely affect our
revenue, as they could create inefficiencies in our business operations, result in labor disruptions and limit our ability to expand and grow our business. The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our operating results. Our operations are substantially affected by market
conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant economic downturns characterized by reduced product demand and production overcapacity which can result in rapid erosion of average
selling prices. Since the end of 2000, we have been experiencing a general slowdown in the semiconductor industry. Our profitability is affected by average selling prices which tend to decline. Decreases in the average selling prices of our packaging and test services can have a material adverse effect
on our profitability. The average selling prices of packaging and test services have declined historically, with packaging services in 
 1 

particular experiencing severe pricing pressure. This pricing pressure for packaging and test services is
likely to continue. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability will continue to be dependent, in large part, upon our ability to offset decreases in average selling prices by improving production efficiency, increasing unit volumes
packaged or tested, or by shifting to higher margin packaging and test services. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to develop and market new technologies, we may not remain
competitive within the semiconductor packaging industry. The semiconductor packaging and test industry is characterized by rapid increases in the diversity and complexity of packaging services. As a result, we expect that we will need to continually introduce more advanced package designs
in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements. The requirement to develop, license and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development and capital
expenditures in future years. Any failure by us to achieve advances in package design or to obtain access to advanced package designs developed by others could reduce our growth prospects and operating income. The intensity of competition in our industry could result in the loss of
our customers, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits. We face substantial competition from a number of established independent packaging companies and with the internal capabilities of many of our largest customers. Each of our primary competitors has
significant operational capacity, financial resources, research and development operations, and established relationships with many large semiconductor companies, which are current or potential customers of ours. Furthermore, our competitors may in
the future capture our existing or potential customers through superior responsiveness, service quality, product design, technical competence or other factors, which we view as principal elements of competition in our industry. In addition, our
primary customers may, in the future, shift more of their packaging and test service demand internally. As a result, we may have reduced revenues and profits. Our research and development efforts may not yield profitable and commercially viable services; thus, we may have significant short-term research and
development expenses, which will not necessarily result in increases in revenue. Our research and development efforts may not yield commercially viable packages or test services. The qualification process for new customers is conducted in various stages which may take one or more
years to complete, and during each stage there is a substantial risk that we will have to abandon a potential package or test service which is no longer marketable and in which we have invested significant resources. In the event we are able to
qualify new packages, a significant amount of time will have elapsed between our investment in new packages and the receipt of any related revenues. We could lose customers, and thus revenue, if we cannot maintain the quality of our services. The semiconductor packaging process is complex and involves a
number of precise steps. Defective packaging can result from a number of factors, including the level of contaminants in the operational environment, human error, equipment malfunction, use of defective materials and plating services and inadequate
sample testing. From time to time, we expect to experience lower than anticipated yields as a result of these factors, particularly in connection with any expansion of capacity or change in processing steps. In addition, our yield on new packaging
could be lower during the period necessary for us to develop the requisite expertise and experience with these processes. Any failure by us to maintain high quality standards or acceptable yields, if significant and sustained, could result in the
loss of customers, delays in shipments, increased costs and cancellation of orders. 
 2 

Our business
may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced purchases by, any of our large customers. Additionally, we may encounter difficulties in soliciting new customers. For the year ended December 31, 2002, sales to our top five customers in the aggregate accounted for
approximately 66.3 of total net revenues. If any of our main customers were to purchase significantly less of our services in the future, these decreased levels of purchases could harm our operating results. Semiconductor packaging companies must pass a lengthy and
rigorous qualification process that can take up to six months at a cost to the customer of approximately 250,000 to 300,000. If we fail to qualify packages with potential customers or customers with which we have recently become qualified do not
use our services, then our customer base could become more concentrated with a limited number of customers accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. Moreover, we believe that once a semiconductor company has selected a particular
packaging and test foundry company s services, the semiconductor company generally relies on that vendor s packages for specific applications and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of that vendor s packages. Accordingly,
it may be difficult to achieve significant sales from a particular or potential customer once it selects another vendor s packaging services. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.
 As of December 31, 2002, our total
indebtedness was 267.9 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
and the industry in which we operate; 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes; 

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt; and 

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds. Furthermore, failing to comply with
those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase our revenues and profitability and meet our growth objectives. Despite our current levels of indebtedness, we still may be able to incur
substantially more debt which could increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our senior credit facility provides for revolving loans up to
 50.0 million, including letters of credit. Additionally, the indenture for the existing senior subordinated notes permits us to incur additional indebtedness if we meet a test measuring our cash flow relative to our required interest payments. This
indenture also allows us to incur debt under our senior credit facility. The indenture for our convertible notes does not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. All of the borrowings under our senior credit facility are secured by all
of our assets and those of our subsidiaries, except those of our Chinese operating subsidiary. The addition of new debt to our current debt levels could intensify the debt-related risks that we now face that are described above. 
 3 

The senior credit
facilities and the indenture governing our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes impose limitations on how we conduct
our business; as a result, we may not be able to pursue strategies that could be in the best interests of holders of our stock. The senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on us that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in
planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry. Specifically, these restrictions limit our ability to: 

incur additional debt; 

pay dividends and make other distributions; 

prepay subordinated debt; 

make investments and other restricted payments; 

enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 

create liens; 

sell assets; 

enter into transactions with affiliates; and 

consolidate or merge. Beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2002, the financial covenants under our senior credit facilities consist solely of a
minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio based on a rolling 12 months calculation. As of December 31, 2002, there were no violations of the covenants under the senior credit facilities. As a result of these restrictions,
we may not be able to pursue business strategies that could be in the best interest of the holders of our notes and stock. If we fail to comply with any of the restrictions in the senior credit facilities, a default may also occur under the indenture governing
our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes and any other financing agreements. This default may allow some creditors,
if their respective agreements so provide, to accelerate payments owed on such debt as well as any other indebtedness as to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. The creditors who may be entitled to accelerated payments in
the event of a default are: (1) the holders of our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes issued in the aggregate
principal amount of 165.0 million, under an indenture dated July 29, 1999 by and among us, ChipPAC International Company Limited, and Firstar Bank, N.A. as trustee; and (2) the senior credit facility lenders, including Credit Suisse First Boston,
New York branch, BankBoston N.A., State Street Bank and Trust Company, Balanced High-Yield Fund II Limited, CIBC Inc., First Source Financial LLP, Heller Financial, Inc., The First National Bank of Chicago and IBM Credit Corporation, under our
senior credit facility, dated as of August 5, 1999 by and among the us, ChipPAC International Company Limited, and Credit Suisse First Boston, New York branch as the administrative agent, collateral agent and sole lead arranger for the senior
facility lenders. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate principal amount of the senior credit facility was 86.2 million of which approximately 36.2 million was outstanding. In addition, our lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they
had made to supply us with further funds. An
economic or political crisis in Asia where our manufacturing facilities and most of our suppliers are located could prevent us from meeting the requirements of our customers and result in a decrease in our revenues. 
 4 

Our
manufacturing facilities are located in China, South Korea and Malaysia. Most of our materials suppliers are also located in Asia. For the last two years over half of our substrate costs were incurred from the purchase of materials from South Korean
suppliers. In the future, we expect that a growing portion of these materials will be supplied by sources in China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Several countries in this region have experienced currency devaluation and/or difficulties in financing
short-term obligations. We cannot assure you that the effect of an economic crisis on our suppliers will not impact operations, or that the effect on our customers in that region will not adversely affect both the demand for our services and the
collectibility of receivables. Furthermore, the
region may suffer political unrest as a result of terrorist activity or armed conflict. The terrorist group, Abyu Sayyaf, which has been responsible for several kidnappings, is active in and near Malaysia. There are also other terrorist
organizations which could target United States interests in the region. In addition, North Korea s recent decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and related geopolitical maneuverings may escalate into war or otherwise
adversely affect South Korea. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing facilities and supply sources to other locations. The failure of our vendors to supply sufficient quantities of materials on
a timely basis could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. In addition, we may not be able to pass on any unexpected increase in the cost of these materials to our customers. We obtain materials to fill orders for our packaging and test
services directly from vendors. To maintain competitive packaging operations, we must obtain from our vendors, in a timely manner, sufficient quantities of acceptable materials at expected prices. We source most of our materials, including critical
materials like laminate substrates, lead frames, mold compounds and gold wires, from a limited group of suppliers. We purchase all of our materials on a purchase order basis and have no long-term contracts with any suppliers. From time to time,
vendors have extended lead times or limited the supply of required materials to us because of vendor capacity constraints and, consequently, we have experienced difficulty in obtaining acceptable materials on a timely basis. Our business and results
could be negatively impacted if our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials and other supplies in a timely manner were substantially diminished or if there were significant increases in the cost of materials that we could not pass on to
our customers. If we are unable to obtain capital equipment
in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet the increased demands of our customers which could result in a decrease in our revenues. Our facilities currently have sufficient packaging and test services capacity to meet the current and expected demands of our customers.
Nonetheless, in the event there are significant increases in overall semiconductor demand or demand for some of our products and services, we may not be able to meet those increased demands of our customers. Moreover, because the semiconductor
packaging and test services business requires investment in expensive capital equipment and is characterized, from time to time, by intense demand, limited supply and long delivery cycles, we may not be able to readily increase our operating
capacity. This would lead to a loss of sales of our packaging and test services, could ultimately lead to a loss in market share and have a negative impact on our results of operations. We depend upon intellectual property and license critical technology from third parties in order to develop and provide
advanced packaging technologies and designs for our customers. To the extent these licenses are not perpetual and irrevocable, our net revenues could be materially adversely affected if our rights under these licenses expire or are terminated.
 Our ability to develop and provide advanced
packaging technologies and designs for our customers depends in part on our proprietary know-how, trade secrets and other patented and non-patented, confidential technologies, which we either own or license from third parties. We seek to protect our
proprietary information and know-how through the use of 
 5 

trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We may not obtain patent protection
for the patent applications that we file, or if we are granted patents, those patents may not offer meaningful protection. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop, patent or gain access to similar know-how and
technology, or reverse engineer our packaging services, or that any confidentiality agreements upon which we rely to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology. We have licenses to use numerous third party patents, patent
applications and other technology rights, as well as trademark rights, in the operation of our business. To the extent these licenses are not perpetual and irrevocable, we believe that these licenses are renewable under normal commercial terms once
they expire. However, we may be unable to utilize the technologies under these licenses if they are not extended or otherwise renewed or if any of these licenses are terminated by the licensor due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy. Alternatively,
if we are able to renew these arrangements, we cannot assure you that they will be on the same terms as currently exist. Any failure to extend or renew these license arrangements could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the
packaging services and processes that utilized these technologies. The loss of our skilled technical, marketing and sales personnel or our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our research and development, marketing and sales efforts. Our competitiveness will depend in large part upon whether we
can attract and retain skilled technical, marketing and sales personnel and can retain members of our executive team. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and we may not be 
 6 

successful in attracting and retaining the technical personnel or executive managers we require to develop
new and enhanced packaging and test services and to continue to grow and operate profitably. If we cannot attract or retain skilled personnel, we may not be able to operate successfully in the future. If we encounter future labor problems, we may fail to deliver our products
in a timely manner which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our employees at our Ichon, South Korea facility are represented by ChipPAC Korea Labor Union and are covered by collective bargaining and wage agreements. Both the wage agreement and the collective
bargaining agreement, which covers basic union activities, working conditions and welfare programs, among other things, are effective to May 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 78 of our South Korean employees were represented by the
ChipPAC Korea Labor Union. In addition, one of our Chinese subsidiaries experienced labor protests and a two-day work stoppage in July 1998 in connection with proposed work force reductions. We cannot assure you that issues with the labor union or
other employees will be resolved favorably for us in the future, that we will not experience significant work stoppages in future years or that we will not record significant charges related to those work stoppages. In addition, potential efficiency
enhancement efforts, including personnel reductions, following our acquisition of the Malaysian business may create the risk of labor problems in Malaysia or at other facilities. New laws and regulations, currency devaluation and political instability in foreign countries, particularly in China,
Malaysia and South Korea could make it more difficult for us to operate successfully. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we generated approximately 11.3 , 8.1 and 16.7 of total revenues, respectively, from international markets, primarily from customers in
Southeast Asia and Europe. In addition, all of the facilities currently used to provide our packaging services are located in China, Malaysia and South Korea. Moreover, many of our customers operations are located in countries outside of the
United States. We cannot determine if our future operations and earnings will be affected by new laws, new regulations, a volatile political climate, changes in or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or other consequences of doing
business outside the U.S., particularly in China, Malaysia and South Korea. In particular, we risk terrorism against U.S. companies in Malaysia and the instability that would accompany any type of armed conflict with North Korea. If future
operations are negatively affected by these changes, our sales or profits may suffer. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and profitability. A portion of our costs are denominated in foreign currencies,
like the South Korean Won, the Chinese Renminbi or RMB and the Malaysian Ringgit. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect our costs of goods sold and operating
margins and could result in exchange losses. We cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability. From time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of
exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that any hedging technique we may implement will be effective. If it is not effective, we may experience reduced operating margins. We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if U.S. or
foreign taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws. Our corporate structure is based, in part, on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that
foreign taxing authorities will agree with our interpretations or that they will reach the same conclusions. For example, the Korean National Tax Administration has informed us that it has made an assessment of 
 7 

approximately 13.3 million against us relating to withholding tax collected on a loan between our
subsidiaries in Korea and Hungary. We believe that no withholding on the transaction in question is required under the prevailing tax treaty. We have appealed this assessment and believe it will be overturned. However, our interpretations are not
binding on any taxing authority and, if these foreign jurisdictions were to change or to modify the relevant laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or have the anticipated benefits of our corporate structure materially
impaired. Because the Malaysian business previously operated
as a subsidiary of Intersil, our future financial results may be significantly different from those experienced historically. Prior to our acquisition of our Malaysian business in 2000, it was operated as a subsidiary of Intersil. All the historical revenues of
the Malaysian business represent intercompany sales to Intersil on terms determined by Intersil. Although we expect to retain this business pursuant to a five-year supply agreement with Intersil, volume, product mix and pricing may change in the
future, and we cannot assure you that Intersil will perform under our supply agreement. We entered into supply contracts with Intersil in connection with our acquisition of our Malaysian business and with Fairchild Semiconductor following Fairchild s acquisition of Intersil s discrete power
business, and any decrease in the purchase requirements of Intersil or Fairchild or the inability of Intersil or Fairchild to meet its contractual obligations could substantially reduce the financial performance of our Malaysian subsidiary.
 Historically, the Malaysian business
generated all of its revenues from the sale of products and services to affiliated Intersil companies. The revenue of the Malaysian business for the first six months of 2000 prior to our acquisition of it and for all of 1999 was 41.9 million and
 101.9 million, respectively. As a result of our acquisition of the Malaysian business, we have numerous arrangements with Intersil, including arrangements relating to packaging and test services as a vendor to affiliated Intersil companies and
other services. Any material adverse change in the purchase requirements of Intersil or in its ability to fulfill its other contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our Malaysian subsidiary. Moreover, we may be unable to sell
any products and services to affiliated Intersil companies beyond the term of our five-year supply agreement with Intersil. In connection with Fairchild Semiconductor s acquisition of Intersil s discrete power business, we entered into an assignment
agreement that assigned Intersil s portion of the supply agreement relating to this business to Fairchild. We have also entered into a three-year IT services agreement with Intersil under which the Malaysian business will continue to obtain a
number of these services from Intersil. We cannot assure you that Fairchild will perform under the supply agreement or that Intersil will perform under the supply and services agreements or that upon termination of these agreements we will be able
to obtain similar services on comparable terms. We may not be
able to consummate future acquisitions, and consequences of those acquisitions which we do complete may adversely affect us. We plan to continue to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses. The expense incurred in consummating the future acquisition
of related businesses, or our failure to integrate those businesses successfully into our existing business, could result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. We plan to continue to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses
in the future. We may be unable to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from those acquisitions. Should we successfully acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in
unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be 
 8 

available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Possible future
acquisitions could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
 In addition, we may finance future acquisitions
with additional indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and will, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, have the ability to incur additional indebtedness. We will be required to generate cash flow from
operations to service that indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to service that indebtedness. We may be required to refinance our indebtedness upon its maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will
be able to refinance our indebtedness at all or on terms acceptable to us. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of violence or war, such as war with Iraq, may affect the markets on which our securities trade, the
markets in which we operate, our operations and our profitability. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or United States businesses. These attacks or
hostilities may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. For example, several terrorist groups have called for targeting U.S. interests, including U.S. companies in Southeast Asia. Our current facilities
include administrative, sales, and R D facilities in the United States and manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and South Korea. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult
and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products in the United States and overseas. Also as a result of terrorism, the United States may enter into an armed conflict which could have a further impact on our domestic and
international sales, our supply chain, our production capability and our ability to deliver product to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. In
particular, the United States may enter into an armed conflict with North Korea or on the Korean peninsula, which could affect our suppliers or our manufacturing facilities. War with Iraq may negatively impact the prices of our supplies and the
condition of our national and global economy. The consequences of any of these hostilities are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment. A limited number of persons indirectly control us and may exercise their
control in a manner adverse to your interests. At March 20, 2003, Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd. and its affiliates owned or had the right to acquire 23,854,379 shares or approximately 25.1 of our outstanding Class A common stock. At March 20, 2003, funds
affiliated with Bain Capital, Inc. owned 21,387,396 shares or approximately 22.5 of our outstanding Class A common stock. By virtue of this stock ownership, these entities collectively have substantial power to direct our affairs and
will be able to significantly affect the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of a majority of our directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets
and amendment of our certificate of incorporation. Because a limited number of persons control us, transactions could be difficult or impossible to complete without the support of those persons. It is possible that these persons will exercise their
control over us in a manner adverse to your interests. If our
relationship with Hynix Semiconductor, our previous owner, deteriorates, our business could be adversely affected. Our facilities in Ichon, South Korea occupy a portion of a building located on property owned by Hynix Semiconductor, a current
stockholder and former majority owner. In addition, Hynix Semiconductor is one of our current customers. An 
 9 

unfavorable change in our relations with Hynix Semiconductor could adversely effect services we receive
from them at this facility and the revenue we derive from the products and services we provide to them. Environmental, health and safety laws could require us to incur capital and operational costs to maintain compliance and could impose liability to remedy the effects of hazardous substance
contamination. We are subject to
liabilities and compliance obligations arising under environmental, health and safety laws. These laws impose various controls on the quality of our air and water discharges, on the storage, handling, discharge and disposal of chemicals the company
uses, and on employee exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace. Environmental, health and safety laws could require us to incur capital and operational costs to maintain compliance and could impose liability to remedy the effects of
hazardous substance contamination. We cannot assure you that applicable environmental, health and safety laws will not in the future impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon the company, curtail its
operations, or restrict its ability to expand its operations. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws, the failure to comply with new or existing laws, or issues relating to hazardous substance contamination could subject the
company to future material liability. Risks
Relating to Our Class A Common Stock Our stock price has
fluctuated significantly in the past, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be lower than you expect. Since our initial public offering on August 8, 2000, the closing price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly, ranging
from a low of 0.99 to a high of 18.50 per share. Fluctuations in our stock price could continue. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are: 

quarterly variations in our operating results; 

rating changes by research analysts; 

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions; 

general market conditions; and 

general economic factors unrelated to our performance. The stock markets in general, and the markets for technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility not
necessarily related to the operating performance of particular companies. We cannot provide assurances as to our stock price. Some of our long-time stockholders have the right to require us to register the public sale of their shares; all of our total outstanding shares of
Class A common stock may be sold into the market; future sales of those shares could depress the market price of our Class A common stock. The public market for our Class A common stock includes 11,500,000 shares of Class A common stock that we sold in our initial public
offering, an additional 11,445,600 shares of Class A common stock that we sold to the public in January 2002 and an additional 12,000,000 shares that we sold to the public in May 2002. At the time of our initial public offering, there were
55,631,718 additional shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. Those people and entities who were our stockholders prior to our initial public offering are able to sell their shares in the public market, subject to legal restrictions on
transfer. Some of our stockholders prior to our initial public offering are parties to agreements with us that provide for demand registration rights to cause us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, all or
part of their shares of our Class A common stock, as well as piggyback registration rights. Currently, approximately 46,415,147 shares of our Class A common stock have 
 10 

restrictions on resale and are subject to these registration rights. We believe that all of the other
shares of our Class A common stock are freely tradable. Registration of the sale of these restricted shares of our Class A common stock would permit their sale into the market immediately. If our stockholders sell a large number of shares, the
market price of our Class A common stock could decline, as these sales may be viewed by the public as an indication of an upcoming or recently occurring shortfall in the financial performance of our company. Moreover, the perception in the public
market that these stockholders might sell shares of our Class A common stock could depress the market price of the Class A common stock. As of March 20, 2003, we had 94,983,299 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradeable
without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares which may be held or acquired by an affiliate of our company, as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. We believe that affiliates hold approximately
41,078,535 shares of common stock, and that those shares could only be sold over the next 12 months in accordance with the volume and manner of sale limitations set forth in Rule 144. Provisions of our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay, deter or prevent a
change in control. Provisions of our
certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors and would limit the circumstances in which a premium may be paid for our Class A common stock in proposed transactions, or
a proxy contest for control of the board may be initiated. These provisions provide for: 

a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents; 

a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chief executive officer or the board of directors; 

advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; 

limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal the by-laws; and 

the authority of the board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms as the board may determine. Your right to receive payments on the Class A common stock is junior to the
company s existing and, possibly future, senior and subordinated indebtedness. It is possible, therefore, that you may receive no compensation of any kind relating to the Class A common stock if there is a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar
proceeding affecting us. The Class A common
stock ranks behind all of our existing indebtedness, including our guarantees of our subsidiary s obligations under the senior credit facility and our subsidiary s 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes and our obligations under our 8 convertible subordinated notes. The Class A common stock also ranks behind all of our future borrowings, except any
future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the Class A common stock. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, in a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar
proceeding relating to us or our property, we will have to pay the holders of debt senior to the Class A common stock in full before we can make any payment on the Class A common stock. Moreover, the Class A common stock will be structurally
subordinated to all liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the rights of the holders of the Class A common stock to share in those assets, would be subordinate to
the claims of the subsidiaries creditors. In addition, all payments on the Class A common stock will be blocked in the event of a payment default on our senior and subordinated debt, including borrowings under the senior credit facility, and may be blocked for specified
periods in the event of 
 11 

non-payment defaults on certain senior debt. Risks Relating to Our 8 Convertible Subordinated Notes Your right to receive payments on the 8 convertible subordinated notes is
junior to the company s existing and, possibly future, senior indebtedness. It is possible, therefore, that you may receive no compensation of any kind relating to the notes if there is a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding affecting
us. We may not have sufficient funds to
satisfy our obligations relating to the 8 convertible subordinated notes. The 8 convertible subordinated notes rank behind all of our existing indebtedness, including our guarantees of our subsidiary s obligations under the senior credit
facility and our subsidiary s 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes. The 8 convertible subordinated notes will
also rank behind all of our future borrowings, except any future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the convertible subordinated notes. In total as of December 31, 2002, the amount of our
indebtedness which constitutes senior indebtedness was 201.2 million. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, in a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or our property, we will have to pay the
holders of debt senior to the 8 convertible subordinated notes in full before we can make any payment on the 8 convertible subordinated notes. Moreover, the 8 convertible subordinated notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities,
including trade payables, of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the rights of the holders of the convertible subordinated notes to share in those assets, would be subordinate to the claims of the
subsidiaries creditors. In
addition, all payments on the 8 convertible subordinated notes will be blocked in the event of a payment default on our senior debt, including borrowings under the senior credit facility, and may be blocked for specified periods in the event of
non-payment defaults on certain senior debt. As
a holder of debt securities, you would typically have equal rights to your ratable share, along with all of our suppliers and vendors to which we owe money, who are commonly referred to as trade creditors, and other holders of debt of the same class
as the notes, of any assets remaining after we have paid off all of the debt senior to the notes. However, the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated notes requires that amounts otherwise payable to holders of the convertible
subordinated notes in a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding be paid to holders of debt senior to the convertible subordinated notes instead. Consequently, holders of the 8 convertible subordinated notes may receive less, ratably, than
holders of trade payables or other debt of the same class in this type of proceeding. We are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, which may affect our ability to make payments on the 8 convertible subordinated notes. All of our manufacturing services are conducted through our
subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the 8 convertible subordinated notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. In addition, we depend on the distribution of earnings, loans or other
payments by our subsidiaries to us. Our
subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the 8 convertible subordinated notes. Our subsidiaries are not required to provide us with funds for our payment obligations,
whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our
subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change in control offer required by the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated 
 12 

notes. If the company undergoes a change in control (as defined in the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated notes) we may need to
refinance large amounts of our debt, including our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes, these 8 convertible
subordinated notes and borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility. If a change in control occurs, we must offer to buy back the 8 convertible subordinated notes for a price equal to 100.0 of the principal amount of the 8 convertible
subordinated notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds available for us to make any required repurchases of the 8 convertible subordinated notes upon a change in control. In addition, our
senior revolving credit facility will prohibit us from repurchasing the 8 convertible subordinated notes until we first repay the senior revolving credit facility in full and the indenture governing our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes requires us to meet financial tests before prepaying subordinated debt like the 8 
convertible subordinated notes. If we fail to repurchase the 8 convertible subordinated notes in that circumstance, we will go into default under the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated notes and by virtue of the cross-default
provisions contained in the notes, the senior revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 12 3 / 4 
senior subordinated notes. A change in control for purposes of the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated notes may also constitute a change in control under the indenture governing our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes, which would require that we offer to buy back the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes prior to these notes. Any future debt which we incur may also contain restrictions on repayment upon a change in control. If any change in control
occurs, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy all of the company s debt obligations. These buyback requirements may also delay or make it harder for others to effect a change in control. However, certain other
corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase our level of indebtedness, would not constitute a change in control under the indenture governing the 8 convertible subordinated notes. Federal and state laws allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void
debts and require holders of debt securities to return payments received from debtors. All of the net proceeds from the initial private placement of the 8 convertible subordinated notes were used to repay our existing senior credit facility. If a bankruptcy proceeding or a lawsuit is
initiated by the company s unpaid creditors, the debt which we incurred to repay our existing credit facility, including the notes, may be reviewed under federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws. Under
these laws, the debt of the company could be voided, or claims in respect of the debt could be subordinated to all other debt if, among other things, the company: 

received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such debt; 

was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; 

was engaged in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the company constituted unreasonably small capital; or 

intended to incur, or believed that the company would incur, debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. In addition, you may be required to return to fund for the
benefit of creditors, any payments received from us in respect of the 8 convertible subordinated notes. The measures of insolvency will vary depending upon the fraudulent transfer law applied in any proceeding to determine whether such a
transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a debtor would be considered insolvent if: 
 13 

the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; 

the present fair saleable value of its assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on existing debts, including contingent
liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or 

it could not pay its debts as they become due. On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that we are not insolvent, do not
have unreasonably small capital for the business in which we are engaged and have not incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such obligations as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making such
determination, or that a court would agree with our conclusion in this regard. We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the 8 convertible subordinated notes. There has been no public market for the 8 convertible subordinated notes. In addition, both the liquidity and the market price quoted for
these notes may be adversely affected by changes in the price of our Class A common stock, changes in the overall market for convertible securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects, or in the prospects for companies in our
industry generally. In particular, the price of our 8 convertible subordinated notes may fluctuate with our stock price since the notes are convertible into stock. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active or stable trading market will
develop or continue for these 8 convertible subordinated notes. We also cannot guarantee that the 8 convertible subordinated notes will trade in the same or like manner as our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes. Risks Relating to Our 12 3 / 4 Senior
Subordinated Notes ChipPAC International Company
Limited does not have an independent source of income from which to satisfy obligations of the 12 3 / 4 senior
subordinated notes. ChipPAC
International Company Limited or ChipPAC International will rely on intercompany loans through its direct and indirect subsidiaries to satisfy obligations of its indebtedness; as a result, if these subsidiaries are not able to make payments on these
intercompany loans, we may not be able to pay our noteholders interest on the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes
when due. The only source of cash for
ChipPAC International to pay principal and interest on the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes will be through
payments of interest and principal on intercompany notes, capital contributions from the parent company or dividends or distributions from ChipPAC International s subsidiaries, which dividends or distributions would be funded through payments
on intercompany notes. We will rely principally on funds generated by ChipPAC International s operating subsidiaries to fund payments on the notes and other indebtedness. If these subsidiaries are unable to make payments on their intercompany
loans, we may not be able to satisfy obligations under our debt instruments, including payment of interest on the senior revolving credit facility and these 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes. Our ability to pay our obligations under the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes may be reduced because ChipPAC International s Chinese operating subsidiary, which holds 27.7 of our consolidated assets and generated 18.6 of our consolidated
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, is not a guarantor of the notes. Our Chinese subsidiary is not a guarantor of the notes. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the total revenue for our Chinese subsidiary was 67.8 million, representing approximately 18.6 of our
consolidated revenue. Our Chinese subsidiary had combined assets of approximately 130.1 million at December 31, 2002, representing approximately 27.7 of our consolidated assets. 
 14 

Claims of
creditors of our Chinese operating subsidiary, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or a guarantee issued by this subsidiary, will generally have priority on the assets and earnings of this subsidiary, over
the claims of creditors of our company, including holders of our 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes, even if the
obligations of our Chinese operating subsidiary do not constitute senior indebtedness. Since our Chinese subsidiary will not guarantee the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes, holders of the notes will have to rely solely on dividends or distributions from the company s Korean, Malaysian and British Virgin Islands subsidiaries to satisfy
their respective obligations under the notes should our Chinese subsidiary be unable to make dividends or distributions. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes. If the company undergoes a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes) we may need to refinance large amounts of our debt, including the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes and borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility. If a change of control
occurs, we must offer to buy back the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes for a price equal to 101 of the
principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds available for us to make any required repurchases of the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes upon a change of control. In addition, our senior revolving credit facility will prohibit us from repurchasing the notes until
we first repay the senior revolving credit facility in full. If we fail to repurchase the 12 3 / 4 senior
subordinated notes in that circumstance, we will go into default under both the indenture governing the notes and the senior revolving credit facility. Any future debt which we incur may also contain restrictions on repayment upon a change of
control. If any change of control occurs, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy all of the company s debt obligations. These buyback requirements may also delay or make it harder for others to effect a change of
control. However, certain other corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase our level of indebtedness, would not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the notes.
 We cannot assure you that
an active trading market will develop or continue for the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes.
 The 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes are publicly traded but do not necessarily trade actively. In addition, both the
liquidity and the market price quoted for these notes may be adversely affected by changes in the price of our Class A common stock, changes in the overall market for convertible securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects,
or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active or stable trading market will develop or continue for these 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes. We also cannot guarantee that the 12 3 / 4 senior subordinated notes will trade in the same or like manner as our 8 convertible subordinated notes.
