 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder
of Residential Funding Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion about Residential Funding Corporation's
(the "Company") compliance with the minimum servicing standards identified in
their role as Master Servicer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004,
included in the accompanying management assertion (see Exhibit 1). Such
assertion was examined relating to those mortgage loans included in the listing
of mortgage loans and series of certificates included in the attached Exhibit 2.
Our testing procedures were applied only to the series of certificates serviced
on or before September 30, 2004. Direct servicing functions are performed by
various primary servicers and subservicers. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's
compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Loans and series of certificates
subject to such procedures were selected using sampling methods, and
accordingly, we make no representation that our examination procedures were
performed on a specific series of loans or certificates as listed in the
attached Exhibit 2. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended December
31, 2004 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
