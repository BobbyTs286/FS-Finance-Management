ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH 
 APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company provides this platform-level assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 
 
 Platform : Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). 
 
 Period : Twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (the Period ). 
 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled Not Applicable To Platform in Appendix 1 attached hereto. 
 
 With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criterion. Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations Interpretation 17.06 ). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criterion. 

With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 
 1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 
 2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 
 3. Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria other than as identified on Schedule A attached. 
 
 4. Schedule B attached includes Management s discussion of the material instances of noncompliance noted in Schedule A, including remediation efforts taken by the Company. 
 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareowner of 
 Protective Life Insurance Company: 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria that Protective Life Insurance Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Protective Life Secured Trust Notes (the Platform), as of December 31, 2013 and for the year then ended, excluding (i) the criteria which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the Platform and (ii) the servicing activities that are applicable to the Platform but are excluded from the scope of management s assertion and are not reported on herein, as indicated in Appendix A of Management s Assertion on Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria. Appendix B to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors: 
 The Bank of New York Mellon 
 BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware 
 The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.: 
 
 We have examined the compliance of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust, Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e. transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s compliance based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As described in the Company s Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations Interpretation 17.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criterion as described in its Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06. 
 
 Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) and 1122(d)(3)(ii), as applicable to the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 as follows: 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A), certain reports to investors were not prepared in accordance with the timeframes and other terms set forth in the related transaction agreements. 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii), certain distributions to investors were not remitted in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements. 
 
 In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described above, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. 
 
 We do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on Schedule B, Management s Discussion on Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company , to the Company s Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.
