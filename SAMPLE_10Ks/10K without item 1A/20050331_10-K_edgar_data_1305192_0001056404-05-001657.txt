Report of Independent Accountants

Board of Directors
LaSalle Bank Corporation

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying report
titled Report of Management, that ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. (AAMG, a wholly
owned subsidiary of LaSalle Bank Corporation) complied with the servicing
standards identified in Exhibit A to the Report of Management (the "specified
minimum servicing standards") as set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association
of America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP)
during the year ended December 31, 2004. Management is responsible for AAMG's
compliance with those specified minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the AAMG's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the AAMG's compliance with the
specified minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on AAMG's compliance with the specified minimum servicing
standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the AAMG complied with the
aforementioned specified minimum servicing standards during the year ended
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Mortgage Company:

We have examined management's assertion that Fifth Third Mortgage Company
(the "Company") has complied as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004,
with its established minimum servicing standards for residential mortgage loans
described in the accompanying Management's Assertion dated March 8, 2005.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion about the Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with its minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with its minimum servicing
standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects based on the
criteria set forth in Appendix I.

Independent Accountants' Report

The Board of Directors
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Assertion of Management of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a division of Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Company), that the Company complied with the minimum
servicing standards set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. Management is responsible for
the Company's compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards specified above
and performing such other procedures, as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2004 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

following:

 In certain circumstances, the mortgage interest rate changes on certain Home
 Equity Lines of Credit were not adjusted at the appropriate date in
 accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents. This resulted in the
 mortgagor being overcharged for the period from the interest rate change

 month. This error was identified by Management and the systemic issue that

 issuance of this letter.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company had in effect a
fidelity bond in the amount of 25,000,000 for a single loss limit and an
