PART I

Item 1. Business

 Richton International Corporation (the "Company" or "Richton") is a
diversified service company with two operating subsidiaries, Century Supply
Corp. ("Century") and CBE Technologies, Inc. ("CBE").

 Century is a leading full-service wholesale distributor of sprinkler
irrigation systems, outdoor lighting and decorative fountain equipment,
headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan. Its branches serve customers in 33
States mostly in the eastern half of the country and Ontario, Canada. During
1998, Century acquired several distributors in Utah, Idaho and opened a branch
in Oregon. Irrigation products have historically been sold by manufacturers
primarily through wholesale distributors and Century is a leading distributor of
irrigation equipment in the geographic areas it serves. Century is currently a
distributor for the leading original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of turf
irrigation equipment in the United States.

 Century's primary customers are irrigation and landscape contractors who
install irrigation systems for commercial, residential and golf course watering
systems. Approximately 93 of revenues are derived from irrigation products,
with the remaining 7 from lighting and fountains. Century represents more than
60 suppliers and provides a complete product line to approximately 15,300
customers through more than 100 branches.

 Century is organized into six geographical regions, each with a regional
team that manages branches within a specific geographic area. Purchasing,
accounts receivable, accounting and cash management are centralized functions.
Close control is maintained over receivables, inventory and other key factors
through a centralized order entry management information system. All branches
are linked to the on-line system, and substantially all of Century's business is
conducted in a real time order entry environment.

 Century's operations constitute a material portion of Richton's business.
Although Century has a history of operating profitably, its business is impacted
by both the economic and climatic conditions in the geographic areas where its
branches are located. Since irrigation and landscape contractors are Century's
primary customers, business is best when commercial and residential construction
is strong and general economic conditions and consumer confidence are favorable.
Weather is also a significant non-controllable element affecting Century's
business. Business is better during warm dry periods, especially in spring and
early summer months and when general construction is strong. Climatic factors
that can adversely affect Century principally relate to above-average rainfall
during the primary selling season or other unusual weather-related conditions.
Century's geographic diversity makes it much less susceptible to weather than
many of its competitors who operate in a more limited geographic area. Century
has mitigated some of the impact of both economic and climatic conditions by
pursuing an aggressive growth program. By opening or acquiring branches (see
Competition) in new areas and continuing to grow its business in existing
markets, Century has created both geographic diversity and consistent growth.
Even so, seasonality causes a significant disparity in quarterly sales and
results.

 CBE headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with offices in New York, Los
Angeles and Portland, Maine is a systems integrator providing network
consulting, design, and installation; network management and related support;
technical services outsourcing; comprehensive hardware maintenance; and
equipment sales.

 CBE's technical certifications include: Novell Platinum reseller,
Microsoft Channel partner, Cisco Premier, Novell Authorized Training Center, as
well as a Novell Authorized Service Center.

 Physical resources include a fully integrated network lab with a
functioning model of most computer operating systems; a network management lab
to support remote management; and training labs at both the Boston and Portland
sites to support in-house training programs.

 CBE is also an authorized service and warranty center for most of the
leading Personal Computer ("PC") manufacturers including IBM, Compaq, Hewlett
Packard, Apple, AST, and services most every other make of PC and printers. The
field staff is supported by a fully automated call control and dispatch center;
a parts depot with an extensive inventory; and a complete diagnostic/repair lab
for PC's, printers and monitors.

 CBE's business is impacted by technological changes both in software and
hardware. There can be no assurance that CBE can (a) continue to maintain the
highly qualified and experienced technicians and engineers, and (b) that those
technicians continue to remain technically proficient in an environment in which
technology changes occur regularly.

1

Suppliers

 Century maintains a broad base of suppliers that enables the Company to
offer a wide range of irrigation equipment. Products are obtained from more than
60 suppliers with no one supplier comprising more than 30 of average annual
purchases. Century has master distributor agreements in place with Rain Bird,
Hunter, Irritrol Systems and Legacy by Hunter Golf as well as with other OEM
suppliers that authorize Century as a distributor of their products for specific
geographic areas. These agreements are renewable annually, and there is no
assurance that these agreements will be renewed. Therefore, Century's business
is subject to change in these distribution agreements with manufacturers or in
manufacturers pursuing alternate channels of distribution. However, Century
maintains excellent vendor relations with these suppliers and management
believes the wholesale distribution channel will continue to be the dominant
professional channel for the irrigation industry.

 CBE acquires its products from OEM suppliers as well as wholesalers and
distributors, such as Tech Data Corporation, Ingrim Micro, and Gates Arrow
Electronics.

Competition

 Historically, irrigation distribution, like the wholesale distribution
industry in general, has been fragmented with many small distributorships
serving specific geographic markets. However, the more recent trend in
distribution has been one of consolidation, where larger wholesaler chains have
been created as a result of mergers and acquisitions and distributors moving
into new territories to expand market share and achieve economies of scale.
Within the irrigation industry, Century has been a leader in the trend toward
consolidation.

 During the period of Richton ownership, Century has grown from 29 branches
and 43 million in sales in 1993 to more than 94 branches and 125 million in
sales in 1998. Since Century has a sophisticated computer system supporting its
branch operations and most of its administrative functions are centralized,
Century has been able to achieve significant economies of scale as a result of
consolidation and growth.

 This growth has resulted in Century facing different competitors in almost
every market it serves. Century competes with these other distributors by
providing local warehousing linked to a centralized computer system that enables
Century customers to get product when they need it, and by providing value-added
services, such as design assistance, training seminars, incentive programs and
sales leads to its customers. Century also competes against large discount
stores and plumbing supply companies that sell irrigation products, which may be
at lower prices, but who do not provide the range of services that Century
offers. While some of its competitors in specific markets are larger than the
corresponding Century operations, it is management's belief that none are larger
when only the irrigation business is considered.

 CBE competes in maintenance service with many companies, both larger and
smaller than CBE. Larger companies generally are OEM suppliers that also provide
network installation and maintenance services and offer a broader line of
product and service than CBE.

Employee Relations

 At December 31, 1998, the Company employed approximately 585 full-time
employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement.

 The Company considers its people to be one of its greatest assets and
provides training courses on sales, product features and benefits, management
skills, and communication. This has created an effective, knowledgeable and
self-motivated work force with a strong focus on customer service.

Working Capital

 Century's business is seasonal due principally to the fact that irrigation
systems are normally installed during warm weather and a majority of Century's
branches are located in the northern half of the United States. As a result,
Century's monthly and quarterly sales, operating results and working capital
requirements fluctuate significantly. Century relies on short-term borrowing to
finance its working capital needs. During the first quarter, Century's working
capital requirements are at minimum, with short-term borrowings of approximately
 25 million, a significant increase from prior years due principally to the
added branch operations. Beginning in April borrowing requirements expand. By
July short-term borrowings will increase to approximately 40 million. During
the 

2

remaining months receivable balances are liquidated, releasing substantial
amounts of cash that may be used to reduce short-term borrowing. (See Note 7 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's
credit line.)

 At December 31, 1998 working capital decreased approximately .8 million
to 6.5 million from 7.3 million in the prior year. This decline was attributed
primarily to added debt associated with the acquisitions and the related
goodwill, net of amortization, of 1.4 million in 1998. In 1997 acquisitions
were nearly all funded internally and the comparable amount was .6 million in
net goodwill charges.

Business Acquisitions

 On March 29, 1995 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Century, acquired all the operating assets and business of CBE for 5.0 million,
plus assumption of certain liabilities, which was financed by bank borrowings of
 3.0 million, a 1.0 million unsecured promissory note to the former owners and
a 1.0 million note to the Chairman of Richton. The note to the Chairman was
subject to a fairness opinion of an independent advisor chosen by Richton's
Board of Directors. The note to the former owners, which is guaranteed by both
Century and Richton, is to be paid over the next two years.

 During 1998 Century acquired five different distributor operations in four
different markets. Northern New Jersey, Idaho, Utah and Florida for 6.4
million. The acquisitions were made for cash and were financed by its working
capital line, recording 4.2 million in tangible net assets. Century also opened
a branch in Oregon as well as fourteen new branches in existing markets. Similar
to past experience, several of these acquisitions were made primarily after the
prime selling season.

Liquidity

 The Company's financial condition continues to improve. The net worth as
of December 31, 1998 has increased to 11.9 million. At December 31, 1998, the
Company's long-term debt was approximately 6.5 million, including 4.5 million
of senior secured debt owed to a Michigan bank. Of the balance of the
outstanding debt, 0.7 million is owed to Fred R. Sullivan, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Richton, which is payable through April, 2000. Notes issued
to Mr. Sullivan were subject to a fairness opinion issued by an independent
advisor chosen by Richton's Board of Directors. The bank debt provides for a
loan covenant that precludes distribution of funds to stockholders.

 Though the Company has continued to generate sufficient cash to liquidate
its term and subordinated debt as it becomes due, and make acquisitions
necessary for it's growth, there is no assurance, given the high degree of
leverage, the seasonality of its principal business, and the strong construction
economy that existed in 1998, that it can continue to do so in the future.

ITEM 2. Properties

 Richton's executive offices at 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York are
subject to a five-year lease which expires in 2003. Century's principal offices
are in Madison Heights, Michigan, under a lease that expires in October 2000. In
addition, Century leases warehouse and sales space in its other branches. The
aggregate of such leased space is approximately 377,000 square feet. Expiration
dates extend to July 2006. Seven of these facilities are leased from the former
owner of Century under a lease agreement, which approximates current market
value. These leases expire in October 2000. One facility is leased from a
partnership, which includes the President of Century. The lease, which is
currently on an annual basis, approximates current market value. In addition,
during 1997 Century acquired a 10,000 square foot facility in Sarasota, Florida,
which it had previously leased. In 1998 Century acquired a 3000-sq. ft. facility
in Bay City, MI which it had previously leased. CBE's principal offices are
located in Boston, Massachusetts. This office is leased under an agreement,
which expires in June 2000. CBE leases approximately 10,000 square feet of
additional office space at its other locations. Richton believes that its
properties are adequately equipped, maintained and suited to the purpose for
which they are used.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations

 The following information should be read along with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto on pages F-2 through F-13.

 This report contains forward-looking statements. The matters expressed in
such statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including but
not limited to general economic and climatic conditions in the markets in which
Richton and its subsidiaries operate, fluctuation in demand for the products and
services offered by these subsidiaries, and current expectations of the Company
or its management. Should one or more of those uncertainties or risks
materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual
results may vary materially from those described as forward-looking statements.
The Company does not intend to update those forward-looking statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1998 Compared with 1997

 Sales for the year ended December 31, 1998 were 147.9 million, an
increase of 41.4 million or approximately 38.9 over the 1997 amount of 106.5
million. Century contributed 38.2 million of this increase due largely to
favorable economic and weather conditions in most of its market areas and to
geographical expansion relating to acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of
1997. Presently, Century has more than 100 branches. CBE's sales in 1998 have
increased more than 16.0 over 1997 levels principally due to market growth.

 Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1998 was 40.8 million, an
increase of 10.6 million or approximately 35.1 over the 1997 amount of 30.2
million. This increase is due primarily to the higher sales noted above. The
overall gross profit percentage of sales declined slightly to 27.6 due in part
to the overall competitive conditions in the irrigation market.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December
31, 1998 increased 8.5 million or 34.4 of sales to 33.2 million from 24.7
million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The full year effect of the
geographical expansion resulting from acquisitions made during 1997 at Century
noted above accounted for a major portion of this increase.

 Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased .3
million to 1.6 million. This increase reflects the higher borrowings under the
line of credit facility incurred in carrying the higher working capital.

 The federal, state and foreign income tax provision for the year ended
December 31, 1998 was 2.4 million, an increase of approximately .6 million
from last year. The higher taxes are due to higher income.

 As a result of the foregoing, net income for the year ended December 31,
1998 was 3.53 million, or 1.06 per share-diluted. This compares with 2.29
million or .68 per share-diluted reported for the year ended December 31, 1997.

1997 Compared with 1996

 Sales for the year ended December 31, 1997 were 106.5 million, an
increase of 18.7 million or approximately 21 over the 1996 amount of 87.8
million. Century contributed 13 million of this increase due largely to
favorable economic and weather conditions in most of it's market areas and to
geographical expansion-principally in the East and South East sections of the
country. In 1997, Century had 65 branches. CBE's sales in 1997 have increased
more that 40 over 1996 levels principally due to expansion through the
acquisition made a year ago in Maine and in Los Angeles, California.

 Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1997 was 30.2 million an
increase of 5.4 million or approximately 22 over the 1996 amount of 24.8
million. This increase is due primarily to the higher sales noted above. The
overall gross profit percentage of sales remained about 28.3 .

6

Selling, general and administration expenses for the year ended December
31, 1997 increased 3.8 million or 18.1 to 24.7 million from 20.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 1996. The full year effect of the geographical
expansion noted above accounted for a portion of this increase.

 Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased .1
million or nearly 10 to 1.3 million over the year earlier period of 1.2
million. This increase reflects the higher borrowings under the line of credit
facility incurred in carrying the higher working capital, partially offset by a
slightly lower borrowing rate.

 The federal, state and foreign income tax provision for the year ended
December 31, 1997 was 1.9 million, a increase of approximately 1.0 million
from last year. The higher tax is principally due to higher income.

 As a result of the foregoing, net income for the year ended December 31,
1997 was 2.29 million, or .68 per share-diluted. This compares with 1.77
million or .54 per share-diluted reported for the year ended December 31, 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The Company's financial condition continues to improve. The net worth as
of December 31, 1998 has increased to 11.9 million. The Company's long term
debt -- including the current position -- at December 31, 1998 was 6.5 million,
a decrease of .9 million from December 31, 1997.

 The Company continues to rely on short-term borrowings to finance its
working capital. During the first quarter of each year, Century's working
capital requirements are at a low point, with short-term borrowings of 25.0
million a significant increase from prior year due principally to the increase
in the number of branches and markets served by Century. During the second
quarter working capital requirements begin to expand and by July of each year
the amount necessary to carry the working capital expands to approximately 40.0
million. From July through the remainder of the year, receivable balances are
liquidated, releasing substantial amounts of cash that may be used to reduce
short-term debt. The operating profits before interest and taxes of the Company
improved to 7.5 million from 5.5 million last year. The Company was thus able
to retire nearly .9 million of term and subordinated debt which came due during
the year and partially fund 6.4 million on acquisitions of businesses in new
markets. At December 31, 1998 working capital was 6.5 million, a decrease of
approximately .7 million from last year. This decline was partially attributed
to the higher debt associated with the acquisitions and the related intangibles
costs which in 1998 amounted to a net increase of 1.4 million as compared to a
net increase of .6 million in 1997 when, due to the lower level of acquisition
expenditure, funding was internally provided. It is expected that the Company
will continue to rely on short-term borrowings to fund its future growth which
will increase the Company's leverage. However, because the Company expects to
continue to reinvest its available funds, the amount of debt will grow at a
slower rate than the growth in assets.

 While the Company has continued to generate sufficient cash to liquidate
its term and subordinated debt as it becomes due, and make acquisitions
necessary for its growth, there is no assurance, given the high degree of
financing leverage, the potential for continued growth in this leverage, the
seasonality of its principal business, and the strong construction economy that
it can continue to do so in the future.

Year 2000

 The year 2000 issue exists because many computer systems and applications,
including those imbedded in equipment and facilities, use two digit rather than
four digit date fields to designate an applicable year. As a result, the systems
and applications may not properly recognize the year 2000 or process data which
includes it, potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or
operational malfunctions or failures.

 Each of the Company's operating subsidiaries uses systems software
acquired from an established software vendor. In each case the vendor has
indicated that the software being supplied is year 2000 compliant. In the case
of Century, their operating computer environment uses a proxy for a date rather
than the actual date -thus there is no double zero problem to deal with that
would be subject to misinterpretations or miscalculation. CBE has received a
"Y2K Compliance Certificate" from American Micro Innovations, Inc. the vendor of
their general ledger systems and its supporting modules. Despite the assurance,
the Company will test these systems during the 3rd quarter of 1999.

 Both Century and CBE communicate with their suppliers through EDI.
Century, however, does not receive its third party data directly into its
operating systems but rather it converts such data before it is internally
processed, avoiding the opportunity for contamination of their system. CBE
recently tested their EDI transmission with several

7

of their largest vendors and found the systems compliant. Century and CBE are
continuing to work with their suppliers, however should any supplier or vendor
be unable to achieve year 2000 compliance by September 30, 1999, the Company
intends to switch to other suppliers that are able to provide year 2000
compliance. The Company does not expect to incur any material additional cost to
achieve year 2000 compliance.

 The Company's ability to be completely compliant is, of course, dependant
upon the ability of its vendors, suppliers, bankers and other fiduciaries to
also be compliant. In addition, the Company can not guarantee that third parties
upon whom the Company depend for essential services, such as electric utilities,
and telephone and other interchange carriers, will convert their critical
systems and processes in a timely manner. Failure or delay by any of these
parties could disrupt the Company's businesses. The Company has established a
supplier compliance program to minimize such risks.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Richton International Corporation:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Richton
International Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Richton
International Corporation and subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

RICHTON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of Business:

 Richton International Corporation ("Richton") is a holding company with
two principal subsidiaries, Century Supply Corp. ("Century") and CBE
Technologies Inc ("CBE"), collectively the "Company". Century is a leading
full-service wholesale distributor of sprinkler irrigation systems, outdoor
lighting and decorative fountain equipment. Branches serve customers in 33
states mostly in the eastern United States and in Ontario, Canada. Irrigation
products have historically been sold by manufacturers primarily through
wholesale distributors. Century is a major distributor in the United States for
all of the leading original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the irrigation
systems field.

 CBE Technologies, Inc. ("CBE") is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts
with satellite offices located in New York, Los Angeles and Portland, Maine. CBE
is a Systems Integrator providing network consulting, design, and installation;
network management and related support; technical services outsourcing;
comprehensive hardware maintenance; and equipment sales. CBE's technical
certifications include; Novell Platinum reseller, Microsoft Channel partner,
Banyan Enterprise/Network dealer, Novell authorized Training Center, and a
Novell Authorized Service Center.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

 Principles of Consolidation--The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Richton and all wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

 Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents--Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

 Allowance For Doubtful Accounts--The Company provides an allowance for
doubtful accounts arising from operations of the business, based upon a specific
review of certain outstanding amounts and historical experience.

 Inventories--The Company values inventory, which consists entirely of
finished goods, at the lower of cost or market using the first-in first-out
("FIFO") method of accounting.

 Goodwill--Goodwill shown in the consolidated balance sheets at December
31, 1998 and 1997 relates to multiple acquisitions completed during the last
four years. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 15
years.

 Other Intangibles--Other intangibles consist principally of amounts paid
to sellers of businesses acquired subject to non-compete agreements and are
being amortized over periods of 1-5 years. Cost allocated primarily to
non-compete agreements were 2,025,000 and 1,115,000 at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. Accumulated amortization was 352,000 and 287,000 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

 Long-Lived Assets--The provisions of SFAS No. 121 "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long Lived Assets" requires, among other things, that an entity
review its long-lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment
whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. The Company continually evaluates whether events
and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful
life of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, may not be
recoverable. As a result of this review, management does not believe there is
any impairment of its long-lived assets at December 31, 1998.

RICHTON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued

 Revenue Recognition--Revenue from sales and services are recorded at the
time the product is shipped to the customer or the service to be billed is
completed. The Company reports its sales levels on a net basis, which is
computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and
an amount established for anticipated returns.

 Sales Returns--The Company reports its sales levels on a net sales basis,
with net sales being computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual
sales returns and the amount of reserves established for anticipated sales
returns.

 Deferred Income--Deferred income represents cash received from customers
related to service contracts that extend for specified periods of time, less
than one year. Income is recognized proportionally over the life of the
contract.

 Income Taxes--The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". This statement requires the Company
to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.

 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation--The Company has elected to
account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed
in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock issued to
Employees," and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the Company's stock at the date of grant over the amount the employee must pay
to acquire the stock and is recorded in the accompanying statements of income.
The Company has provided pro forma disclosure of the fair value at the date of
grant of stock options granted during 1998, 1997 and 1996 in Note 10, in
accordance with the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation".

 Comprehensive Income--In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No.130
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components in a full set of financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS No.
130 during 1998. The Company's comprehensive income consists of a cumulative
translation adjustment of 130,000. Total comprehensive income has not been
presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements as the impact is
not material to the consolidated financial statements.

 Derivative Instruments--In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 1999 and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period
financial statements. The Company does not presently make material use of
derivative instruments.

 Reclassification--Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to
conform with current year presentations.

3. Acquisitions:

 During 1998, Century acquired five different distributor operations in
four different markets: Northern New Jersey, Idaho, Utah and Florida for an
aggregate purchase price of 6.4 million. The acquisitions were made in cash and
were financed by its working capital line. As a result of these acquisitions,
the Company recorded 4.2 million of tangible net assets. Century also opened a
branch in Oregon as well as 14 other branches in existing markets. Similar to
past experience, these acquisitions were made primarily after the prime selling
season.

 Pension expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income for
this Plan was 37,000 in 1997 and 1996 and 155,000 in 1995.

 Century and CBE have Tax Deferred Savings Plans under Section 401 (k) (the
"Plans") of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plans allows employees to defer up to
15 of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the
Plans. Under the provisions of the Plans, Century has elected to contribute, for
every dollar the employee contributes, 50 of the employee's amount, up to 4 
of eligible compensation. Century may also make discretionary contributions. The
charge to income for employer contributions to the Century Plan was
approximately 361,000, 285,000, and 224,000 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Century's discretionary contribution to the

 The Company has as part of its 1990 Long-Term Compensation Plan, a Stock
Option Plan ("the Plan"). Richton accounts for this plan under APB Opinion No.
25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation cost
for this plan been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123 for options granted
subsequent to January 1995 , the Company's net income and earnings per share
would have been as follows:

 The Company may grant options for up to 415,000 shares under the Plan. The
Company has granted options representing 315,000 shares through December 31,
1998. Options are granted over terms not to exceed ten years. Under the Plan,
the option exercise price equals the stock's market price on date of grant
except for options granted the Chairman of the Board. The exercise price for Mr.
Sullivan's options are at 110 of the current market price at date of grant.

 On December 1, 1998 the Company issued a restricted stock grant to the
Chairman of the Board for 20,000 shares subject to certain restrictions as
provided for in the grant. At the time of the grant the market price of the
Company's common stock was 8.50 per share. The value of these shares at the
grant date is included as a separate component of stockholders' equity and a
related compensation charge is being recorded over the vesting period.

11. Net Income Per Share:

 Net income per common share was calculated on the basis of 3,318,000,
3,372,000, and 3,290,000 weighted average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding in the years ending December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.

year. Diluted net income per common share included the effect of options and
warrants computed under the treasury stock method.

12. Long-term Leases and other Commitments:
