PART 1

ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

History
- -------

Apolo Gold & Energy Inc, (the Company) was incorporated in March 1997 under the
laws of the State of Nevada as Apolo Gold Inc., for the purpose of financing and
operating precious metals concessions. In May 2005, the Company amended its
articles of incorporation to change the name of the Company to Apolo Gold &
Energy Inc.

After incorporation in 1997 the Company focused on precious metals opportunities
in Latin and South America. Shortly thereafter the Company formed a subsidiary,
Compania Minera Apologold, C.A. a corporation, and on May 18, 1999 the Venezuela
subsidiary entered into an agreement with Empresa Proyectos Mineros Goldma, C.A.
in Caracas Venezuela, to acquire the diamond and gold mining concession in
Southern Venezuela known as Codsa 13, located in the Gran Sabana Autonomous
Municipality, State of Bolivar, Venezuela. This project was subsequently
cancelled in August 2001 because of poor testing results. The subsidiary company
in Venezuela has been dormant since 2001 and will not be reactivated.

On April 16, 2002, the Company executed an agreement with Pt. Metro Astatama, of
Jakarta, Indonesia, for the mining rights to a property known as Nepal Umbar
Picung ("NUP"), which is located west of Bandar Lampung, on the island of
Sumatra, Indonesia. NUP has a KP, Number KW. 098PP325, which is a mineral
tenement license for both Exploration and Exploitation. All KP's must be held by
an Indonesian entity. The "NUP" is 733.9 hectares in size and Apolo had an 80 
interest. Apolo was entitled to recover all of its development costs on the
"NUP" including property payments before the partner with 20 could participate.
The total purchase price for "NUP" was 375,000. The Company made payments
amounting to 250,000 prior to termination of the project.

After general exploration programs including drilling failed to yield the
necessary Positive results, the Company discussed various options with the
property owner subsequent to its year ending June 30, 2008 and then decided to
terminate its agreement with the NUP property and return all exploration rights
to the property owners.

The Company's office is in North Vancouver B.C.at #12-1900 Indian River Cresc.
V7G 2R1.

Government Regulation
- ---------------------

The Company is not presently subject to any government regulation other than
that of the State of Nevada and pursuant to its obligations under the Securities
Exchange Act. The Company is comfortable with the requirements and regulations
and will abide by them.

Risk Factors
- ------------

1. The Company has no record of earnings. It is also subject to all the risks
inherent in a developing business enterprise including lack of cash flow, and no
assurance of recovery of precious metals.

2. The Company's success and possible growth will depend on its ability to
develop or acquire new business operations.

3. Liquidity and need for additional financing is a concern for the Company. At
the present time, the Company does not have sufficient cash to finance its
operations. The Company is dependent on the ability of its management team to
obtain the necessary working capital to operate successfully. There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital as
required, or if the capital is available, to obtain it on terms favorable to the
Company. The Company may suffer form a lack of liquidity in the future that
could impair its production efforts and adversely affect its results of
operations.

 1
 
4. Competition is more in the area of ability to sell at world prices, that the
Company cannot control, and the Company competes for access to the world markets
with its products.

5. The Company is wholly dependent at the present upon the personal efforts and
abilities of its Officers and Directors, who exercise control over the
day-to-day affairs of the Company.

6. There are currently 80,453,729 common shares outstanding at October 1, 2008
out of a total authorized capital of 200,000,000 shares. The Board of Directors
has the power to issue such shares, subject to Shareholder approval, in some
instances.

7. There are no dividends anticipated by the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders,
Apolo Gold & Energy Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Apolo Gold & Energy Inc. (an
Exploration Stage Company) as of June 30, 2008 and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year ended
June 30, 2008 and for the period from April 16, 2002 (date of inception of the
exploration stage) to June 30, 2008. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require
that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2008 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2008
and for the period from April 16, 2002 (date of inception of the exploration
stage) to June 30, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using accounting
principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company is an exploration stage company and has
incurred substantial losses, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to their planned
financing and other matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

APOLO GOLD & ENERGY, INC.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2008
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc. formerly known as Apolo Gold, Inc. (hereinafter "the
Company") was incorporated in March of 1997 under the laws of the State of
Nevada primarily for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties.
The Company conducts operations primarily from its administrative offices in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 1997, the Company formed a subsidiary
corporation (Apologold C.A.) in Venezuela, which was originally used to acquire
a Venezuelan mining property. The subsidiary has had no financial transactions
since 2001 and is no longer active.

On April 16, 2002, the Company signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture
with PT Metro Astatama, a limited liability corporation, incorporated under the
laws of Republic of Indonesia. Upon signing this agreement, the Company entered
a new exploration stage and commenced exploration of the Napal Gold Property,
not yet under production. See Note 3.

The Company's year-end is June 30.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in
understanding the Company's financial statements. The financial statements and
notes are representations of the Company's management, which is responsible for
their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been
consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

Accounting Method
- -----------------
The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
- --------------------------------
Loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of
shares was calculated by taking the number of shares outstanding and weighting
them by the amount of time that they were outstanding. Basic and diluted loss
per share are the same, as inclusion of common stock equivalents would be
antidilutive.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

APOLO GOLD & ENERGY, INC.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2008
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concentration of Risk
- ---------------------
The Company maintains its cash accounts in primarily one commercial bank in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Canadian dollar account is insured up
to a maximum of 60,000 per account. However, the Company's business checking
account, which is maintained in United States dollars, is not insured.

Derivative Instruments
- ----------------------
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" (hereinafter "SFAS No. 133"), as amended by SFAS No. 137,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB No. 133", and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities", and SFAS No. 149,
"Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. They require that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure
those instruments at fair value.

If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a
hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition
on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair
value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk
or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is
recognized in income in the period of change.

Historically, the Company has not entered into derivatives contracts to hedge
existing risks or for speculative purposes. At June 30, 2008 and 2007, the
Company has not engaged in any transactions that would be considered derivative
instruments or hedging activities.

Estimates
- ---------
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Exit or Disposal Activities
- ---------------------------
In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities" (hereinafter "SFAS No. 146"). SFAS No. 146
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and
reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including
restructuring activities. SFAS No. 146 also addresses recognition of certain
costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease, costs to
consolidate facilities or relocate employees, and termination benefits provided
to employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one-time
benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual
deferred-compensation contract. SFAS No. 146 was issued in June 2002 and is
effective for activities after December 31, 2002. There has been no impact on
the Company's financial position or results of operations from adopting SFAS No.
146.

APOLO GOLD & ENERGY, INC.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2008
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exploration Stage
- -----------------
The Company began a new exploration stage on April 16, 2002 at which time it
commenced the exploration of the Napal Gold Property, including a drilling
program but the property is not yet in production. Subsequent to the year ending
June 30, 2008, the Company terminated its exploration agreement on the NUP
property in Indonesia.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- -----------------------------------
The carrying amounts for cash, notes receivable, accounts payable, loans payable
and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value. The Company is not exposed
to significant interest, credit or currency risk arising from these financial
instruments due to their short term nature.

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------
Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Exchange rate
differences arising on translation are disclosed as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are reflected in the results of operations.

Comprehensive Income
- --------------------
In accordance with SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS 130"),
comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting
stockholder's equity that are excluded from net income, such as unrealized gains
and losses on investments available for sale, foreign currency translation gains
and losses when the Company has a functional currency other than U.S. dollars,
and minimum pension liability. For the year ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 the
Company's financial statements include none of the additional elements that
affect comprehensive income. Accordingly, net income and comprehensive income
are identical.

Going Concern
- -------------
As shown in the financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of
 202,215 for the year ended June 30, 2008 and has an accumulated deficit of
 7,454,854, has no revenues, and has limited cash resources.

These factors indicate that the Company may be unable to continue in existence.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company
cannot continue existence. The Company is actively seeking additional capital
and management believes that new properties can ultimately be developed to
enable the Company to continue its operations. However, there are inherent
uncertainties in mining operations and management cannot provide assurances that
it will be successful in its endeavors.

The Company's management believes that it will be able to generate sufficient
cash from public or private debt or equity financing for the Company to continue
to operate based on current expense projections.

Impaired Asset Policy
- ---------------------
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (hereinafter "SFAS No. 144"). SFAS No. 144
replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of." This standard establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including
discontinued operations.

The Company reviews its long-lived assets quarterly to determine if any events
or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying
value of its assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines impairment by
comparing the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by these
assets to their respective carrying amounts. Maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized. The cost and
related reserves of assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts, and
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in results of operations. As of June 30,
2008 and 2007 no impairment was recognized.

Mineral Exploration and Development Costs
- -----------------------------------------
All exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred. Significant property
acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized. If no
ore body able to be mined is discovered, previously capitalized costs are
expensed in the period the property is abandoned.

Expenditures to develop new mines, to define further mineralization in existing
ore bodies, and to expand the capacity of operating mines are capitalized and
amortized on a units-of-production basis over proven and probable reserves.
Should a property be abandoned, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.
The Company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs
attributable to properties sold. Capitalized costs are allocated to properties
sold based on the proportion of claims sold to the claims remaining within the
project area.

Provision for Taxes
- -------------------
Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (hereinafter "SFAS No. 109"). Under this approach, deferred income taxes
are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax
assets if management does not believe the Company has met the "more likely than
not" standard imposed by SFAS No. 109 to allow recognition of such an asset.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2008
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At June 30, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets calculated at an
expected rate of 33 of approximately 2,468,983 principally arising from
approximate net operating loss carry forward of 7,481,768 for income tax
purposes, which expire in the years 2015 through 2028. As management of the
Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will
realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance equal
to the net deferred tax asset has been recorded. The significant components of
the deferred tax asset at June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 were as follows:

 June 30, June 30,
 2008 2007
 ----------- -----------
Net operating loss carry forward 7,483,685 7,252,639

The change in the allowance account from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2008 was

Site Restoration Costs
- ----------------------
The Company has adopted SFAS No 143, Accounting for Assets Retirement
Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS
No. 143 requires the Company to record a liability for the present value of the
estimated site restoration costs with corresponding increase to the carrying
amount of the related long-lived assets. The liability will be accreted and the
asset will be depreciated over the life of the related assets. Adjustments for
changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or
amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be
made. As at June 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company does not have any site
restoration costs.

Stock-Based Compensation
- ------------------------
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123(revised), "Share-Based Payment", to account
for its stock options and similar equity instruments issued. Accordingly,
compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments
granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the
expected vesting period.

Transactions in which goods or services are received from non-employees in
exchange for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

SFAS 123(revised) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash
inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
Sales are recorded when minerals are delivered to the purchaser, when it has a
written contract and when reasonable assurance exists regarding measurement and
collectability.

Segment Information
- -------------------
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,"
(hereinafter "SFAS No. 131") in the year ended June 30, 2000. SFAS No. 131
supersedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise," replacing the "industry segment" approach with the "management"
approach. The management approach designates the internal organization that is
used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the Company's reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect the Company's results of operations
or financial position. The Company has abandoned its only operating mining
property and has no operating segments at this time.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
- --------------------------------
In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (hereinafter
"SFAS No. 157"). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and
expands disclosure about fair value measurements. This statement applies under
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.
This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but for some
entities, the application of this statement may change current practice. The
adoption of this statement is estimated to have no immediate material effect on
the Company's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (hereinafter :SFAS No. 158"). This statement
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded statues of a
defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize
changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets
of a not for profit organization. This statement also requires an employer to
measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of
financial position, with limited exceptions. The adoption of this statement is
estimated to have no immediate material effect on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations upon adoption.

In February, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.
115" (hereinafter SFAS No. 159"). This statement permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the
opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
accounting provisions. This Statement is expected to expand the use of fair
value measurement, which is consistent with the Board's long-term measurement
objectives for accounting for financial instruments. This statement is effective
as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November
15, 2007, although earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this statement
is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations". This
Statement replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement retains
the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of
accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all
business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business
combination. This Statement also establishes principles and requirements for how
the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in
the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c) determines
what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.
141(R) will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after Company's fiscal year beginning November 1,
2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect
on the Company's financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements". This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish
accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest
in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Company's fiscal year
beginning November 1, 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("FAS
161"). FAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments
and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures
about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and
its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and
cash flows. The guidance in FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with
early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require,
comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of FAS 161.

Indonesia
- ---------
On April 8, 2002, the Company signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture
with PT Metro Astatama, a limited liability corporation, incorporated under the
laws of Republic of Indonesia, who held the rights to explore the property and
Pt Napal Umbar Picung, the owners of the NUP property. The agreement enables the
joint venture to acquire the mining rights on the property known as the Napal
Gold Property, (NUP) located in Sumatra, Indonesia. In exchange for a commitment
for future incremental cash payments totaling 375,000, payable over six years,
and 3,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock, the Company will
receive 734 hectares with a production permit number KW-098PP325 (KP) in place.
Although preliminary sampling on the property indicated the presence of gold,
significant additional work will be required to gain a better overview of the
potential of the property. According to the agreement, the Company will retain
80 percent of the net profits once production commences.

As of June 30, 2008, in accordance with the aforementioned agreement, the
Company had paid 225,000 in cash and issued 3,000,000 shares of its common
stock, with a fair market value of 330,000. The payment due September 15, 2006
was deferred to March 31, 2007 by mutual consent of the parties.. Payments due
since March 15, 2007 have not been made and after consultation with Pt. Umbar
Picung, the Company decided subsequent to the June 30, 2008 year end to
terminate its agreement on the property and return exploration rights to the
property owner.

Nevada
- ------
On September 21, 2005, the Company entered into an Exploration Agreement with
Option for Joint Venture on the "Beowawe Project" in Nevada. This Agreement was
executed with Atna Resources Inc, of Vancouver BC Canada in regard to
exploration on the Beowawe Property located in Lander and Eureka Counties,
Nevada. Under terms of the Agreement, Atna Resources Inc granted the Company the
exclusive right to acquire an undivided 55 interest in the Beowawe Property by
expending a total of 1,700,000 within a four year period. The first year
exploration requirement was 250,000. The Company did not complete the required
work program in the allotted time period and subsequently negotiated a
cancellation of the Agreement signed on February 14, 2007. Under terms of the
cancellation, the Company is required to pay to Atna the sum of 113,520 plus
issue 2,200,000 shares (paid).

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
 Financial Disclosure.

On September 10, 2008 the firm Williams & Webster, P.S. of Spokane, Washington,
resigned as the principal accountant to audit the Registrant's financial
statements. Williams & Webster, P.S., were the auditors of the financial
statements for the fiscal years of the Registrant ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.

Except for the following qualification, the report of Williams & Webster, P.S,
for the fiscal years of the Registrant ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 did not
contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle:

 "The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
 the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to
 the financial statements, the Company has no revenues and limited cash.
 In addition, the Company's significant operating losses raise
 substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
 Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note
 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
 result from the outcome of this uncertainty."

During the fiscal years of the Registrant ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and
through September 10, 2008, there were no disagreements with Williams & Webster,
P.S., on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of Williams & Webster, P.S., would have caused Williams &
Webster, P.S., to make reference thereto in his report on the Registrant's
financial statements for such year.

During the fiscal years of the Registrant ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and
through September 10, 2008, there were no "reportable events" with respect to
the Registrant as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-B.

During the fiscal years of the Registrant ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and
through September 10, 2008, the Registrant did not consult with Williams &
Webster, P.S., with respect to any of the matters or events set forth in Item
304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-B.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive
Officer / Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure
controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e). In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of June 30, 2008, the end of the period of this report, the Company
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer /Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation
of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and
expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management
authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not
intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial
statements would be prevented or detected.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended June 30, 2008, management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our internal controls over financial reporting, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded and reported to the Board of Directors that the design and operation
of our internal controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2008.

There have been no material changes in the Company's internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent
to the date the Company completed its evaluation.

ITEM 9A(T). Controls and Procedures.

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the company's
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's
report in this annual report.

Committees: Meetings of the Board
- ---------------------------------

The Company does not have a separate Compensation Committee, Audit Committee or
Nominating Committee. These functions are done by the Board of Directors meeting
as a whole. The Company's Board of Directors held both in person meetings during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and meetings by telephone. All corporate
actions by the Board of Directors were either consented to in writing by all
Directors or were agreed to unanimously at a meeting where proper notice had
been given and a quorum was present.

Audit Committee
- ---------------

The board of directors has not established an audit committee. The functions of
the audit committee are currently performed by the entire board of directors.
The Company is under no legal obligation to establish an audit committee and has
elected not to do so at this time so as to avoid the time and expense of
identifying independent directors willing to serve on the audit committee. The
Company may establish an audit committee in the future if the board determines
it to be advisable or we are otherwise required to do so by applicable law, rule
or regulation.

As the board of directors does not have an audit committee, it therefore has no
"audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of Item 401(e) of
Regulation S-B. except its chief financial officer. In general, an "audit
committee financial expert" is an individual member of the audit committee who:

 understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial
 statements,
 is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection
 with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves,
 has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial
 statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial
 statements,
 understands internal controls over financial reporting, and
 understands audit committee functions.

Board of Directors Independence

One of the Company's directors is "independent" within the meaning of
definitions established by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
self-regulatory organization. The independent director is David Yu. The Company
is not currently subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or
any portion of its board of directors include "independent" directors.

Director Nominees

The Company does not have a nominating committee. The board of directors,
sitting as a board, selects those individuals to stand for election as members
of our board. Since the board of directors does not include a majority of
independent directors, the decision of the board as to director nominees is made
by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. The board
will consider candidates for directors proposed by security holders, although no
formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Until otherwise
determined, not less than 90 days prior to the next annual board of directors'
meeting at which the slate of board nominees is adopted, the board accepts
written submissions that include the name, address and telephone number of the
proposed nominee, along with a brief statement of the candidate's qualifications
to serve as a director and a statement of why the shareholder submitting the
name of the proposed nominee believes that the nomination would be in the best
interests of shareholders. If the proposed nominee is not the security holder
submitting the name of the candidate, a letter from the candidate agreeing to
the submission of his or her name for consideration should be provided at the
time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a resume supporting the
nominee's qualifications to serve on the board of directors, as well as a list
of references.

 28
 
The board identifies director nominees through a combination of referrals,
including by management, existing board members and security holders, where
warranted. Once a candidate has been identified the board reviews the
individual's experience and background, and may discuss the proposed nominee
with the source of the recommendation. If the board believes it to be
appropriate, board members may meet with the proposed nominee before making a
final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of
management's slate of director nominees submitted for shareholders for election
to the board.

Among the factors that the board considers when evaluating proposed nominees are
their experience in the information technology industry, knowledge of and
experience with and knowledge of and experience in business matters, finance,
capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The board may request additional
information from the candidate prior to reaching a determination. The board is
under no obligation to formally respond to all recommendations, although as a
matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so.

Security Holder Communications with our Board of Directors
- ----------------------------------------------------------

The Company provides an informal process for security holders to send
communications to our board of directors. Security holders who wish to contact
the board of directors or any of its members may do so by writing to Apolo Gold
Inc., #12-1900 Indian River Cres, North Vancouver BC, Canada V7G 2R1

Correspondence directed to an individual board member is referred, unopened, to
that member. Correspondence not directed to a particular board member is
referred, unopened, to the President and CEO.

Code of Ethics
- --------------

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange
Commission's related rules, the Company is required to disclose whether it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to the Company's principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller
or persons performing similar functions. The Company has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to its chief executive officer, chief financial officer and
other officers, legal counsel and to any person performing similar functions.
The Company has made the code of ethics available and intends to provide
disclosure of any amendments or waivers of the code within five business days
after an amendment or waiver on the Company's website wwww.apologold.com.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
- ------------------------------------

The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) provides information
on the compensation programs established for our "Named Executive Officers"
during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. All information provided herein
should be read in conjunction with the tables provided below.

Our Board of Directors is responsible for establishing, implementing and
monitoring the policies governing compensation for our executives. Currently our
Board does not have a compensation committee. Our officers are members of our
Board of Directors and are able to vote on matters of compensation. We are not
currently under any legal obligation to establish a compensation committee and
have elected not to do so at this time. In the future, we may establish a
compensation committee if the Board determines it to be advisable or we are
otherwise required to do so by applicable law, rule or regulation. During the
year ended June 30, 2008 our Board did not employ any outside consultants to
assist in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to executive
compensation, although we have access to general executive compensation
information regarding both local and national industry compensation practices.
In future periods we may participate in regional and national surveys that
benchmark executive compensation by peer group factors such as company size,
annual revenues, market capitalization and geographical location.

The executive employment market in general is very competitive due to the number
of companies with whom we compete to attract and retain executive and other
staff with the requisite skills and experience to carry out our strategy and to
maintain compliance with multiple Federal and State regulatory agencies. Many of
these companies have significantly greater economic resources than our own. Our
Board has recognized that our compensation packages must be able to attract and
retain highly talented individuals that are committed to our goals and
objectives, without at this time paying cash salaries that are competitive with
some of our peers with greater economic resources. Our compensation structure is
weighted towards equity compensation in the form of options to acquire common
stock, which the Board believes motivates and encourages executives to pursue
strategic opportunities while managing the risks involved in our current
business stage, and aligns compensation incentives with value creation for our
shareholders.

Components of Our Executive Compensation Program
- ------------------------------------------------

Our executive compensation program incorporates components we believe are
necessary in order for the Company to provide a competitive compensation package
relative to our peers and to provide an appropriate mix between short-term and
long-term cash and non-cash compensation. Elements of our executive compensation
are listed below:

 o Base Salary
 o Stock Awards
 o Other benefits available to all employees
 o Items specific to our President and Chief Executive Officer per an
 employment agreement

 31

Base Salary: At present we do not have a salary structure for employees and
executives is based on skill set, knowledge and responsibilities. Base salaries
may be established as necessary. During the year ended June 30, 2008 none of our
Named Executive Officers received a salary increase.

Stock Awards: A portion of compensation paid to our executives is equity based.
We believe equity compensation helps align the interests of our executives with
the interests of our shareholders. In that regard, our executives' compensation
is subject to downside risk in the event that our common stock price decreases.
In addition, we believe stock awards provide incentives to aid in the retention
of key executives.

Other Benefits: Our Executive Officers and employees receive no other benefits.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

 (a) Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners holding five percent or
greater of the 80,453,729 shares of common stock outstanding as of September 15,
2007 and of Management assuming the exercise of outstanding options held by
management.

 control over financial reporting that occurred during the

 fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
 affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
 registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based
 on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
 reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
 registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
 functions):

a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
 operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
 reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
 record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

 b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
 employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
 control over financial reporting.
