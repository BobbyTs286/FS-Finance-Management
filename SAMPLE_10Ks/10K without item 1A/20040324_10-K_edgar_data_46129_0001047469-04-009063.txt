Item 1. Business. 

 Allied Motion Technologies, Inc. (the Company) was organized under the laws of Colorado in 1962. The Company is engaged in the business of designing,
manufacturing and selling motor and servo motion products primarily to the Commercial Motor, Industrial Motion Control and Aerospace and Defense
markets . Prior to July 29, 2002, the Company was also engaged in designing, manufacturing and selling advanced systems and instrumentation to the
worldwide power and process industries. As discussed more fully in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 29, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its
Power and Process Business, and in March 2003 finalized the sale of the Calibrator Business, completing the sale of all its Power and Process Business, therefore transforming the Company and
focusing all of its resources in the motor and motion products markets (Motion Strategy). The Company operates primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. Prior to the sale of its Power and
Process Business, the Company also had joint venture investments in China. Prior to October 2002, the Company was known as Hathaway Corporation. In connection with the sale of its Power and
Process Business, the Hathaway name became the property of the buyers. At the October 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a proposal was approved to amend the Articles of Incorporation to
change the Company's name to Allied Motion Technologies, Inc. 

 Allied
Motion utilizes its underlying core "Electromagnetic Motion Know How" to provide compact, high performance products as solutions to a variety of motion applications. The served
markets include on and off road vehicles, semi-conductor equipment, packaging, medical, actuation, military, commercial aviation and industrial automation, and fiber-optic based
telecommunications. End products using Allied Motion technology include HVAC systems for trucks, buses and off-road vehicles, medical equipment, processing equipment for the semiconductor
industry, missile and munitions control systems for the military, anti-lock brake and fuel cell applications for the specialty automotive market, satellite tracking systems, MRI scanners,
high definition printers and tunable lasers, wavelength meters and spectrum analyzers for the fiber optic industry as well as various applications in the medical market. 

 Allied
Motion is organized into three subsidiaries: Emoteq Corporation (Emoteq Tulsa, OK), Computer Optical Products, Inc. (COPI Chatsworth, CA), and Motor
Products Corporation (Motor Products Owosso, MI). 

 Emoteq
designs, manufactures and markets direct current brushless motors, related components, and drive and control electronics as well as a family of static frequency converters for
military and aerospace applications and has extensive experience in power electronics design and software development required for the application of specialized drive electronics technology. Markets
served include semiconductor manufacturing, industrial automation, medical equipment, and military and aerospace. Emoteq also manufactures precision direct current fractional horsepower motors and
certain motor components and spare parts and replacement equipment for general-purpose instrumentation products. Industrial equipment and military products are the major application for the motors. 

 Optical
encoders are manufactured by COPI. They are used to measure rotational and linear movements of parts in diverse applications such as printers, sorting machinery, machine tools,
robots, medical equipment, tunable lasers and spectrum analyzers. The primary markets for the optical encoders are in the industrial, computer peripheral manufacturing, medical and telecommunications
sectors. COPI also designs, manufactures and markets fiber optic-based encoders with special characteristics, such as immunity to radio frequency interference and high temperature tolerance, suited
for industrial, aerospace and military environments. Applications include airborne navigational systems, anti-lock braking transducers, missile flight surface controls and high temperature
process control equipment. 

 1 

Motor
Products, located in Owosso, Michigan has been a motor producer for more than sixty years and is a vertically integrated manufacturer of customized, highly engineered
sub-fractional horsepower permanent magnet DC and brushless DC motors serving a wide range of original equipment applications. The motors are used in HVAC and actuation systems in a
variety of markets including trucks, buses, RV's, off-road vehicles, health, fitness, medical and industrial equipment. 

 On
February 10, 2004, the Company signed a merger agreement to acquire Owosso Corporation located in Watertown, New York. The closing of the merger is scheduled for the second
quarter of 2004 and is subject to approval by Owosso's shareholders, the filing of an effective registration statement for the Company's securities and customary closing conditions. Owosso's sole
operating subsidiary, Stature Electric, Inc., manufactures fractional and integral horsepower motors, gear motors, and motor part sets. Significant markets for Stature include commercial
products and equipment, healthcare, recreation and non-automotive transportation. Stature's component products are sold throughout North America and in Europe, primarily to original
equipment manufacturers that use them in their end products. 

Fiscal Year End Change 

The Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective December 31, 2002; and, therefore, the Company reported a
six-month transition period ending December 31, 2002. The following table describes the periods presented in this Form 10-K. 

Period: 
 
 Referred to as: 

Audited results from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 
 
 Year 2003 

Unaudited results from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 
 
 Twelve Month Comparative Period 

Audited results from July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 
 
 Transition Period 

Unaudited results from July 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 
 
 Six Month Comparative Period 

Audited results from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002 
 
 Fiscal Year 2002 

Audited results from July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001 
 
 Fiscal Year 2001 

Product Distribution 

The Company maintains a direct sales force. In addition to its own marketing and sales force, the Company has independent sales representatives and agents to sell
its various product lines in certain markets. 

Competition 

The Company faces competition in all of its markets, although the number of competitors varies depending upon the product. The Company believes there are numerous
competitors in the motion control market. Competition involves primarily product performance and price, although service and warranty are also important. 

Financial Information about Operating Segments 

The information required by this item is set forth in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 

Availability of Raw Materials 

All parts and materials used by the Company are in adequate supply. No significant parts or materials are acquired from a single source. 

 2 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 

The Company holds several patents and trademarks regarding components used by the various subsidiaries; however, none of these patents and trademarks are
considered to be of major significance. 

Seasonality of the Business 

The Company's business is not of a seasonal nature; however, revenues may be influenced by customers' fiscal year ends and holiday seasons. 

Working Capital Items 

The Company currently maintains inventory levels adequate for its short-term needs based upon present levels of production. The Company considers the
component parts of its different product lines to be readily available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. 

Sales to Large Customers 

During Year 2003, the Transition Period, and Fiscal Year 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues. During Fiscal Year 2001 one
customer accounted for 20 of the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations. The customer is a leading manufacturer of test instrumentation for the fiberoptic telecommunications
industry. During Fiscal Year 2002, the customer cancelled a 4.75 million order. The Company's products are still designed into the customer's products, however deliveries of our products have
been halted by the customer because of the economic downturn. The Company is also delivering products to this customer under other orders at this time. 

Sales Backlog 

The Company's backlog at December 31, 2003 consisted of sales orders totaling approximately 13,383,000 while backlog at December 31, 2002 was
 13,663,000. In our commercial motors markets, the Company is experiencing an increased number of its customers going on a "pull system" whereby the Company agrees to maintain available inventory that
the customer "pulls" or takes delivery as they need the products. At the time the customer pulls the product, the Company records the order and sale. Approximately 50 of our customers in commercial
motors markets were on a pull system in 2003 compared to 35 in 2002. Accordingly, this trend will reduce the amount of backlog since these
customers are no longer giving the Company long-term orders that it delivers against over time and, therefore, the amount of backlog compared to prior periods is not necessarily an
accurate indication of the future sales of the Company compared to prior periods. 

 There
can be no assurance that the Company's backlog can be converted into revenue. 

Government Sales 

Approximately 86,000 of the Company's backlog as of December 31, 2003 consisted of contracts with the United States Government. The Company's contracts
with the government contain a provision generally found in government contracts that permits the government to terminate the contract at its option. When the termination is attributable to no fault of
the Company, the government would, in general, have to pay the Company certain allowable costs up to the time of termination, but there is no compensation for loss of profits. 

Engineering and Development Activities 

The Company's expenditures on engineering and development for Year 2003 were 1,853,000. For the Transition Period, Fiscal Years 2002, and 2001 engineering and
development from continuing 

 3 

operations
were 754,000, 846,000, and 962,000, respectively. Of these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers. 

Environmental Issues 

No significant pollution or other types of emission result from the Company's operations and it is not anticipated that the Company's proposed operations will be
affected by Federal, State or local provisions concerning environmental controls. However, there can be no assurance that any future regulations will not affect the Company's operations.

Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for additional information required by this item. 

Foreign Operations 

The information required by this item is set forth in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 

Employees

Available Information 

The Company maintains a website at www.alliedmotion.com. The Company makes available, free of charge on or through its website, its annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such materials to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

 The
Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for its chief executive officer, president and senior financial officers. A copy of this Code has been filed as an exhibit to this
Form 10-K. The Company intends to make the Code available on the Company's website and to disclose on this website any amendment to this Code. Waivers under this Code, if any, will
be disclosed under the rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq Small Cap Market. A copy of this Code is also available in print to any stockholder upon written request addressed to Allied Motion
Technologies Inc., 23 Inverness Way East, Suite 150, Englewood, CO 80112-5711. 

Item 2. Properties. 

 As of December 31, 2003, the Company occupies facilities as follows:

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

 In 2001, the Company, with other parties, was named as a defendant in an environmental contamination lawsuit. The lawsuit relates to property that was occupied by
the Company's Power and Process Business over 37 years ago. In connection therewith, the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit and recorded an estimated charge for the settlement and related
legal fees of 1,429,000 961,000 net of tax) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The settlement agreement received court approval during the Transition Period. While the Company
believes that the suit against the Company was without merit, it agreed to the settlement to eliminate future costs of defending itself and the uncertain risks associated with litigation. Additional
information required by this item is set forth in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 

 The
Company is also involved in certain actions that have arisen out of the ordinary course of business. Management believes that resolution of the actions will not have a significant
adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. 

 The Company held its annual stockholders' meeting on October 23, 2003. The stockholders voted on one item. 

 The
stockholders elected E.E. Prince, R.D. Smith, G.D. Hubbard, D.D. Hock and G.J. Pilmanis to serve on the Board of Directors for the coming year. The vote tabulation was as follows:

 Overview 

 Business 

 Allied Motion designs, manufactures and sells motion products to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the commercial motor, industrial
motion control, and aerospace and defense markets. The Company's products are in use in an ever-greater number of demanding applications in specialty automotive, HVAC, medical,
health-fitness, defense, aerospace, semiconductor 

 8 

manufacturing,
fiber optic-based telecommunications, printing, and graphic imaging market sectors, to name a few. 

 Today,
three companies form the core of Allied Motion. The companies, Emoteq, Computer Optical Products and Motor Products offer a wide range of standard motors, encoders and drives for
original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and end user applications. A particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of
its customers. 

 Emoteq
Corporation in Tulsa, Oklahoma develops and manufactures advanced servo motor and drive solutions. Emoteq has developed specialized, high performance servo solutions. As a result,
Emoteq's products are at work in precision equipment applications around the world from semiconductor manufacturing equipment to fuel cell powered vehicles to high performance target tracking systems. 

 Computer
Optical Products (COPI) in Chatsworth, California solves difficult feedback application problems with innovative optical encoder solutions. Combining their considerable
expertise in mechanical, optical, and electronic technologies, COPI's engineers have developed unique encoding solutions for numerous and diverse applications from pre-press imaging
equipment to missile seeker heads. Integrating their custom high resolution sine-cosine optical encoders with customers' motor actuators is a particular strength of the company. 

 Motor
Products Corporation in Owosso, Michigan has been supplying fractional horsepower DC motors to original equipment manufacturers in a myriad of industries for over sixty years.
Allied Motion acquired Motor Products in July 2002 to further the Company's strategy to become a leading supplier in the motion industry. Motor Products specializes in the design of custom
brush DC motors for specific customer applications, and supplies them with uniformly high quality in quantities ranging from tens to the tens of thousands. Motor Products motors are in use worldwide
in commercial and industrial applications in HVAC and heat-transfer systems, fans and blowers, pumps, electro-mechanical actuators, and both over-the-road trucks
and buses and off-road vehicles. 

 Business and Strategy Overview 

 During 2002, management significantly changed the structure and strategy of the Company. The Company had historically operated in two business segments under the
name Hathaway Corporation: Motion Control and Power and Process. During 2002, the Company sold substantially all its power and process business segment and transformed the Company to a focused motion
company under the name Allied Motion Technologies Inc. 

 During
2002 and 2003, the Company has made considerable progress in implementing its new corporate strategy, the driving force of which is "Applied Motion Technology/Know How", and in
the transformation of Allied Motion into a growth oriented motion company. To ensure the implementation of all of our critical issues that are necessary to accomplish our overall strategy, we launched
a formal process, called Strategy Deployment, in each Allied Motion operation. The Strategy Deployment process includes the development of action plans and a rigorous and regular implementation review
process to ensure we achieve the objectives of our Strategic Plan. 

 During
2003, the Company initiated recruitment efforts for various engineering and sales and marketing positions to enhance its ability to increase sales in the future. The overhead cost
reductions and the parallel recruitment efforts are consistent with improving our "Areas of Excellence" and the redeployment of resources in support of our strategy as an Applied Motion
Technology/Know-How company. Key resources have been added in electrical design, mechanical design and in applied marketing and it is our belief these key resources will allow us to
accelerate our current product re-design as well as our new product development efforts. We fully expect our recruiting efforts to 

 9 

result
in cost effective and innovative new designs and solutions that will provide us with the technology platform to obtain a leadership position in our served market segments. 

 Also
during 2003 the Company began the re-alignment of its sales team to focus on selected vertical target market segments. Already, this has resulted in a much better
understanding of these markets and through the emphasis on our applications expertise we will now be aligned to provide improved support for our customers in the future which we believe should
contribute to the Company's growth in sales and profitability. 

 During
2003 (on a pro-forma basis for the year including Motor Products for twelve months of 2002), sales increased by approximately 1 million and operating profits
increased approximately 1.2 million. To accomplish this we utilized what we call a soft implementation of various processes available to our business units through our ever evolving and
expanding set of tools. This tool kit contains a well defined set of processes, training programs and procedures that are fundamental to the way we operate our businesses. We have coined the term
"AST", for Allied's Systematic Tools. Based on Lean and Six Sigma principles, we provide our employees with well defined methods to addresses various assessment, development, execution and process
needs within the Company. These "Tools" include strategy development, strategy deployment, applied marketing, value stream mapping, cellular manufacturing, SMED, Six Sigma, etc. The soft
implementation used during the past year will move to a more vigorous and scheduled implementation in each of our business units in 2004. We believe this will allow us to improve profitability of our
existing operations as well as effectively integrate new acquisitions. 

 One
of our major challenges, and a risk to our business, is to maintain and improve our price competitiveness. Our customers are continually being challenged by their markets and
competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible. For the Company to continue to be competitive in its
markets, we must have the ability to continuously improve our cost of doing business while maintaining and improving the quality and performance of our products. To accomplish this, we have placed
significant emphasis on reducing our costs through the implementation of AST, re-designing products and designing new products for cost improvement and manufacturing efficiency, sourcing
materials and components from global low cost sources and establishing manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions. The continuous improvement in our cost of doing business is an integral part of
our corporate strategy. 

 Subsequent Acquisition 

 On February 10, 2004, the Company signed a merger agreement to acquire Owosso Corporation located in Watertown, New York. The closing of the merger is
scheduled for the second quarter of 2004. Owosso's sole operating subsidiary, Stature Electric, manufactures fractional and integral horsepower motors, gear motors, and motor part sets. Significant
markets for Stature include commercial products and equipment, healthcare, recreation and non-automotive transportation. Stature's component products are sold throughout North America and
in Europe, primarily to original equipment manufacturers that use them in their end products. 

Stature
Electric excels at engineering, designing, packaging and applying integrated gearing and motor solutions for the commercial and industrial equipment, healthcare, recreation and
non-automotive transportation markets. We utilized the framework of our strategy to ensure Stature Electric and Allied Motion were strategically aligned. The markets they serve and the
technology they bring are both extensions of and expansions to our current company know-how. 

 The
consideration for the merger of 14 million will consist of the issuance of approximately 532,200 shares of Allied Motion common stock representing approximately 9.6 of the
outstanding shares of the Company after the merger, 1 million of cash payable to Owosso's preferred shareholders, assumption of 4.6 million of Owosso's debt and approximately
 6 million of cash to 

 10 

settle
the remainder of Owosso's debt and liabilities at closing. Additional subordinated notes for up to 500,000 may be issued by Allied Motion effective January 1, 2005 payable over five
years if Stature achieves certain revenue levels in 2004. In addition, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of Allied Motion common stock at 4.41 per share will be issued to Owosso's preferred
shareholders. Allied Motion has received a commitment from PNC Business Credit and Silicon Valley Bank for up to 18.1 million to complete the acquisition and for working capital needs. The
closing of the acquisition is subject to approval by Owosso's shareholders, the effectiveness of a Registration Statement for the Allied Motion common shares to be issued and customary closing
conditions. 

 In
addition to the acquisition of Owosso and Stature Electric, the Company continues to be in active discussions with other companies in pursuing strategic acquisitions to both provide
external growth and to strengthen its technology base. 

 Outlook 

 The following will provide a good snapshot of what Allied Motion will focus its plans on in 2004: 

We
will emphasize top line growth. Armed with our expanded "Areas of Excellence" we will launch innovative new products to our served markets and provide better service to
our customers through our re-aligned sales team and market segment specialists.
 We
will remain loyal to our strategy and will be relentless in our efforts to continue cost reductions internally, utilizing "AST", Allied's Systematic Tools, and externally
through our expanded strategic sourcing activities with an increased emphasis on low cost region suppliers.
 We
will continue to focus on strengthening our management team and hire top notch personnel to satisfy our critical resource requirements in our Areas of Excellence
(applications and design engineering and applied marketing).
 Through
the use of "AST", Allied's Systematic Tools, we will ensure the successful integration of Stature within Allied and will position Stature to once again grow in the
future.
 We
will remain diligent in our efforts to identify and cultivate additional acquisition and business development activities for our Company. 

Fiscal Year End Change 

 The Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective December 31, 2002; and, therefore, the Company reported a
six-month Transition Period ended December 31, 2002. The following table describes the periods presented in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Operating Results 

 Year 2003 compared to Twelve Month Comparative Period 

 Effective July 29, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its Power and Process Business and effective March 6, 2003, the Company sold its
Calibrator Business, completing the sale of the Power and Process Business. Together, these two businesses comprised the Company's Power and Process segment as historically reported. See
Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these events. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, these businesses have been presented as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As such, the operating results from continuing operations of the Company now only include results from the
Company's Motion Business. All activities related to the Power and Process segment are excluded from continuing operating results and are included in the results from discontinued operations. 

NET INCOME The Company achieved net income of 948,000 or .19 per diluted share for the year 2003 compared to 225,000 or
 .05 per diluted share for the Twelve Month Comparative Period. The improvement is due to the sale of the Power and Process Business, the addition of Motor Products, improved gross margins through the
successful implementation of lean manufacturing initiatives, including modifying manufacturing processes to reduce costs, and a 442,000 tax benefit related to the realization of a prior year state
income tax refund and resolution of certain income tax related issues. 

 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Company achieved income from continuing operations of 948,000 or .19 per diluted
share for the year 2003 compared to a net loss of 59,000 or .01 per diluted share for the Twelve Month Comparative Period. The improvement is due to the addition of Motor Products, the successful
implementation of lean manufacturing initiatives, including modifying manufacturing processes to reduce costs, and a 442,000 tax benefit related to the realization of a prior year state income tax
refund and resolution of certain income tax related issues. 

 REVENUES Revenues were 39,434,000 in year 2003 compared to 25,046,000 for the Twelve Month Comparative Period. Included in
revenues for all of year 2003 and five months of the Twelve Month Comparative Period are revenues related to Motor Products, which was acquired on July 30, 2002. Exclusive of revenues from
Motor Products, revenues increased 7 in year 2003 over the Twelve Month Comparative Period due to our success in expanding into new industry sectors including military and automotive applications. On
a pro forma basis, including Motor Products revenues for the full twelve months ended December 31, 2002, revenues were 3 higher for 2003 compared to the comparable period last year. 

 GROSS MARGINS Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 26 for year 2003 from 27 for the Twelve Month
Comparative Period. The primary reason for this decline is due to the impact of the Motor Products acquisition. Motor Products has not historically achieved as high a gross margin percentage from the
industry sectors to which it sells as is achieved from other industry sectors to which the Company sells its products. Gross margin of 26 in 2003 compares to 22 for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002 on a pro forma basis, including Motor Products for the full period. This improvement from the pro forma basis is primarily due to cost reductions and improved efficiency
resulting from the implementation of lean manufacturing initiatives, savings in material costs from purchasing material from off-shore sources and from the restructuring of the operations. 

 SELLING EXPENSES Selling expenses were 2,022,000 and 1,183,000 in year 2003 and the Twelve Month Comparative Period,
respectively. This increase is primarily due to the impact of Motor Products, increased selling expenses and commissions related to the increase in revenues, and increased expenses related to the
development of a focused marketing strategy including website development. 

 12 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses were 4,596,000 in year 2003 compared to 4,311,000
in the Twelve Month Comparative Period. This increase was due to the impact of acquiring Motor Products, increased salary cost associated with the Company's new president and chief operating officer
and additional incentive bonus charges. 

 ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Engineering and development expenses were 1,853,000 and 1,178,000 for year 2003 and
the Twelve Month Comparative Periods, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the impact of acquiring Motor Products and additional expenditures associated with engineering product
development. 

 AMORTIZATION AND OTHER Amortization and other expense was 315,000 in year 2003 and 132,000 in the Twelve Month Comparative
Period. This increase is due to the amortization costs related to the amortizable intangible assets acquired in the Motor Products acquisition. 

 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE Restructuring charges were 211,000 and zero for year 2003 and the Twelve Month Comparative Period,
respectively. The restructuring expense relates to moving expenses and severance costs arising from workforce reductions from consolidation of the Company's manufacturing facilities. 

 INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for year 2003 was 226,000 and for the Twelve Month Comparative Period was 130,000. This
increase is due to the additional borrowings related to the financing of the acquisition of Motor Products. 

 INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for year 2003 was 19,000 compared to a 17,000 benefit for the Twelve Month
Comparative Period. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes from continuing operations was 2 in year 2003 and 47 in the Six Month Comparative Period. The
difference in the effective tax rate between periods is primarily due to a 442,000 tax benefit related to the realization of a prior year state income tax refund and resolution of certain income tax
related issues. 

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Income from discontinued operations was zero in year 2003 compared to 284,000 in the Twelve Month
Comparative Period. Included in the results for the Twelve Month Comparative Period is a pretax gain on the sale of the Power and Process Business of 1,699,000 which closed on July 29, 2002
and a writedown to the carrying value of the Calibrator Business of 259,000. Also included in the Twelve Month Comparative Period is operating income from discontinued operations of 292,000 and a
pretax charge for litigation settlement and legal fees of 1,429,000 to settle an environmental contamination lawsuit filed in 2001 pursuant to which the Company was named as a defendant. The lawsuit
related to property that was occupied by the Company's Power Business over 37 years ago. While the Company believed the suit against the Company was without merit, it agreed to the settlement
to eliminate future costs of defending itself and the risks associated with litigation. 

 Transition Period compared to Six Month Comparative Period 

 NET INCOME The Company achieved net income of 328,000 or .07 per diluted share for the Transition Period compared to a net
loss of 163,000 or .04 per diluted share for the Six Month Comparative Period. 

 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Company achieved income from continuing operations of 45,000 or .01 per diluted share
for the Transition Period compared to 60,000 or .01 per diluted share for the Six Month Comparative Period. 

 REVENUES Revenues were 17,191,000 in the Transition Period compared to 7,868,000 for the Six Month Comparative Period.
Included in revenues for the Transition Period are revenues related to 

 13 

Motor
Products, which was acquired on July 30, 2002. Exclusive of revenues from Motor Products, revenues increased 3 in the Transition Period over the Six Month Comparative Period due to our
success in expanding into new industry sectors including military and automotive applications. 

 GROSS MARGINS Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 23 for the Transition Period from 30 for the Six Month
Comparative Period. The primary reason for this decline is due to the impact of the Motor Products acquisition. Motor Products margin for the Transition Period was negatively impacted due to the costs
associated with the integration of Ohio's manufacturing lines into the Michigan plant, including the hiring and training of more than 50 new employees. However, with the implementation of lean
manufacturing and off-shore purchasing initiatives, the
Company anticipates Motor Products gross margins to improve to align with the Company's legacy business and for margins to increase company wide. 

 SELLING EXPENSES Selling expenses were 726,000 and 444,000 in the Transition Period and Six Month Comparative Period,
respectively. This increase is primarily due to the impact of Motor Products. 

 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses were 2,217,000 in the Transition Period compared to
 1,403,000 in the Six Month Comparative Period. This increase was primarily due to the additional 290,000 expense from the acquisition of Motor Products and increased salary costs and expenses of
 233,000 as a result of hiring additional personnel including the president and chief operating officer of the Company. Additionally the increase was due to 154,000 in business development expenses
primarily related to the Company's new strategic development and lean manufacturing initiatives. 

ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Engineering and development expenses were 754,000 and 422,000 for the Transition and
Six Month Comparative Periods, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the impact of Motor Products. 

 AMORTIZATION AND OTHER Amortization and other expense was 131,000 in the Transition Period and 4,000 in the Six Month
Comparative Period. This increase is due to the amortization costs related to the amortizable intangible assets acquired in the Motor Products acquisition. 

INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for the Transition Period was 130,000 and for the Six Month Comparative Period was
 10,000. This increase is due to the additional borrowings related to the financing of the acquisition of Motor Products. 

 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the Transition Period was 40,000 and for the Six Month
Comparative Period was 26,000. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes from continuing operations was 47 in the Transition Period and 31 in the Six Month
Comparative Period. The difference in the effective tax rate between periods is primarily due to the impact of foreign taxes. 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Income from discontinued operations was 283,000 in the Transition Period compared to a loss from
discontinued operations of 223,000 for the Six Month Comparative Period. Included in the results for the Transition Period is a pre-tax gain on the sale of the Power and Process Business
of 1,699,000 which closed on July 29, 2002 and a pretax write down to the carrying value of the Calibrator Business of 259,000. Included in the results for the Six Month Comparative Period is
a pretax gain on the sale of Si Fang of 674,000, net of selling costs. Operating loss in the Transition Period increased from the Six Month Comparative Period primarily because the
sale of the Power and Process Business closed on July 29,2002 and only one month's activity is included in the results of the Transition Period compared to six months results included in the
Six Month Comparative Period. The month of July has historically been the least profitable month of each fiscal year. 

 14 

Fiscal year 2002 compared to Fiscal year 2001 

 NET INCOME The Company had a net loss of 266,000 or .06 per diluted share for fiscal year 2002 compared to net income of
 1,996,000 or .41 per diluted share for fiscal year 2001. 

 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Company had a loss of 45,000 or .01 per diluted share for fiscal year 2002 compared
to income of 2,024,000 or .42 per diluted share for fiscal year 2001. Results for fiscal year 2002 were adversely affected by the economic slowdown, particularly in the semiconductor and
telecommunications markets. 

 REVENUES Revenues from continuing operations were 15,723,000 and 21,188,000 in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
decrease was primarily due to the overall economic slowdown especially in the semiconductor and telecommunications markets. 

 GROSS MARGINS Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 32 for fiscal year 2002 from 38 for fiscal year 2001.
The decrease in gross margin was due to fixed overhead costs that could not be reduced in direct correlation to reduced revenue. 

SELLING EXPENSES Selling expenses were 901,000 and 1,162,000 in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease was
due to decreased commissions and selling expenses related to the decrease in revenues. 

 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses were 3,497,000 in fiscal year 2002 compared to
 3,200,000 in fiscal year 2001. This increase was primarily due to increased employee bonus costs. 

 ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Engineering and development expenses were 846,000 and 962,000 for fiscal years 2002
and 2001, respectively. This decrease was due to cost reductions made by the Company in reaction to the economic slowdown. 

 AMORTIZATION AND OTHER Amortization and other expense were 5,000 and 57,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively.
This decrease was primarily due to the amortization of the goodwill associated with the July 1, 1998 acquisition of Emoteq UK being completed in fiscal year 2001. 

 INTEREST EXPENSE There was no interest expense for fiscal year 2002 compared to 82,000 for fiscal year 2001. The decrease is
due to the elimination of the Company's outstanding debt during the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. 

BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES The benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2002 was 31,000 compared to a provision for income
taxes of 598,000 for fiscal year 2001. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes from continuing operations was a 41 benefit in fiscal year 2002 compared to a 23 
provision in fiscal year 2001. The difference in the effective tax rate between periods is primarily due to expenses not deductible for tax purposes and changes in the valuation allowance against the
balance of deferred tax assets. 

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations had a loss of 221,000 for fiscal year 2002 compared to 28,000 for fiscal
year 2001. Included in the results for fiscal year 2002 is a pre-tax charge for litigation settlement and related legal fees of 1,429,000 to settle an environmental contamination lawsuit
filed in 2001 pursuant to which the Company was named as a defendant. The lawsuit related to property that was occupied by the Company's Power Business over 37 years ago. While the Company
believed the suit against the Company was without merit, it agreed to the settlement to eliminate future costs of defending itself and the risks associated with litigation. 

 15 

Also
included in the results for fiscal year 2002 is the gain on the sale of the Company's investment in the Si Fang joint venture and equity income from the remaining joint venture
investments in China, totaling 833,000 before tax, compared to 1,170,000 equity income from all joint ventures included in fiscal year 2001. Also included in the results for fiscal year 2001 is a
pre-tax restructuring charge of 587,000 related to the restructuring of the Company's Process Business. 

 Overall,
operating results from discontinued operations decreased in fiscal year 2002 over fiscal year 2001 primarily due to the litigation settlement and reduced income from China joint
venture activities, offset by improved margins achieved in fiscal year 2002 due to changes in product mix sold and the effect of the restructuring charge in fiscal 2001. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 The Company's liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased 5,000 during the Year 2003 to a balance of 1,960,000 at December 31,
2003. Cash flow provided by operating activities was 2,152,000 in Year 2003 while cash used in operating activities was 187,000, 1,428,000, and 744,000 in the Twelve Month Comparative Period, the
Transition Period, and the Six Month Comparative Period, respectively. Cash flow provided from operations was 552,000 in fiscal year 2002 and 815,000 in fiscal year 2001. The differences are
primarily due to changes in operating results and working capital changes. 

 Cash
of 764,000 and 5,584,000 was used in investing activities during Year 2003 and the Twelve Month Comparative Period, respectively. Cash of 5,077,000 was used by investing
activities during the Transition Period, while cash of 2,559,000 and 1,997,000 was generated by investing activities in the Six Month Comparative Period and fiscal year 2002, respectively. Cash of
 1,003,000 was used by investing activities in fiscal year 2001. During Year 2003 the Company made payments of 300,000 related to the acquisition of Motor Products and received 500,000 and 149,000
from the sale of the Power and Process Business and the Calibrator Business, respectively. During the Twelve Month Comparative Period which includes the Transition Period, the Company made payments of
 12,184,000, including acquisition costs, related to the acquisition of Motor Products and received 7,020,000 in payments, net of expenses paid, related to the sale of the Power and Process Business.
The cash generated in the Six Month Comparative Period and fiscal year 2002 includes 3,020,000 cash received from the sale of Si Fang. Purchases of property and equipment were 1,113,000, 865,000,
 423,000, 461,000, 903,000 and 908,000 for Year 2003, the Twelve Month Comparative Period, the Transition Period, the Six Month Comparative Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During the Year 2003, the Twelve Month Comparative Period and the Transition Period, restricted cash balances decreased by zero, 445,000 and 510,000, respectively while during the Six Month
Comparative Period, and fiscal years 2002 and 2001, restricted cash balances increased by 55,000, 120,000 and 95,000, respectively. 

 During
year 2003 financing activities used 1,447,000 in cash while 4,162,000 in cash was provided in the Twelve Month Comparative Period. Financing activities provided 4,104,000 in
cash for the Transition Period but used cash of 349,000, 291,000 and 769,000 in the Six Month Comparative Period and in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, the Company made
 2,000,000 in repayments on the line-of-credit, received 500,000 from new capital leases entered into during year 2003, made repayments of 21,000 on its capital leases and
received 74,000 from stock transactions under employee benefit stock plans. Financing activities for the Twelve Month Comparative Period focused primarily on the activities during the Transition
Period when the Company received proceeds from its line-of-credit and term loan agreements of 4,000,000 and made payments of 167,000 on its term loan. The Company also
received net proceeds of 329,000 related to the activities of the employee benefit stock plans in the Twelve Month Comparative Period. During the Transition Period, besides the
line-of-credit activity and term loan payments discussed above, the Company received net proceeds of 271,000 related to the activities of employee benefit stock plans. During
fiscal year 2002, 

 16 

553,000
of cash was used to pay off the line of credit. This was offset by net proceeds from the activities of employee benefit stock plans of 262,000. In fiscal year 2001, the Company made net
repayments of 993,000 to the line of credit, offset by 224,000 of cash received from activities of employee benefit stock plans. 

 At
December 31, 2003, the Company had 1,833,000 of debt obligations, compared with 4,133,000, zero, and 553,000 at December 31, 2002 and fiscal years ended
June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The December 31, 2003 debt represents borrowings on the Company's current long-term financing agreement (Agreement) with Silicon Valley
Bank (Silicon), which was amended during the Transition Period to increase the Maximum Credit Limit on the line-of-credit to 4,000,000 and to add an additional 1,750,000 term
loan to the Agreement. 

 Under
the amended Agreement, borrowing on the line-of-credit is restricted to the Maximum Credit Limit which is calculated as the lesser of 4,000,000 or 80 of
the Company's eligible receivables plus the lesser of 1) 25 of the Company's eligible inventory, or 2) 30 of the Company's eligible receivables, or 3) 750,000. The Agreement
was to mature on September 10, 2003 but was amended to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2004. The interest rate on the line-of-credit prior to the year 2003
amendment was equal to the prime rate plus 1.5 , but was lowered to the prime rate plus 1 (5 at December 31, 2003) with the new amendment. The interest rate may be adjusted on a quarterly
basis, but not above prime rate plus 1 , if the Company achieves certain defined financial ratios. In addition to interest, the line bears a monthly unused line fee at 0.375 on the difference between
the amount of the credit limit and the average daily principal balance of the line-of-credit outstanding during the month. The Company borrowed 2,250,000 on July 30,
2002 under this line-of-credit to fund the purchase of Motor Products but made 1,500,000 in repayments during Year 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the amount available
under the line of credit was 2,843,000. 

 Also
under the amended Agreement, the Company obtained a term loan of 1,750,000. The term loan requires forty-two monthly principal payments of 41,667 plus interest through
February 2, 2006. The loan matures the earlier of February 1, 2006 or the date the line-of-credit terminates which is June 30, 2004. Accordingly, amounts
outstanding under the term loan have been classified as a current liability. The loan bears interest at 8.38 , but may be adjusted on a quarterly basis, but not above 8.38 , if the Company achieves
certain defined financial ratios. The Company borrowed 1,750,000 under this term loan on July 30, 2002 to fund the purchase of Motor Products. 

 Both
loan facilities are secured by all of the assets of the Company. The Agreement prohibits the Company from paying dividends and requires that the Company maintain compliance with
certain covenants related to tangible net worth and profitability. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. 

The
Company's working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, including payment of the litigation settlement, are expected to be funded from cash provided by
operations, the Company's existing cash balance and amounts available under the line of credit facility. The Company believes the capital currently available to it is sufficient for its currently
anticipated needs for the next twelve months, but if additional capital is needed in the future, the Company would pursue additional capital via debt or equity financing. A key component of the
Company's liquidity relates to the availability of amounts under the line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. Any lack of availability of this facility could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's liquidity position. 

 In
relation to the proposed acquisition of Owosso Corporation, the Company has received a commitment from PNC Business Credit and Silicon Valley Bank for up to 18.1 million to
complete the acquisition and for working capital needs. The commitment consists of up to 10.5 million of borrowings under a revolving line of credit facility, 3.0 million of borrowings
under a new term loan agreement and a stand-by letter of credit of up to 4.6 million to collateralize industrial revenue bonds. 

 17 

See
Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this proposed acquisition. 

 Price Levels and the Impact of Inflation 

 Prices of the Company's products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years, primarily due to competition. The effect
of inflation on the Company's costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials. The Company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize
the effects of any foreseeable inflation
and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates. As the Company's manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi-skilled labor, which is relatively plentiful in the areas
surrounding the Company's production facilities, the Company does not anticipate substantial inflation-related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees. 

 Critical Accounting Policies 

 The Company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and these statements
necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management. The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements. The Company's critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies. The Company uses historical experience and
all available information to make these judgments and estimates. As discussed below the Company's financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different
conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent
periods to reflect more current information. The Company's critical accounting policies include: 

 The
Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance is based on historical
experience and judgments based on current economic and customer specific factors. Significant judgments are made by management in connection with establishing our customers' ability to pay at the time
of shipment. Despite this assessment, from time to time, the Company's customers are unable to meet their payment obligations. The Company continues to monitor customers' credit worthiness, and use
judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which may not be collected. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the Company's customers could have a
material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results. 

 Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company monitors and forecasts expected inventory needs based on sales forecasts. Inventory is written down or written off when it
becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess. These determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management. If actual market conditions are significantly different than those
projected by management the recorded reserve may be adjusted, and such adjustments may have a significant impact on our results of operations. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly, and
in the past we have recorded substantial charges for inventory obsolescence 

 The
Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded
in the consolidated financial statements, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient
taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards. A
valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets 

 18 

will
not be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed. 

The
Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
such carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Under previous standards, the assets had to be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use would recover their carrying
amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest. However, if projected cash flows were less than their carrying value, even by one dollar, the long-lived assets had to be
reduced to their estimated fair value. Considerable judgment was and is required to project such cash flows and, if required, estimate the fair value of the impaired long-lived asset.
Effective July 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 provides a more restrictive fair value test to evaluate goodwill and long-lived asset
impairment. Depending upon future assessments of fair value, there could be impairment recorded related to goodwill and other long-lived assets. 

 Contractual Commitments

(1) The
capital lease commitments include amounts representing interest.
 (2) The
line of credit Agreement matures on June 30, 2004 but can be extended upon agreement by Silicon.
 (3) The
term loan matures the earlier of February 1, 2006 or the date the line-of-credit terminates which is currently June 2004. Assuming the
Company's line of credit will be renewed annually, the required principal payments would be 500,000 in 2004, 500,000 in 2005 and 83,000 in 2006. This allows for the term loan to be repaid over a
forty-two month period. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in
financial and commodity market prices and rates. The Company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in United States interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as
measured against the United States dollar. These exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities. Historically, and as of December 31, 2003, the Company has not
used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities. 

 19 

Interest Rate Risk 

 The interest payable on the Company's line-of-credit is variable based on the prime rate, and, therefore, affected by changes in market
interest rates. The line-of-credit matures in June 2004. The Company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents bearing variable interest
rates that are tied to various market indices. As a result, the Company does not believe that reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on
future earnings, fair values or cash flows of the Company. A change in the interest rate of 1 on the Company's variable rate debt would have the impact of changing interest expense by approximately
 7,500 annually. 

 Foreign Currency Risk 

 After July 29, 2002, upon the sale of the Power and Process Business, the Company had one wholly-owned subsidiary located in England, but during year 2003,
this subsidiary was merged into its parent company located in the United States. Historically sales from this operation were typically denominated in British Pounds, thereby creating exposures to
changes in exchange rates. The Company did not believe that reasonably possible near-term changes in exchange rates would result in a material effect on future earnings, fair values or
cash flows of the Company, and therefore, chose not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments.

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Business 

Allied Motion Technologies, Inc. is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling motion control products to a broad spectrum of
customers throughout the world primarily for the commercial motor, industrial motion control, and aerospace and defense markets. Prior to October 2002, the Company was known as Hathaway
Corporation. In connection with the sale of its Power and Process Business (see Note 12), the Hathaway name became the property of the buyers. At the October 2002 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing the Company's name to Allied Motion Technologies Inc. 

 On
July 30, 2002, the Company purchased 100 of the stock of Motor Products Owosso Corporation and Motor Products Ohio Corporation (collectively "Motor
Products") from Owosso Corporation, a publicly held corporation, for 11,800,000. Motor Products, located in Owosso, Michigan has been a motor producer for more than fifty years and is a vertically
integrated manufacturer of customized, highly engineered sub-fractional horsepower permanent magnet DC and brushless DC motors serving a wide range of original equipment applications. The
motors are used in HVAC and actuation systems in a variety of markets including trucks, buses, RV's, off-road vehicles, health, fitness, medical and industrial equipment. The Company
acquired Motor Products to further its Motion Strategy. See Note 2 for further information about the acquisition of Motor Products. 

Fiscal Year End Change 

The Board of Directors approved a change in the fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 which was effective July 1, 2002; and therefore
the Company reported a six month period ended December 31, 2002. The following table describes the periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto:

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include instruments which are readily convertible into cash (original maturities of three months or less) and which are not subject to
significant risk of changes in interest rates. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using an average rate. 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit that serve as collateral for letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company. 

Inventories 

Inventories include costs of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market, as follows (in thousands): 

December 31, 2003 
 
 December 31, 2002 

Parts and raw materials, net 

2,205

Reserves
established for anticipated losses on excess or obsolete inventories were approximately 881,000 and 1,024,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment is classified as follows (in thousands): 

Useful 
lives

Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 

(4,522) 
 
 (3,773) 

6,423 

6,431 

Depreciation
and amortization expense is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of building improvements and
leased equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the life of the lease term or the life of the assets, 

 27 

whichever
is shorter. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Major additions and improvements are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of retired or
sold property are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in earnings. 

 Depreciation
expense was approximately 1,044,000, 354,000, 371,000 and 310,000 in year 2003, the Transition Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. On
July 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles" (SFAS No. 142) and ceased amortization of its goodwill. In
addition, the Company has determined that the classifications of its intangible assets previously acquired and the related useful lives established were not impacted by the provisions of SFAS
No. 142. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the Company performed its transitional goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2002 and determined that no impairments existed at that date. SFAS No. 142 requires a
goodwill impairment test on an annual basis. The Company completed its annual analysis of the fair value of its goodwill at September 30, 2003 and determined there was no indicated impairment
of its goodwill. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

On July 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144
supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 121 did not address the
accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation, which resulted in two accounting models for long-lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144
establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, and requires that those long-lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. 

 The
Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable. Under
SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and
without considering interest. However, if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value, even by one dollar, the long-lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value.
Considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and, if required, estimate the fair value of the impaired long-lived asset. No impairments of long-lived assets
were recorded in year 2003, the Transition Period or in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 or 2001. 

 28 

Warranty 

The Company offers warranty coverage for its products for periods ranging from 12 to 18 months after shipment, with the majority of its products for
12 months. The Company estimates the costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical average cost of the repairs. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are
reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals are adjusted. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product, and are
considered a cost of sale. Accrued warranty costs were 185,000 and 212,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

Accrued Liabilities 

Accrued liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): 

December 31, 2003 
 
 December 31, 2002 

Compensation and fringe benefits 

1,245 

1,309

Customer deposits 

458 

Other accrued expenses 

1,056 

828 

3,059 

2,562 

Foreign Currency Translation 

In accordance with SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using current exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the other comprehensive
income component of stockholders' investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. 

Engineering and Development Expenses 

Engineering and development expenses are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped or delivered (shipping terms may be either FOB shipping point or destination) and title has passed to the
customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. 

Basic and Diluted Income per Share from Continuing Operations 

Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Diluted income or loss per share from continuing operations is determined by dividing the net income or loss by the sum of (1) the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and (2) if not anti-dilutive, the effect of stock options determined utilizing the treasury stock method. Outstanding options totaling 136,000, 153,000, and 341,000 had
a dilutive effect for year 2003, the Transition Period and fiscal years 2001, 

 29 

respectively.
Stock options to purchase 734,000, 971,000, 890,000, and 240,000 shares of common stock (without regard to the treasury stock method), were excluded from the calculation of diluted
income (loss) per share for year 2003, the Transition Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively, since the results would have been anti-dilutive. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders. Adjustments for comprehensive income for
all years presented are limited to cumulative translation adjustments from the translation of the financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations. All options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant and therefore no stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income (loss), except as discussed in Note 6. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined
consistent with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123", the Company's net income (loss) would have been adjusted to the following amounts (in thousands, except per share data):

For
SFAS No. 123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: 

For the Transition Period Ended December 31, 2002 

For the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 

For the 
year Ended December 31, 2003

The
weighted average fair value of options granted, assuming the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, during year 2003, the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002 and fiscal
years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 was 1.64, 2.00, 2.57, and 4.19, respectively. The total fair value of options granted was 324,000, 461,000, 1,069,000, and 1,897,000 in year 2003, the
Transition Period ended December 31, 2002 and fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options
for purposes of this disclosure. 

 The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different than those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options. 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amount of the line-of-credit
approximates its fair value because the underlying instrument is a variable rate note that reprices frequently. The carrying amount of the term loan approximates its fair value because the fixed
interest rate is a current fair market interest rate. 

Income Taxes 

The current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax return filings each year. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance may be provided to the extent management deems it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period. Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets
and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income, in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management believes that it is more 

 31 

likely
than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of valuation allowances. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Trade receivables subject the Company to the potential for credit risk. To reduce this risk, the Company performs evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and creditworthiness at the time of sale, and updates those evaluations when necessary. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior year balances were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Those reclassifications had no impact on net income or stockholders'
investment as previously reported. 

 2. MOTOR PRODUCTS ACQUISITION 

 On July 30, 2002, the Company purchased 100 of the stock of Motor Products from Owosso Corporation, a publicly held corporation, for 11,800,000. The
Company incurred approximately 712,000 in acquisition costs, which resulted in a total purchase price of 12,512,000. The Company paid 11,500,000 in cash at closing and 300,000 was paid in
January 2003 and was included in debt obligations in the accompanying December 31, 2002 balance sheet. 

 The
Company acquired Motor Products to further its strategy of expanding its motion business. Motor Products was very well aligned with the Company due to the commitment to lean
manufacturing processes and an extensive design and applications engineering knowledge base. 

 The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based on
their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition which in part was determined by a third-party appraisal. The net purchase price allocation was as follows (in thousands): 

Trade receivables 

2,927 

Inventories 

2,300 

Other current assets 

56 

Property, plant and equipment 

5,377

(2,937) 

Pension and post-retirement obligations 

(2,742)

12,512 

32 

The
acquired goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes. The amortizable intangible assets will be amortized as discussed in Note 3. 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Motor Products subsequent to July 30, 2002. 

The

Long-term debt obligations 

The
Company has entered into a long-term financing agreement (Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (Silicon) which was to mature on May 7, 2003. On July 30,
2002, the Company and Silicon amended the Agreement increasing the credit limit on the line-of-credit to 4,000,000. 

 Under
the amended Agreement, borrowing on the line-of-credit is restricted to the Maximum Credit Limit which is calculated as the lesser of 4,000,000 or 80 of
the Company's eligible receivables plus the lesser of 1) 25 of the Company's eligible inventory, or 2) 30 of the Company's eligible receivables, or 3) 750,000. The amended
Agreement was to mature on September 10, 2003 but was further amended to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2004. The interest rate on the line-of-credit prior
to the year 2003 amendment was equal to the prime rate plus 1.5 , but was lowered to the prime rate plus 1 (5 at December 31, 2003) with the new amendment. The interest rate may be adjusted
on a quarterly basis, but not above prime rate plus 1 , if the Company achieves certain defined financial ratios. In addition to interest, the line bears a monthly unused line fee of 0.375 on the
calculated difference between the amount of the credit limit and the average daily principal balance of the line-of-credit outstanding during the month. The Company borrowed
 2,250,000 on July 30, 2002 under this line-of-credit to fund the purchase of Motor Products but made 1,500,000 in repayments during year 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the amount available under the line of credit was 2,843,000. 

 Also
under the amended Agreement, the Company obtained a term loan of 1,750,000. The term loan requires forty-two monthly principal payments of 41,667 plus interest through
February 1, 2006. The term loan matures the earlier of February 1, 2006 or the date the line-of-credit terminates which is June 30, 2004. Accordingly, all
amounts outstanding under the term loan have been classified as a current liability. The loan bears interest at 8.38 , but may be adjusted on a quarterly basis, but not above 8.38 , if the Company
achieves certain defined financial ratios. The Company borrowed 1,750,000 under this term loan on July 30, 2002 in connection with the purchase of Motor Products. 

 The
loans are secured by all of the assets of the Company. The Agreement prohibits the Company from paying dividends and requires that the Company maintain compliance with certain
covenants related to tangible net worth and profitability. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

The
Company has domestic tax credit carryforwards of 500,000 expiring in 2005 through 2008 and a domestic net operating loss carryforward of 2,875,000 expiring in 2022 through 2023.
Tax credit carryforwards of 72,000 expired in 2003. As a result, a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded. 

 Realization
of the Company's net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdictions in future years to obtain
benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit carryforwards. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty related to the realization of
certain deferred tax assets existing at December 31, 2003. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable
income are changed. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the net deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowances as of December 31,
2003. 

 6. STOCK COMPENSATION 

Allied Motion Stock Option Plan 

At December 31, 2003, there were options outstanding to purchase 1,323,430 shares of common stock and options available for grant to purchase 119,540
shares under the Company's stock option plans. Under the terms of the plans, options may not be granted at less than 85 of fair market value. Generally, all options granted to date have been granted
at fair market value as of the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable evenly over three years starting one year from the date of grant and expire seven years from the date of grant. 

 As
of June 30, 2002, 112,360 options were granted in excess of the shares authorized under the stock option plans. The Company accounted for the over-issued stock
options using variable plan accounting. Variable plan accounting requires the Company to recognize the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the exercise price of the excess
options issued as compensation expense, to the extent that the fair market value exceeds the exercise price. A portion of the excess option grants were considered "fixed" on July 28, 2002 due
to the forfeiture of 112,360 options related to the sale of the Company's Power and Process Business. The remainder were considered "fixed" on October 24, 2002 when the Company's stockholders
approved an additional 400,000 available for grant. On those dates, compensation cost of 39,000 was calculated based upon the then-current fair market values of the underlying common
stock and will be recognized over the three -year vesting period of the options. Total compensation expense related to these stock options was 9,000 and 11,000 for 2003 and the
Transition Period, respectively. 

 In
conjunction with the sale of the Power and Process Business, all options held by employees of the business sold became immediately exercisable and expired on the closing date of the
sale or thirty 

 37 

days
later. All unexercised options on the expiration dates were forfeited and became eligible for future grant by the Company. The Company recorded compensation expense of 11,000 in the Transition
Period related to the accelerated vesting of these options 

 Option

Emoteq Corporation Stock Option Plan 

Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Company had granted options for shares of common stock of Emoteq Corporation (Emoteq, a wholly-owned subsidiary) to officers and
key employees of Emoteq. The options were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, and consisted of time vesting options and
performance vesting options. During fiscal year 2001 all of the outstanding (and also fully vested) stock options were exercised and 223,636 shares of Emoteq common stock, representing 12 ownership
of Emoteq, were issued. Proceeds to the 

 38 

Company
from the exercises totaled 498,000. Under the terms of the Emoteq stock option plan and the related stockholders' agreements, the stockholders had a liquidity put option that they could
exercise only after owning the stock for at least six months. If the holder of the shares elected this put option, the Company would be required to purchase the shares of Emoteq at their then current
fair market value. After holding the shares for at least six months, all such holders of Emoteq common stock exercised their put options and consequently, the Company purchased the shares for
 1,006,000, the fair value of the shares, for consideration consisting of Company common stock, notes payable and cash. The Company recorded 352,000 of cost in excess of net assets acquired
(goodwill) related to the purchase of these Emoteq shares. The Emoteq stock option plan and stockholders' agreements were terminated in August 2001.

 7. LOANS RECEIVABLE FOR STOCK 

 The Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust (the Plan) allows eligible Company employees to participate in ownership of the Company. The 200,000
receivable at December 31, 2003 represents the full amount the Company loaned to the Plan during year 2003 so that the Plan could acquire from the Company 130,719 newly issued shares of the
Company's common stock. The note bears an annual interest rate of 5.75 and is scheduled to mature May 31, 2018. The terms of the Plan require the Company to make an annual contribution equal
to the greater of i) the Board established percentage of pretax income before the contribution (5 in year 2003, the Transition Period and fiscal years 2002 and
2001 or ii) the annual interest payable on the note. Company contributions to the Plan were 51,000, 29,000, 37,000 and 133,000 in year 2003,
the Transition Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively.

in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and was 500,000 and zero at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accumulated amortization of the leased
equipment at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 was 18,000 and zero, respectively. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.

Severance Benefit Agreements 

The Company has entered into annually renewable severance benefit agreements with certain key employees which, among other things, provide inducement to the
employees to continue to work for 

 40 

the
Company during and after any period of threatened takeover. The agreements provide the employees with specified benefits upon the subsequent severance of employment in the event of change in
control of the Company and are effective for 24 months thereafter. The maximum amount of salary that could be required to be paid under these contracts, if such events occur, totaled
approximately 1,848,000 as of December 31, 2003. In addition to the salary above, severance benefits include payment of 20 of annual salary for life, disability, accident and health insurance
for 24 months and a pro-rata calculation of bonus for the current year. 

Consulting Agreement 

Effective September 1, 1998, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (Consulting Agreement) with the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is a
major stockholder. Under the Consulting Agreement, he will be compensated for providing consulting services to the Company as requested by the Chief Executive Officer. During Year 2003, the Transition
Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001 there was no compensation paid to the Chairman of the Board under the Consulting Agreement. 

Stock Repurchase Program 

Under an employee stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors, the Company may repurchase its common stock from its employees at the current
market value. The Company's Agreement with Silicon limits employee stock repurchases to 125,000 per fiscal year. The number of shares repurchased under the program was 1,968 for Year 2003 and zero
for the Transition Period and fiscal years 2002 and 2001. 

Litigation 

In 2001, the Company was named, with other parties, as a defendant in an environmental contamination lawsuit. During the Transition Period, the Company agreed to
settle this lawsuit. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2002, an estimated charge for the settlement and related legal fees of 1,429,000 961,000, net of tax) was recorded. This charge is included
in the results of discontinued operations. The lawsuit relates to property that was occupied by the Company's Power business over thirty-seven years ago. While the Company believes the suit was
without merit, it agreed to the settlement to eliminate the future costs of defending itself and the uncertainty and risks associated with litigation. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of
settlement, exclusive of legal costs, remaining to be paid was 250,000 included in Accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

 The
Company is also involved in certain actions that have arisen out of the ordinary course of business. Management believes that resolution of the actions will not have a significant
adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

 9. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT WELFARE PLANS 

Pension Plan 

Motor Products has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its hourly union employees. The benefits are based on years of service, the
employee's compensation during the last three years of employment, and accumulated employee contributions.

The
pension assets are managed by an outside investment manager. The Company's investment policy with respect to pension assets is to make investments solely in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of the plans and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits accrued and defraying the reasonable expenses of administration. The Company strives to maintain
investment diversification to assist in minimizing the risk of large losses. 

Postretirement Welfare Plan 

Motor Products provides postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits to current and former employees hired before January 1, 1994 who retire
from Motor Products. No contributions from retirees are required and the plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company recognizes the expected cost of
providing such post-retirement benefits during employees' active service periods.

For
measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate rate
by a said year, and remain at that level thereafter, per the following: 

December 31, 
2003 
 
 December 31, 
2002 

Annual rate of increase per capita of covered health care benefits 
 
 9.50

Ultimate rate 
 
 4.00 
 
 4.25 

Year ultimate rate is reached

 2013 

44 

The
healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003 by 438,000 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for year 2003 by 45,600. Decreasing the assumed healthcare postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003 by 1 decreases the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by 333,500 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for year 2003 by 34,000. The weighted
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.00 and 6.25 as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost was 6.00 for 2003 and 6.25 for 2002. 

 The
Company expects to contribute approximately 85,000 to the postretirement welfare plan during 2004. The accrued postretirement benefit cost has been reflected as a
non-current liability due to the insignificance of estimates to be funded in 2004. 

10. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

 Restructuring charges include the costs associated with the Company's strategy of reducing its facility requirements and implementing lean manufacturing
initiatives. These charges consist of costs that are incremental to the Company's ongoing operations and, for Year 2003, include employee termination related charges. 

 The
Company recorded restructuring charges of 211,000 in Year 2003, primarily associated with workforce reductions which were paid in the first half of the year. 

At
December 31, 2003, there were no outstanding liabilities related to the restructuring charges included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheet. 

 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION 

 SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" requires disclosure of operating segments, which as defined, are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance. 

 The
Company operates in one segment for the manufacture and marketing of motion control products for original equipment manufacturers and end user applications. In accordance with SFAS
No. 131, the Company's chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Office of the Chief Executive Officer, which reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating
resources and assessing performance for the entire company. SFAS No. 131, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment
information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports
revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under SFAS No. 131 due to their similar customer base and similarities in:
economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by
SFAS No. 131 can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and within this note.

The
Company's wholly-owned foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom was merged into the Emoteq subsidiary during Year 2003 and is included in the accompanying consolidated financial

 During
Year 2003, the Transition Period and Fiscal Year 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues. During fiscal years 2001 one customer accounted for 20 of
the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations. 

12. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

 On July 29, 2002, the Company sold substantially all the assets of its Power and Process Business to Qualitrol Power Products, LLC (Qualitrol Power) and
its affiliate Danaher UK Industries, Limited (DUKI). Both Qualitrol Power and DUKI are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Danaher Corporation, a publicly traded corporation under the symbol DHR. The
Power and Process Business was comprised of power instrumentation products, systems and automation products, and process instrumentation products. It also included investments in two Chinese joint
ventures; a 25 interest in Kehui and a 40 interest in HPMS, which were also sold (See Note 13). 

Proceeds
from the sale of substantially all of the Power and Process Business were 8,182,000 plus the assumption of certain related liabilities. Selling costs incurred were 1,278,000.
The after tax gain on the sale was 1,019,000. The Company received net proceeds of 7,020,000 in the Transition Period and 500,000 in the year 2003. 

 The
remaining assets of the Power and Process Segment related to the Company's Calibrator Business. On March 6, 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Calibrator Business to
a subsidiary of Martel Electronics Corp. The proceeds consisted of 200,000 received on March 6, 2003 plus 50,000 due on March 6, 2004. The amount due is included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets in the accompanying December 31, 2003 balance sheet. After consideration of selling costs of 51,000 incurred in the first quarter of 2003, the net proceeds on the sale
were 199,000. Due to a writedown of the carrying value of the Calibrator Business to its estimated fair value at September 30, 2002, there was no gain or loss recorded on the finalization of
the sale. 

 In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, the consolidated financial statements of the Company have been recast to present these businesses as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the
revenues, costs and expenses and assets and liabilities of these discontinued operations have been excluded from the respective captions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Balance Sheets and have been reported in the various statements under the captions, "Income (loss) from discontinued operations", "Current assets of segment held for sale" and "Current liabilities of
segment held for sale" for all periods. In addition, certain of these Notes have been recast for all periods to reflect the discontinuance of these operations.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

 There were no disagreements with KPMG LLP on accounting and financial disclosure matters. 

 On
July 17, 2002, the Company replaced Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as the principal accountant for the Company and its affiliates. For the previous two fiscal years,
the reports of Arthur Andersen on the Company's consolidated financial statements did not contain an adverse opinion nor a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles. The decision to replace Arthur Andersen was approved by the Company's Board of Directors. 

In
connection with the audits of the Company's financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001 and in the subsequent interim
period preceding Arthur Andersen's replacement, there were no disagreements on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which,
if not resolved to the satisfaction of Arthur Andersen, would have caused Arthur Andersen to make references to the matter in its reports. For a complete discussion, refer to the
Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 18, 2002. 

 On
July 17, 2002, the Company engaged as its new principal accountant KPMG LLP ("KPMG") for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. The decision to retain KPMG LLP was
approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee. During the two fiscal years preceding and through the date of their appointment, the Company has not
consulted with KPMG on matters of the type contemplated by Item 304 (a) (2) (i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. All of the fiscal periods included in this
Form 10-K have been audited by KPMG LLP because of the requirement to restate the financial statements for discontinued operations. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

 The Company's controls and procedures include those designed to ensure that material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2003 the Company's chief executive officer and chief
financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner
as required by Exchange Act reports such as this Form 10-K and concluded that they are effective. 

 There
has not been any significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2003 that has materially affected or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, dated and effective as of August 1, 2003 is between Allied Motion Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the
"Company"), and Richard D. Smith ("Employee"). 

 RECITALS: 

 The Employee has acknowledged skills and experience in the business conducted by the Company and the Company desires to obtain the benefit of the Employee's
knowledge, skills and experience and assure itself of the ongoing right to Employee's services from and after the date hereof, and is willing to do so on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Employee is willing and able to render services to the Company, from and after the date hereof, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

 AGREEMENT: 

 NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and Employee agree as follows: 

1. Employment. 

1.1 Title and Duties of Employee. The Company hereby
employs Employee as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Employee hereby accepts such employment with the Company. 

(a) Powers and Duties. Employee shall have the powers and duties normally incident to the offices he holds as
provided in the bylaws of the Company and such other duties as shall be determined from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") consistent with Employee's qualifications and the
best interest of the Company. Employee shall report to the Board. Employee's powers and authorities shall be superior to those of any other officer or employee of the Company or any subsidiary
thereof. 

 (b) Contract Rights. Failure of the Board to elect Employee as Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer, or action by the Board to remove Employee from such offices, shall be without prejudice to the contract rights in this Agreement. 

 (c) Service on the Board. So long as Employee is willing to serve on the Board and has not been terminated for
cause, the Board shall nominate Employee for election to the Board. Failure to elect to, or removal from, the position of director or Chief Executive Officer or termination of this Agreement for any
reason shall not constitute resignation from the Board or termination of Employee's service on the Board and termination of employment as Chief Executive Officer shall not include termination as a
director. 

1.2 Performance. Throughout the period of Employee's employment
hereunder, Employee shall devote Employee's full business time, attention, knowledge and skills, faithfully, diligently, and to the best of Employee's ability, to the active performance of Employee's
duties and responsibilities hereunder; provided, however , Employee may serve as a 

1 

director
of other corporations and entities and may engage in other activities to the extent they do not inhibit the performance of Employee's duties hereunder, or conflict with the business of the
Company. Employee shall disclose to the Company the name of any corporation or entity on which he serves as a director or in a similar capacity and describe other activities that are not personal in
nature in which he engages. Employee shall do such traveling as reasonably may be required in connection with the performance of such duties and responsibilities. Employee shall not be required to
relocate Employee's residence and Employee may conduct work out of his residence from time to time as he determines appropriate. 

2. Term of Employment. Unless terminated as provided in
Section 4 hereof, the term of this Agreement shall extend to July 31, 2008 (the "Initial Period"), and thereafter shall automatically continue on a year to year basis (each a "Subsequent
Period") unless the Company or Employee shall give the other party notice at least 60 days prior to the termination of the Initial Period or any Subsequent Period of its or his election not to
renew the term of employment, in which case this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the period in which the notice is given; provided, however , the
Company's obligation to pay compensation pursuant to Section 3 or perform any other acts with respect to the last year for which this Agreement is effective shall continue and be enforceable
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. 

 3. Compensation Benefits. 

3.1 Base Salary . As compensation for services to be rendered by
Employee hereunder, the Company shall pay to Employee an annual salary of not less than 235,000 per year, payable in periodic installments (but in no event less frequently than monthly) in accordance
with the standard payroll practices of the Company in effect from time to time. Employee's salary shall be reviewed annually for increase (but not decrease) on a merit basis. Such review shall be
conducted at the first meeting of the Board after the end of a fiscal year but not later than February 28 of each year and the effective date of any such increase shall be March 1. The
Employee's annual salary in effect from year to year is herein referred to as the "Base Salary". 

3.2 Annual Bonus. 

(a) Performance Criteria. The Company shall pay to Employee an Annual Bonus with respect to each fiscal year in
amounts determined as provided by the Board based on achieving performance criteria
established at the beginning of each fiscal year. Such performance criteria will recognize the overall financial performance of the Company and the improvements made in financial results. 

(b) Time of Payment. The first payment of the Annual Bonus to Employee pursuant to Section 3.2
(a) shall be with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. An Annual Bonus provided herein shall be paid, subject to achieving the performance criteria, with respect to each
fiscal year thereafter during the term of this Agreement. All Annual Bonuses payable under Section 3.2 (a) shall be paid in cash immediately following the first Board meeting held after
the end of the applicable fiscal year at which the Annual Bonus calculation is approved by the Board. 

3.3 Long-Term Incentive Payment Plan. On or before
the first Board meeting held in a current fiscal year, the Board shall consider whether to grant options to purchase the Company's Common Stock ("Stock Options") to Employee, including the terms and
the provisions of any Stock Options. Grants of Stock Options provided under this Section 3.3 are referred to herein as "Long-Term Incentive Payout". In making its determination the
Board shall consider, among other things, the Employee's responsibilities and efforts and 

2 

performance
under this Agreement in relation to the business plan and forecast, the relationship between the benefits of Stock Options and improving shareholder value, the development of the Company's
products and the performance of the Company's products in the marketplace, impact of the Company's products and product development on future prospects for the Company, and an increase in the trading
price per share of the Company's Common Stock. The Board shall also consider customary business practices and Long-Term Incentive Payment Plan benefits granted to Employee in comparison to
such benefits provided to other executives in positions similar to the Employee.

adversely affect the Employee's rights or benefits thereunder, unless such changes occur pursuant to a program applicable to all employees of the Company and do not result in a proportionately greater
reduction in the rights of, or benefits to, the Employee as compared with any other employee of the Company. 

 (b) Office Space. The Company shall provide office space and secretarial services at the Company's offices
suitable to Employee's position.

in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause without written notice pursuant to Section 13 and providing

this Agreement. 

 4.10 Termination by Employee. Employee may terminate this
Agreement by resigning as Chief Executive Officer upon at least 30 days prior written notice of the effective Date of Termination. In such event the Company shall continue Employee's Base
Salary and all fringe benefits to the effective Date of Termination. Termination of this Agreement under this Section does not affect the Company's obligation to make all payments to Employee which

Dear
Mr. Smith: 

 Allied
Motion Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") has determined that it is essential to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to foster the continuous employment
of key management personnel including you as CEO of the Company. The board of directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the
possibility of a change in control of the Company exists. Such possibility and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. In addition, the Company seeks your unequivocal support in realizing the maximum value per share to shareholders in the event
of a disposition of the Company. In the event of a change of control, we also seek your cooperation in a smooth transition of
management. These objectives require employment arrangements that provide security to you in the face of uncertainty. 

 The
Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of management, including yourself, to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. 

 In
order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, and in consideration of your agreements set forth in Section 2(ii), the Company agrees that you shall receive the
severance benefits set forth in this letter agreement ("Agreement") in the event your employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a change in control of the Company (as defined in
Section 2 hereof) under the circumstances described below. 

 1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through
December 31, 2003; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2004 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement
shall automatically be extended for one additional year (meaning that as of each January 1 this Agreement shall then have a term of two years which shall reduce during the ensuing
12 months but shall again be extended on the next following January 1 to a term of two years) unless, not later than the September 30 immediately preceding each such
January 1, the Company shall have given notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement; provided further, if a change in control of the
Company shall have occurred during the original or extended term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of 24 months beyond the month in which such event
occurred. 

 2.(i) Change in Control of the Company. No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless there shall have been a
change in control of the Company, as set forth below. For purposes of this Agreement, a "change in control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred (A) if any "Person" (as such term is
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 

 1 

amended
(the "Exchange Act")), other than (1) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, or any Person or entity organized, appointed or
established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or (2) any Person who, on the date hereof, is a director or officer of the Company or whose shares of common stock of
the Company are treated as beneficially owned (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by any such director or officer, is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 45 of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or (B) upon the first purchase of outstanding
shares of the Company's outstanding common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer (other than a tender or exchange offer made by the Company, by an employee benefit plan established or
maintained by the Company or by any of their respective affiliates); or (C) if during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who, at the beginning of such period, constitute
the Board and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in clauses (A) or (D) of
this Subsection) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds 2 / 3 of the Company
directors then still in office who either (1) were directors at the beginning of the period or (2) whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
reason to constitute a majority thereof; or (D) if the shareholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or
consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into
voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 80 of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
consolidation; or (E) the shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially
all of the Company's assets; 

 provided, however , a spinoff distribution to shareholders of the Company of all or part of the Company's equity interest in a subsidiary
entity shall not constitute a change in control of the Company. 

(ii) Potential Change in Control of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "potential change in control
of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a change in control of the Company;
(B) any Person (including the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would constitute a change in control of the Company;
(C) any Person, other than (1) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, or (2) any Person or entity organized, appointed or
established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or (3) any Person who, on the date hereof, is a director or officer of the Company or whose shares of common stock of
the Company are treated as beneficially owned by any such director or officer, increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 8 or more of the shares of the Company issued and outstanding
on the date of such determination; or (D) the Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a potential change in control of the Company has occurred. You agree
that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event of a potential change in control of the Company, you will remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of
(1) a date which is twelve (12) months after the occurrence of such potential change in control of the Company, (2) the termination by you of your employment by reason of death or
Disability or Retirement, as defined in Section 3(i), or (3) the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. 

2 

3. Termination Following Change in Control. If any of the events described in Section 2(i) hereof
constituting a change in control of the Company shall have occurred, you shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 4(iii) hereof upon the subsequent termination of your
employment during the term of this Agreement unless such termination is (A) because of your death, Disability or Retirement, (B) by the Company for Cause, or (C) by you other than
for Good Reason. 

(i) Disability; Retirement. If, as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall have
been absent from the full-time performance of your duties with the Company for six (6) consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is
given you shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties, your employment may be terminated for "Disability". Termination of your employment based on "Retirement"
shall mean your termination in accordance with any retirement arrangement established with your consent. 

(ii) Cause. Termination by the Company of your employment for "Cause" shall mean termination upon (A) an
act of dishonesty constituting a felony under the laws of your domicile and resulting or intending to result in your gain or personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, or (B) use of
drugs or excessive and habitual use of alcohol either of which substantially affects your ability to perform your duties with the Company, or (C) continued unauthorized and significant absences
from duty (other than any such absences resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated absences after the issuance of a Notice of Termination by you
for Good Reason as defined in Sections 3(iv) and 3(iii), respectively) after a written notice is delivered to you by the Company, which notice specifically identifies the cause referred to
above which is identified as the basis for termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you
a copy of a resolution duly adopted by
the Board with the approval of not less than three-fourths 3 / 4 of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct set forth above and
specifying the particulars thereof in detail. 

 (iii) Good Reason. You shall be entitled to terminate your employment for Good Reason. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean, without your express written consent, the occurrence after a change in control of the Company of any of the following circumstances unless, in the case of
paragraphs (A), (B), (G), (H) or (I), such circumstances are fully corrected prior to the Date of Termination specified in the Notice of Termination, as defined in
Sections 3(v) and 3(iv), respectively, given in respect thereof; 

(A) any
change in your title or corporation office, the assignment to you of any duties inconsistent with your status as CEO of the Company, or a substantial adverse
alteration in the nature or status of your responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control of the Company; 

 (B) the
change of the principal business of the Company (for purposes of this Agreement, as it is composed immediately prior to the change in control of the Company) as
evidenced by, but not limited to, any sale of assets of the Company producing more than 50 of the Company's revenue, or comprising more than 50 of the Company's total assets, in any of the three
most recent fiscal years prior to such sale; 

 (C) a
reduction, without your consent, in your annual base salary as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to time; 

3 

(D) the
relocation of your principal office to a location more than 50 miles from the location where such office is located immediately prior to the change in control of the
Company except for required travel on Company business to an extent substantially consistent with your present business travel obligations; 

 (E) the
failure, without your consent, to pay to you any portion of your current compensation or to pay to you any portion of an installment of deferred compensation under
any deferred compensation program applicable to you, within seven (7) days of the date such compensation is due; 

 (F) the
failure by the Company to continue in effect, except upon expiration in accordance with their terms, any compensation plan in which you participate immediately prior
to the change in control of the Company which is material to your total compensation, including but not limited to the Company's Management Incentive Bonus Plan, Tax-Advantaged Investment
Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust, and 1991 Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, or any plans adopted in substitution of existing plans prior to the change in control of the
Company, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with respect to such plan, or the failure by the Company to continue your participation
therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the amount of benefits provided and the level of your participation relative to other
participants, as existed at the time of the change in control of the Company; 

 (G) the
failure by the Company to continue to provide you with benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by you under any of the Company's life insurance, medical,
health and accident, or disability plans in which you were participating at the time of the change in control of the Company, the taking of any action by the Company which would directly or indirectly
materially reduce any of such benefits or deprive you of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by you at the time of the change in control of the Company, or the failure by the Company to provide you
with the number of paid vacation days to which you are entitled on the basis of years of service with the Company in accordance with the Company's normal vacation policy in effect at the

 (H) the
events described as a breach in Section 6 (i) or (ii) hereof; or 

(I) any
purported termination of your employment which is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of Subsection (iv) below (and,
if applicable, the requirements of Subsection (ii) above); for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective. 

Your
right to terminate your employment pursuant to this Subsection (iii) shall not be affected by your incapacity due to physical or mental illness. Your continued employment shall not
constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason hereunder. 

(iv) Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of your employment by the Company or by you shall be
communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 7 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which

employment under the provision so indicated.

Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty
(30) day period), and (B) if your employment is terminated pursuant to Subsection (ii) or (iii) above or for any other reason (other than Disability), the date
specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination pursuant to Subsection (ii) above shall be not less than thirty (30) days, and in the case of a
termination pursuant to Subsection (iii) above shall be not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is

determined without regard to this proviso), the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be
the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the parties, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected); provided
further, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues the
resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence. Notwithstanding the pendency of any such dispute, you shall continue to perform your duties for the Company and the Company will continue to pay
you your full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to, base salary) and continue you as a participant in all compensation, benefit
and insurance plans in which you were participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is finally resolved in accordance with this Subsection. Amounts paid under
this Subsection are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement. 

4. Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability. Following a change in control of the Company, as defined
by Section 2(i), upon termination of your employment or during a period of Disability you shall be entitled to the following benefits: 

(i) During
any period that you fail to perform your full-time duties with the Company as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall
continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all compensation payable to you under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan or
other plan during such period, until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 3(i) hereof. Thereafter, or in the event your employment shall be terminated by the Company or by
you for Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall be determined pursuant to agreements between you and the Company and the Company's insurance and other compensation programs then in
effect in accordance with the terms of such programs. 

 (ii) If
your employment shall be terminated by the Company for Cause or by you other than for Good Reason, Disability, death or Retirement, the Company shall pay you your
full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the
Company at the time such payments are due, and the Company shall have no further obligations to you under this Agreement. 

5 

(iii) If
your employment by the Company shall be terminated (a) by the Company other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability or (b) by you for Good Reason,
then you shall be entitled to the benefits provided below: 

(A) the
Company shall pay you your full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts
to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company, at the time such payments are due, except as otherwise provided below; 

 (B) in
lieu of any further salary payments to you for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as severance pay to you a lump sum payment
(together with the payments provided in paragraph C, below, the "Severance Payments") equal to 2.5 times the sum of (x) your annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the
occurrence of the circumstance giving rise to the Notice of Termination given in respect thereof and (y) the amount paid to you pursuant to the Management Incentive Compensation Plan for the
fiscal year immediately prior to the Notice of Termination; 

 (C) notwithstanding
any provision of any incentive compensation plan applicable to you, the Company shall pay to you a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (x) any
incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to you for a fiscal year or other measuring period preceding the Date of Termination but has not yet been paid, and (y) an allocation
under any annual or long-term incentive plan applicable to you for the current fiscal year with all tests for income adjusted pro rata according to the number of calendar months,
including the month in which the Date of Termination occurs, that have elapsed in the fiscal year of termination; 

 (D) the
Company shall also pay to you all legal fees and expenses incurred by you as a result of such termination (including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
contesting or disputing any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent
attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to any payment or benefit provided hereunder); 

(E) in
the event that you become entitled to payments (the "Severance Payments") provided under paragraphs (B), (C), and (D), above, and Subsection (iv), below, if any of
the Severance Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to you at the time specified in paragraph (F), below, an
additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by you, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Severance Payments and any federal and state and local income
tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph, shall be equal to the Severance Payments. For purposes of determining whether any of the Severance Payments will be subject to the
Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) any other payments or benefits received or to be received by you in connection with a change in control of the Company or your termination of
employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change in control or any person
affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company's independent auditors and acceptable to you, such
other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually
rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the base amount within the 

6 

meaning
of section 280G(b)(3) of the Code, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of the Severance Payments which shall be treated as subject to the
Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total amount of the Severance Payments or (B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of
section 280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (i), above), and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by
the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
Payment, you shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state
and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of your residence on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination
of your employment, you shall repay to the Company at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to
such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid
by you if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal and state and local income tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in
section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of the termination of your employment
(including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional gross-up
payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess if finally determined; 

 (F) the
payments provided for in paragraphs (B), (C) and (E) above, shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination, provided,
however, that if the amounts of such payments
cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company, shall pay to you on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall
pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event
later than the thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall

(A) does not assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place, or

amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled to hereunder if you terminate your Employment for Good Reason following a change in control of the Company, except that for purposes of
implementing

following a change in control of the Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.
However, if you enter into an employment agreement with the transferee entity as a part of the transaction or if such transferee entity (1) does assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place, or (2) alternatively, does offer to provide you an agreement with benefits
substantially similar to this Agreement, then the obligation hereunder of the Company shall be released from all obligations under this Agreement.

hereunder, Employee shall devote Employee's full business time, attention, knowledge and skills, faithfully, diligently, and to the best of Employee's ability, to the active performance of Employee's
duties and responsibilities hereunder; provided, however , Employee may serve as a director of other corporations and entities and may engage in other

"Subsequent Period") unless the Company or Employee shall give the other
party notice at least 60 days prior to the termination of the Initial Period or any Subsequent Period of its or his election not to renew the term of employment, in which case this Agreement

Dear
Mr. Warzala: 

 Hathaway
Corporation (the "Company") has determined that it is essential to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management
personnel including you as President of the Company. The board of directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a
change in control of the Company exists. Such possibility and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to
the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. In addition, the Company seeks your unequivocal support in realizing the maximum value per share to shareholders in the event of a disposition of the
Company. In the event of a change of control, we also seek your cooperation in a smooth transition of management. These objectives require employment arrangements that provide security to you in the
face of uncertainty. 

 The
Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of management, including yourself, to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. 

 In
order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, and in consideration of your agreements set forth in Section 2(ii), the Company agrees that you shall receive the
severance benefits set forth in this letter agreement ("Agreement") in the event your employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a change in control of the Company (as defined in
Section 2 hereof) under the circumstances described below. 

 1. Term of Agreement . This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through
December 31, 2003; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2004 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement
shall automatically be extended for one additional year (meaning that as of each January 1 this Agreement shall then have a term of two years which shall reduce during the ensuing
12 months but shall again be extended on the next following January 1 to a term of two years) unless, not later than the September 30 immediately preceding each such
January 1, the Company shall have given notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement; provided further, if a change in control of the
Company shall have occurred during the original or extended term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of 24 months beyond the month in which such event
occurred. 

 2.(i) Change in Control of the Company . No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless there shall have been a change in
control of the Company, as set forth below. For purposes of this Agreement, a "change in control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred (A) if any "Person" (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than (1) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an
employee 

benefit
plan of the Company, or any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or (2) any Person who, on the date hereof,
is a director or officer of the Company or whose shares of common stock of the Company are treated as beneficially owned (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by any
such director or officer, is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 45 of the combined voting power of the Company's then
outstanding securities; or (B) upon the first purchase of outstanding shares of the Company's outstanding common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer (other than a tender or exchange
offer made by the Company, by an employee benefit plan established or maintained by the Company or by any of their respective affiliates); or (C) if during any period of two
consecutive years, individuals who, at the beginning of such period, constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement
with the Company to effect a transaction described in clauses (A) or (D) of this Subsection) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds 2 / 3 of the Company directors then still in office who either (1) were directors at the beginning of the period or
(2) whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or (D) if the shareholders of the Company approve a
merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto
continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 80 of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the
Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (E) the shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an
agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; 

 provided, however , a spinoff distribution to shareholders of the Company of all or part of the Company's equity interest in a subsidiary
entity shall not constitute a change in control of the Company. 

(ii) Potential Change in Control of the Company . For purposes of this Agreement, a "potential change in control of the
Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a change in control of the Company;
(B) any Person (including the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would constitute a change in control of the Company;
(C) any Person, other than (1) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, or (2) any Person or entity organized, appointed or
established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or (3) any Person who, on the date hereof, is a director or officer of the Company or whose shares of common stock of
the Company are treated as beneficially owned by any such director or officer, increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 8 or more of the shares of the Company issued and outstanding
on the date of such determination; or (D) the Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a potential change in control of the Company has occurred. You agree
that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event of a potential change in control of the Company, you will remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of
(1) a date which is twelve (12) months after the occurrence of such potential change in control of the Company, (2) the termination by you of your employment by reason of death or
Disability or Retirement, as defined in Section 3(i), or (3) the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. 

3. Termination Following Change in Control . If any of the events described in Section 2(i) hereof constituting
a change in control of the Company shall have occurred, you shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 4(iii) hereof upon the subsequent termination of your employment during 

 2 

the
term of this Agreement unless such termination is (A) because of your death, Disability or Retirement, (B) by the Company for Cause, or (C) by you other than for Good Reason. 

(i) Disability; Retirement . If, as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall have been absent
from the full-time performance of your duties with the Company for six (6) consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given you
shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties, your employment may be terminated for "Disability". Termination of your employment based on "Retirement" shall mean
your termination in accordance with any retirement arrangement established with your consent. 

 (ii) Cause . Termination by the Company of your employment for "Cause" shall mean termination upon (A) an act of
dishonesty constituting a felony under the laws of your domicile and resulting or intending to result in your gain or personal enrichment at the expense of the Company, or (B) use of drugs or
excessive and habitual use of alcohol either of which substantially affects your ability to perform your duties with the Company, or (C) continued unauthorized and significant absences from
duty (other than any such absences resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated absences after the issuance of a Notice of Termination by you for
Good Reason as defined in Sections 3(iv) and 3(iii), respectively) after a written notice is delivered to you by the Company, which notice specifically identifies the cause referred to above
which is identified as the basis for termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board with the approval of not less than three-fourths 3 / 4 of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for
such purpose (after reasonable notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty
of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. 

 (iii) Good Reason . You shall be entitled to terminate your employment for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good
Reason" shall mean, without your express written consent, the occurrence after a change in control of the Company of any of the following circumstances unless, in the case of paragraphs (A), (B), (G),
(H) or (I), such circumstances are fully corrected prior to the Date of Termination specified in the Notice of Termination, as defined in Sections 3(v) and 3(iv), respectively,
given in respect thereof; 

(A) any
change in your title or corporation office, the assignment to you of any duties inconsistent with your status as President of the Company, or a substantial adverse
alteration in the nature or status of
your responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control of the Company; 

 (B) the
change of the principal business of the Company (for purposes of this Agreement, as it is composed immediately prior to the change in control of the Company) as
evidenced by, but not limited to, any sale of assets of the Company producing more than 50 of the Company's revenue, or comprising more than 50 of the Company's total assets, in any of the three
most recent fiscal years prior to such sale; 

 (C) a
reduction, without your consent, in your annual base salary as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to time; 

 (D) the
relocation of your principal office to a location more than 50 miles from the location where such office is located immediately prior to the change in control of the
Company except for required travel on Company business to an extent substantially consistent with your present business travel obligations; 

(E) the
failure, without your consent, to pay to you any portion of your current compensation or to pay to you any portion of an installment of deferred compensation under 

3 

any
deferred compensation program applicable to you, within seven (7) days of the date such compensation is due; 

 (F) the
failure by the Company to continue in effect, except upon expiration in accordance with their terms, any compensation plan in which you participate immediately prior
to the change in control of the Company which is material to your total compensation, including but not limited to the Company's Management Incentive Bonus Plan, Tax-Advantaged Investment
Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust, and 1991 Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, or any plans adopted in substitution of existing plans prior to the change in control of the
Company, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with respect to such plan, or the failure by the Company to continue your participation
therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the amount of benefits provided and the level of your participation relative to other
participants, as existed at the time of the change in control of the Company; 

 (G) the
failure by the Company to continue to provide you with benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by you under any of the Company's life insurance, medical,
health and accident, or disability
plans in which you were participating at the time of the change in control of the Company, the taking of any action by the Company which would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such
benefits or deprive you of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by you at the time of the change in control of the Company, or the failure by the Company to provide you with the number of paid
vacation days to which you are entitled on the basis of years of service with the Company in accordance with the Company's normal vacation policy in effect at the time of the change in
control of the Company; 

 (H) the
events described as a breach in Section 6 (i) or (ii) hereof; or 

 (I) any
purported termination of your employment which is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of Subsection (iv) below (and,
if applicable, the requirements of Subsection (ii) above); for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective. 

Your
right to terminate your employment pursuant to this Subsection (iii) shall not be affected by your incapacity due to physical or mental illness. Your continued
employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason hereunder.

written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 7 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate

under the provision so indicated.

Subsection (iii) above shall be not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is given); provided that if within
fifteen (15) days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
without regard to this proviso), the party 

4 

receiving
such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute is finally resolved,
either by mutual written agreement of the parties, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect
to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected); provided further, that the Date of Termination shall be extended
by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence. Notwithstanding the pendency of any
such dispute, you shall continue to perform your duties for the Company and the Company will continue to pay you your full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given
(including, but not limited to, base salary) and continue you as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which you were participating when the notice giving rise to the
dispute was given, until the dispute is finally resolved in accordance with this Subsection. Amounts paid under this Subsection are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and
shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement. 

4. Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability . Following a change in control of the Company, as defined by
Section 2(i), upon termination of your employment or during a period of Disability you shall be entitled to the following benefits: 

(i) During
any period that you fail to perform your full-time duties with the Company as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall
continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all compensation payable to you under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan or
other plan during such period, until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 3(i) hereof. Thereafter, or in the event your employment shall be terminated by the Company or by
you for Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall be determined pursuant to agreements between you and the Company and the Company's insurance and other compensation programs then in
effect in accordance with the terms of such programs. 

 (ii) If
your employment shall be terminated by the Company for Cause or by you other than for Good Reason, Disability, death or Retirement, the Company shall pay you your
full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other
amounts to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company at the time such payments are due, and the Company shall have no further obligations to you under this Agreement. 

(iii) If
your employment by the Company shall be terminated (a) by the Company other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability or (b) by you for Good Reason,
then you shall be entitled to the benefits provided below: 

(A) the
Company shall pay you your full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts
to which you are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company, at the time such payments are due, except as otherwise provided below; 

 (B) in
lieu of any further salary payments to you for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as severance pay to you a lump sum payment
(together with the payments provided in paragraph C, below, the "Severance Payments") equal to 2.5 times the sum of (x) your annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the
occurrence of the circumstance giving rise to the Notice of Termination given in respect thereof and (y) the amount paid to you pursuant to the Management Incentive Compensation Plan for the
fiscal year immediately prior to the Notice of Termination; 

5 

(C) notwithstanding
any provision of any incentive compensation plan applicable to you, the Company shall pay to you a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (x) any
incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to you for a fiscal year or other measuring period preceding the Date of Termination but has not yet been paid, and (y) an allocation
under any annual or long-term incentive plan applicable to you for the current fiscal year with all tests for income adjusted pro rata according to the number of calendar months,
including the month in which the Date of Termination occurs, that have elapsed in the fiscal year of termination; 

 (D) the
Company shall also pay to you all legal fees and expenses incurred by you as a result of such termination (including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
contesting or disputing any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent
attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to any payment or benefit provided hereunder); 

 (E) in
the event that you become entitled to payments (the "Severance Payments") provided under paragraphs (B), (C), and (D), above, and Subsection (iv), below, if any of
the Severance Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to you at the time specified in paragraph (F), below, an
additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by you, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Severance Payments and any federal and state and local income
tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph, shall be equal to the Severance Payments. For purposes of determining whether any of the Severance Payments will be subject to the
Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) any other payments or benefits received or to be received by you in connection with a change in control of the Company or your termination of
employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change in control or any person
affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company's independent auditors and acceptable to you,
such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services
actually rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the base amount within the meaning of section 280G(b)(3) of the Code, or are otherwise
not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of the Severance Payments which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total amount of the
Severance Payments or (B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (i), above), and (iii) the value of
any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of
sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, you shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest
marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the
state and locality of your residence on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the event
that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of your employment, you shall repay to the Company at the time that
the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such 

6 

reduction
(plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by
you if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal and state and local income tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in
section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of the termination of your employment
(including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional gross-up
payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess if finally determined; 

(F) the
payments provided for in paragraphs (B), (C) and (E) above, shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination, provided,
however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company, shall pay to you on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company, of
the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth day after the Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined
to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to you payable on the fifth day after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate provided in
section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). 

(iv) If
your employment shall be terminated (A) by the Company other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability or (B) by you for Good Reason, then for a
24-month period after such termination, the Company shall pay you on a monthly basis an amount equal to 20 of your monthly Base Salary being paid on your Date of Termination for you to
directly acquire whatever benefits you choose for the 24 months immediately following the Date of Termination. 

(v) You
shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of
any payment or benefit provided for in this Section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any
amount claimed to be owed by you to the Company, or otherwise. 

5. Termination Before Change in Control . If your employment by the Company shall be terminated by the Company other than for
Cause, Retirement or Disability, and a change in control of the Company occurs within 90 days thereafter, you shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 4(iii) hereof. 

 6. Successors; Binding Agreement; Release of the Company. 

(i) In
the event there is a disposition of the Company in a transaction as described in Section 2(i)(A), (B) (C) or (D), and the Company under new
ownership or any successor to the Company in such transactions, and any business entity beneficially owning directly or indirectly 50 or more equity interest in the Company or any such successor,
(A) does not assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place, or
(B) alternatively, does not offer to provide you an agreement with benefits substantially similar to this Agreement, then such failure to obtain the events described in clauses (A) or
(B) above of this Section 6(i), prior to the effectiveness of such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle you to compensation from the Company in the same
amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled to hereunder if you terminate your Employment for Good Reason following a change in control of the Company, except that for purposes of
implementing the foregoing, the date on 

7 

which
any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. However, if you enter into an employment agreement with the Company or such successor as a part of the transaction
or if the Company or any such successor, (1) does assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform it if no
succession had taken place, or (2) alternatively, does offer to provide you an agreement with benefits substantially similar to this Agreement, then the obligation hereunder of the Company
shall be released from all obligations under this Agreement. 

 (ii) In
the event there is a disposition in a transaction described in Section 2(iii)(D) and any transferee entity in such a transaction, and any business entity
beneficially owning directly or indirectly 50 or more equity interest in such transferee entity (A) does not assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place, or (B) alternatively, does not offer to provide you an agreement with benefits substantially similar to this
Agreement, then such failure to obtain the events described in clauses (A) or (B) above of this Section 6(ii), prior to the effectiveness of such succession shall be a breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle you to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled to hereunder if you terminate your Employment for Good Reason
following a change in control of the Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.
However, if you enter into an employment agreement with the transferee entity as a part of the transaction or if such transferee entity (1) does assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place, or (2) alternatively, does offer to provide you an agreement with benefits
substantially similar to this Agreement, then the obligation hereunder of the Company shall be released from all obligations under this Agreement. 

(iii) This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees,
devisees and legatees. If you should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate. 

 (iv) Your
obligations hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Company and each of its successors and assigns by contract, operation of law or
otherwise.

discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by you and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party
hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or

 11. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or

 Silicon Valley Bank 

Amendment to Loan Documents 

Borrower: 
 
 Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (fka Hathaway Corporation) 
Allied Motion Systems Corporation (fka Hathaway Systems Corporation) 
Allied Motion Process Instrumentation Corporation (fka Hathaway Process Instrumentation Corporation) 
Allied Motion Control Corporation (fka Hathaway Motion Control Corporation) 
Allied Motion Industrial Automation, Inc. (fka Hathaway Industrial Automation, Inc.)

Motor Products Corporation (fka Motor Products-Owosso Corporation) 

Date: 
 
 September 26, 2003 

THIS AMENDMENT TO LOAN DOCUMENTS is entered into between SILICON VALLEY BANK ("Silicon") and the borrower named above (jointly and
severally, "Borrower"). 

 The
Parties agree to amend the Loan and Security Agreement between them, dated May 7, 1998 (as amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), as follows, effective as of
September 10, 2003. (Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement.) 

1. Modified Interest Rate. Section 2 of the Schedule to Loan and Security Agreement, entitled "2. INTEREST," is hereby
amended to read as follows: 

2. INTEREST. 

Interest Rate (Section 1.2): 

 With
respect to the Revolving Loans: 

 A
rate equal to the "Prime Rate" in effect from time to time, plus 1.0 per annum; provided that the interest rate in effect on any given day, including
after taking into account the reduction, if any, described below, shall not be less than 5.0 per annum. The foregoing interest rate shall be reduced by
0.25 per annum at such time as, and for so long as, Borrower has achieved a Quick Ratio (as defined below) for two consecutive fiscal quarters (the first of which may not be earlier than the fiscal
quarter ending September 30, 2002) greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1. The foregoing rate reduction shall go into effect as of the date of the second consecutive quarter's financial statements
showing that Borrower is entitled to such rate reduction. If the interest rate is so reduced, based on financial statements as of a certain date and thereafter Borrower's Quick Ratio is no longer at
least 1.50 to 1, then the interest rate shall be increased by 0.25 per annum, which rate increase shall go into effect as of the date of the financial statements showing that Borrower is no longer
entitled to the rate reduction. Such reduction(s) and increase(s) may be made throughout the term of this Agreement. 

 With
respect to the Term Loan: 

 A
rate equal to the U.S. Treasury note yield to maturity for a term of 36 months as quoted in The Wall Street Journal on the day the Term Loan is advanced, plus 5.50 per 

1 

annum.
The foregoing interest rate shall be reduced by 0.50 per annum at such time as, and for so long as, Borrower has achieved a Quick Ratio (as defined below) for two consecutive fiscal quarters
(the first of which may not be earlier than the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2002) greater than or equal to 1.20 to 1 but less than 1.50 to 1, and shall be reduced by an additional 0.25 
per annum at such time as, and for so long as, Borrower has achieved a Quick Ratio for two consecutive fiscal quarters (the first of which may not be earlier than the fiscal quarter ending
September 30, 2002) of greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1. The foregoing rate reduction(s) shall go into effect as of the date of the second consecutive quarter's financial statements showing
that Borrower is entitled to such rate reduction(s). If the interest rate is so reduced, based on financial statements as of a certain date and thereafter Borrower's Quick Ratio is no longer at least
1.50 to 1, then the interest rate shall be increased by 0.25 per annum, and if the Borrower's Quick Ratio is no longer at least 1.20 to 1, then the interest rate shall be increased by an additional
0.50 per annum, which rate increase(s) shall go into effect as of the date of the financial statements showing that Borrower is no longer entitled to the rate reduction(s). Such reduction(s) and
increase(s) may be made throughout the term of this Agreement. 

 With
respect to all Loans: 

 Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall an interest rate reduction go into effect if, at the date it is to go into effect, an Event of Default has occurred. 

As
used above, "Quick Ratio" shall mean the ratio of Borrower's accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, in each case held at Silicon, to Borrower's current liabilities (including, with respect
to any long-term indebtedness, only that portion of such long-term indebtedness that is equal to twelve months' worth of regularly scheduled payments of principal on
such long-term indebtedness) determined in accordance with GAAP. 

 With
respect to all Loans, interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. "Prime Rate" means the rate announced from time to time
by Silicon as its "prime rate;" it is a base rate upon which other rates charged by Silicon are based, and it is not necessarily the best rate available at Silicon. The interest rate applicable to the
Obligations shall change on each date there is a change in the Prime Rate. 

 Minimum Monthly Interest (Section 1.2): Not Applicable. 

2. Modified Collateral Monitoring Fee. The Collateral Monitoring Fee set forth in Section 3 of the Schedule to Loan
and Security Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows: 

Collateral
Monitoring Fee: 1,000, per calendar month, payable in arrears (prorated for any partial calendar month at the beginning and at termination of this Agreement). 

3. Modified Maturity Date. Section 4 of the Schedule to Loan and Security Agreement is hereby amended to read as
follows: 

4. MATURITY DATE (Section 6.1): 

February 28, 2004 , subject to early termination as provided in Section 6.2 above. 

 Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to the Term Loan: The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan shall be repaid by Borrower to Silicon in forty-two (42) equal
monthly payments of principal, commencing on September 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each subsequent month until the earlier of the following dates: (i) the date 

2 

the
Term Loan has been indefeasibly paid in full, (ii) the date the Revolving Loans are terminated, or (iii) the date this Agreement terminates by its terms or is terminated by either
party in accordance with its terms. On the earlier to occur of the foregoing dates, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and
payable. Interest on the Term Loan shall be payable monthly as provided for in Section 1.2 of this Agreement. 

4. Fee. In consideration for Silicon entering into this Amendment, Borrower shall concurrently pay Silicon a fee in the
amount of 6,250, which shall be non-refundable and in addition to all interest and other fees payable to Silicon under the Loan Documents. Silicon is authorized to charge said fee to
Borrower's loan account. 

 5. Representations True. Borrower represents and warrants to Silicon that all representations and warranties set forth in the
Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, are true and correct. 

 6. General Provisions. This Amendment, the Loan Agreement, any prior written amendments to the Loan Agreement signed by
Silicon and Borrower, and the other written documents and agreements between Silicon and Borrower set forth in full all of the representations and agreements of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior discussions, representations, agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject hereof. Except as herein expressly amended, all of the
terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement, and all other documents and agreements between Silicon and Borrower shall continue in full force and effect and the same are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Exhibit 14.1 

 ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 

CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRESIDENT AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS 

 The Board of Directors of Allied Motion Technologies, Inc. has developed and adopted this Code of Ethics which requires its Chief Executive Officer (CEO),
President and all senior financial officers including the Company's general managers and controllers to make full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable public disclosures; to conduct themselves
honestly and ethically; to avoid material conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; and to comply with applicable governmental rules and regulations. In addition: 

 1. The
CEO, President and all senior financial officers are responsible for full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the periodic reports required to be
filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by the Company. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the CEO, President and each senior
financial officer promptly to bring to the attention of the Audit Committee any material information of which he or she may become aware that affects the disclosures made or required to be made by the
Company to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators and in other public communications made by the Company. 

 2. The
CEO, President and each senior financial officer shall promptly bring to the attention of the Audit Committee any information he or she may have concerning
