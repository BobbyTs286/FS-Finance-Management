Compliance with the Minimum Servicing Standards Set Forth in the

Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers

Report of Independent Accountants

Board of Directors
lndyMac Bank, F.S.B.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying report
titled Report of Management, that, except for noncompliance with the minimum
servicing standards for the annual analysis of escrow accounts and for payment
or accretion of interest on escrow accounts in accordance with applicable state
laws, IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. and subsidiaries (the "Bank") complied with the
minimum servicing standards set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America s Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers ("USAF")
during the year ended December 31, 2002. Management is responsible for the
Bank's compliance with those requirements. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assertion about the Bank's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards: established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank's compliance with those
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable) basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Bank's compliance with specified requirements.

In our opinion, management's assertion that, except for noncompliance with the
minimum servicing standards for escrow accounts that should be analyzed, in
accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents, on at least an annual basis and
for interest on escrow accounts that should be paid, or credited, to mortgagors
in accordance with applicable state laws, the Bank complied with the
aforementioned. requirements during the year ended December 31, 2002, is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

As discussed in management's assertion, the following instances of material
noncompliance occurred at the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2002:

Minimum servicing standards require escrow accounts be analyzed at least
annually. As of December 31, 2002, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum
servicing standard that requires escrow accounts be analyzed at least annually
However, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Bank identified
approximately 400 escrow accounts which had not been analyzed for more than a
year. Subsequent to the identification of this exception, the Bank performed a
review of all escrow accounts and completed required analysis.

Management's Assertion on Compliance

with the Minimum Servicing Standards Set Forth

in the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers

Report of Management

We, as members of management of IndyMac Bank, F.S.13. (the `Bank"), are
responsible for complying with the minimum servicing standards as set forth in
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers ("USAP"). We are also responsible for establishing
and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with these
standards. We have performed an evaluation of the Bank's compliance with the
minimum servicing standards set forth in the USAP as of December 31, 2002 and
for the year then ended. Base on this evaluation, we assert that during the
year ended December 31, 2002, the Bank complied, in all material respects,
with the minimum servicing standards set forth in the USAF, except as described
in the following two paragraphs.

Minimum servicing standards require escrow accounts be analyzed at least
annually. As of December 31, 2002, the Bank was in compliance with the
minimum servicing standard that requires escrow accounts be analyzed at
least annually. However, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Bank
identified approximately 400 escrow accounts which had not been analyzed for
more than a year_ Subsequent to the identification of this exception, the Bank
performed a review of all escrow accounts and completed the required analysis.

Minimum servicing standards require interest on escrow accounts be paid, or
credited, to mortgagors in accordance with applicable state laws. As of
December 31, 2002, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum servicing
standard that requires interest on escrow accounts be paid, or credited, to
mortgagors in accordance with applicable state laws. However, during the year
ended December 31, 2002, the Bank identified certain escrow accounts for which
the timing of interest payments by the Bank differed from the; respective state
requirements. Subsequent to the identification of this exception, the Bank
made modifications to the servicing system to ensure interest on escrow
accounts was paid, or credited, in accordance with applicable state laws.

As of December 31, 2002 and for the year then ended, the Bank had in effect a
fidelity bond in the amount of 35,000,000 and an errors and omissions policy
in the amount of 20,000,000.
