Department Stores Company of St. Louis, Missouri May ). The Company changed
its name to Payless ShoeSource, Inc. in 1991. On May 4, 1996, Payless became an
independent public company incorporated in Missouri as a result of its spin-off
from May. In June 1998, Payless was reorganized into a holding company
structure with the domestic retail operations centralized in Payless
ShoeSource, Inc., a Missouri corporation, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary

provide similar services for third parties in the future, however, no assurance
can be made as to the ability of Dyelights to attract third-party customers.
 
 Customers select the color they would like their shoes to be dyed from a color
book. Once a shoe is ordered from a store, the shoe is dyed to order. The dyed
shoes are generally available for pick up at the store approximately 10 days
after the order is placed. The retail price for Dyelights shoes including the

 PRODUCTS 
 
 The Company s Payless ShoeSource stores offer a broad assortment of
fashionable, quality footwear sold at affordable prices for men, women and
children, including athletic, casual, dress, sandals, work and fashion boots
and slippers. Footwear is constructed with leather, canvas and man-made
materials. Styling is updated regularly in an effort to remain current with
proven fashion trends. During 2002, shoes at Payless ShoeSource stores sold at
an average retail price of 11.95/pair. In addition to footwear, Payless
ShoeSource stores offer accessories, including handbags, shoe polish and
hosiery. Parade stores feature fashionable women s dress, casual and athletic
footwear priced in the 20 to 40/pair range. Bundles stores feature both
private label and branded hosiery, underwear, sleepwear and accessories at
prices generally ranging from 1.00 to 40.00. However, certain seasonal
Bundles/Tootsies merchandise may be more expensive.
 
 The Company s merchandising effort is led by the President and three general
merchandise managers, each with significant retail experience. They direct
teams of buyers, planners and distributors that interact with agents and
factory representatives to design, select, produce, inspect and distribute
footwear and accessories to Payless ShoeSource, Parade, Bundles/Tootsies and
Luster stores.
 
 CUSTOMERS 
 
 The Company sells footwear and accessories to women, men and children of all
age groups. The Company has significant market penetration with its target
customers: women between the ages of 18 and 44. The Company believes that more
than 45 percent of its target customers purchased at least one pair of shoes
from the Company last year. In 2002, the Company believes it sold more pairs of
shoes than any other U.S. footwear retailer.
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 The retail footwear market is characterized by four high volume seasons:
Easter, early Summer, back-to-school
and Winter holiday. The Company must increase inventory levels during these
periods to support the increased demand for seasonal styles. Unseasonable
weather patterns may affect planned sales of seasonal products such as sandals
and boots.
 
 PURCHASING 
 
 The Company, both on its own account and through its indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary, Payless ShoeSource Merchandising, Inc., utilizes a network of
agents and factories in the United States and 11 foreign countries to obtain
its products. These products are manufactured to meet the Company s
specifications and standards. The strength of the Company s relationships with
agents and factories, some dating back over 40 years, has allowed the Company
to revise its sourcing strategies to reflect changing political and economic

 environments. Many of the Company s agents and factory owners have played
significant roles in developing production in new factories and in new
countries without compromising production capacity or product quality. In order
to increase quality control and to achieve other efficiencies, Payless has
continued to consolidate its factory base. Payless now relies heavily on
several large factory groups. If any one of them were to be unable to supply
the Company s needs consistent with prior performance Payless could experience
disruptions in shoe deliveries. However, the Company believes that it could
find alternate factories to produce its product and believes that its
relationships with its factory base to be good. The People s Republic of China
is a direct source of approximately 85 percent of the Company s footwear based
on first cost. There can be no assurance that a change in political climate
with, or in, China would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. The
Company does not purchase seconds or overruns and does not own any
manufacturing facilities. The Company closely integrates its merchandise
purchasing requirements with various manufacturers through its sourcing
organization which has offices in Kansas, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Hong Kong,
Indonesia and Vietnam. Management believes it has good relationships with the
entities from which it sources, although there can be no assurance that such
relationships will remain good or that such entities believe that such
relationships are good.
 
 Approximately 55 percent of the Company s merchandise calculated on first
cost-basis is acquired through a network of third-party agents. Payless
ShoeSource International, Ltd., the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
in Hong Kong, arranges directly with factories for the design, selection,
production management, inspection and distribution of approximately 45 percent
of the shoes acquired for the Company.
 
 Risks inherent in foreign sourcing (i.e., manufacturing outside the United
States) include economic and political instability, transportation delays and
interruptions, restrictive actions by foreign governments, laws and policies of
the United States or other countries affecting importation of goods, including
duties, quotas and taxes, transportation interruption or cost increases, trade
and foreign tax laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and war. As the
Company expands internationally, the Company faces similar risks in each
country in which it has operations. Other than the work stoppage at West Coast
ports in 2002, the Company has not historically experienced material adverse
effects resulting from the occurrence of these types of risks. However, there
is no assurance that in the future the occurrence of these risks will not
result in increased costs, delays or disruption in product deliveries that
could cause loss of revenue, damage to customer relationships or have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
 
 Imports from China enjoy permanent normal trade relations PNTR treatment
under United States tariff laws. PNTR treatment provides the most favorable
level of United States import duty rates.
 
 QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
 The Company s quality assurance organization sets standards and specifications
for product manufacture, performance and appearance. It communicates those
standards and specifications through its proprietary quality assurance manual.
The Company stands behind the quality of the shoes it sells to its customers by
permitting return of purchased merchandise with proper documentation evidencing
purchase.

Table of Contents 
 The quality assurance organization also provides technical design support for
the Company s direct purchasing function. It is responsible for review and
approval of agent and factory technical design, for worldwide laboratory
testing of materials and components, and for performing in-factory product
inspections to ensure that materials and factory production techniques are
consistent with Company specifications. The Company locates its field
inspection personnel close to the factories and freight consolidation
facilities it uses throughout the world.
 
 PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT 
 
 The production management organization manages an ongoing process to qualify
and approve new factories, while continually assessing existing factory service
and quality of performance. New factories must meet specified quality standards
for shoe production and minimum capacity requirements. They must also agree to
the Company s production control processes and certify that neither they nor
their suppliers use forced or child labor. Factory performance is regularly
monitored. If a factory does not continue to meet or exceed the Company s
requirements, the factory risks being removed from the list of approved
factories. The production management organization utilizes a unique, internally
developed production control process by which the Company is electronically
linked to the factories and agents. This process is designed to ensure on-time
deliveries of merchandise with minimum lead time and without unnecessary costs.
 
 The Company believes that maintaining strong factory relationships, improving
key factory performance factors is critical to long-term sourcing stability.
The Company s manufacturing services group, based in Asia, provides direction
and leadership to key factories in the areas of overall productivity
improvement and lead time reduction.
 
 MERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTION 
 
 The Company believes that its distribution system provides it with a
competitive advantage. The Company s merchandise distribution teams are able to
track shoes by the pair from order placement through sale to the customer by
the use of perpetual inventory, product planning and retail price management
systems. These systems are maintained by experienced information systems
personnel and are enhanced regularly to improve the product distribution
process. Distribution analysts review sales and inventory by size and style to
maintain availability of product within the Company s stores.
 
 The Company, through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Payless ShoeSource
Distribution, Inc., operates a single 807,000 square foot distribution center,
including office space and a 12,000 square foot dyeing facility, in Topeka,
Kansas (the Distribution Center ). The Distribution Center is capable of
replenishing in-store product levels by style, color and size. During 2002, the
Distribution Center handled approximately 73 percent of the Company s
distribution needs and operated seven days a week, 20 to 24 hours per day.
Management believes this facility is one of the most highly-automated and
cost-efficient distribution facilities in the retail footwear industry. The
remaining 27 percent of the Company s distribution needs were handled by a
fully automated third-party facility in Los Angeles, California. The Company
utilizes third-party carriers to ship all product to and from its distribution
 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 centers. In addition, in February 2003, the Company began using a distribution
facility in Panama to service its Central and South American stores.
 
 The Company believes its Distribution Center has sufficient capacity to support
more than 5,500 stores. The Company regularly monitors the capacity of its
distribution system and the Distribution Center. In anticipation of future
needs, the Company is considering opening additional regional distribution
centers in international markets. Stores generally receive new merchandise at
least twice a week in an effort to maintain a constant flow of new and
replenished merchandise.
 
 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS 
 
 The retail footwear industry can be divided into high, moderate and
value-priced segments. The high-priced segment is comprised principally of
department stores. The moderate-priced segment, which includes specialty
shoe chains, mass merchandisers, and junior department stores, has no single
dominant competitor. The Company and national discount mass-merchandisers are
predominant in the value-priced segment.
 
 Payless ShoeSource considers itself part of the value-priced segment of the
footwear industry. Parade operates in the moderate-priced segment. Based on
industry data, the United States footwear market is estimated to be
approximately 40 billion/year, and has been flat to slightly declining over
the last twelve months. Industry data suggests that the quality offered in the
value-priced segment has improved significantly in recent years.
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The Company operates in a highly competitive retail market competing primarily
with national and regional discount mass-merchandisers, as well as with other
discount shoe stores and off-price outlet stores. Competition is based on
product selection, quality and availability, price, store location, customer
service and promotional activities. The Company believes that it has a
leadership position in the footwear market.
 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
 The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns certain copyrights,
trademarks, patents and domain names which it uses in its business and regards
as valuable assets. The trade/service marks include Payless , Payless
ShoeSource , Payless Kids , Parade , Parade of Shoes , Bundles sm , and
Luster sm . The domain names include Payless.com , as well as many derivatives of
Payless ShoeSource. The Company owns all rights to the yellow and orange logo
used in its Payless ShoeSource signs and advertising. As of February 1, 2003,
in the United States, the Company owns 171 pending applications and
registrations for its trade and service marks and owns several common-law marks
under which it markets private label merchandise in its Payless ShoeSource,
Parade, Bundles, and Luster stores. The Company also owns 1,472 pending

 MARKETING 
 
 The Company s marketing efforts are multi-dimensional, including nationally
broadcast television and magazine advertising, in support of major promotional
periods. In addition to media support, the Company utilizes in-store
promotional materials, including posters, signs and point of sale items. Also,
the Company communicates through the promotional funds, media funds, merchants 
associations and similar efforts that are part of the leasing agreements from
its various landlords. Finally, the Company uses publicity efforts to gain
low-cost awareness of Payless and its core business.
 
 In addition to its marketing staff, the Company uses professional firms to
assist in advertising, creative services, media purchase, publicity, business
and market planning and consumer research.
 
 ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Compliance with federal, state and local statutes, rules, ordinances, laws and
other provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS 
 
 In late 1997, the Company, through its indirect wholly-owned Canadian
subsidiary, Payless ShoeSource Canada Inc., opened its first store in Canada.
As of February 1, 2003, the Company operated 274 Canadian stores. In late
2000, the Company opened its first stores in Costa Rica and in 2001 opened
stores in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Trinidad Tobago.
In 2002, the Company opened stores in Nicaragua, Honduras, Chile, Ecuador,
Panama and Peru.
 
 In order to facilitate the Company s international expansion, the Company
opened an international office in Dallas in
2002. The international office provides support to the Company s international
operations. The Dallas international office allows the Company to focus better
on its international growth and provides shorter and easier travel times to the
Company s international markets.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Based on their evaluation as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or

Table of Contents 
 There were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the
date of their evaluation and up to the filing date of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and
therefore there were no corrective actions taken.
 
 It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In
addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other
inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote.

EXHIBIT 10.8

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

 THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the ____ of _____ 200_,
by and between PAYLESS SHOESOURCE, INC., a Delaware corporation, ("Payless") and
________ ("Executive").

 In consideration of mutual promises and agreements set forth in this
Employment Agreement, Payless and Executive agree as follows:

1. (a) Payless agrees to employ Executive, and Executive
 agrees to render personal services to Payless, for the period
 commencing on the date of this Employment Agreement through May 31,
 200__ (the "Contract Term") as Senior Vice President of Payless
 ShoeSource, Inc. and/or to perform such other executive duties as may
 from time to time be required of Executive by Payless. Upon the
 anniversary date of this Agreement, the Contract Term shall
 automatically be extended by one (1) year unless, within thirty (30)
 days of said anniversary date, or any anniversary date thereafter,
 Payless shall deliver to Executive, or Executive shall deliver to
 Payless, written notice that the Contract Term shall not be extended.

 (b) Payless agrees to pay Executive basic compensation
 for such services during the Contract Term at the annual rate of
 __________, payable in equal bi-weekly installments, and in accordance
 with Paragraph 5, which annual rate will be subject to an annual review
 during Payless' regularly scheduled review time.

 (c) If Executive is eligible to participate in one of Payless'
 bonus plans (the "Incentive Plan"), then Executive shall be entitled to
 such awards, if any, which may be payable under the Incentive Plan,
 determined in accordance with and subject to all of the terms and
 provisions of the Incentive Plan. If the Executive participates in the
 Payless ShoeSource, Inc. Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the
 "EICP") for the long-term performance periods ending in fiscal years
 2003 or 2004, the Executive hereby consents to the long-term award, if
 any, being calculated using the following formula: long-term
 performance period ending in 2003, (1/3 of the bonus under the EICP +
 2/3 bonus under the Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP")); and for
 the long-term performance period ending in 2004, 100 percent of the
 bonus will be determined under the ICP. Such awards are subject to the
 terms and provisions of the EICP and ICP respectively.

 (d) Payless shall reimburse Executive for all items of normal
 expense incurred by Executive as an employee of Payless in accordance
 with Payless' reimbursement policies in effect from time to time.

 (e) Payless has adopted certain employee benefit plans and has
 established certain arrangements concerning executive perquisites which
 may, from time to time, confer rights and benefits on the Executive in
 accordance with their terms, and Payless may, in the future, adopt

additional employee benefit plans and establish additional arrangements
 concerning executive perquisites, and may in the future amend, modify
 or terminate any of the aforesaid employee benefit plans and
 arrangements, all in accordance with their terms and in accordance with
 applicable law. Executive shall be entitled to whatever rights and
 benefits may be conferred on Executive, from time to time in accordance
 with the terms of such plans and arrangements, as they may be amended
 from time to time, independent of this Agreement.

 (f) Executive will be eligible for future grants of restricted
 stock and stock options as may be made under the terms of the Stock
 Incentive Plan in accordance with the levels established by the
 Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

 (g) All references to payment dates or vesting dates in this
 Paragraph 1 or in such plans and arrangements, shall require that
 Executive be employed by Payless on such date to receive such payment
 or be vested in such benefit.

2. (a) At all times during the Contract Term, Executive will:

 (i) faithfully and diligently perform Executive's duties
 in conformity with the directions of Payless and serve Payless
 to the best of Executive's ability; and

 (ii) devote Executive's undivided time and attention to
 the business of Payless, subject to reasonable vacations in
 accordance with Payless' vacation policy as it applies from
 time to time, to such extent as may be reasonably necessary
 for the proper performance of the personal services to be
 rendered by Executive under this Agreement; and

 (iii) maintain Executive's residence within reasonable
 access to the business activities of Payless for the Contract
 Term.

 (b) At all times during the Contract Term, Executive will not:

 (i) engage in any activity which conflicts or interferes
 with or adversely affects Executive's performance of
 Executive's duties hereunder, or

 (ii) accept any other employment, whether as an Executive
 or as a consultant or in any other capacity, and whether or
 not compensated therefor, or

 (iii) violate the terms of any of the policies described
 in Payless' Policy of Business Conduct distributed from time
 to time to Executive.

3. (a) At all times during the Contract Term and for a period of
 one (1) year from actual termination of employment or, if there is more
 than one (1) year remaining in the Contract Term at the time of
 termination of employment, for the remainder of the Contract Term,
 Executive will not:

 2

(i) directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, finance,

 (iii) take any action which is intended to harm Payless or
 its reputation, which Payless reasonably concludes could harm Payless
 or its reputation or which Payless reasonably concludes could lead to
 unwanted or unfavorable publicity to Payless.

 (ii) any franchising or wholesaling business with gross sales
 or revenue in the prior fiscal year of more than 25 million (or which
 is a subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture partner of a business with
 gross sales or revenue in the prior fiscal year of more than 25
 million) which sells footwear at wholesale to franchisees, retailers or
 other footwear distributors located within 20 miles of any Payless
 store or the store of any wholesale customer of Payless in the United
 States, or anywhere in any foreign country in which Payless has retail
 stores, franchisees or wholesale customers:

 (iii) any footwear manufacturing business with gross sales or
 revenue in the prior fiscal year of more than 25 million (or which is
 a subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture partner of a business with
 gross sales or revenue in the prior fiscal year of more than 25
 million) which sells footwear to retailers or other footwear
 distributors located within 20 miles of any Payless store or the store
 of any wholesale customer of Payless in the United States, or

 3

anywhere in any foreign country in which Payless has retail stores,
 franchisees, or wholesale customers; (e.g., including, without
 limitation, Jones Apparel Group, Inc., Dexter, Stride Rite Corporation,
 Wolverine Worldwide, Inc., The Timberland Company, Nike Inc., Reebok
 International Ltd., K-Swiss, Keds and Adidas-Salomon); or

 (iv) any business which provides buying office services to any
 store or group of stores or businesses referred to in Paragraph 3.(b)
 (i), 3. (b) (ii) or 3. (b) (iii).

 (c) Background of non-compete restriction:

 (i) Payless is one of the leading retail companies in North
 America, with self-service shoe stores throughout the United States and
 its territories, Canada and Central America; and

 (ii) In connection with its business, Payless has expended a
 great deal of time, money and effort to develop and maintain its
 confidential, proprietary and trade secret information; this
 information, if misused or disclosed, could be very harmful to Payless'
 business and its competitive position in the marketplace; and

 (iii) Executive desires to be employed by Payless, to be
 eligible for opportunities for advancement within Payless, to be
 eligible for potential compensation increases and to be given access to
 confidential and proprietary information of Payless necessary for
 Executive to perform Executive's job, but which Payless would not make
 available to Executive but for Executive's signing and agreeing to
 abide by the terms of this Agreement as a condition of Executive's
 employment by Payless; and

 (iv) Executive recognizes and acknowledges that Executive's
 position with Payless provides Executive with access to Payless'
 confidential and proprietary trade secret information and other
 confidential business information; and

 (v) Payless compensates its associates to, among other things,
 develop and preserve goodwill and relationships on Payless' behalf and
 to develop and preserve business information for Payless' exclusive
 ownership and use; and

 (vi) long-term customer and supplier relationships often can
 be difficult to develop and require a significant investment of time,
 effort and expense; and

 (vii) Executive recognizes and acknowledges that if
 Executive's employment with Payless were to cease, Payless needs
 certain protections in order to ensure that Executive does not
 appropriate and use any confidential information entrusted to Executive
 during the course of Executive's employment by Payless or take any
 other action which could result in a loss of Payless' goodwill that was
 generated on Payless' behalf and at its expense, and, more generally,
 to prevent Executive from having an unfair competitive advantage over
 Payless.

 4

(d) Reasonableness of non-compete restriction. Executive
 acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions in Paragraph 3(a) are
 reasonable and enforceable in view of the background for the
 non-compete restriction set forth in Paragraph 3(c) and in view of,
 among other things,

 (i) the markets in which Payless and its subsidiaries
 operate their business; and

 (ii) the confidential information to which Executive has
 access; and

 (iii) Executive's training and background, which are such
 that neither Payless nor Executive believe that the restraint
 will pose an undue hardship on Executive; and

 (iv) the fact that a Competing Business could benefit
 greatly if it were to obtain Payless' confidential
 information; and

 (v) the fact that Payless would not have adequate
 protection if Executive were permitted to work for any
 Competing Business since Payless would be unable to verify
 whether its confidential information was being disclosed or
 misused; and

 (vi) the limited duration of, the limited scope of, and
 the limited activities prohibited by, the restrictions in
 Paragraph 3(a); and

 (vii) Payless' legitimate interests in protecting its
 confidential information, goodwill and relationships.

 (e) If Executive violates Executive's obligations under
 Paragraph 3(a), then Payless shall be entitled to all legal and
 equitable rights and remedies under this Agreement, including all of
 its rights and remedies referred to in Paragraph 8 of this Agreement.
 Further, the time during which Executive violated the obligations shall
 not count toward satisfying the time during which any injunctive
 restriction shall apply. For example, if Executive were to join a
 competitor at the end of the Contract Term in violation of the
 restrictions in Paragraph 3(a) and work for such competitor for one (1)
 month before a court enjoined such violation, then the two (2) year
 time period of the restriction would begin when such injunction were
 issued; the one (1) month during which Executive violated such
 restriction would not count toward the time that the restriction
 applies.

4. If Executive becomes Disabled and remains continuously
 so Disabled for a period of 180 days, then Payless' obligations under
 this Employment Agreement, at Payless' option, may be terminated by
 notice in writing to that effect given during the continuance of such
 Disability, such termination to take effect the later of (a) the last
 day of the month during which such notice is given or (b) the last day
 of such 180 day period. If Executive has made a previous election to
 participate in the Payless ShoeSource, Inc. Long-Term Disability Plan
 (subject to the terms and provisions of that plan), then the terms of
 that plan shall apply. "Disability" or "Disabled" shall mean the
 inability of Executive to perform the essential duties of Executive's
 job under this Agreement.

 5

5. (a) If Executive's employment terminates during the Contract
 Term by reason of Executive's death or Disability, by Executive's
 voluntary termination of employment or by Payless for Cause,

 (i) Executive's basic compensation and employee
 benefits shall cease on the date of such termination, except
 as otherwise provided herein or in any applicable employee
 benefit plan or program; and

 (ii) Executive (or Executive's legal
 representative(s)) shall be entitled to such portion of any
 incentive compensation as shall be payable under the terms of
 the Incentive Plan.

 (b) In addition, if Executive's employment is terminated by
 reason of death, then Executive's obligations under Paragraphs 1 and 2
 shall cease on the effective date of such termination.

 (c) In addition, if Executive's employment is terminated by
 reason of Disability, by Executive voluntarily or by Payless for Cause,
 then Executive's obligations under Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall cease on
 the effective date of such termination and Executive's obligations
 under Paragraphs 3 and 6 remain in full force and effect, and Payless
 shall be entitled to all legal and equitable rights and remedies under
 this Agreement, including all of its rights and remedies referred to in
 Paragraph 8 of this Agreement.

 (d) If Executive's employment is terminated by Payless without
 Cause, then

 (i) Executive's employment (and status as an
 employee) shall cease immediately; and

 (ii) Executive shall be entitled, subject to the
 provisions of Paragraph 5(d)(v), to continue to receive for
 the remainder of the Contract Term the higher of Executive's
 basic compensation specifically stated in Paragraph 1(b) as of
 the date of this Agreement, or Executive's basic compensation
 at the time Executive employment terminates; and

 (iii) Executive shall be entitled to such portion of
 any incentive compensation as shall be payable under the terms
 of the Incentive Plan; and

 (iv) Except as expressly provided in this Paragraph
 5(d), Executive's post-termination obligations under this
 Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of
 Paragraphs 3 and 6, shall continue to apply following such
 termination; and

 (v) Executive shall use Executive's best efforts to
 find other employment which does not violate the provisions of
 Paragraph 3 hereof. If Executive accepts such other
 employment, Executive shall promptly notify Payless of such
 employment and of the compensation received, to be received or
 receivable from Executive's subsequent employer attributable
 to

 6

the remainder of the Contract Term, and all basic compensation
 otherwise payable under Paragraph 5(d) for the remainder of
 the Contract Term shall be reduced to the extent of
 Executive's similar compensation received, to be received or
 receivable from such other employer or other business.

 (e) "Cause" means

 (i) an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement, theft
 or any other material violation of law in connection with
 Executive's duties or in the course of Executive's employment
 with Payless; or

 (ii) intentional damage to assets of Payless; or

 (iii) intentional disclosure of confidential
 information of Payless contrary to the policy of Payless; or

 (iv) breach of Executive's obligations under this
 Agreement; or

 (v) intentional engagement in any competitive
 activity which would constitute a breach of Executive's duty
 of loyalty or of Executive's obligations under this Agreement;
 or

 (vi) intentional breach of any policy of Payless; or

 (vii) the willful and continued failure by Executive
 to substantially perform Executive's duties with Payless
 (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness); or

 (viii) the willful engaging by Executive in conduct
 which is demonstrably and materially injurious to Payless,
 monetarily or otherwise.

 For purposes of this Paragraph 5(e), an act, or a failure to
 act, shall not be deemed "willful" or "intentional" unless it is done,
 or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith or without reasonable
 belief that Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of
 Payless. Failure to meet performance standards or objectives, by
 itself, will not constitute "Cause".

 (f) Executive agrees that, in addition to any other remedies,
 Payless shall be permitted, as part of the computation of any final
 amount or amounts due to Executive as wages, compensation, bonus,
 deferred compensation or otherwise, and before any such amount shall be
 due and owing, to reduce any amount which Payless may otherwise owe to
 Executive by any unpaid amount which Executive owes to Payless.

6. (a) Executive will not, at any time, directly or indirectly,
 use or disclose any of Payless' Confidential Information except as
 authorized and within the scope of Executive's employment with Payless.

 7

(b) At Payless' request and/or termination of Executive's
 employment with Payless, Executive will return to Payless all
 documents, records, notebooks, computer diskettes and tapes and
 anything else containing Payless' Confidential Information, including
 all copies thereof, as well as any other Payless property, in
 Executive's possession, custody or control. Executive will also delete
 from Executive's own computer or other electronic storage medium any of
 Payless' proprietary or Confidential Information. Not later than 20
 days after Executive's employment is terminated, Executive will certify
 in writing to Payless that Executive has complied with these
 obligations.

 (c) During Executive's employment with Payless and thereafter,
 Executive will

 (i) notify and provide Payless immediately with the
 details of any unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any of
 Payless' Confidential Information,

 (ii) assist in preventing any reoccurrence of this
 possession, use or knowledge, and

 (iii) cooperate with Payless in any litigation or
 other action to protect or retrieve Payless' Confidential information.

 (d) "Confidential Information" means any non-public
 information pertaining to Payless' business. Confidential Information
 includes information disclosed by Payless to Executive, and information
 developed or learned by Executive during the course of or as a result
 of Executive's employment with Payless, which Executive also agrees is
 Payless' property. Executive further agrees that any item of
 intellectual or artistic property generated or prepared by Executive,
 for Executive or with others, in connection with Executive's employment
 by Payless is Payless' sole property and shall remain so unless Payless
 otherwise specifically agrees in writing. Confidential Information
 includes, without limitation, information and documents concerning
 Payless' processes; suppliers (including Payless' terms, conditions and
 other business arrangements with suppliers); supplier and customer
 lists; advertising, marketing plans and strategies; profit margins;
 seasonal plans, goals, objectives and projections, compilations,
 analyses and projections regarding Payless' divisions, businesses,
 product segments, product lines, suppliers, sales and expenses; files;
 trade secrets and patent applications (prior to their being public);
 salary, staffing and employment information (including information
 about performance of other executives); and "know-how," techniques or
 any technical information not of a published nature relating, for
 example, to how Payless conducts its business.

 (e) Executive agrees that Executive will not disclose to
 Payless or use, or induce Payless to use, any proprietary information,
 trade secret or confidential business information of any other person
 or entity, including any previous employer of Executive. Executive also
 represents that Executive has returned property, proprietary
 information, trade secret and confidential business information
 belonging to any prior employer.

 8

7. (a) If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that,
 but for the provisions of this Paragraph 7, any provision of this
 Agreement is illegal, void as against public policy or otherwise
 unenforceable because it is deemed to be overbroad, then such provision
 shall automatically be amended to the extent (but only to the extent)
 necessary to make it sufficiently narrow in scope, time and geographic
 area that it is not illegal, void as against public policy or
 overbroad. All other remaining terms and provisions shall remain in
 full force and effect.

 (b) If Executive raises any question regarding the
 enforceability of any aspect of this Agreement, including, without
 limitation, Paragraphs 3 or 6, Executive specifically agrees that
 Executive will abide fully by such provisions unless and until a court
 of competent jurisdiction has rendered a final judgment that such
 provisions are not fully enforceable. Following any such final
 judgment, Executive and Payless will abide fully by such judgment.

8. (a) Payless and Executive shall each be entitled to pursue all
 legal and equitable rights and remedies to secure performance of the
 obligations and duties of the other under this Agreement, and
 enforcement of one or more of such rights and remedies shall in no way
 preclude Payless or Executive from pursuing any and all other rights
 and remedies available to each of them.

 (b) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the individualized
 services and capabilities that Executive will render and provide to
 Payless during the Contract Term are of a personal, special, unique,
 unusual, extraordinary and intellectual character.

 (c) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions in
 this Agreement on Executive are reasonable in order to protect Payless'
 expectations and rights under this Agreement and to provide Payless
 with the protections that Payless needs to, among other things,
 safeguard its confidential information. Executive agrees that any
 breach of this Agreement by Executive will cause immediate irreparable
 injury to Payless, for which an award of damages alone may be
 inadequate. Therefore, Payless shall be entitled, in addition to any
 other right or remedy it may have, to an injunction without the posting
 of any bond or other security, enjoining or restraining Executive from
 any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement. In the event
 that Payless is successful in any suit or proceeding relating to the
 enforcement of this Agreement, Executive agrees to pay the reasonable
 attorneys fees and costs as calculated by the Court.

 (d) If Executive's employment is terminated by Executive
 voluntarily or by Payless for Cause, Executive shall be liable for all
 attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Payless in seeking to enforce its
 rights under this Agreement.

9. Payless Work Product. The Executive agrees to disclose fully
 to Payless, and hereby assigns and transfers to Payless, and agrees to
 execute any additional documentation Payless may reasonably request to
 evidence the assignment and transfer, immediately upon the conception,
 development, making or acquisition thereof, the right, title, and
 interest in and to any and all inventions, discoveries, improvements,
 innovations, and/or designs (the "Work Product") conceived, discovered,
 developed, acquired or secured by the Executive, solely or jointly with

 9

others or otherwise, together with all associated U.S. and foreign
 intellectual property rights (i.e., patents, copyrights, trademarks or
 trade secrets) either:

 (a) during the period of Executive's employment, if such Work
 Product is related directly or indirectly, to the business of, or to
 the research or development work of Payless;

 (b) with the use of the time, materials, or facilities of
 Payless; or

 (c) within one (1) year after termination of such employment
 if conceived as a result of and is attributable to work done during
 such employment and relates to Work Product within the scope of the
 business of Payless, together with rights to all intellectual property
 rights which may be granted thereon.

 Upon discovery, development or acquisition or any such Work
 Product, Executive shall notify Payless and shall execute and deliver
 to Payless, without further compensation, such documents prepared by
 Payless as may be reasonable or necessary to prepare or prosecute
 applications for such Work Product and to assign and transfer to
 Payless Executive's right, title and interest in and to such Work
 Product and intellectual property rights thereof. Executive
 acknowledges that Executive has carefully read and considered the
 provisions of this paragraph and, having done so, agrees that the
 restrictions set forth herein are fair and reasonable and are
 reasonably required for the protection of the interests of Payless, its
 officers, directors, and other executives.

10. The entire understanding and agreement between the parties has
 been incorporated into this Agreement, and this Agreement supersedes
 all other agreements and understandings between the Executive and
 Payless and its parents and subsidiaries, with respect to the
 employment of Executive by Payless and its parents and subsidiaries.
 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding
 upon, Payless, its successors and assigns and upon Executive and
 Executive's heirs, successors and assigns; provided, however, that,
 since this is an agreement for the rendering of personal services,
 Executive cannot assign any of Executive's obligations under this
 Agreement to anyone else. This Agreement may be executed in
 counterparts, in which case each of the two (2) counterparts shall be
 deemed to be an original and the final counterpart shall be deemed to
 have been executed in Topeka, Kansas.

11. Executive agrees that this Agreement may be assigned by
 Payless to a subsidiary of Payless; such assignment, however, shall not
 relieve Payless of any of its obligations hereunder except to the
 extent that such obligations are actually discharged by such
 subsidiary.

12. This Agreement has been executed by Payless at Payless'
 corporate headquarters and principal executive offices in Topeka,
 Kansas. Any questions or other matter arising under this Agreement,
 whether of validity, interpretation, performance or otherwise, shall be
 governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
 Kansas applicable to agreements made and to be performed in such state
 without regard to such state's conflicts of law provision. All actions
 and proceedings arising out of or relating directly or indirectly to
 this Agreement shall be

 10

filed and litigated exclusively in any state court or federal court
 located in the City of Topeka, Kansas or in Shawnee County, Kansas. The
 parties hereto expressly consent to the jurisdiction of any such court
 and to venue therein and consent to service of process if made upon
 Payless' registered agent or if made at Executive's last known address
 on the records of Payless.

 BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT EXECUTIVE
 (A) HAS RECEIVED A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR REVIEW AND STUDY BEFORE
 SIGNING IT; (B) HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING IT;
 (C) HAS HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE AGREEMENT WITH ANY
 ADVISOR WHICH EXECUTIVE MAY DESIRE TO CONSULT, INCLUDING LEGAL COUNSEL;
 (D) HAS HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY BEFORE SIGNING IT TO ASK ANY
 QUESTIONS EXECUTIVE HAS ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT AND HAS RECEIVED
 SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO ALL SUCH QUESTIONS; AND (E) UNDERSTANDS
 EXECUTIVE'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed by Executive, and
 then by Payless in Topeka, Kansas, effective as of the date first above
 written.

PAYLESS SHOESOURCE, INC.
 401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

 INTRODUCTION

 Effective April 1, 1996, Payless ShoeSource, Inc. withdrew from and
ceased to be a participating Employer in The May Department Stores Company
Profit Sharing Plan (the "May Plan"), and established the Payless ShoeSource,
Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan"). Effective January 1, 1997, a portion of
the Plan covering Associates of Payless ShoeSource of Puerto Rico, Inc. was spun
off. As of August 1, 1997, Payless amended and restated the Plan, primarily to
establish a company matching contribution based on Members' contributions
effective January 1, 1998, to institute automatic enrollment in before-tax
contributions by Members, and to comply with certain changes in the law. On June
1, 1998, Payless restructured its corporate organization into a holding company
structure with Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as the parent
corporation and the named Company for this Plan. Effective March 20, 2000, the
Company amended and restated the Plan, primarily to include provisions for loans
and the acceptance of rollover contributions from other qualified plans, a
change to daily valuation and other miscellaneous changes.

 Now, effective January 1, 2002, the Company is amending and restating
the Plan to effect the adoption of mandatory and certain permissive provisions
of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA"). The
EGTRRA amendments to the Plan are intended to be made in good faith compliance
with the requirements of EGTRRA and are to be construed in accordance with
EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. While the EGTRRA amendments are generally
effective January 1, 2002, some of the amendments are effective May 1, 2002, as
indicated below. In addition, effective May 1, 2002, the Plan is amended to
permit Full Time Associates to participate in the Plan upon the completion of 90
days of employment service with a participating Employer or other member of the
Group. Other amendments made herein are effective on the dates as specified.

 The terms and provisions of this new plan are as follows:

such eligibility is for less than a full Plan Year.

Service:

 Employer (either voluntarily or involuntarily) or retires, and
 then performs an Hour of Service within the twelve month
 period beginning on the Severance from Service Date, such

 and

 (ii) If an Associate terminates employment with the
 Employer (either voluntarily or involuntarily) or retires
 during an absence from service of twelve months or less for

SECTION 2

 MEMBERSHIP

 2.01 CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY.

 (a) Each Associate who on April 30, 2002 was a Member of or is
 eligible to be a Member of the Plan shall continue to be a Member of
 this Plan entitled to make Member Contributions pursuant to Section 4
 and eligible to share in Company Contributions pursuant to Section 3.

 (b) Each other Associate shall be eligible to become a Member of
 the Plan when the Associate has completed one Year of Service and
 attained age 21, with membership to commence as of the first day of the
 month coincident with or following the date he has met these
 eligibility requirements. Such Associate shall be eligible:

 (i) to make Member Contributions pursuant to Section 4;

 (ii) to share in Company Matching Contributions pursuant
 to Section 3.02;

 (iii) to share in Company Profit Sharing Contributions, if
 any, pursuant to Section 3.01.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Full Time Associate shall be
 eligible to make Member Contributions pursuant to Section 4 as of the
 first day of the month coincident with or following the date he has
 completed 90 days of employment with the Employer and attained age 21.
 For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a "Full Time Associate" is
 an Associate classified on the Employer's records as a Full Time
 Associate. In many locations, this means the Associate is normally
 scheduled to work 32 or more hours per week. However, the Associate's
 classification on the Employer's records, and not the actual number of
 hours worked in any period, determines Full Time status.

 (c) Each Member shall be deemed to have elected to make a three
 percent (3 Before-Tax Contribution pursuant to Section 4.01(b),
 commencing with the first paycheck issued with respect to the first
 payroll period beginning on or after the first day of the month
 coincident with or following the date the Employer determines he met
 the foregoing eligibility requirements. Notwithstanding this "deemed"
 election, an Associate or Member may elect pursuant to procedures
 established by the Committee to not make, or to suspend making, said
 three percent (3 automatic Before-Tax Contribution, or pursuant to
 Section 4.01(a) or (b) to make an After-Tax or a Before-Tax
 Contribution of an amount other than three percent (3 ).

 (d) Associates employed by the Company's Puerto Rican Subsidiaries
 are not eligible for membership hereunder. If any such
 Associate has Accounts in this Plan, such

 9

Accounts shall continue to be revalued as of each succeeding
 Valuation Date pursuant to Section 6.04.

 2.02 RE-EMPLOYMENT. A former Member who has retired or has
otherwise terminated employment and is rehired shall become a Member on the
first day of the calendar month after the Employer becomes aware of his rehire.

 10

SECTION 3

 COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS

 3.01 AMOUNT OF COMPANY PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTION. The Company or
an Employer may contribute to the Trust, as of the end of each Plan Year, a
percentage of the Company's Net Profits as a Company Profit Sharing
Contribution. The amount of such contribution, if any, shall be determined by
the Board of Directors in its discretion. Any such contribution shall be made as
soon as practicable after the close of the Company's Fiscal Year. All such
contributions advanced to the Plan by the Company shall be reimbursed to the
Company by the Employer.

 3.02 AMOUNT OF COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION. The Company shall, in
its discretion, contribute to the Trust, as of the end of each Plan Year, a
total combined amount as to this Plan and the Payless ShoeSource, Inc. Profit
Sharing Plan for Puerto Rico Associates ("Puerto Rico Plan") equal to 2 1/2 of
its Net Profits, until determined otherwise by the Board of Directors, in the
form of a Company Matching Contribution. Such contribution may be made by an
Employer, rather than by the Company, as to that Employer's participating
Associates. The total amount of such contribution shall be allocated in
proportion to the amount that each Member's Contributions under Sections 4.01(a)
and (b) for such Plan Year, up to a total of 5 of such Member's Pay, bears to
the total amount of all Member Contributions up to 5 of such Members' Pay. Such
Company Matching Contribution shall be determined and paid to the Trustee as
soon as practicable after the close of each Fiscal Year.

 3.03 ALLOCATION OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. The Company Contributions
shall be allocated only to the Company Accounts of Members who are employed by
the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year and on behalf of Members whose
employment has terminated during the Plan Year by reason of Retirement, death or
Disability. Company Profit Sharing Contributions shall be credited to eligible
Members' Company Profit Sharing Contribution Accounts. Company Profit Sharing
Contributions allocated prior to or as of July 31, 1997 shall be fully vested;
Company Profit Sharing Contributions allocated thereafter shall be subject to
the vesting provisions of Section 6.07. Company Matching Contributions shall be
subject to the vesting provisions of Section 6.07 and to the withdrawal penalty
provisions of Section 8.02(a). No Company Matching Contribution shall be made
with respect to a Member Before-Tax Contribution in excess of the Code Section
402(g) and 414(v) limit, as revised from time to time.

 3.04 PROFIT SHARING ALLOCATION FORMULA. The Company Profit Sharing
Contribution, if any, shall be allocated to all Members eligible to share in the
contribution according to the ratio that each Member's Allocation Pay Amount for
the Plan Year bears to the total Allocation Pay Amount for all eligible Members
for the Plan Year. For this purpose the term eligible Members includes Members
in both the Puerto Rico Plan and this Plan.

 3.05 INVESTMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION. The amounts allocated
to each Member pursuant to Section 3.03 shall be credited to his Company
Accounts and invested in one

 11

or more of the Investment Funds described in Section 5.01 and in the percentages
designated by the Member in the investment election filed pursuant to Section
5.02 effective at the time the amount is allocated.

 3.06 RETURN OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS.

 (a) If, after the Company Contribution has been made and
 allocated, it should appear that, through oversight or a mistake of
 fact or law, a Member (or an Associate who should have been considered
 a Member) who should have been entitled to share in such contribution,
 receives no allocation or receives an allocation which was less than he
 should have received, the Company may, at its election and in lieu of
 reallocating such contribution, make a special make-up contribution for
 the Company Account of such Member in an amount sufficient to provide
 for him the same addition to his Company Account as he should have
 received. Similarly, if a Member received an allocation which was more
 than he should have received (or an Associate was inappropriately
 included in the Plan), the Company, at its election, may reallocate
 such contribution, offset other Company contributions against such
 allocation, or use such allocation to pay Plan expenses.

 (b) Each contribution made to the Trust shall be made on the
 condition that it is currently deductible by the Company or Employer
 under Code Section 404 for the taxable year with respect to which the
 contribution is made. If a contribution subsequently is determined,
 whether in whole or in part, not to be currently deductible as provided
 in the preceding sentence, then, within one year of the date of
 disallowance of the deduction of such Company Contribution, an amount
 equal to the disallowed deduction shall be returned to the Company or
 Employer.

 (c) Earnings attributable to a contribution that is returned
 pursuant to Subsection (a) or (b) above shall not be withdrawn, but
 losses attributable thereto shall reduce the amount returned to the
 Company and/or Employer.

 12

 establish lower permissible After-Tax Contributions for Highly
 Compensated Employees); provided, however, that a Member shall not
 contribute, or elect to have contributed on his behalf, amounts with
 respect to Pay received by him after the close of the calendar year
 during which his employment terminates and further provided that any
 Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of the Member shall reduce, by
 the percentage which he elects to have contributed pursuant to Section
 4.01(b)(i), the percentage of Pay that the Member may contribute
 pursuant to this Section 4.01(a).

 (b) BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS.

 (i) Subject to the limitations set forth below, each
 Member may elect that his Employer shall contribute directly
 to the Trust Fund an amount equal to a whole percentage of his
 Pay, not less than 1 nor greater than such percentage as may
 be determined from time to time by the Company which amount
 shall be his Before-Tax Contribution. The maximum Before-Tax
 Contribution by a Member determined to be a Highly Compensated
 Employee under Section 4.02, for the Plan Year in question,
 may be further restricted or limited by the Company or
 Committee from time to time.

 (ii) Pursuant to Section 2.01(c), each eligible Member
 shall be deemed to have elected to make a three percent (3 Before-Tax Contribution, unless the Member elects otherwise in
 accordance with procedures established by the Committee.

 (c) Notwithstanding any election in accordance with Section
 4.01(b), if the Committee at any time determines that all or any
 portion of the Member's Before-Tax Contributions should be treated as
 After-Tax Contributions in order for the Before-Tax Contribution
 provisions of the Plan to qualify as a "qualified cash or deferred
 arrangement" for purposes of Code Section 401(k), or if the Actual
 Deferral Percentage standards set forth in Code Section 401(k)(3) are
 not met at the end of the Plan Year, then the Committee, in its sole
 and absolute discretion,

 (i) may, in accordance with Section 4.02 below, limit the
 amount which shall be contributed by the Employer as
 Before-Tax Contributions after the date of such determination
 on behalf of all or any portion of the Members and,

 13

(ii) may, except with respect to situations in which
 Section 4.01(h) applies, (and prior to March 15 of the
 calendar year following the Plan Year in which such
 contributions are made) declare all or such portion of the
 Before-Tax Contributions theretofore or thereafter made on
 behalf of all or a portion of the Members to be After-Tax
 Contributions. Effective January 1, 1997, if Before-Tax
 Contributions are made to another plan or plans, this Plan and
 such other plans must be aggregated for purposes of Section
 410(b) of the Code (other than the average benefit percentage
 test).

 (d) The Employer shall (i) deduct a Member's After-Tax
 Contributions from the Pay of the Member in such installments as the
 Employer may deem appropriate, (ii) contribute a Member's Before-Tax
 Contributions on behalf of the Member, and (iii) reduce the Pay that is
 paid to the Member directly in cash by an amount equal to the Member's
 Before-Tax Contributions in such installments as the Employer shall
 deem appropriate. The amounts so deducted and so contributed shall be
 paid by the Employer to the Trustee not later than 15 days following
 the end of the month with respect to which such amounts are to be so
 deducted and contributed or within such shorter period of time as may
 be designated under the Code, ERISA or related regulations. The
 Employer may, from time to time, make estimated contribution payments
 to the Trustee during each month.

 (e) Effective with the first payroll period beginning in any
 calendar month, or as of such other effective time as may be determined
 by the Committee, a Member may elect to change the rate of his
 After-Tax Contributions to any other rate permitted by Subsection (a)
 of this Section 4.01 and may elect to change the amount to be
 contributed by the Employer directly to the Trust Fund as Before-Tax
 Contributions to an amount equal to an amount permitted by Subsection
 (b) of this Section 4.01 with respect to such contributions to be made
 after the effective date of the election, pursuant to procedures
 established by the Committee.

 (f) Not later than 15 days prior to the beginning of a payroll
 period of a Member, or not later than such other date as may be
 determined by the Committee, such Member may elect, pursuant to
 procedures established by the Committee, (i) to suspend making
 After-Tax Contributions and (ii) that the Employer should suspend
 making Before-Tax Contributions on his behalf, all as of the beginning
 of such payroll period. Not later than 15 days prior to the beginning
 of a payroll period of a Member, or not later than such other date as
 may be determined by the Committee, such Member may elect (i) to resume
 making After-Tax Contributions and, (ii) that the Employer shall resume
 making Before-Tax Contributions on his behalf, by indicating any amount
 of contributions permitted under Subsection (a) and designating an
 amount equal to any amount of Pay as Before-Tax Contributions that is
 permitted under Subsection (b) hereof.

 (g) Contributions pursuant to this Section 4.01 shall be credited
 to Member Accounts.

 14

(h) Notwithstanding any election in accordance with Subsection
 (b), the total amount of a Member's Before-Tax Contributions and other
 contributions made by the Member under Code Section 401(k) to another
 plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) for any calendar year shall
 not exceed 11,000 (as adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of
 the Treasury or his delegate, pursuant to Code Section 415(d)). If any
 Member may reach the 11,000 limit (as adjusted) the Committee can
 direct that all or any portion of such Member's Contributions during
 such year shall be After-Tax Contributions regardless of such Member's
 elections pursuant to Sections 4.01(a) and 4.01(b). Effective May 1,
 2002, all employees who are eligible to make elective deferrals under
 this Plan and who have attained age 50 before the close of the Plan
 Year shall be eligible to make catch-up contributions in accordance
 with, and subject to the limitations of, section 414(v) of the Code.
 Such catch-up contributions shall not be taken into account for
 purposes of the provisions of the Plan implementing the required
 limitations of sections 402(g) and 415 of the Code. The Plan shall not
 be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of the Plan
 implementing the requirements of sections 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11),
 401(k)(12), 410(b), or 416 of the Code, as applicable, by reason of the
 making of such catch-up contributions.

 (i) The Committee shall provide each new Member a notice that
 explains the procedure for making Before-Tax Contributions under
 Sections 4.01(b) and 2.01(c), including the Member's right to elect to
 make no Before-Tax Contribution from his or her Pay and the manner in
 which the amount of such contributions may be changed. In addition, the
 Committee shall provide an annual notice to each Member indicating his
 or her Before-Tax Contributions as a percentage of Pay, describing the
 right to alter and the procedure for changing such percentage, and
 explaining the timing for implementation of any such change.

 4.02 LIMITATIONS ON AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS
FOR HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

 The Committee is authorized to reduce to the extent necessary
the maximum contributions under Section 4.01(b) for Highly Compensated Employees
prior to the close of the Plan Year if the Committee reasonably believes that
the reduction is necessary to prevent the Plan from failing Code Section
401(k)(3). Such adjustments shall be made in accordance with rules prescribed by
the Employer.

 If the Plan fails to satisfy Code Section 401(k)(3), the Plan

shall correct the failure within 12 months after the last day of such Plan Year
under any method of combination of methods allowed under Code Section 401(k)(8)
or Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(f), taking into account any
adjustments necessary due to changes to Code Section 401(k)(8)(C) that are
reflected in the regulations. For purposes of this Section 4.01, the actual
deferral percentage of Non-Highly Compensated Employees shall be determined as
of the Plan Year for which the Plan must satisfy one of the tests in Code
Section 401(k)(3), unless the Employer elects to determine such actual deferral
percentage as of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year for which

 15

the Plan must satisfy one of the tests in Code Section 401(k)(3). Any such
election shall not be changed except as provided by the Secretary of the
Treasury.

 Effective January 1, 1997, if for any Plan Year, the Plan
satisfies neither of the tests set forth in Code Section 401(k)(3), the Trustee
shall be directed by the Committee to return to each Highly Compensated Employee
his or her portion of the excess contributions (plus the income or less the loss
allocable to such excess contributions) for such Plan Year within 12 months
after the last day of such Plan Year. A Highly Compensated Employee shall
forfeit any Matching Contributions which were contributed on account of any
portion of the excess contributions even if such Matching Contributions are
vested. Each Highly Compensated Employee's portion of the excess contributions
for a Plan Year shall be determined under a two step process. First, the
aggregate amount of excess contributions shall be calculated. This shall be done
by reducing the actual deferral percentages of those Highly Compensated
Employees with the highest actual deferral percentages to the extent necessary
but not below the next highest level of actual deferral percentages. This
process shall be repeated, to the extent necessary, until the actual deferral
percentages for the group of Highly Compensated Employees satisfies one of the
tests set forth in Code Section 401(k)(3). The aggregate amount of excess
contributions shall be calculated by multiplying the actual deferral percentage
reduction for each Highly Compensated Employee by his or her compensation
(within the meaning of Code Section 414(s)) for the Plan Year and adding the
product of each such multiplication. Second, the aggregate amount of excess
contributions to be returned shall be allocated by reducing the Before-Tax
Contributions of those Highly Compensated Employees with the highest amount of
Before-Tax Contributions to the extent necessary but not below the next highest
amount of Before-Tax Contributions. This process shall be repeated, to the
extent necessary, until all excess contributions to be returned shall be
allocated among the Highly Compensated Employees. The income or loss allocable
to a Highly Compensated Employee's portion of the excess contribution will be
determined under such reasonable method as the Committee shall establish,
provided the method does not discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated
Employees, is used consistently for all Members and for all corrective
distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and is used by the Plan for
allocating income to Members' accounts.

 If the Trustee is required to distribute both elective
deferrals and excess contributions for a Plan Year, the Trustee shall (a)
calculate and distribute elective deferrals before determining the excess
contributions to be distributed to Highly Compensated Employees; (b) calculate
the actual deferral percentage including the amount of excess deferrals
distributed pursuant to (a) above; and (c) distribute excess contributions to
Members by reducing the excess contributions distributed to a Member by the
amount of excess elective deferrals distributed to such Member.

 The actual contribution percentage and the actual deferral
percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee who is eligible to participate in
two or more qualified plans which have cash or deferred arrangements or matching
contributions or after-tax contributions features (other than an employee stock
ownership plan) maintained by the Employer or a member of the Group shall be
calculated by treating all such cash or deferred arrangements in which the
Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to participate as one cash or deferred
arrangement for purposes

 16

of calculating the actual deferral percentage for such Highly Compensated
Employee, and all such features in which the Highly Compensated Employee is
eligible to participate as one feature for purposes of calculating the actual
contribution percentage for such Highly Compensated Employee with respect to
years ending within the same calendar year.

 4.03 DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXCESS DEFERRALS.

 If a Member's elective deferrals for any calendar year exceed
 10,500 (or such higher amount prescribed under Section 402(g) of the
 Code), then the Member may file an election form prescribed by the
 Committee with the Employer/Company designating in writing the amount
 of the Member's Excess Before-Tax Deferrals to be distributed from this
 Plan. Any such election form must be filed with the Committee no later
 than the first March 1 following the close of such calendar year in
 order for the Committee to act on it. If such an election form is
 timely filed, the Trustee shall distribute to the Member the amount of
 such Excess Before-Tax Deferrals which the Member has allocated to this
 Plan together with any income or less any loss allocable to such amount
 on or before the first April 15 following the close of such calendar
 year. In the case of a Highly Compensated Employee, any matching
 contributions which were contributed on account of the Excess
 Before-Tax Deferrals being distributed will be forfeited, even if such
 matching contributions are vested. For purposes of this Section 4.03,
 the income or loss allocable to such Excess Before-Tax Deferrals will
 be determined under such reasonable method as the Committee shall
 establish, provided the method does not discriminate in favor of Highly
 Compensated Employees, is used consistently for all Members and for all
 corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and is used
 by the Plan for allocating income to Members' accounts.

 4.04 LIMITATIONS ON AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF AFTER-TAX EMPLOYEE
CONTRIBUTIONS AND MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

 The Committee is authorized to reduce to the extent necessary the
maximum amount of Employee After-Tax Contributions and Employer Matching
Contributions under Sections 4.01(a) and 3.02 contributed on behalf of any
Highly Compensated Employee prior to the close of the Plan Year if the Committee
reasonably believes that such adjustment is necessary to prevent the Plan from
failing Code Section 401(m)(2). Such reduction shall be made in accordance with
rules prescribed by the Employer.

 If the Plan fails to satisfy Code Section 401(m)(2), the Plan shall
correct the failure within 12 months after the last day of such Plan Year under
any method or combination of methods allowed under Treasury Regulation
1.401(m)-1(e), taking into account any adjustments necessary due to changes to
Code Section 401(m)(6)(c) that are not reflected in the regulations. For
purposes of this Section 4.04, the actual contribution percentage of Non-Highly
Compensated Employees shall be determined as of the Plan Year for which the Plan
must satisfy one of the tests in Code Section 401(m)(2), unless the Employer
elects to determine such actual contribution

 17

percentage as of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year for which the Plan must
satisfy one of the tests in Code Section 401(m)(2). Any such election shall not
be changed except as provided by the Secretary of the Treasury.

 Effective January 1, 1997, if for any Plan Year, the Plan
fails to satisfy either of the tests set forth in Code Section 401(m)(2), the
Trustee shall be directed by the Committee to distribute to each Highly
Compensated Employee his or her vested portion (and forfeit the nonvested
portion) of the excess aggregate contributions (plus the income or less the
losses allocable to such excess aggregate contributions) for such Plan Year
within 12 months after the last day of such Plan Year. Each Highly Compensated
Employee's portion of the excess aggregate contributions for a Plan Year shall
be determined under a two step process. First, the aggregate amount of excess
aggregate contributions shall be calculated. This shall be done by reducing the
actual contribution percentages of those Highly Compensated Employees with the
highest actual contribution percentages to the extent necessary but not below
the next highest level of actual contribution percentages. This process shall be
repeated, to the extent necessary, until the actual contribution percentage for
the group of Highly Compensated Employees satisfies one of the tests set forth
in Code Section 401(m)(2). The aggregate amount of excess aggregate
contributions shall be calculated by multiplying the actual contribution
percentage reduction for each Highly Compensated Employee by his or her
compensation (within the meaning of Code Section 414(s)) for the Plan Year and
adding the product of each such multiplication. Second, the aggregate amount of
excess aggregate contributions to be distributed or forfeited shall be allocated
by first reducing any After-Tax Contributions and then any Matching
Contributions made by or on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees with the
highest total amount of After-Tax Contributions and Matching Contributions to
the extent necessary but not below the next highest total amount of After-Tax
Contributions and Matching Contributions. This process shall be repeated, to the
extent necessary, until all excess aggregate contributions to be distributed or
forfeited shall be allocated among the Highly Compensated Employees. A Highly
Compensated Employee whose After-Tax Contributions are determined to be excess
aggregate contributions shall forfeit any Matching Contributions which were
contributed on account of such After-Tax Contributions, even if such Matching
Contributions are vested. The income or loss allocable to a Highly Compensated
Employee's portion of the excess aggregate contributions will be determined
under such reasonable method as the Committee shall establish, provided the
method does not discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Employees, is used
consistently for all Members and for all corrective distributions under the Plan
for the Plan Year, and is used by the Plan for allocating income to Members'
accounts.

 4.05 LIMITATIONS ON MULTIPLE USE OF ALTERNATIVE LIMITATION.

 (a) Repeal of Multiple Use Test.

 The Multiple use test described in Treasury
 Regulation section 1.401(m)-2 shall not apply for
 Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001.

 18

(b) Special Definitions.

 All terms used in this Section 4 shall have
 the meaning given such terms in Code Sections 401(k)
 and 401(m) and the regulations thereunder.

 19

SECTION 5

 INVESTMENT PROVISIONS

 5.01 INVESTMENT FUNDS.

 (a) There shall be established as part of the Trust Fund a
 reasonable range of investment options. The Committee may from time to
 time, in its discretion, change, delete or add Investment Funds
 available within the Trust Fund; provided that unless and until the
 Plan is amended accordingly, the Plan shall continue to provide a
 Payless Common Stock Fund as an investment option.

 (b) Income from and proceeds of sales of investments in each
 Investment Fund shall be reinvested in the same Investment Fund. Any
 income or other taxes payable with respect to a Fund shall be charged
 to such Fund.

 (c) A Trustee may, from time to time, make temporary investments
 in short term obligations of the United States Government, commercial
 paper, or other investments of a short term nature, pending investment
 in an Investment Fund.

 5.02 INVESTMENT DIRECTION.

 (a) A Member may elect that his Member Contributions be invested
 in 1 increments totaling 100 in one or more of the Investment Funds.
 Such election must be made pursuant to procedures prescribed by the
 Committee. Such election shall be effective until and unless a Member
 makes a different election for any period, but only as provided for
 under Subsection 5.02(b) and Subsection 5.02(c). If the Member fails to
 file a timely initial investment election, he shall be deemed to have
 elected to have 100 of his Member Contributions invested in the
 stable, fixed income investment as may be determined by the Committee.
 Until such time as the Committee determines otherwise and so notifies
 Members, a Member's share of any Company Contributions, when allocated
 as of Plan Year-end, shall be invested in the same Investment Funds in
 the same proportions as the Member has elected in connection with
 investment of his Member Contributions at the time the Company
 Contribution is contributed to the Trust.

 (b) A Member may change his election with respect to future Member
 and Company Contributions effective pursuant to procedures prescribed
 by the Committee and may not change his election in any other manner
 except as provided in Subsection 5.02(c).

 (c) Effective as of the date determined by the Committee, and
 pursuant to procedures prescribed by the Committee, a Member may elect
 to have any or all of the value in any of the Investment Funds which
 are credited to his Member and/or Company Accounts transferred and
 invested in any one or more of the Investment Funds.

 20

(d) Notwithstanding this Section 5.02, effective March 20, 2000,
 during the black out period as determined by the Committee and the
 Trustee established to change to daily valuation or a change in
 recordkeepers, no investment transfers or changes may be made by a
 Member unless provided in Section 6.06. Notwithstanding anything to the
 contrary, no loans, withdrawals or distributions shall be made during
 any such blackout period except as provided by the Committee.

 21

SECTION 6

 ACCOUNTS

 6.01 MEMBER ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain or cause to be
maintained for each Member under each Investment Fund in which his Member
Contributions are invested separate Member Accounts which shall reflect the
portion of his interest in such Investment Fund which is attributable to his
contributions. The Member's After-Tax Contributions shall be credited to a
separate Member After-Tax Account. The Member's Before-Tax Contributions shall
be credited to a separate Member Before-Tax Account. The Member's or Associate's
Rollover Contribution shall be credited to a separate Member Rollover
Contribution Account.

 6.02 COMPANY ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain or cause to be
maintained for each Member under each Investment Fund in which his Company
Contributions are invested separate Company Accounts which shall reflect the
portion of his interest in such Investment Fund which is attributable to Company
Contributions, as well as to contributions made by an Employer under prior plans
and to any income or earnings attributable to such Company Contributions and
prior plan contributions. The Member's Company Matching Contributions shall be
credited to a separate Company Matching Contribution Account. The Member's
Company Profit Sharing Contribution, if any, shall be credited to a separate
Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account.

 6.03 MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS. For the purposes of maintaining
Accounts pursuant to this Section 6, each Investment Fund shall be divided into
Units, and the Interest of each Member in such Investment Fund shall be
evidenced by the number of Units in such Investment Fund credited to his
Accounts.

 6.04 VALUATION OF ACCOUNTS. As of each Valuation Date the Committee
shall determine the value of a Unit in each Account by dividing the current
market value of all property in each such Account as of such Valuation Date
(after deducting any expenses or other amounts including withdrawals properly
chargeable against such Account) by the number of Units then outstanding to the
credit of all Members in each such Account.

 6.05 MEMBER STATEMENTS. The Committee shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each Member a statement of his Company and Member Accounts, at
least once each year, or more frequently if required by applicable law.

 6.06 SHARES OF PAYLESS SHOESOURCE, INC. ("PAYLESS STOCK") IN THE
PAYLESS COMMON STOCK FUND.

 (a) Each Member (or beneficiary of a deceased Member) who has
 Accounts invested in the Payless Common Stock Fund shall, as a named
 fiduciary within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of ERISA, have the
 right to direct the Trustee with respect to the vote of the number of
 shares of Payless Stock attributable to Units credited to him in the
 Payless

 22

Common Stock Fund as of the latest practicable Valuation Date prior to
 or contemporaneous with the record date set by the Company for each
 meeting of shareowners of the Company. For such purpose the Trustee
 shall furnish to each such Member prior to each such meeting the proxy
 statement for such meeting, together with a form to be returned to the
 Trustee on which may be set forth the Member's instructions as to the
 manner of voting such shares of stock. Upon receipt of such
 instructions, the Trustee shall vote such shares in accordance
 therewith. If a Member's instructions are not received by the Trustee
 in a timely manner, the Trustee shall vote such Member's shares in the
 same proportion as the shares of Common Stock for which instructions
 were actually timely received from Members. The Trustee shall not
 divulge the instructions of any Member.

 (b) Each Member (or beneficiary of a deceased Member) who has
 Accounts invested in the Payless Common Stock Fund shall, as a named
 fiduciary within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of ERISA, have the
 right with respect to the number of shares of Payless Stock
 attributable to Units credited to him in the Payless Common Stock Fund
 as of the latest practicable Valuation Date, to direct the Trustee in
 writing as to the manner in which to respond to a tender or exchange
 offer with respect to Payless Stock, and the Trustee shall respond in
 accordance with the instructions so received. The Trustee shall utilize
 its best efforts to timely distribute or cause to be distributed to
 each Member such information as will be distributed to shareowners of
 the Company in connection with any such tender or exchange offer,
 together with a form requesting instructions on whether or not such
 shares will be tendered or exchanged. If the Trustee shall not receive
 timely direction from a Member as to the manner in which to respond to
 such a tender or exchange offer, the Trustee shall not tender or
 exchange any shares of Payless Stock with respect to which such Member
 has the right of direction. Tenders as a result of a self-tender offer
 by the Company shall continue notwithstanding any investment change
 blackout. The Trustee shall not divulge the instructions of any member.
 The proceeds from the tender or exchange of shares attributable to
 Units in Payless Common Stock Investment Fund accounts of Members shall
 be transferred to one of the Investment Funds described in Section 5.01
 pursuant to a procedure established by the Committee.

 6.07 VESTING IN MEMBER AND COMPANY ACCOUNTS.

 (a) VESTING SCHEDULE. A Member shall have a fully vested interest
 at all times (i) in his Member Accounts and (ii) in his Company Profit
 Sharing Contribution Account balance determined as of July 31, 1997. A
 Member who has completed at least two full Years of Service as of
 August 1, 1997 also shall be fully vested at all times (i) in his
 Company Matching Contribution Account and (ii) in his Company Profit
 Sharing Contribution Account determined at any time after July 31,
 1997. The Company Matching Contribution Account of a Member who is not
 or was not credited with at least two Years of Service as of August 1,
 1997 and his Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account attributable
 to Company Profit Sharing Contributions, if any, based on such Member's

 23

eligibility for such contributions after August 1, 1997, shall vest
 according to the following schedule:

Vesting Service Vested Interest
 --------------- ---------------
 
Fewer than 2 years 0 

 2 years 25 

 3 years 50 

 4 years 75 

 5 years or more 100 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Member's interest in his
 Company Matching Contribution Account and his Company Profit Sharing
 Contribution Account shall become fully vested if the Member terminates
 employment on account of Retirement, death or Disability.

 (b) CASH-OUT DISTRIBUTIONS TO PARTIALLY VESTED MEMBERS AND
 RESTORATION OF FORFEITURES. If, pursuant to Section 10.01, a
 partially-vested Member receives a cash-out distribution before he
 incurs a Forfeiture Break in Service (as defined in Subsection (e)
 below), the cash-out distribution will result in an immediate
 forfeiture of the nonvested portion(s) of the Member's Company Matching
 and Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account(s). See Subsection (e)
 below. A partially-vested Member is a Member whose Vested Interest,
 determined under Section 6.07(a), in either his Company Matching
 Contribution Account or his Company Profit Sharing Contribution
 Account, or both, is less than 100 . A cash-out distribution is a
 distribution of the entire vested portion of the Member's Account(s).

 (i) A partially-vested Member who is reemployed by an
 Employer after receiving a cash-out distribution of the vested
 portion of his Account(s) shall have such forfeited amount
 restored, unless the Member no longer has a right to
 restoration under this subparagraph (i). The amount restored
 by the Plan Administrator shall be the same dollar amount as
 the dollar amount of his Account(s) on the Valuation Date
 immediately preceding the date of the cash-out distribution,
 unadjusted for any gains or losses occurring subsequent to
 that Valuation Date but reduced by the amount of the prior
 cash-out distribution. Restoration of the Member's Account
 balance(s) includes restoration of all Code Section 411(d)(6)
 protected benefits with respect to the restored Account(s) in
 accordance with applicable Treasury regulations. The Plan
 Administrator will not restore a reemployed Member's Account
 balance(s) under this subparagraph (i) if the Member has
 incurred a Forfeiture Break in Service (as defined in
 Subsection (d) below).

 24

(ii) If restoration of the Member's Account(s) is
 permitted under subparagraph (i) above, the Plan Administrator
 will restore the Member's Account(s) on the same day as the
 date of allocation of the Company Contribution for the Plan
 Year during which such Member was reemployed by an Employer.
 To restore the Member's Account(s), the Plan Administrator, to
 the extent necessary, will allocate to the Member's
 Account(s):

 (A) first, the amount, if any, of Member
 forfeitures otherwise available for allocation under
 Subsection (f) below;

 (B) second, deductible Employer contributions
 for the Plan Year to the extent made under a
 discretionary formula; and

 (C) third, as otherwise permitted by law.

The Plan Administrator will not take into account any allocation under this
Subsection (b) in applying the limitation on allocations under Section 13.

 (iii) The deemed cash-out rule applies to a 0 vested
 Member. A 0 vested Member is a Member whose Account(s)
 derived from Employer contributions is (are) entirely
 forfeitable at the time of his termination of employment.
 Under the deemed cash-out rule, the Plan Administrator will
 treat the 0 vested Member as having received a cash-out
 distribution on the date of the Member's termination of
 employment or, if the Member's Account(s) is (are) entitled to
 an allocation of Employer contributions for the Plan Year in
 which he terminates employment, on the last day of that Plan
 Year.

 (c) DETERMINATION OF VESTING SERVICE. For purposes of determining
 a Member's Vested Interest in his Company Contributions Account(s)
 under Subsection (a) above, a Member shall be credited with that number
 of years of Vesting Service determined by adding together all of the
 Associate's Periods of Service, whether or not consecutive.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vesting Service shall not include any
 Period of Service before the Plan Year in which an Associate attains
 age eighteen (18). Only whole years of service shall be taken into
 account for purposes of applying the schedule set forth in Subsection
 (a) above, and, for purposes of determining a Member's number of whole
 years of service, non-successive Periods of Service must be aggregated,
 with 365 days of service being deemed to constitute one year. For
 purposes of determining a Member's Period of Service, the Service
 Spanning rules described in Section 1.51(g) shall apply.

 (d) FORFEITURE BREAK IN SERVICE. For purposes of this Section
 6.07, a "Break in Service" is a Period of Severance of at least 365
 consecutive days. A "Forfeiture Break in Service" occurs when a Member
 or former Member incurs 5 consecutive Breaks in Service.

 25

(e) FORFEITURE OCCURS. A Member's forfeiture, if any, of his
 Account balance(s) derived from Company contributions occurs under the
 Plan on the earlier of:

 (i) the last day of the last pay period ending within the
 Plan Year in which the Member first incurs a Forfeiture Break
 in Service; or

 (ii) the date the Member receives a cash-out distribution.

 The Plan Administrator shall determine the percentage of a
 Member's Account(s) forfeiture, if any, under this Subsection (e)
 solely by reference to the vesting schedule of Section 6.07(a). As of
 the last day of each Plan Year, the total amount of forfeitures which
 occurred during such Plan Year shall be calculated and such amount
 shall be applied (i) to restore under (b) above any amounts previously
 forfeited from rehired Members' Accounts, (ii) to pay Administrative
 Expenses under Section 7.01 and (iii) the balance, if any, shall be
 added to and allocated with the Company Matching Contribution for that
 Plan Year.

 (f) FORMER MAY PLAN MEMBERS. The provisions of this Subsection (f)
 apply to a Member who previously was employed by the Employer, when it
 was part of the Group which included The May Department Stores Company,
 and who at the termination of his employment had Company Accounts in
 the May Plan which were forfeited as a result of termination of
 employment. If such Member has not incurred five consecutive Breaks in
 Service as defined in Section 6.07(b), the value of the Member's
 Company Account forfeited under the May Plan will be restored under
 this Plan (in the manner described in Subsection (b) above) and will be
 100 vested.

 26

SECTION 7

 EXPENSES

 7.01 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the costs and expenses for administering this Plan, consisting of Trustee
fees and expenses, Investment Manager fees and expenses, fees and expenses of
outside experts, expenses of maintaining records under Section 6 of the Plan,
and all other administrative expenses of the Plan, shall be paid out of the
Trust Fund unless the Company elects to pay them with its own funds. Costs
incident to the purchase and sale of securities, such as brokerage fees,
commissions and stock transfer fees, are not regarded as administrative expenses
and shall be borne by the appropriate Investment Fund as determined by the
Trustee or Committee.

 27

SECTION 8

 WITHDRAWALS DURING EMPLOYMENT

 8.01 WITHDRAWALS PROHIBITED UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED. No
withdrawal from the Plan shall be permitted prior to a Member's termination of
employment, except as provided in Section 8.02.

 8.02 AUTHORIZED WITHDRAWALS.

 (a) Prior to his termination of employment, a Member may elect to
withdraw, in cash, any or all of the value in his Member After-Tax Accounts.
However, in the event a Member elects to withdraw all or a portion of his
After-Tax Contributions made after August 1, 1997, such Member shall forfeit his
right to fifty percent (50 of the Company Matching Contribution, if any,
otherwise allocable in connection with his Member Contributions for the Plan
Year in which the withdrawal occurs.

 (b) Prior to his termination of employment, a Member may elect to
withdraw, in the event of a "hardship", an amount in cash up to (i) the total
amount of the Before-Tax Contributions made to the Trust on his behalf, or (ii)
the value in his Member Before-Tax Account, whichever is less. In any event the
amount withdrawn may not be greater than the amount determined by the Committee
as being required to meet the immediate financial need created by the "hardship"
and not reasonably available from other resources of the Member, whichever
amount is less. The term "hardship" means a heavy financial hardship in light of
immediate and heavy financial needs as determined by the Committee in accordance
with Internal Revenue Service regulations. The amount of an immediate and heavy
financial need may include any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or
local taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution.
The determination shall be made in a nondiscriminatory manner. Hardship shall
include but not be limited to the following:

 (i) Medical expenses described in Code Section 213(d)
 previously incurred by the Member, the Member's spouse, or any
 of the Member's dependents (as defined in Code Section 125) or
 necessary for these persons to obtain medical care described
 in Section 213(d);

 (ii) Purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal
 residence for the Member;

 (iii) Payment of tuition, related educational fees, and
 room and board expenses for the next 12 months of
 post-secondary education for the Member, his or her spouse,
 children, or dependents (as defined in Code Section 152);

 (iv) The need to prevent the eviction of the Member from
 his or her principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage
 of the Member's principal residence.

 28

The Committee may adopt written guidelines which identify
additional circumstances constituting hardship and which provide procedures to
be followed in the administration of hardship withdrawal requests, which
guidelines are hereby incorporated herein.

 In addition, such hardship must be one which in the judgment
of the Committee, based on the Member's representations, cannot be relieved (1)
through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (2) by
reasonable liquidation of the Member's assets to the extent such liquidation
would not itself cause an immediate and heavy financial need, (3) by cessation
of Member Contributions under the Plan, (4) by other distributions or loans from
employee benefit plans, including this Plan, maintained by the Company or any
other employer or (5) by borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable
commercial terms. The Member shall be required to submit documentation, to be
determined by the Committee, with his hardship withdrawal request to enable the
Committee to make a judgment regarding the validity of such hardship withdrawal
request. For any Member who has attained age 59 1/2, the "hardship" requirement
shall be deemed waived.

 (c) A Member who was a Participant in or eligible to be a
Participant in the Volume Shoe Corporation Profit Sharing Plan (the "Volume
Plan") as of December 31, 1988 and who had an account balance in the Volume Plan
attributable to Employer Contributions made to the Volume Plan before July 31,
1976 and which account became a Company Account under The May Department Stores
Company Profit Sharing Plan and which has been transferred to this Plan, shall
be entitled to withdraw the market value of such account balance determined (and
frozen) as of December 31, 1988.

 (d) Associates with Member Rollover Contribution Accounts may
elect to withdraw their Member Rollover Contribution Accounts prior to
termination of employment.

 (e) A withdrawal election shall be made pursuant to application
procedures established by the Committee. Contribution totals and Account values
shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or next following
the filing of the withdrawal election. If the Member Accounts from which
withdrawal is made are in more than one Investment Fund, the withdrawal shall be
pro rata from each such Investment Fund except in the case the Member is subject
to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or has been designated as a
"Designated Insider," in which case such Member's withdrawal will be taken first
from such Member's Investment Funds other than the Payless Common Stock Fund.

 29

SECTION 9

 BENEFITS UPON RETIREMENT, DEATH, DISABILITY OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

 9.01 BENEFITS. Upon a Member's Retirement, death, Disability, or
other termination of employment, the value of his Member Accounts and of his
vested Company Accounts shall be determined as of the Valuation Date prior to
the date the distribution is calculated. A temporary Authorized Leave of Absence
for Military Service or for other purposes approved by the Employer shall not,
while any such Authorized Leave of Absence is validly in effect, be regarded as
a termination of employment.

 9.02 BENEFICIARY. Any benefits payable on account of a Member's
death shall be paid to such Member's spouse. If such Member has no spouse or if
such Member's spouse shall have consented to the naming of another beneficiary,
such benefits shall be paid to the person or persons (including, without
limitation, estates, trust, or other entities) last named as beneficiary by such
Member on an appropriate form filed with the Committee. A spouse's consent shall
acknowledge the effect of the consent and be in writing, witnessed by a Plan
representative or notary public. A spouse's consent shall be irrevocable. If no
beneficiary has been so named or the named beneficiary does not survive the
Member, any payment to be made under this Plan on account of a Member's death
shall be paid to such Member's spouse, or, if he has no spouse, to such Member's
estate. Whenever permitted by the Code or regulations thereunder, the Committee
may waive the requirements that a spouse's consent be obtained. Such waiver may
be on a case by case basis or by categories.

 30

SECTION 10

 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

 10.01 TIME OF PAYMENT.

 (a) All amounts distributable to a Member or Beneficiary pursuant
 to Section 9 shall, unless the Member makes an approved election
 pursuant to Section 10.01(b) or 10.01(c), be paid in a lump sum payment
 to be made as soon as practicable after the Valuation Date as of which
 the Account values are determined pursuant to Section 9.01; provided,
 however, that any additional amounts which may be allocated to a
 Member's Company Accounts resulting from a Company Contribution in
 respect of the calendar year in which employment terminates shall be
 paid as soon as practicable after such contribution.

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10 to the
 contrary, if the present value of the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of
 a Member, including Company and Member Contributions (but excluding
 accumulated deductible employee contribution, if any) exceeds (or for
 distributions made prior to March 22, 1999, ever has exceeded) 5,000,
 no partial or total distribution shall be made unless the Member has
 consented thereto in writing in the manner required by law.

 (b) A Member who was a Member of the May Plan as of June 30, 1990
 may elect that all Transferred Accounts distributable to him pursuant
 to Section 9 shall be paid in annual installments over a period not to
 exceed ten years beginning with the Valuation Date as of which the lump
 sum payment would otherwise be made. In the event of the death of a
 Member prior to the expiration of such period, all amounts which have
 not been distributed to him shall be paid in a lump sum to his
 designated Beneficiary or his estate if there is no designated
 Beneficiary. Subject to the foregoing, each such installment shall be
 paid as of a Valuation Date and, until all the Accounts of the Member
 have been fully distributed, they shall continue to be revalued as of
 each succeeding Valuation Date pursuant to Section 6.04.

 Notwithstanding the paragraph above, a Member who as of
 December 31, 1988 was or was entitled to be a Participant in the Volume
 Shoe Corporation Profit Sharing Plan may elect that all Transferred
 Accounts distributable to him pursuant to Section 9 be paid in the form
 of equal monthly installments over a period not to exceed 120 months.
 Such payments shall otherwise be made in accordance with the foregoing
 portion of this Subsection 10.01(b).

 (c) A Member who is entitled to receive a distribution in excess
 of 5,000 may elect to defer such distribution to the required minimum
 distribution age, as determined by law from time to time. An election
 to defer distribution shall conform to such requirements as to form,
 content, manner, and timing as shall be determined by the Committee and
 which requirements shall be applied in a manner which does not
 discriminate in favor of

 31

Members who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of
 Code Section 414(q)). All Accounts of a Member who elects to defer his
 distribution shall continue to be revalued as of each succeeding
 Valuation Date pursuant to Section 6.04. A deferred distribution shall
 be paid when such Member attains the required minimum distribution age
 or at such earlier or later time as shall be determined by the
 Committee as permitted by law. In the event of the death of a Member
 prior to distribution of the deferred amounts, all amounts shall be
 distributed in a lump sum to his designated Beneficiary or to his
 estate if there is no designated Beneficiary. The value for payment
 shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coincident with or next
 following such Member's birthday coincident with the Member's required
 minimum distribution age or such other payment date determined by the
 Committee.

 10.02 FORM OF PAYMENT. All distributions shall be made in the form
of cash, except that distributions from the Payless Common Stock Fund shall be
made in the form of full shares of Payless Common Stock, as applicable (with
payment in cash for a fraction of a share) or in cash if elected by the Member
or Beneficiary. The rights extended to a Member hereunder shall also apply to
any Beneficiary or alternate payee of such Member.

 10.03 INDIRECT PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. If any Member or Beneficiary has
been adjudged to be legally, physically or mentally incapable or incompetent,
payment may be made to the legal guardian or other legal representative of such
Member or Beneficiary as determined by the Committee. Such payments shall
constitute a full discharge with respect thereto.

 10.04 INABILITY TO FIND MEMBER. If a Member or Beneficiary or other
person to whom a benefit payment is due cannot be found during the three years
subsequent to the date a distribution was required to be made under this Plan,
the Accounts shall be forfeited at the end of such three-year period. The value
of such Accounts as of the date the distribution was required to be made shall
be restored if such Member or Beneficiary or other person makes a claim.

 10.05 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS. In accordance
with Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
distributions to a Member must commence not later than the first day of April
following the calendar year in which the Member attains age 70 1/2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, distribution to a Member who is not a "five
percent owner" as defined in Section 20.10(f)(3) shall commence not later than
April 1 following the calendar year in which the Member attains age 70 1/2 or,
if later, the calendar year in which the Member retires.

 10.06 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARY.
Distributions to the Beneficiary entitled under Section 9.02 to receive any
payments payable under this Plan on account of a Member's death shall be made in
a lump sum payment not later than December 31 of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the Member died.

 10.07 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO ALTERNATE PAYEE.
Distributions to an alternate payee entitled under Section 16.01 to receive any
payments payable under this Plan

 32

pursuant to the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order shall be made in
accordance with the terms of such Qualified Domestic Relations Order and this
Plan on or after the date on which the Member has attained his "earliest
retirement age" (as defined under Code Section 414(p)) under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, distribution to an alternate payee may be made
prior to the Member's attainment of his earliest retirement age if, but only if:
(1) the Qualified Domestic Relations Order specifies distribution at that time
or permits an agreement between the Plan and the alternate payee to authorize an
earlier distribution; (2) the distribution is a single sum distribution of the
alternate payee's entire benefit entitlement under the Plan; and (3) in the
event the present value of the alternate payee's benefits under the Plan exceeds
 5,000, the alternate payee consents to any distribution occurring prior to the
Member's attainment of earliest retirement age.

 Nothing in this Section 10.07 shall be construed to permit a Member to
(1) receive a distribution at a time not otherwise permitted under the Plan, (2)
permit the alternate payee to receive a form of payment not otherwise permitted
under the Plan, or (3) cause his Plan accounts to be valued or otherwise
determined in a manner not otherwise permitted under the Plan.

 33

SECTION 11

 PERMITTED ROLLOVER OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS

 11.01 ROLLOVER TO OTHER PLANS. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under
this Section, a distributee may elect, at the time and pursuant to procedures
prescribed by the Committee, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee in a direct rollover. Such distribution may commence no less than
thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) after any notice required under
Treas. Reg. Section 1.411(a)-11(c) (or its successor) and explanation of his
right to rollover his distribution and tax explanation in accordance with
Internal Revenue Rules are given to a Member or other distributee, provided that
the Member has been clearly informed that he has a right to a period of at least
thirty (30) days after receiving said notice to consider the decision as to
whether to elect a distribution or, if applicable, a distribution option, and
the Member nevertheless affirmatively elects distribution preceding the
expiration of thirty (30) days. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to
be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
after-tax Member contributions which are not includible in gross income.
However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement
account or annuity described in Sections 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or a
qualified defined contribution plan described in Sections 401(a) or 403(a) of
the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including
separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible
in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

 11.02 ROLLOVER FROM OTHER PLANS. An Associate eligible to
participate in the Plan, regardless of whether he has satisfied the
participation requirements of Section 2.01, may transfer to the Plan an Eligible
Rollover Distribution provided that such distribution is from an Eligible
Retirement Plan other than an individual retirement account described in Code
Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section
408(b); and, provided further, that this Plan shall not accept the portion of
any eligible rollover distribution that is not includible in gross income. If
such transfer is not a direct transfer, such a transfer may be made only if the
following conditions are met:

 (a) the transfer occurs on or before the 60th day
 following the Associate's receipt of the distribution from the
 Eligible Retirement Plan; and

 (b) The amount transferred is equal to any portion of the
 distribution the Associate received from the Eligible
 Retirement Plan, not in excess of the fair market value of all
 property received in such a distribution reduced by employee
 contributions, as defined in Code Section 402(a)(5)(E).

 The Committee shall develop such procedures, and may require
 such information, from a Member desiring to make such a
 transfer, as it deems necessary or desirable to determine that
 the proposed transfer will meet the requirements of the
 Section.

 34

Upon approval by the Committee or its Administrative Delegate,
 the amount transferred shall be deposited in the Trust Fund
 and shall be credited to the Member's account. Such rollover
 amount shall be one hundred percent (100 vested in the
 Member, shall share in the income allocations in accordance
 with Section 5, but shall not share in the Company Profit
 Sharing Contributions, the Company Matching Contributions or
 the forfeiture allocations. Upon termination of employment,
 the total amount of the rollover contribution shall be
 distributed in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

 Upon such a transfer by an Associate who is otherwise eligible
 to participate in the Plan but who has not yet completed the
 participation requirement of Section 2.01, his rollover amount
 shall represent his sole interest in the Plan until he becomes
 a Member.

 11.03 DEFINITIONS. The following definitions shall apply for the
purposes of this Section 11:

 (a) ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION. An eligible rollover
 distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance
 to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
 distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series
 of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than
 annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or
 the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
 distributee's beneficiary or for a specified period of ten years or
 more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required
 under Code Section 401(a)(9) and any hardship distribution.

 (b) ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible retirement plan is an
 individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an
 individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
 annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), an annuity contract
 described in Code Section 403(b), an eligible plan described in Code

 state, or any instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a
 state, or a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), which
 accepts or will make, as applicable, an Eligible Rollover Distribution.

 In addition, the Member or former Member's surviving spouse and the
 Member's or former Member's spouse or former spouse who is the

than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond four and one-half years from
the date of the loan. If such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which
within a reasonable time (determined at the time the loan is made) will be used
as the principal residence of the Participant, the repayment period shall not
extend beyond twenty nine and one-half years from the date of the loan. An
assignment or pledge of any portion of the Participant's interest in the Plan

 permitted; provided, however, that if such Associate or Member also
 receives a loan from the Puerto Rico Plan, such minimum amount
 limitation shall not apply.

 37

(e) In the event of a default, foreclosure on the note and
 attachment of security will not occur until a distributable event
 occurs under the Plan with respect to the Member.

 38

SECTION 13

 LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN

 This Section 13 is intended to conform the Plan to the requirements of
Code Section 415 and limits the contributions that can be made by and for an
individual under the Plan.

 13.01 LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary:

 (a) The amounts allocated to a Participant during the Limitation
 Year under the Plan and allocated to the Participant under any other
 defined contribution plan to which the Employer or any other member of
 the Group has contributed shall be proportionately reduced, to the
 extent necessary, so that the Annual Addition does not exceed the least
 of:

 (1) 40,000; or

 (2) 100 of the Participant's remuneration from the
 Employer or any member of the Group during the
 Limitation Year; or

 (3) such other limits set forth in Code Section 415.

The amount set forth in subparagraph (1) above shall automatically be adjusted
to reflect adjustments made by applicable law. Remuneration for purposes of this
Section means remuneration as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.415-2(d)(10) and, effective January 1, 1998, shall also include the deferrals
described in Code Section 415(c)(3)(D)(including effective January 1, 2001,
elective amounts not included in gross income by reason of Code Section
132(f)(4).

 (b) For purposes of this Section, Limitation Year means the 12
 month period commencing on January 1 and ending on December 31.

 (c) For purposes of this Section, Annual Additions means the sum
 for the Limitation Year of Employer contributions, Employee
 contributions (determined without regard to any rollover contributions
 as defined in Code Sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8) and
 408(d)(3), without regard to catch-up contributions under Code Section
 414(v) and without regard to Employee contributions to a simplified
 employee pension plan which are excludible from gross income under
 408(k)(6) of the Code) and forfeitures.

 13.02 ADJUSTMENT FOR EXCESSIVE ANNUAL ADDITIONS.

 (a) If, as a result of the allocation of forfeitures, a reasonable
 error in estimating a Member's Pay or other facts and circumstances to
 which Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-6(b)(6) shall be applicable,
 the "annual additions" under this Plan would cause the

 39

maximum "annual additions" to be exceeded for any Member, the Committee
 shall (1) return any Member Contributions credited for the "limitation
 year" to the extent that the return would reduce the "excess amount" in
 the Member's Accounts, (2) hold any "excess amount" remaining after the
 return of any member Contributions in a "Section 415 suspense account",
 (3) use the "Section 415 suspense account" in the next "limitation
 year" (and succeeding "limitation years" if necessary) to reduce either
 Company Contributions for that Member if that Member is covered by the
 Plan as of the end of the "limitation year" or if such Member is not
 covered by the Plan at the end of the "limitation year" to reduce
 Company Contributions for all Members in the Plan, before any Company
 Contributions or Member Contributions which would constitute "annual

purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Members and their Beneficiaries
under this Plan and administrative expenses of this Plan.

 15.02 TRUSTEES. The Trust Fund may, at the direction of the Company,
be divided into one or more separate trusts, each of which may have a separate
Trustee appointed from time to time by the Company and subject to removal by the
Company. The Trustee or Trustees of each trust shall have complete authority and
discretion with respect to the investment and reinvestment of the assets of each

Any or all of such separate trusts shall be referred to collectively from time
to time as the Trust Fund. Any division of the Trust Fund into one or more

Subcommittee shall have such power and authority as otherwise would be
exercisable by such Investment Manager.

 (c) In the event that the assets of the Trust Fund shall be
divided into one or more separate trusts pursuant to the authority provided for
in Section 15.02, then the powers of the Investment Subcommittee as provided for
in Section 15.03(b) may be exercised with respect to one or more of such trusts
within the discretion of the Investment Subcommittee.

SECTION 16

 CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EMPLOYERS AND MEMBERS

 16.01 DISCLAIMER OF EMPLOYER LIABILITY.

 (a) No liability shall attach to any Employer with respect to a
benefit or claim hereunder and Members and their Beneficiaries, and all persons
claiming under or through them, shall have recourse only to the Trust Fund for
payment of any benefit hereunder.

 (b) The rights of the Members, their Beneficiaries and other
persons are hereby expressly limited and shall be only in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give a
Member any interest in any specific property of the Trust or any interest other
than a right to receive payments pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.

 16.02 EMPLOYER-ASSOCIATE RELATIONSHIP. Neither the establishment of
this Plan nor its communication through a Summary Plan Description (or
otherwise) shall be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any
Associate or any other person to continue in employment or as interfering with
or affecting in any manner the right of an Employer to discharge any Associate
or otherwise act with relation to him. Each Employer may take any action
(including discharge) with respect to any Associate or other person and may
treat him without regard to the effect which such action or treatment might have
upon him as a Member of this Plan.

 16.03 BINDING EFFECT. Each Member, by executing an enrollment form,
beneficiary designation and otherwise agreeing to participate in the Plan agrees
for himself, his beneficiary(ies), heirs, successors and assigns to be bound by
all of the provisions of the Plan.

 16.04 CORPORATE ACTION. With respect to any action permitted or
required by the Plan, the Company may act through its appropriate officers.

 16.05 CLAIM AND APPEAL PROCEDURE. A Member or beneficiary may file
with the Committee or its designee at any time a written claim in connection
either with a benefit payable hereunder or otherwise. The Committee or its
designee, normally within 90 days after receipt of a written claim, shall render
a written decision on the claim, unless an additional 90 days is required by
special circumstances which shall be explained to the claimant. If the claim is
denied, either in whole or in part, the decision shall include the reason or
reasons for the denial; a specific reference to the Plan provision or provisions
which are the basis for the denial; a description of any additional material or
information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim; an explanation as
to why the information or material is necessary; and an explanation of the
Plan's entire claim procedure. The claimant may file with the Committee, within
60 days after receiving the written decision from the Committee, a written
notice of request for review of the Committee's decision. The review shall be
made by a committee of up to three individuals (which may include members of the
Committee) appointed by the Company or by the Committee. Said committee

 46

shall render a written decision on the claim containing the specific reasons for
their decision, including a reference to the Plan's provisions, normally within
60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless an additional 60 days is
required by special circumstances which shall be explained to the claimant. If a
Member or beneficiary does not file written notice of a claim with the Committee
or its designee at the times set forth above, he shall have waived any right to
a benefit other than as originally proposed by the Company or the Committee.

 47

SECTION 17

 NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

 17.01 PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASSIGNMENT AND LEVY. No benefit
payable under this Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, levy or charge, and
any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, encumber, levy
upon or charge the same shall be void; nor shall any such benefit be in any
manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements
or torts of the person entitled to such benefit, except as specifically provided
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the creation, assignment, or recognition
of a right to any benefit payable to an alternate payee with respect to a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order shall not be treated as an assignment or
alienation prohibited by this Section. Any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary notwithstanding, if a Qualified Domestic Relations order requires the
distribution of all or part of a Member's benefits under the Plan, the
establishment or acknowledgment of the alternate payee's right to benefits under
the Plan in accordance with the terms of such Qualified Domestic Relations Order
shall in all events be deemed to be consistent with the terms of the Plan.

 Notwithstanding the above a Member's benefit will be offset
against any amount he or she is ordered or required to pay to the Plan pursuant
to an order or requirement which arises under a judgment of conviction for a
crime involving the Plan, under a civil judgment entered by a court in an action
involving a fiduciary breach, or pursuant to a settlement agreement between the
Participant and the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation. Any such offset shall be made pursuant to Section 206(d) of ERISA.

 17.02 ALTERNATE APPLICATION. If a Member or Beneficiary under this
Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer,
assign, pledge, encumber or charge any benefit under this Plan, except as
specifically provided herein, or if any benefit shall, in the discretion of the
Committee, cease, and in that event the Committee may hold or apply the same or
any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Member or Beneficiary, his
spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, or in such other manner
and in such proportion as the Committee may deem proper.

 48

 18.01 COMPANY'S RIGHTS. The Company reserves the right at any time
and from time to time in its sole discretion to alter, amend, or modify, in
whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of this Plan, provided, however,
no such alteration, amendment or modification shall be made which shall decrease
the accrued benefit of any Member. Anything in this Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company in its sole discretion may make any modifications
or amendments, additions or deletions in or to this Plan as to benefits or
otherwise and retroactively if necessary, and regardless of the effect thereof

the Trustee either to distribute the Accounts of the Members of the withdrawing
Employer as of the date of such withdrawal on the same basis as if the Plan had
been terminated pursuant to Section 19.03 or to deposit in a trust established
by the withdrawing Employer pursuant to a plan substantially similar to this

Accounts of the Members of the withdrawing Employer.

Valuation Date and the affected Members' Accounts shall be distributed in
accordance with Section 10.

is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive
immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan had then
terminated).

 Aggregation Group and the Plan enables a defined benefit plan required
 to be included in the Aggregation Group to meet the requirement of Code
 Sections 401(a)(4) or 410. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the
 calculation of the percentage at which allocations are made for a Key
 Employee shall be based only on his Pay not in excess of 200,000, such
 amount to be adjusted periodically for increases in the cost of living
 in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17). The minimum allocation
 described in this paragraph (b) shall be in addition to (and shall not

Employer which is a Top-Heavy Plan, then Section 21.03(a) shall not apply and
the required minimum annual contribution for such Member under this Plan shall
be 7 percent (7 of such Member's Pay. Such contribution shall be made without
regard to the amount of contribution, if any, made to the Plan on behalf of
Employees.

 (a) The determination of whether a plan is Top-Heavy shall be made
 in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this Section 21.04.

 52

(b) If the Plan is not required to be included in an Aggregated
 Group with other plans, then it shall be Top-Heavy only if when
 considered by itself, it is a Top-Heavy Plan and it is not included in
 a permissive Aggregation Group that is not a Top-Heavy Group.

 (c) If the Plan is required to be included in an Aggregation Group
 with other plans, it shall be Top-Heavy only if the Aggregation Group,
 including any permissively aggregated plans, is Top-Heavy.

 (d) If a plan is not a Top-Heavy Plan and is not required to be
 included in an Aggregation Group, then it shall not be Top-Heavy even
 if it is permissively aggregated in an Aggregation Group which is a
 Top-Heavy Group.

 Employee's accounts under a defined contribution plan (for an
 unaggregated plan) or under all defined contribution plans included in
 an Aggregation Group (for aggregated plans) determined as of the most
 recent plan Valuation Date within a 12-month period ending on the
 Determination Date, increased by any allocations due after such
 Valuation Date and before the Determination Date.

 (c) Cumulative Accrued Benefit means the sum of the present value
 of an Employee's accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan (for an
 unaggregated plan) or under all defined benefit plans included in an
 Aggregation Group (for aggregated plans), determined under the
 actuarial assumptions set forth in such plan or plans, as of the most
 recent plan Valuation Date within a 12-month period ending on the
 Determination Date as if the Employee voluntarily terminated service as
 of such Valuation Date.

 (d) Accounts and benefits shall be calculated to include all
 amounts attributable to both Matching Allocations and Employee
 contributions but excluding amounts attributable to voluntary
 deductible Employee contributions.

 (e) Accounts and benefits shall be increased by the aggregate
 distributions during the one-year period ending on the Determination
 Date made with respect to an Employee

 53

under the plan or plans as the case may be or under a terminated plan
 which, if it had not been terminated, would have been required to be
 included in the Aggregation Group. In the case of a distribution made
 for a reason other than separation from service, death, or disability,
 this provision shall be applied by substituting "five-year period" for
 "one-year period."

 (f) Rollovers and direct plan-to-plan transfers shall be handled
 as follows:

 (i) If the transfer is initiated by the Employee and made
 from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by
 another Employer, the transferring plan continues to count the
 amount transferred under the rules for counting distributions.
 The receiving plan does not count the amount if accepted after
 December 31, 1983, but does count it if accepted prior to
 December 31, 1983.

 (ii) If the transfer is not initiated by the Employee or
 is made between plans maintained by the Employers, the
 transferring plan shall no longer count the amount transferred
 and the receiving plan shall count the amount transferred.

 (iii) For purposes of this subsection (f), all Employers
 aggregated under the rules of Code Sections 414(b), (c) and
 (m) shall be considered a single employer.

 (g) The accured benefits and accounts of any individual who has
 not performed services for the Employer during the one-year period
 ending on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

 21.07 OTHER DEFINITIONS.

 paragraphs (b) through (i) of this Section 21.07 shall apply, to be
 interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 416 and
 the regulations thereunder.

 (b) Aggregation Group means a plan or group of plans which
 included all plans maintained by the Employer in which a Key Employee
 is a participant or which enables any plan in which a Key Employee is a
 participant to meet the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or Code
 Section 410, as well as all other plans selected by the Company for
 permissive aggregation, the inclusion of which would not prevent the
 group of plans from continuing to meet the requirements of such Code
 sections.

 last day of the preceding Plan Year.

 (d) Employee means any person employed by an Employer and shall

 there is evidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good
 faith bargaining between such Employee representatives and such
 Employer or Employers.

 (e) Employer means any corporation which is a member of a
 controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code Section 414(b))

 adjusted under Code Section 416(i)(1))(2) any person owning (or
 considered as owning within the meaning of the Code Section 318) more
 than five percent of the outstanding stock of an Employer or stock
 possessing more than five percent of the total combined voting power of
 such stock; (3) a person who would be described in subsection (3) above
 if "one percent" were substituted for "five percent" each place it
 appears in subsection (3) above, and who has annual Pay of more than
 150,000 (for purposes of determining ownership under this subsection,
 Code Section 318(a)(2)(C) shall be applied by substituting "five

(the "Company"), and __________ (the "Executive").

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"),
has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of
the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change
of Control (as defined herein). The Board believes it is imperative to diminish
the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal
uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and
to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the current
Company and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to
provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change
of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the
Executive will be satisfied and that are competitive with those of other
corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has
caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

 NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. (a) "Effective Date"
means the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined herein) on
which a Change of Control occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment
with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control
occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such
termination of employment (1) was at the request of a third party that has taken
steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (2) otherwise arose
in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then "Effective Date"
means the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.
Further, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a
Potential Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the
Company is terminated as provided in Section 5(e), then "Effective Date" means
the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.

 (b) "Change of Control Period" means the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date
hereof; provided, however, that, commencing on the date one year after the date
hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual
anniversary thereof, the "Renewal Date"), unless previously terminated, the
Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate
three years from such Renewal Date, unless, at least 60 days prior to the
Renewal Date, the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of
Control Period shall not be so extended.

 (c) "affiliated company" means any company controlled by,
controlling or under common control with the Company.

 (d) "Change of Control" means:

(1) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial
ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
of 20 or more of either (A) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the
Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (B) the combined voting
power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting
Securities"); provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section 1(d), none
of the following shall constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition
directly from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any
acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
maintained by the Company or any affiliated company, (iv) any acquisition by any
corporation pursuant to a transaction that complies with Sections 1(d)(3)(A),
1(d)(3)(B) and 1(d)(3)(C) or (v) any acquisition by the Company which, by
reducing the number of shares of Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding
Company Voting Securities, increases the proportionate number of shares of
Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities
beneficially owned by any Person to 20 or more of the Outstanding Company
Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities; provided, however, that,
if such Person shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional
shares of Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting
Securities and beneficially owns 20 or more of either the Outstanding Company
Common Sock or the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, then such additional
acquisition shall constitute a Change of Control; or

 (2) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute
the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the
Board; or

 (3) Consummation of a reorganization, merger,

indirectly, more than 50 , respectively, of the then-outstanding shares of
common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case
may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including,
without limitation, a corporation that, as a result of such transaction, owns
the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly
or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as
their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the
Outstanding Company Common Stock and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities,
as the case may be, (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from

 2

such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the
Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination)
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20 or more of, respectively, the
then-outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such
Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting
securities of such corporation, except to the extent that such ownership existed
prior to the Business Combination, and (C) at least a majority of the members of
the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of
the initial agreement or of the action of the Board providing for such Business
Combination; or

 (4) Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

 (e) "Potential Change of Control" means:

 (1) At least two directors of a particular class of
directors, as of the date hereof, are replaced for any reason by directors who
are not members of the Incumbent Board at the time of such replacement;
provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the
date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's
stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such
individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this
purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election
or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or

 (2) The Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, for
purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change of Control has occurred.

 SECTION 2. EMPLOYMENT PERIOD. The Company hereby agrees
to continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to
remain in the employ of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the
third anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Employment Period").

 SECTION 3. TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. (a) POSITION AND
DUTIES. (1) During the Employment Period, (A) the Executive's position
(including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority,
duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate in all material
respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any
time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date and (B)
the Executive's services shall be performed at the office where the Executive
was employed immediately preceding the Effective Date or at any other location
less than 35 miles from such office.

 (2) During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the
Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal business
hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to
discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the

 3

Executive's reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such
responsibilities. During the Employment Period, it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable
boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or
teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long
as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the
Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with
this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that, to the extent that
any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective
Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities
similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not
thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's
responsibilities to the Company.

 (b) COMPENSATION. (1) BASE SALARY. During the Employment
Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary (the "Annual Base
Salary"), which Annual Base Salary shall be paid at a monthly rate at least
equal to 12 times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any
base salary that has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company
and the affiliated companies in respect of the 12-month period immediately
preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. During the Employment
Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually, beginning no
more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive
prior to the Effective Date. Any increase in the Annual Base Salary shall not
serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this
Agreement. The Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase
and the term "Annual Base Salary" shall refer to the Annual Base Salary as so
increased.

 (2) ANNUAL BONUS. In addition to the Annual Base Salary,
the Executive shall be awarded, for each fiscal year ending during the
Employment Period, an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") in cash at least equal
to the Executive's highest bonus under the Company's annual and long-term
incentive plans, or any comparable bonus under any predecessor or successor
plan, for the last three full fiscal years prior to the Effective Date
(annualized, in the event that the Executive was not employed by the Company for
the whole of such fiscal year) (the "Recent Annual Bonus"). Each such Annual
Bonus shall be paid no later than the end of the third month of the fiscal year
next following the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded, unless the
Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus.

 (3) INCENTIVE, SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS. During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all
incentive, savings and retirement plans, practices, policies, and programs
applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and the affiliated
companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs
provide the Executive with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to
both regular and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that
such distinction is applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit
opportunities, in each case, less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most
favorable of those provided by the Company and the affiliated companies for the
Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any
time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if
more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the
Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and the affiliated
companies.

 4

(4) WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS. During the Employment Period,
the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be
eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare
benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company and the
affiliated companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription,
dental, disability, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel
accident insurance plans and programs) to the extent applicable generally to
other peer executives of the Company and the affiliated companies, but in no
event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive
with benefits that are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable
of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for the Executive at
any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or,
if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after
the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and the affiliated
companies.

 (5) EXPENSES. During the Employment Period, the Executive
shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses
incurred by the Executive in accordance with the most favorable policies,
practices and procedures of the Company and the affiliated companies in effect
for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding
the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect
generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the
Company and the affiliated companies.

 (6) FRINGE BENEFITS. During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall be entitled to fringe benefits, including, without limitation,
tax and financial planning services, payment of club dues, and, if applicable,
use of an automobile and payment of related expenses, in accordance with the
most favorable plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company and the
affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day
period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the
Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and the affiliated companies.

 (7) OFFICE AND SUPPORT STAFF. During the Employment
Period, the Executive shall be entitled to an office or offices of a size and
with furnishings and other appointments, and to exclusive personal secretarial
and other assistance, at least equal to the most favorable of the foregoing
provided to the Executive by the Company and the affiliated companies at any
time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if
more favorable to the Executive, as provided generally at any time thereafter
with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the affiliated
companies.

 (8) VACATION. During the Employment Period, the Executive
shall be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the most favorable plans,
policies, programs and practices of the Company and the affiliated companies as
in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately
preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in
effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of
the Company and the affiliated companies.

 SECTION 4. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. (a) DEATH OR
DISABILITY. The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically if the
Executive dies during the

 5

Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability
(as defined herein) of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period
(pursuant to the definition of "Disability"), it may give to the Executive
written notice in accordance with Section 11(b) of its intention to terminate
the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment with the
Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice
by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30
days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time
performance of the Executive's duties. "Disability" means the absence of the
Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for
180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or
physical illness that is determined to be total and permanent by a physician
selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the
Executive's legal representative.

 (b) CAUSE. The Company may terminate the Executive's
employment during the Employment Period for Cause. "Cause" means:

 (1) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to
 perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or any
 affiliated company (other than any such failure resulting from
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand
 for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board
 or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company that specifically
 identifies the manner in which the Board or the Chief Executive Officer
 of the Company believes that the Executive has not substantially
 performed the Executive's duties, or

 (2) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal
 conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably
 injurious to the Company.

For purposes of this Section 4(b), no act, or failure to act, on the part of the
Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to
be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the
Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be
for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than
three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the
Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel for
the Executive, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith
opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in
Section 4(b)(1) or 4(b)(2), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 (C) GOOD REASON. The Executive's employment may be
terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. "Good Reason" means:

 6

(1) the assignment to the Executive of any duties
 inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including
 status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties
 or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 3(a), or any other
 action by the Company that results in a diminution in such position,
 authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an
 isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith
 and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice
 thereof given by the Executive;

 (2) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the
 provisions of Section 3(b), other than an isolated, insubstantial and
 inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and that is remedied by
 the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the
 Executive;

 (3) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at
 any office or location other than as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(B) or
 the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to
 a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the
 Effective Date;

 (4) any purported termination by the Company of the
 Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this
 Agreement; or

 (5) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy
 Section 10(c).

 For purposes of this Section 4(c), any good faith
determination of Good Reason made by the Executive shall be conclusive. Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a termination by the
Executive for any reason during the 30-day period immediately following the
first anniversary of a Change of Control shall be deemed to be a termination for
Good Reason for all purposes of this Agreement.

 (d) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any termination by the Company
for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice
of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 11(b).
"Notice of Termination" means a written notice that (1) indicates the specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (2) to the extent
applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed
to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the
provision so indicated, and (3) if the Date of Termination (as defined herein)
is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the Date of
Termination (which Date of Termination shall be not more than 30 days after the
giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth
in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance that contributes to a
showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or
the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company,
respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the
Executive's or the Company's respective rights hereunder.

 (e) DATE OF TERMINATION. "Date of Termination" means (1)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the
Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or
any later date specified in the Notice of Termination, as the case may be, (2)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the

 7

Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination, and (3) if
the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the
Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

 SECTION 5. OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UPON TERMINATION.
(a) GOOD REASON; OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY. If, during the
Employment Period, the Company terminates the Executive's employment other than
for Cause or Disability or the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason:

 (1) the Company shall pay to the Executive, in a lump sum
 in cash within 30 days after the Date of Termination, the aggregate of
 the following amounts:

 (A) the sum of (i) the Executive's Annual Base
 Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not
 theretofore paid, (ii) the product of (x) the higher of (I)
 the Recent Annual Bonus and (II) the Annual Bonus paid or
 payable, including any bonus or portion thereof that has been
 earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year
 consisting of less than 12 full months or during which the
 Executive was employed for less than 12 full months), for the
 most recently completed fiscal year during the Employment
 Period, if any (such higher amount, the "Highest Annual
 Bonus") and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
 number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of
 Termination and the denominator of which is 365, and (iii) any
 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and any accrued
 vacation pay, in each case, to the extent not theretofore paid
 (the sum of the amounts described in subclauses (i), (ii) and
 (iii), the "Accrued Obligations"); and

 (B) the amount equal to the product of (i) three
 and (ii) the sum of (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and
 (y) the Highest Annual Bonus; and

 (C) in lieu of the receipt of shares of common
 stock of the Company ("Common Stock") issuable upon the
 exercise of outstanding options (other than stock options
 qualifying as incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section
 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
 "Code") which ISOs were granted on or prior to April 29, 1996)
 ("Options"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and
 performance units "Units"), if any (the Options, SARs and
 Units shall be referred to herein collectively as the
 "Awards"), granted to the Executive under the Company's 1996
 Stock Incentive Plan or any successor or substitute plans
 thereto, an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess of
 (x) in the case of an ISO granted after April 29, 1996, the
 closing price of Common Stock as reported on the New York
 Stock Exchange on the Date of Termination or the last full
 trading day immediately prior to the Date of Termination (or,
 if not listed on such exchange, on a nationally recognized
 exchange or quotation system on which trading value in the
 Common Stock is highest) (the "Closing Price") and, in the
 case of all other Awards, the higher of the Closing Price and
 the highest per share price for Common Stock actually paid in
 connection with any Change of

 8

Control, over (y) the per share exercise price (if any) of
 each Award, and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock
 covered by each such Award, whether or not such Award is
 exercisable on the Date of Termination; and

 (2) for three years after the Executive's Date of
 Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of
 the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall
 continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at
 least equal to those that would have been provided to them in
 accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described
 in Section 3(b)(4) if the Executive's employment had not been
 terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect
 generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives
 of the Company and the affiliated companies and their families,
 provided, however, that, if the Executive becomes re-employed with
 another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare
 benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical and other
 welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided
 under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. If
 the Executive has attained age 50 on the Date of Termination and if,
 with five additional years of age and service beyond the Executive's
 age and years of service as of the Date of Termination, the Executive
 would have been entitled to receive any other benefits under the
 Company's post-retirement programs as in effect immediately prior to
 the Effective Date, then the Executive shall be entitled to such
 benefits as if the Executive had attained those five additional years
 of age and been employed by the Company for those five additional years
 of service, as of the Date of Termination, and such benefits shall
 commence immediately and be determined and provided under the terms of
 such plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date,
 without regard to any amendments subsequent to the Effective Date that
 adversely affect the rights of participants thereunder; and

 (3) if the Executive has attained age 50 but has not
 attained age 55 on the Date of Termination, then for purposes of
 determining benefits under Section 3.2(c) of the Company's
 Supplementary Retirement Plan or any successor plan, as in effect
 immediately prior to the Effective Date (the "Supplemental Plan"), the
 Executive shall be deemed to be entitled to the benefits under Section
 3.2(c) of the Supplemental Plan if, during the five-year period
 following the Effective Date, the Company terminates the Executive's
 employment other than for Cause or the Executive terminates his
 employment for Good Reason (it being expressly agreed that,
 notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the rights
 under this Section 5(a)(3) shall survive for the five-year period
 following the Effective Date); and

 (4) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred,
 and subject to a maximum limit equal to three (3) times the Executive's
 monthly compensation, provide the Executive with outplacement services
 the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in
 the Executive's sole discretion; and

 (5) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the
 Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts
 or benefits required to be paid or provided or that the Executive is
 eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or

 9

practice or contract or agreement of the Company and the affiliated
 companies (such other amounts and benefits, the "Other Benefits").

 (b) DEATH. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement
shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal
representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued
Obligations and the timely payment or provision of the Other Benefits. The
Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as
applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
With respect to the provision of the Other Benefits, the term "Other Benefits"
as utilized in this Section 5(b) shall include, without limitation, and the
Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits
at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and the
affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of peer executives of the
Company and the affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices and
policies relating to death benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other
peer executives and their beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period
immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the
Executive's estate and/or the Executive's beneficiaries, as in effect on the
date of the Executive's death with respect to other peer executives of the
Company and the affiliated companies and their beneficiaries.

 (c) DISABILITY. If the Executive's employment is
terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period,
this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive,
other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or
provision of the Other Benefits. The Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the
Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With
respect to the provision of the Other Benefits, the term "Other Benefits" as
utilized in this Section 5(c) shall include, and the Executive shall be entitled
after the Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at
least equal to the most favorable of those generally provided by the Company and
the affiliated companies to disabled executives and/or their families in
accordance with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to
disability, if any, as in effect generally with respect to other peer executives
and their families at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding
the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's
family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer
executives of the Company and the affiliated companies and their families.

 (d) CAUSE; OTHER THAN FOR GOOD REASON. If the Executive's
employment is terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement
shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than the
obligation to pay to the Executive (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary
through the Date of Termination, (2) the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive, and (3) the Other Benefits, in each case, to the
extent theretofore unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment
during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this
Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other
than for the Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of the
Other Benefits. In such case, all the Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the
Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

 (e) OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND THE EXECUTIVE UPON A
POTENTIAL CHANGE OF CONTROL. If, during the Change of Control Period, a
Potential Change of Control

 10

occurs, the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, on
the same basis and terms and conditions as the Executive is employed by the
Company immediately prior to the Potential Change of Control, for the 12-month
period following such Potential Change of Control. If the Executive's employment
is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, death or Disability, or the
Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, during the 12-month period
following the occurrence of a Potential Change of Control, without regard to
whether a Change of Control has actually occurred or is likely to occur, the
Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company in
anticipation of a Change of Control, and the Executive shall be entitled to
receive the payments and benefits provided in Section 5(a) hereof.

 SECTION 6. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company
or the affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor,
subject to Section 11(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such
rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the
Company or the affiliated companies. Amounts that are vested benefits or that
the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice
or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or the affiliated
companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement,
except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

 SECTION 7. FULL SETTLEMENT. The Company's obligation to
make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its
obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense, or other claim, right or action that the Company may have
against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to
seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the
amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement,
and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted
by law, all legal fees and expenses that the Executive may reasonably incur as a
result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the
Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under,
any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof
(including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any
payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus, in each case, interest on any delayed
payment at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of
the Code.

 SECTION 8. CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.

 (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be
determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or the affiliated
companies to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or
distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise but determined without regard to any additional payments required
under this Section 8) (the "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed
by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties are incurred by the
Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any
such interest and penalties, collectively, the "Excise Tax"), then the

 11

Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up
Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
(including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties
imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment,
the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the
Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed 110 of the greatest
amount that could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of the Payments
would not give rise to any Excise Tax (the "Reduced Amount"), then no Gross-Up
Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall
be reduced to the Reduced Amount.

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 8(c), all
determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including whether and
when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
by the Company's independent public accountant or such other certified public
accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm")
that shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the
Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive
that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the
Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or
auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the
Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make
the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be
referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as
determined pursuant to this Section 8, shall be paid by the Company to the
Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's
determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon
the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application
of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the
Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not
have been made by the Company should have been made (the "Underpayment"),
consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the
Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive
thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm
shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

 (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is
informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of
such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or
such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to
such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to
the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim,
the Executive shall:

 12

(1) give the Company any information reasonably requested
 by the Company relating to such claim,

 (2) take such action in connection with contesting such
 claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to
 time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation
 with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the
 Company,

 (3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order
 effectively to contest such claim, and

 (4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
 relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection
with such contest, and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the
applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole
option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund
or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to
prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in
a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the
Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company directs the
Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the
amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and shall
indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any
Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto)
imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with
respect to such advance; and provided, further, that any extension of the
statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the
Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is
limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of
the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up
Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to
settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal
Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

 (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 8(c), the Executive becomes entitled
to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject
to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 8(c)) promptly pay
to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or
credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the
Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 8(c), a
determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund
with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in
writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration
of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven

 13

and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall
offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be
paid.

 SECTION 9. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Executive
shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or
confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or the
affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which information,
knowledge or data shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company or the affiliated companies and which
information, knowledge or data shall not be or become public knowledge (other
than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation
of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company
and those persons designated by the Company. In no event shall an asserted
violation of the provisions of this Section 9 constitute a basis for deferring
or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this
Agreement.

 SECTION 10. SUCCESSORS. (a) This Agreement is personal
to the Executive, and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall
not be assignable by the Executive other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

 (c) The Company will require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession
had taken place. "Company" means the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to
perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

 SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this
Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or
effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified other than by a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and
legal representatives.

 (b) All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed as follows:

 14

if to the Executive:
 Name:____________
 Payless ShoeSource, Inc.
 3231 SE Sixth Avenue
 Topeka, Kansas 66607

 if to the Company:
 Payless ShoeSource, Inc.
 3231 SE Sixth Avenue
 Topeka, Kansas 66607
 Attention: General Counsel

or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in
writing in accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.

 (c) The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement.

 (d) The Company may withhold from any amounts payable
under this Agreement such United States federal, state or local or foreign taxes
as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or
regulation.

 (e) The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist
upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or the failure to
assert any right the Executive or the Company may have hereunder, including,
without limitation, the right of the Executive to terminate employment for Good
Reason pursuant to Sections 4(c)(1) through 4(c)(5), shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this
Agreement.

 (f) From and after the Effective Date, this Agreement
shall supersede any other agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided, however, in no event shall this Agreement
supersede or replace the Indemnification Agreement between the Executive and the
Company, dated as of March 24, 2003.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set the
Executive's hand and, pursuant to the authorization from the Board, the Company
has caused these presents to be executed in its name on its behalf, all as of
the day and year first above written.

 EX-10.13 FORM OF DIRECTORS' & OFFICER AGREEMENT

EXHIBIT 10.13

 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

 AGREEMENT, dated as of the ____ day of _____, 200_ between
Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and __________
(the "Indemnitee").

 WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract
as directors and officers the most capable persons available; and

 WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company;
and

 WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the
increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors
and officers of public companies in today's environment; and

 WHEREAS, basic protection against undue risk of personal
liability of directors and officers heretofore has been provided through
insurance coverage providing reasonable protection at reasonable cost, and
Indemnitee has relied on the availability of such coverage; but as a result of
substantial changes in the marketplace for such insurance it generally has
become more difficult to obtain such insurance on terms providing reasonable
protection at reasonable cost; and

 WHEREAS, the Delaware legislature, in recognition of the need
to secure the continued service of competent and experienced people in senior
corporate positions and to assure that they will be able to exercise judgment
without fear of personal liability so long as they fulfill the basic duties of
honesty, care and good faith, has so enacted Section 145 of The Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), which empowers the Company to indemnify its
officers, directors, employees and agents and expressly provides that the
indemnification provided by the statute is not exclusive; and

 WHEREAS, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
requires the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to its directors and
officers to the fullest extent now or hereafter authorized or permitted by law
and authorizes the Company to enter into agreements providing for such
indemnification and advancement of expenses; and

 WHEREAS, in recognition of the fact that the Indemnitee
continues to serve as a director or officer of the Company, in part in reliance
on the aforesaid By-laws, and of the fact of Indemnitee's need for substantial
protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued
service to the Company in an effective manner, and in part to provide Indemnitee
with specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by such
Certificate of Incorporation will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of,
among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such Certificate of
Incorporation or any change in the composition of the Company's Board of
Directors or any acquisition transaction relating to the Company), and due to
the possibility that the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage could at

some future time become inadequate, the Company wishes to provide in this
Agreement for the indemnification of, and the advancing of expenses to,
Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) now or hereafter
authorized or permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the
extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under
the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies,

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of
Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, with
another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 1. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS:

 (1) "Approved Law Firm" shall mean any law firm (i)
located in New York or Delaware, (ii) having 50 or more attorneys and (iii)
rated "av" by Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory; provided, however, that such law
firm shall not, for a five- year period prior to the Indemnifiable Event, have
been engaged by the Company, an Acquiring Person or the Indemnitee.

 (2) "Applicable Standard of Conduct" shall mean the
standard established by Section 145(a)-(b) of the DGCL.

 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
 Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the
 meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
 20 or more of either (A) the then-outstanding shares of
 common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common
 Stock") or (B) the combined voting power of the
 then-outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to
 vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding
 Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that, for
 purposes of this Section 1(d), none of the following shall
 constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly
 from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii)
 any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related
 trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
 affiliated company, (iv) any acquisition by any corporation
 pursuant to a transaction that complies with Sections
 1(d)(3)(A), 1(d)(3)(B) and 1(d)(3)(C) or (v) any acquisition

 Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting
 Securities, increases the proportionate number of shares of
 Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting
 Securities beneficially owned by any Person to 20 or more of
 the Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company
 Voting Securities; provided, however, that, if such Person
 shall thereafter become

 2

the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Outstanding
 Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities
 and beneficially owns 20 or more of either the Outstanding
 Company Common Stock or the Outstanding Company Voting
 Securities, then such additional acquisition shall constitute
 a Change of Control; or

 (B) The cessation, for any reason, of
 individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board
 (the "Incumbent Board") to constitute at least a majority of
 the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
 director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or
 nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was
 approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
 then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as
 though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board,
 but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
 initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
 or threatened election contest with respect to the election or
 removal of directors or other actual or threatened
 solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
 Person other than the Board; or

 (C) The consummation of a reorganization,
 merger, consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or
 substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business
 Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business
 Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals
 and entities that were the beneficial owners, respectively, of
 the Outstanding Company Common Stock and the Outstanding
 Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business
 Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more
 than 50 , respectively, of the then-outstanding shares of
 common stock and the combined voting power of the
 then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally
 in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the
 corporation resulting from such Business Combination
 (including, without limitation, a corporation that, as a
 result of such transaction, owns the Company or all or
 substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or
 through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
 proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such
 Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock
 and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may
 be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from
 such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or
 related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting
 from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or
 indirectly, 20 or more of, respectively, the then-outstanding
 shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such
 Business Combination or the combined voting power of the
 then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation, except
 to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the
 Business Combination, and (iii) at least a majority of the
 members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting
 from such Business Combination were members of

 3

the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the
 initial agreement or of the action of the Board providing for
 such Business Combination; or

 (D) The approval by the stockholders of the
 Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the
 Company.

 (5) "Claim" shall mean any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether
conducted by the Company or any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other.

 (6) "Expenses" shall include attorneys' fees and all
other costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim
relating to any Indemnifiable Event, together with interest, computed at the
Company's average cost of funds for short-term borrowings, accrued from the date
of payment of such expense to the date Indemnitee receives reimbursement
therefor.

 (7) "Indemnifiable Event" shall mean any event or
occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer,
employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request
of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of
another corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. Without limitation
of any indemnification provided hereunder, an Indemnitee serving (i) another
corporation, partnership, joint venture or trust of which 20 percent or more of
the voting power or residual economic interest is held, directly or indirectly,
by the Company, or (ii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or any entity
referred to in clause (i), in any capacity shall be deemed to be doing so at the
request of the Company.

 (8) "Reviewing Party" shall be (i) the Board of Directors
acting by majority vote of directors who are not parties to the particular Claim
with respect to which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification, even through less
than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority
vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no
such directors, or if such directors so direct, (A) by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because
the indemnification is not precluded by circumstances described in the last
sentence of Section 2 of this Agreement and the Applicable Standard of Conduct
set forth in Section 145 of the DGCL has been met by the Indemnitee or (B) the
shareholders upon a finding that the Indemnitee has met the Applicable Standard
of Conduct referred to in clause (iii)(A) of this definition.

 (9) "Voting Securities" shall mean any securities of the
Company which vote generally in the election of directors.

 4

2. BASIC INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENT. If Indemnitee was,
is or becomes at any time a party to, or witness or other participant in, or is
threatened to be made a party to, or witness or other participant in, a Claim by
reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent now or hereafter authorized or
permitted by law as soon as practicable but in any event no later than 30 days
after written demand is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses,
judgments, fines (including excise taxes assessed against an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan), penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with, or in respect of, such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or
amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim. If so requested by Indemnitee, the
Company shall advance (within two business days of such request) any and all
Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in any action in which the
Indemnitee's conduct has been finally adjudged to have been knowingly
fraudulent, deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct; (ii) in any derivative
action in which Indemnitee has been finally adjudged to be liable to the
Company, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court
in which the proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses as the court shall deem proper, and (iii) prior to a Change in Control
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any
director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented
to the initiation of such Claim.

 3. PAYMENT. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2,
the obligations of the Company under Section 2 (which shall in no event be
deemed to preclude any right to indemnification to which Indemnitee may be
entitled under Section 145(c) of the DGCL) shall be subject to the condition
that the Reviewing Party shall have authorized such indemnification in the
specific case by having determined that the indemnification is not precluded by
circumstances described in the last sentence of Section 2 of this Agreement and
Indemnitee is permitted to be indemnified under the Applicable Standard of
Conduct set forth in Section 145(a)-(b) of the DGCL. The Company shall promptly
call a meeting of the Board of Directors with respect to a Claim and agrees to
use its best efforts to facilitate a prompt determination by the Reviewing Party
with respect to the Claim. Indemnitee shall be afforded the opportunity to make
submissions to the Reviewing Party with respect to the Claim. The obligation of
the Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to Section 2 shall be subject to
the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party
determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under
Section 2 and applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by
Indemnitee (who hereby agrees and undertakes to the full extent required by
Section 145(e) of the DGCL to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts
theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced legal
proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that
Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by
the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified
under

 5

applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to
reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial
determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal
therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). If there has been no determination by
the Reviewing Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee
substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under
applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any
court in the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in
which venue is proper seeking an initial determination by the court or
challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof,
and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such
proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be
conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.

 4. CHANGE IN CONTROL. If there is a Change in Control
(other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the
Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in
Control) then (i) all determinations by the Company pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 3 hereof and Section 145(d) of the DGCL shall be made by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion pursuant to Section 145(d) of the
DGCL and (ii) with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the
rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this
Agreement or any other agreement or By-law of the Company now or hereafter in
effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events (including, but not limited
to, any such legal opinion provided under Section 145 (d) of the DGCL) the
Company (including the Board of Directors) shall seek legal advice from (and
only from) special, independent counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by
the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not
otherwise performed services for the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company)
or an Acquiring Person (or any affiliate or associate of such Acquiring Person)
or Indemnitee within the last five years (other than in connection with such
matters). Unless Indemnitee has theretofore selected counsel pursuant to this
Section 4 and such counsel has been approved by the Company, any Approved Law
Firm selected by Indemnitee shall be deemed to be approved by the Company. Such
counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company,
the Board of Directors and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the
Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The
Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the special, independent counsel
referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all
expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto. As used
in this Agreement, the terms "affiliate" and "associate" shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules
and Regulations under the Act and in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 5. INDEMNIFICATION FOR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. The Company
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys'
fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business days of such
request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted or action brought by Indemnitee
for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the

 6

Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or By-law of the Company now
or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii)
recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is
determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or
insurance recovery, as the case may be.

 6. PARTIAL INDEMNITY, ETC. If Indemnitee is entitled
under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for a
portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the
Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which
Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an
Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including
dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified, to the extent
permitted by law, against all Expenses incurred in connection with such
Indemnifiable Event.

 7. BURDEN OF PROOF. In connection with any determination
by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be
indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish
that Indemnitee is not so entitled.

 8. NO PRESUMPTION. For purposes of this Agreement, the
termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal,
by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not
create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of
conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.

 9. NONEXCLUSIVITY, ETC. The rights of the Indemnitee
hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the DGCL, or otherwise. To the
extent that a change in the DGCL (whether by statute or judicial decision)
permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently
under the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and this Agreement, it is
the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement
the greater benefits so afforded by such change.

 10. LIABILITY INSURANCE. To the extent the Company
maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers'
liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in
accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage
available for any director or officer of the Company.

 11. PERIOD OF LIMITATIONS. No legal action shall be
brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or on behalf of the Company
or any affiliate of the Company

 7

against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of
such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company or any
affiliate shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the
timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however,
that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such
cause of action, such shorter period shall govern.

 12. AMENDMENTS, ETC. No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both
of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be effective unless in writing and no written waiver shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not
similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

 13. SUBROGATION. In the event of payment under the
Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all
of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required
and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including
the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to
bring suit to enforce such rights.

 14. NO DUPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. The Company shall not be
liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Claim
made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received
payment (under any insurance policy, By-law or otherwise) of the amounts
otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

 15. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties recognize that if
any provision of this Agreement is violated by the Company, Indemnitee may be
without an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such
violation, the Indemnitee shall be entitled, if Indemnitee so elects, to
institute proceedings, either in law or at equity, to obtain damages, to enforce
specific performance, to enjoin such violation, or to obtain any relief or any
combination of the foregoing as Indemnitee may elect to pursue.

 16. BINDING EFFECT, ETC. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the Company), assigns, spouses, heirs, and personal
and legal representatives. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of
whether Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer or director of the Company
or of any other enterprise at the Company's request.

 17. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be severable if any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a
single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise

 8

unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

 18. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such state without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.

 19. EFFECTIVE TIME. This Agreement shall become effective
as of the date first above written. The contractual rights of Indemnitee with
respect to Indemnifiable Events occurring before the Effective Time are governed
by the Indemnification Agreement between Indemnitee and Payless ShoeSource,
Inc., a Missouri corporation or Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, if any, (the "Prior Agreements") and Indemnitee shall have no
rights under this Agreement with respect to such Indemnifiable Events. The
contractual rights of Indemnitee with respect to Indemnifiable Events occurring
after the Effective Time are governed by this Agreement, and Indemnitee shall
have no rights against Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a Missouri corporation or
Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation, under any Prior Agreements
with respect to such Indemnifiable Events.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Indemnitee have executed
this Agreement as of the date first above written.

PAYLESS SHOESOURCE, INC.
 PROFIT SHARING PLAN FOR PUERTO RICO ASSOCIATES

 INTRODUCTION

 Effective April 1, 1996, Payless ShoeSource, Inc. ("Payless") withdrew
from and ceased to be a participating Employer in The May Department Stores
Company Profit Sharing Plan (the "May Plan") and established the Payless
ShoeSource, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the "Payless Plan"). The Payless Plan, as
adopted, covered eligible Associates employed in Puerto Rico by Payless
ShoeSource of Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Payless PR"). Effective January 1, 1997, a
portion of the Payless Plan covering Associates employed by Payless PR was spun
off and established a new plan, Payless ShoeSource, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan for
Puerto Rico Associates (the "Plan"), which was adopted by Payless PR as an
adopting Employer.

 Effective March 20, 2000, or as otherwise specified, Payless amended
and restated the Plan primarily to include provisions for loans, the acceptance
of rollover contributions from other qualified plans, a change to daily
valuation, other miscellaneous changes and to comply with the tax laws of Puerto
Rico. Such amendment and restatement applies only to Associates or former
Associates who were employed by an Employer on or after the effective date(s) of
the respective amended provisions, and the rights and benefits of persons
thereunder are to be determined solely in accordance with the provisions of the
Plan in effect on the date an Associate's employment was or is terminated.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the change in valuation date became
effective for all Associates and former Associates, without regard to employment
after the effective date.

 Now effective May 1, 2002, the Plan is amended and restated primarily
to permit Full-Time Associates to participate in the Plan upon the completion of
90 days of employment service with a participating Employer or other member of
the Group. Other amendments made herein are effective on the dates as specified.

 The terms and provisions of this new Plan are as follows:

 6

SECTION 1

 DEFINITIONS

 1.01 ACCOUNTS means the Company Accounts and Member Accounts
established under Section 6.

 1.02 ADMINISTRATIVE DELEGATE means one or more persons or
institutions to which the Committee has delegated certain administrative
functions pursuant to a written agreement.

 1.03 AFTER-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS means Member Contributions which are
not Before-Tax Contributions and which are made by the Member in accordance with
Section 4.01(a).

 1.04 ALLOCATION PAY AMOUNT means with respect to each eligible
Member, (a) one (1) times the amount of Pay as defined in Section 1.33 up to the
Social Security Wage Base ("SSWB") for the Plan Year, plus (b) two (2) times the
amount of such Pay in excess of the SSWB for the Plan Year. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 1.04 or of Section 3.03 to the contrary, in no event
shall the percentage of Members' Pay to be allocated for any year below the SSWB
be less than fifty percent (50 of the percentage of Pay allocated with respect
to Members' Pay in excess of the SSWB, nor may the latter percentage of Pay
(above the SSWB) exceed the former percentage of Pay (below the SSWB) by more
than 5.7 (or such other percentage as may be the maximum permitted differential
under US Code Section 401(1) from time to time).

 In determining each eligible Member's Allocation Pay Amount, only Pay
received during the part of the Plan Year the Member is eligible for the Company
Contribution feature of the Plan, pursuant to Section 2, shall be considered,
and the SSWB to be applied for such Member shall be proportionally prorated if
such eligibility is for less than a full Plan Year.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Plan Year for which
applying the definition of Allocation Pay Amount set forth above would cause the
allocation made pursuant to Section 3.03 to violate the permitted disparity
limitations of US Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(l)-2, Allocation Pay Amount shall be
adjusted to permit Section 3.03 to operate in compliance with the limitations of
US Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(l)-2.

 1.05 ASSOCIATE means any person employed by Payless PR who receives
Pay from Payless PR. The term Associate also may include, based upon the express
written determination of the Company or the Committee, a person who receives Pay
from sources within Puerto Rico and who is employed, at the request of the
Company or the Employer, by a member of the Group (defined in Section 1.21) to
the extent such employee otherwise qualifies for membership under Section 2, in
which case such Group member shall be

 7

deemed to be an "Employer" hereunder, as to such person or persons only. The
term "Associate" shall not include (i) any person covered under a collective
bargaining agreement unless and until the Employer and the collective bargaining
representatives so agree, (ii) any non-resident alien who received no earned
income from the Employer from sources within Puerto Rico, and (iii) any "leased
employee" within the meaning of US Code Section 414(n)(2). The term "Associate"
may include, where appropriate, Associates of Payless or other related Employers
who are transferred to the Employer or as otherwise may be necessary or
appropriate in construing the Plan under applicable law. In the event that an
individual who was not classified as an employee or a common-law employee is
legally reclassified as an employee or a common-law employee of the Employer,
such employee shall only be considered to be an employee at the time of such
reclassification, or, if later, at the time that such individual is initially
treated as an employee or common-law employee on the payroll records of the
Company.

 1.06 AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE means any leave of absence
authorized by the Employer under rules established by the Employer.

 1.07 BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS means contributions which the Member
elects (in accordance with Section 4.01(b)) to have the Employer make directly
to the Plan on behalf of the Member, which election shall constitute an election
under PR Code Section 1165(e)(2)(A). The "Member's Before-Tax Contributions"
shall refer to Before-Tax Contributions made to the Plan by the Employer on

or is eligible to be a Member of the Plan shall continue to be a Member of the
Plan entitled to

 14

make Member Contributions pursuant to Section 4 and eligible to share in Company
Contributions pursuant to Section 3.

 (b) Each other Associate shall be eligible to become a
Member of the Plan when the Associate has completed one Year of Service and
attained age 21, with membership to commence as of the first day of the month
coincident with or following the date he has met these eligibility requirements.

with the Employer and attained age 21. For the purpose of the preceding
sentence, a "Full Time Associate" is an Associate classified on the Employer's
records as a Full Time Associate. In many locations, this means the Associate is
normally scheduled to work 32 or more hours per week. However, the Associate's
classification on the Employer's records, and not the actual number of hours
worked in any period, determines Full Time status.

 (c) Each Member shall be deemed to have elected to make a
three percent (3 Before-Tax Contribution pursuant to Section 4.01(b),
commencing with the paycheck issued with respect to the first payroll period
beginning on or after the first day of the month coincident with or following
the date he met the foregoing eligibility requirements. Notwithstanding this
"deemed" election, an Associate or Member may elect pursuant to procedures
established by the Committee to not make, or to suspend making, said three
percent (3 automatic Before-Tax Contribution, or pursuant to Section 4.01(a)
or (b) to make an After-Tax or a Before-Tax Contribution of an amount other than
three percent (3 ).

Rican subsidiaries are eligible for membership hereunder. Any other Associate
who has Accounts in this Plan, such Accounts shall continue to be revalued as of

an Employer may contribute to the Trust, as of the end of each Plan Year, a
percentage of the Company's Net Profits as a Company Profit Sharing
Contribution. The amount of such contribution, if any, shall be determined by
the Board of Directors in its discretion. Any such contribution shall be made as
soon as practicable after the close of the Company's Fiscal Year. All such
contributions advanced to the Plan by the Company shall be reimbursed to the
Company by the Employer.

 3.02 AMOUNT OF COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION. The Company, in its
discretion, shall contribute to the Trust, as of the end of each Plan Year, such
that the amount contributed to this Plan and to the Payless ShoeSource, Inc.
Profit Sharing Plan shall be equal to 2 1/2 of Net Profits, until determined
otherwise by the Board of Directors, in the form of a Company Matching
Contribution. The total amount of such contribution shall be allocated in
proportion to the amount that each Member's Contributions under Sections 4.01(a)
and (b), up to a total of 5 of such Member's Pay for a Plan Year, bears to the
total amount of all Member Contributions up to 5 of such Members' Pay for a
Plan Year. Such Company Matching Contribution shall be determined and paid to
the Trustee as soon as practicable after the close of each Fiscal Year and shall
be reimbursed to the Company by the Employer when paid.

 3.03 ALLOCATION OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. The Company Contributions
shall be allocated only to the Company Accounts of Members who are employed by
the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year and on behalf of Members whose
employment has terminated during the Plan Year by reason of Retirement, death or
Disability. Company Profit Sharing Contributions shall be credited to eligible
Members' Company Profit Sharing Contribution Accounts. Company Profit Sharing
Contributions allocated prior to or as of July 31, 1997 shall be fully vested;
Company Profit Sharing Contributions allocated thereafter shall be subject to
the vesting provisions of Section 6.07. Company Matching Contributions shall be
subject to the vesting provisions of Section 6.07 and to the withdrawal penalty
provisions of Section 8.02(a). No Company Matching Contribution shall be made
with respect to a Member Before-Tax Contribution in excess of the PR Code
Section 1165(e)(7)(A) limit, as referred to in Section 4.01(h) and as revised
from time to time.

 3.04 PROFIT SHARING ALLOCATION FORMULA. The Company Profit Sharing
Contribution, if any, shall be allocated to all Members eligible to share in the
contribution according to the ratio that each Member's Allocation Pay Amount for
the Plan Year bears to the total Allocation Pay Amount for all eligible Members
for the Plan Year. For this purpose the term "eligible Members" includes Members
in both the Payless ShoeSource, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and this Plan.

 16

3.05 INVESTMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION. The amounts allocated
to each Member pursuant to Section 3.03 shall be credited to his Company
Accounts and invested in one or more of the Investment Funds described in
Section 5.01 and in the percentages designated by the Member in the investment
election filed pursuant to Section 5.02 effective at the time the amount is
allocated.

 3.06 RETURN OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS.

 (a) If, after the Company Contribution has been made and
allocated, it should appear that, through oversight or a mistake of fact or law,
a Member (or an Associate who should have been considered a Member) who should
have been entitled to share in such contribution, receives no allocation or
received an allocation which was less than he should have received, the Company
may, at its election and in lieu of reallocating such contribution, make a
special make-up contribution for the Company Account of such Member in an amount
sufficient to provide for him the same addition to his Company Account as he
should have received. Similarly, if a Member received an allocation which was
more than he should have received (or a Member was inappropriately included in
the Plan), the Company, at its election, may reallocate such contribution,
offset other Company contributions against such allocation, or use such
allocation to pay Plan expenses.

 (b) To the extent permitted by ERISA, each contribution
made to the Trust shall be made on the condition that it is currently deductible
by the Employer under PR Code Section 1023(A) for the taxable year with respect
to which the contribution is made. If a contribution subsequently is determined,
whether in whole or in part, not to be currently deductible as provided in the
preceding sentence, then, within one year of the date of disallowance of the
deduction of such Company Contribution, an amount equal to the disallowed
deduction shall be returned to the Company and/or Employer, as applicable.

 (c) Earnings attributable to a contribution that is
returned pursuant to Subsection (a) or (b) above shall not be withdrawn, but
losses attributable thereto shall reduce the amount returned to the Company
and/or Employer.

SECTION 4

 MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS

set forth in the PR Code from time to time, each Member may designate, pursuant
to procedures established by the Company, and contribute to the Plan an amount
equal to not less than 1 nor more than 15 (in whole percentage points) of his
Pay as he shall have designated pursuant to procedures established by the

Highly Compensated Employees); provided, however, that a Member shall not
contribute, or elect to have contributed on his behalf, amounts with respect to
Pay received by him after the close of the calendar year during which his
employment terminated and further provided that any Before-Tax Contributions
made on behalf of the Member shall reduce by the percentage which he elects to
have contributed pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(i), the percentage of Pay that the
Member may contribute pursuant to this Section 4.01(a). Notwithstanding any
provision in the Plan to the contrary, in no event may After-Tax Contributions

 time to time by the Company which amount shall be his Before-Tax
 Contribution. The maximum Before-Tax Contribution by a Member who is
 determined to be a Highly Compensated Employee under Section 4.02, for
 the Plan Year in question, may be further restricted or limited by the
 Company or the Committee from time to time.

 (ii) Pursuant to Section 2.01(c), each eligible

portion of the Member's Before-Tax Contributions should be treated as After-Tax
Contributions in order for the Before-Tax Contribution provisions of the Plan to
quality as a "qualified cash or deferred

 18

arrangement" for purposes of Section 1165(e) of the PR Code, or if the Actual
Deferral Percentage standards set forth in the PR Code are not met at the end of
the Plan Year; then the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) may,
in accordance with Section 4.02(b) below, limit the amount which shall be
contributed by the Employer as Before-Tax Contributions after the date of such
determination on behalf of all or any portion of the Members and (ii) shall
distribute any excess Before-Tax Contributions made with respect to the Plan
Year to the affected Members as soon as practicable after the end of the Plan
Year.

 (d) The Employer shall (i) deduct a Member's After-Tax
Contributions from the Pay of the Member in such installments as the Employer

directly in cash by an amount equal to the Member's Before-Tax Contributions in
such installments as the Employer shall deem appropriate. The amounts so
deducted and so contributed shall be paid by the Employer to the Trustee not
later than 15 days following the end of the month with respect to which such
amounts are to be so deducted and contributed or within such shorter period of
time as may be designated under the Code, ERISA or related regulations. The
Employer may, from time to time, make estimated contribution payments to the
Trustee during each month.

 (e) Effective with the paycheck issued with respect to
the first payroll period beginning in any calendar month, or as of such other
effective time as may be determined by the Committee, a Member may elect to
change the rate of his After-Tax Contributions to any other rate permitted by
Subsection (a) of this Section 4.01 and may elect to change the amount to be
contributed by the Employer directly to the Trust Fund as Before-Tax
Contributions to an amount equal to an amount permitted by Subsection (b) of
this Section 4.01 with respect to such contributions to be made after the
effective date of the election, pursuant to procedures established by the
Committee.

 (f) Not later than 15 days prior to the beginning of a
payroll period of a Member, or not later than such other date as may be
determined by the Committee, such Member may elect, pursuant to procedures
established by the Committee, (i) to suspend making After-Tax Contributions and
(ii) that the Employer should suspend making Before-Tax Contributions on his
behalf, all as of the beginning of such payroll period. Not later than 15 days
prior to the beginning of a payroll period of a Member, or not later than such
other date as may be determined by the Committee, such Member may elect (i) to
resume making After-Tax Contributions and (ii) that the Employer shall resume
making Before-Tax Contributions on his behalf, by indicating any amount of
contributions permitted under Subsection (a) and designating an amount equal to
any amount of Pay as Before-Tax Contributions that is permitted under Subsection

Contributions for any calendar year shall not exceed 8,000 or 10 of the
Member's annual Pay or such other amount as may be adjusted from time to time
under applicable Puerto Rico law (the "Deferral Limit"). In addition, Before-Tax
Contributions by a Member will be further limited by contributions to an
individual retirement account as described in PR Code Section 1169. If a Member
reaches the Deferral Limit, the Committee can direct that all or any portion of
such Member's Contributions during such year shall be After-Tax Contributions
regardless of such Member's elections pursuant to Sections 4.01(a) and 4.01(b).

 (i) As of April 1, 2000, all then currently existing flat
dollar Member Contributions shall be converted to Member Contributions based on
1 increments calculated by dividing such flat dollar amount by the Member's Pay
for the prior year and rounding the product to the nearest whole percent;
provided, that no flat dollar contribution shall be converted to a percent
contribution of less than 1 .

 (j) Notwithstanding this Section 4.01, effective March
20, 2000, during the black out period as determined by the Committee and the
Trustee established to change to daily valuation or a change in recordkeepers,
no contribution rate changes or suspensions may be made by a Member except as
provided by the Committee.

 eligible Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year is not more
 than the Actual Deferral Percentage of all other eligible Associates
 multiplied by 2.0.

 (iii) To the extent permitted by the Act, the
 Actual Deferral Percentage for non-Highly Compensated Employees used in
 satisfying the tests set

 20

forth in (i) and/or (ii) above may be, for any Plan Year, the Actual
 Deferral Percentage for non-Highly Compensated Employees for the
 immediately preceding Plan Year, as determined by the Company in the
 manner permitted by law.

 For the purposes of this Section 4.02, Section 4.04 and Section 4.05,
"eligible" means eligible to be a Member of this Plan pursuant to Section
2.01(b)(1).

 For purposes of Sections 4.02, 4.04 and 4.05, the term "Highly
Compensated Employee" shall mean any employee whose Pay is greater than the Pay
of two-thirds of all eligible employees, taking into account only Pay which is
considered for the purpose of Section 4.01. To the extent permitted by the PR
Code and its regulations, the Committee may elect to include all other
non-eligible employees for the purposes of determining compliance by the Plan
with the actual deferral percentage test of PR Code Section 1165.

 For purposes of this Section 4.02, the term "Actual Deferral
Percentage" shall mean, for a specified group of Associates for a Plan Year, the
average of the ratios (calculated separately for each person in such group) of

 (i) The aggregate of the Before-Tax
 Contributions (and such other contributions which, in accordance with
 applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the PR Code, may be
 aggregated with such Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of
 demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the PR Code) which
 are actually payable to the Trust on behalf of each such Associate, to

 (ii) Such Associate's Pay for such Plan Year.

 In the event it is determined prior to any payroll period that the
amount of Before-Tax Contributions elected to be made thereafter would cause the
limitation prescribed in this Section 4.02 to be exceeded, the amount of
Before-Tax Contributions allowed to be made on behalf of Highly Compensated
Employees (and/or such other Members as the Committee may prescribe) shall be
reduced to a rate determined by the Committee, and any elections of future
Before-Tax Contributions which exceed the rate determined by the Committee shall
be deemed to be After-Tax Contributions for the remainder of the Plan Year,
notwithstanding the limitations on contribution rate changes in Section 4.01(e).
Except as is hereinafter provided, the Members to whom such reduction is
applicable and the amount of such reduction shall be determined pursuant to such
uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as the Committee shall prescribe.

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
paragraph, with respect to any Plan Year in which Before-Tax Contributions on
behalf of Highly Compensated Employees exceed the applicable limit set forth in
this Section 4.02, the Committee shall reduce the amount of the excess
Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of the Highly Compensated Employees (by
reducing such contributions in order of

 21

Actual Deferral Percentages beginning with the highest), and shall distribute
such excess Before-Tax Contributions (along with earnings attributable to such
excess Before-Tax Contributions, as determined pursuant to such rules and
regulations as shall be prescribed by the Puerto Rico Department of the
Treasury) to the affected Highly Compensated Employees as soon as practicable
after the end of such Plan Year, and in all events prior to the end of the next
following Plan Year. Any excess Before-Tax Contributions to be returned to
Highly Compensated Employees shall be calculated (i.e., reduced) and distributed
by first reducing the Before-Tax Contributions of the Highly Compensated
Employees with the largest dollar amount(s) of Before-Tax Contributions (rather
than with the highest Percentage(s) to the extent required or permitted under
the Act. In lieu of such distribution of excess Before-Tax Contributions, the
Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable rules and regulations (and
(i) except with respect to situations in which Section 4.01 (h) applies, and
(ii) prior to March 15 of the calendar year following the Plan Year in which
such contributions are made or such later date as may be permitted under the PR
Code), recharacterize as After-Tax Contributions for such Plan Year all or a
portion of the Before-Tax Contributions for Members who are Highly Compensated
Employees to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable limit set forth
in this Section 4.02.

 In lieu of either distributing or recharacterizing excess Before-Tax
Contributions, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable rules and
regulations, make a qualified nonelective contribution on behalf of non-Highly
Compensated Employees in an amount sufficient to satisfy one of the
non-discrimination tests set forth above, which Company contribution (if any)
shall be reimbursed by the Employer. Allocation of any such qualified
non-elective contribution would be to the Member Before-Tax Accounts of each
non-Highly Compensated Employee in the same proportion that such Member's
Before-Tax Contributions for the year bears to the total Member Before-Tax
Contributions for the year for all non-Highly Compensated Employees of the
Employer. However, the maximum annual addition credited to a Member's Account
shall be limited by Section 4.06.

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of Sections 4.02(c) to
the contrary, if Before-Tax Contributions on behalf of Highly Compensated
Employees in excess of the applicable limit set forth in Section 4.02 either are
distributed or are recharacterized, any Company Matching Allocation which would
have been attributable to the amounts distributed or recharacterized shall be
held unallocated in a suspense account and, as of the end of the Plan Year,
forfeited and added to and allocated with Company Contributions in the next
following Plan Year.

 22

4.03 DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXCESS DEFERRALS

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
Excess Before-Tax Deferrals (as hereinafter defined) and earnings allocable
thereto as determined pursuant to such rules and regulations as are prescribed
by the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury, may be distributed no later than
April 15 (or such later date as may be permitted under the PR Code) to Members
who claim such allocable Excess Before-Tax Amounts (which shall be the "Excess
Before-Tax Deferrals" plus earnings, if any) for the preceding calendar year.

 (b) For purposes of this Section 4.03, "Excess Before-Tax
Deferral" means the amount of Pay which a Member has elected to have the
Employer contribute to the Trust rather than receive it in cash, which is a
Member Contribution under Section 4.01 for a calendar year that the Member
allocates to this Plan pursuant to the claim procedure set forth in subsection
4.03(c) hereof.

 (c) The Member's claim shall be in writing; shall be
submitted to the Committee no later than March 1 (or such other date as the
Committee may specify); shall specify the amount of the Member's Excess
Before-Tax Deferral for the preceding calendar year; and shall be accompanied by
the Member's written statement that if such amounts are not distributed, the
Excess Before-Tax Deferrals, when added to amounts deferred under other plans or
arrangements described in PR Code Section 1165(e) exceeds the limit imposed on
the Member in accordance with the applicable provisions of the PR Code for the
year in which the deferral occurred.

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of Sections 3 or 4 to
the contrary, any Company Matching Allocation which would have been attributable
to an Excess Before-Tax Deferral distributed to a Member under Section 4.02(a)
shall not be retained or distributed (unless and to the extent permitted under
the PR Code and so determined by the Company in a uniform, nondiscriminatory
manner), but shall be held unallocated in a suspense account and, as of the end
of the Plan Year, forfeited and added to and allocated with Company
Contributions in the next following Plan Year.

 4.04 LIMITATIONS ON AFTER-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 4, the Company or the Committee, in their
respective discretion, may limit the amount of After-Tax Contributions made by
or on behalf of each eligible Member to the extent determined appropriate.

 4.05 LIMITATIONS ON COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.02 or this Section 4, the Company or the
Committee, in their respective discretion, may limit the amount of Company
Matching Contributions allocated on behalf of each eligible Member to the extent
determined appropriate.

 23

4.06 AGGREGATE LIMITATIONS. To the extent required under the PR
Code or as so determined by the Company or the Committee, in their respective
discretion, Company Matching Contributions and Member After-Tax Contributions
may be aggregated on a Member by Member basis and limited, as determined
appropriate.

 SECTION 5

 INVESTMENT PROVISIONS

 5.01 INVESTMENT FUNDS.

 (a) There shall be established as part of the Trust Fund
a reasonable range of investment options. The Committee may from time to time,
in its discretion, change, delete or add Investment Funds available within the
Trust Fund; provided that unless and until the Plan is amended accordingly, the
Plan shall provide a Payless Common Stock Fund as an investment option.

 (b) Income from and proceeds of sales of investments in
each Investment Fund shall be reinvested in the same Investment Fund. Any income
or other taxes payable with respect to a Fund shall be charged to such Fund.

 (c) A Trustee may, from time to time, make temporary
investments in short term obligations of the United States Government,
commercial paper, or other investments of a short term nature, pending
investment in an Investment Fund.

 5.02 INVESTMENT DIRECTION.

 (a) A Member may elect that his Member Contributions for
each Payroll period be invested in 1 increments totaling 100 in one or more of
the Investment Funds. Such election must be made pursuant to procedures
prescribed by the Committee. Such election shall be effective until and unless a
Member makes a different election for any period, but only as provided for under
Subsection 5.02(b) and Subsection 5.02(c). If the Member fails to file a timely
initial investment election, he shall be deemed to have elected to have 100 of
his Member Contributions and his Company Profit Sharing Contributions invested
in the stable, fixed income investment as may be determined by the Committee and
100 of his Company Matching Contributions in the Payless Common Stock Fund.
Until such time as the Committee determines otherwise and so notifies Members, a
Member's share of any Company Contributions, when allocated as of Plan Year-end,
shall be invested in the same Investment Funds in the same proportions as the
Member has elected in connection with investment of his Member Contributions at
the time the amount is allocated.

 (b) A Member may change his election with respect to
future Member and Company Contributions effective pursuant to procedures
prescribed by the

 24

Committee, and may not change his election in any other manner except as
provided in Subsection 5.02(c).

 (c) Effective as of the date determined by the Committee
and pursuant to procedures prescribed by the Committee, a Member may elect to
have any or all of the value in any of the Investment Funds which are credited
to his Member and/or Company Accounts transferred and invested in any one or
more of the Investment Funds.

 (d) Notwithstanding this Section 5.02, effective March
20, 2000, during the black out period as determined by the Committee and the
Trustee established to change to daily valuation or a change in recordkeepers,
no investment transfers or changes may be made by a Member unless provided in
Section 6.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no loans, withdrawals or
distributions shall be made during any such blackout period except as provided
by the Committee.

 SECTION 6

 ACCOUNTS

 6.01 MEMBER ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain or cause to be
maintained for each Member under each Investment Fund in which his Member
Contributions are invested separate Member Accounts which shall reflect the
portion of his interest in such Investment Fund which is attributable to his
contributions. The Member's After-Tax Contributions shall be credited to a
separate Member After-Tax Account. The Member's Before-Tax Contributions shall
be credited to a separate Member Before-Tax Account. The Member's or Associate's
Rollover Contribution shall be credited to a separate Member Rollover
Contribution Account.

 6.02 COMPANY ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain or cause to be
maintained for each Member under each Investment Fund in which his Company
Contributions are invested separate Company Accounts which shall reflect the
portion of his interest in such Investment Fund which is attributable to Company

and to any income or earnings attributable to such Company Contributions and
Prior Plan contributions. The Member's Company Matching Contributions shall be
credited to a separate Company Matching Contribution Account. The Member's
Company Profit Sharing Contribution, if any, shall be credited to a separate

 6.03 MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS. For the purposes of maintaining
Accounts pursuant to this Section 6, each Investment Fund, shall be divided into
Units, and the Interest of each Member in such Investment Fund shall be
evidenced by the number of Units in such Investment Fund credited to his
Accounts.

 25

6.04 VALUATION OF ACCOUNTS. As of each Valuation Date the Committee
shall determine the value of a Unit in each Account by dividing the current
market value of all property in each such Account as of such Valuation Date
(after deducting any expenses or other amounts including withdrawals property
chargeable against such Account) by the number of Units then outstanding to the
credit of all Members in each such Account.

 6.05 MEMBER STATEMENTS. The Committee shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each Member a statement of his Company and Member Accounts, at
least once each year, or more frequently if required by applicable law.

 6.06 SHARES OF PAYLESS SHOESOURCE, INC. ("PAYLESS STOCK") IN THE
PAYLESS COMMON STOCK FUND.

 (a) Each Member (or beneficiary of a deceased Member) who
has Accounts invested in the Payless Common Stock Fund shall, as a named
fiduciary within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of ERISA, have the right to
direct the Trustee with respect to the vote of the number of shares of Payless
Stock attributable to Units credited to him in the Payless Common Stock Fund as
of the latest practicable Valuation Date prior to or contemporaneous with the
record date set by the Company for each meeting of shareowners of the Company.
For such purpose the Trustee shall furnish to each such Member prior to each
such meeting the proxy statement for such meeting, together with a form to be
returned to the Trustee on which may be set forth the Member's instructions as
to the manner of voting such shares of stock. Upon receipt of such instructions,
the Trustee shall vote such shares in accordance therewith. If Member's
instructions are not received by the Trustee in a timely manner, the Trustee
shall vote such Member's shares in the same proportion as the shares of Common
Stock for which instructions were actually received from Members. The Trustee
shall not divulge the instructions of any Member.

 (b) Each Member (or beneficiary of a deceased Member) who
has Accounts invested in the Payless Common Stock Fund shall, as a named
fiduciary within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of ERISA, have the right with
respect to the number of shares of Payless Stock attributable to Units credited
to him in the Payless Common Stock Fund as of the latest practicable Valuation
Date, to direct the Trustee in writing as to the manner in which to respond to a
tender or exchange offer with respect to Payless Stock, and the Trustee shall
respond in accordance with the instructions so received. The Trustee shall
utilize its best efforts to timely distribute or cause to be distributed to each
Member such information as will be distributed to shareowners of the Company in
connection with any such tender or exchange offer, together with a form
requesting instructions on whether or not such shares will be tendered or

proceeds

 26

from the tender or exchange of shares attributable to Units in Payless Common
Stock Investment Fund accounts of Members shall be transferred to one of the
Investment Funds described in Section 5.01 and pursuant to a procedure
established by the Committee.

 6.07 VESTING IN MEMBER AND COMPANY ACCOUNTS

 (a) VESTING SCHEDULE. A Member shall have a fully vested
interest at all times (i) in his Member Accounts and (ii) in his Company Profit
Sharing Contribution Account balance determined as of July 31, 1997. A Member
who has completed at least two full Years of Service as of August 1, 1997 also
shall be fully vested at all times (i) in his Company Matching Contributions
Account and (ii) in his Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account determined
at any time after July 31, 1997. The Company Matching Contribution Account of a
Member who is not or was not credited with at least two Years of Service as of
August 1, 1997 and his Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account attributable
to Company Profit Sharing Contributions, if any, based on such Member's
eligibility for such contributions after August 1, 1997, shall vest according to
the following schedule:

Vesting Service Vested Interest
 --------------- ---------------
 
Fewer than 2 years 0 

 2 years 25 

 3 years 50 

 4 years 75 

 5 years or more 100 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Member's interest in his Company Matching
Contribution Account and his Company Profit Sharing Contribution Account shall
become fully vested upon the Member's Retirement, death or Disability.

 (b) CASH-OUT DISTRIBUTIONS TO PARTIALLY VESTED MEMBERS
AND RESTORATION OF FORFEITURES. If, pursuant to Section 10.01, a
partially-vested Member receives a cash-out distribution before he incurs a
Forfeiture Break in Service (as defined in Subsection (e) below), the cash-out
distribution will result in an immediate forfeiture of the nonvested portion(s)
of the Member's Company Matching and Company Profit Sharing Contribution
Account(s). See Subsection (e) below. A partially-vested Member is a Member
whose Vested Interest, determined under Section 6.07(a), in either his Company
Matching Contribution Account or his Company Profit Sharing Contribution
Account, or both, is less than 100 . A cash-out distribution is a distribution
of the entire vested portion of the Member's Account(s).

 27

(i) A partially-vested Member who is reemployed
 by an Employer after receiving a cash-out distribution of the vested
 portion of his Account(s) shall have such forfeited amount restored,
 unless the Member no longer has a right to restoration under this
 subparagraph (i). The amount restored by the Plan Administrator shall
 be the same dollar amount as the dollar amount of his Account(s) on the
 Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of the cash-out
 distribution, unadjusted for any gains or losses occurring subsequent
 to that Valuation Date but reduced by the amount of the prior cash-out
 distribution. Restoration of the Member's Account balance(s) includes
 restoration of all US Code Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits with
 respect to the restored Account(s) in accordance with applicable
 Treasury regulations. The Plan Administrator will not restore a
 reemployed Member's Account balance(s) under this subparagraph (i) if
 the Member has incurred a Forfeiture Break in Service (as defined in
 Subsection (d) below).

 (ii) If restoration of the Member's Account(s) is
 permitted under subparagraph (i) above, the Plan Administrator will
 restore the Member's Account(s) as of the last day of the Plan Year
 during which such Member was reemployed by an Employer. To restore the
 Member's Account(s), the Plan Administrator, to the extent necessary,
 will allocate to the Member's Account(s):

 (A) first, the amount, if any, of
 Member forfeitures otherwise available for allocation under
 Subsection (e) below;

 (B) second, deductible Employer
 contributions for the Plan Year to the extent made under a
 discretionary formula; and

 (C) third, as otherwise permitted by
 law.

 The Plan Administrator will not take into account any allocation under
 this subsection (b) in applying the limitation on allocations under
 Section 13.

 (iii) The deemed cash-out rule applies to a 0 
 vested Member. A 0 vested Member is a Member whose Account(s) derived
 from Employer contributions is (are) entirely forfeitable at the time
 of his termination of employment. Under the deemed cash-out rule, the
 Plan Administrator will treat the 0 vested Member as having received a
 cash-out distribution on the date of the Member's termination of
 employment or, if the Member's Account(s) is (are) entitled to an
 allocation of Employer contributions for the Plan Year in which he
 terminates employment, on the last day of that Plan Year.

 (c) DETERMINATION OF VESTING SERVICE. For purposes of
determining a Member's Vested Interest in his Company Contributions Account(s)
under subsection (a) above, a Member shall be credited with that number of years
of Vesting Service

 28

determined by adding together all of the Associate's Periods of Service, whether
or not consecutive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vesting Service shall not
include any Period of Service before the Plan Year in which an Associate attains
age eighteen (18). Only whole years of service shall be taken into account for
purposes of applying the schedule set forth in subsection (a) above, and, for
purposes of determining a Member's number of whole years of service,
non-successive Periods of Service must be aggregated, with 365 days of service
being deemed to constitute one year. For purposes of determining a Member's
Period of Service, the Service Spanning rules described in Section 1.52(g) shall
apply.

 (d) FORFEITURE BREAK IN SERVICE. For purposes of this
Section 6.07, a "Break in Service" is a Period of Severance of at least 365
consecutive days. A "Forfeiture Break in Service" occurs when a Member of former
Member incurs 5 consecutive Breaks in Service.

 (e) FORFEITURE OCCURS. A Member's forfeiture, if any, of
his Account balance(s) derived from Company contributions occurs under the Plan
on the earlier of:

 (i) the last day of the last pay period ending
 within the Plan Year in which the Member first incurs a Forfeiture
 Break in Service; or

 (ii) the date the Member receives a cash-out
 distribution.

 The Plan Administrator shall determine the percentage of a Member's
Account(s) forfeiture, if any, under this Subsection (e) solely by reference to
the vesting schedule of Section 6.07(a). As of the last day of each Plan Year,
the total amount of forfeitures which occurred during such Plan Year shall be
calculated and such amount shall be applied (i) to restore under (b) above any
amounts previously forfeited from rehired Members' Accounts and (ii) the
balance, if any, shall be added to and allocated with the Company Matching
Contribution for that Plan Year.

 (f) FORMER MAY PLAN MEMBERS. The provisions of this
 subsection (g) apply to a Member who previously was employed by the
 Employer, when it was part of the Group which included The May
 Department Stores Company, and who at the termination of his employment
 had Company Accounts in the May Plan which were forfeited as a result
 of termination of employment. If such Member has not incurred five
 consecutive one-year Breaks in Service as defined in Section 6.07(d),
 the value of the Member's Company Account forfeited under the May Plan
 will be restored under this Plan (in the manner described in Subsection
 (b) above) and will be 100 vested.

 29

SECTION 7

 EXPENSES

 7.01 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the costs and expenses for administering this Plan, consisting of Trustee
fees and expenses, Investment Manager fees and expenses, fees and expenses of
outside experts, expenses of maintaining records under Section 6 of the Plan,
and all other administrative expenses of the Plan, shall be paid out of the
Trust Fund unless the Company or the Employer elects to pay them with its own
funds. Costs incident to the purchase and sale of securities, such as brokerage
fees, commissions and stock transfer fees, are not regarded as administrative
expenses and shall be borne by the appropriate Investment Fund as determined by
the Trustee or Committee.

 SECTION 8

 WITHDRAWALS DURING EMPLOYMENT

 8.01 WITHDRAWALS PROHIBITED UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED. No
withdrawal from the Plan shall be permitted prior to a Member's termination of
employment, except as provided in Section 8.02.

 8.02 AUTHORIZED WITHDRAWALS.

 (a) Prior to his termination of employment, a Member may
elect to withdraw, in cash, any or all of the value in his Member After-Tax
Accounts. However, in the event a Member elects to withdraw all or a portion of
his After-Tax Contributions made after August 1, 1997, such Member shall forfeit
his right to fifty percent (50 of the Company Matching Contribution, if any,
otherwise allocable in connection with his Member Contributions for the Plan
Year in which the withdrawal occurs.

 (b) Prior to his termination of employment, a Member may
elect to withdraw, in the event of a "hardship", an amount in cash equal to (i)
the total amount of the Before-Tax Contributions made to the Trust on his
behalf, or (ii) the value in his Member Before-Tax Account whichever is less
provided, however, that no withdrawal will be permitted to the extent that loans
from the Plan are available to the Member. In any event the amount withdrawn may
not be greater than the amount determined by the Committee as being required to
meet the immediate financial need created by the "hardship" and not reasonably
available from other resources of the Member, whichever amount is less. The term
"hardship" means a heavy financial hardship in light of immediate and heavy
financial needs as determined by the Committee in accordance with the PR Code
regulations. The amount of an immediate and heavy financial need may include any
amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local taxes or penalties

 30

reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution. The determination shall
be made in a nondiscriminatory manner. Hardship shall include but not be limited
to the following:

 (i) Medical expenses described in PR Code
 Section 1023(aa)(2)(P), previously incurred by the Member, the Member's
 spouse, or any of the Member's dependents (as defined in PR Code
 Section 1025);

 (ii) Purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a
 principal residence for the Member;

 (iii) Payment of tuition, related educational
 fees, and room and board expenses for the next 12 months of
 post-secondary education for the Member, his or her spouse, children,
 or dependents (as defined in PR Code Section 1025);

 (iv) The need to prevent the eviction of the
 Member from his or her principal residence or foreclosure on the
 mortgage of the Member's principal residence.

The Committee may adopt written guidelines which identify additional
circumstances constituting hardship and which provide procedures to be followed
in the administration of hardship withdrawal requests, which guidelines are
hereby incorporated herein.

 In addition, such hardship must be one which in the judgment of the
Committee, based on the Member's representations, cannot be relieved (1) through
reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (2) by reasonable
liquidation of the Member's assets to the extent such liquidation would not
itself cause an immediate and heavy financial need, (3) by cessation of Member
Contributions under the Plan or (4) by other distributions from employee benefit
plans maintained by the Company or any other employer or by borrowing from
commercial sources on reasonable commercial terms. The Member shall be required
to submit documentation, to be determined by the Committee, with his hardship
withdrawal request to enable the Committee to make a judgment regarding the
validity of such hardship withdrawal request. For any Member who has attained
age 59 1/2, the "hardship" requirement shall be deemed waived.

 (c) A Member who was a Participant in or eligible to be a
Participant in the Volume Shoe Corporation Profit Sharing Plan (the "Volume
Plan") as of December 31, 1988 and who had an account balance in the Volume Plan
attributable to Employer Contributions made to the Volume Plan before July 31,
1976 and which account became a Company Account under The May Department Stores
Company Profit Sharing Plan and which has been transferred to this Plan, shall
be entitled to withdraw the market value of such account balance determined (and
frozen) as of December 31, 1988.

 31

(d) Associates with Member Rollover Contribution Accounts
may elect to withdraw their Member Rollover Contribution Accounts prior to
termination of employment.

 (e) A withdrawal election shall be made pursuant to
application procedures established by the Committee. Contribution totals and
Account values shall be determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or
next following the filing of the withdrawal election. If the Member Accounts
from which withdrawal is made are in more than one Investment Fund, the
withdrawal shall be pro rata from each such Investment Fund except in the case
the Member is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or
has been designated as a "Designated Insider," in which case such Member's
withdrawal will be taken first from such Member's Investment Funds other than
the Payless Common Stock Fund.

 SECTION 9

 BENEFITS UPON RETIREMENT, DEATH, DISABILITY, OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

 9.01 BENEFITS. Upon a Member's Retirement, Death, Disability, or
other termination of employment, the value of his Member Accounts and of his
vested Company Accounts shall be determined as of the Valuation Date prior to
the date the distribution is calculated. A temporary Authorized Leave of Absence
for Military Service or for other purposes approved by the Company and/or the
Employer shall not, while any such Authorized Leave of Absence is validly in
effect be regarded as a termination of employment.

 9.02 BENEFICIARY. Any benefits payable on account of a Member's
death shall be paid to such Member's spouse. If such Member has no spouse or if
such Member's spouse shall have consented to the naming of another beneficiary,
such benefits shall be paid to the person or persons (including, without
limitation, estates, trust, or other entities) last named as beneficiary by such
Member on an appropriate form filed with the Committee. A spouse's consent shall
acknowledge the effect of the consent and be in writing, witnessed by a Plan
representative or notary public. A spouse's consent shall be irrevocable. If no
beneficiary has been so named or the named beneficiary does not survive the
Member, any payment to be made under this Plan on account of a Member's death
shall be paid to such Member's spouse, or, if he has no spouse, to such Member's
estate. Whenever permitted by ERISA or regulations thereunder, the Committee may
waive the requirements that a spouse's consent be obtained. Such waiver may be
on a case by case basis or by categories.

 SECTION 10

 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

 32

10.01 TIME OF PAYMENT.

 (a) All amounts distributable to a Member or Beneficiary
pursuant to Section 9 shall, unless the Member makes an approved election
pursuant to Section 10.01 (b) or 10.01 (c), be paid in a lump sum payment to be
made as soon as practicable after the request is received, provided however,
that any additional amounts which may be allocated to a Member's Company
Accounts resulting from a Company Contribution in respect of the calendar year
in which employment terminates shall be paid as soon as practicable after such
contribution.

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10 to the contrary, if
the present value of the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of a Member, including
Company and Member Contributions (but excluding accumulated deductible employee
contribution, if any) exceeds (or for distributions prior to March 22, 1999,
ever has exceeded) 5,000, no partial or total distribution shall be made unless
the Member has consented thereto in writing in the manner required by law.

 (b) Any Member who was a Member of the May Plan as of
June 30, 1990 may elect that all Transferred Accounts distributable to him
pursuant to Section 9 shall be paid in annual installments over a period not to
exceed ten years beginning with the Valuation Date as of which the lump sum
payment would otherwise be made. In the event of the death of a Member prior to
the expiration of such period, all amounts which have not been distributed to
him shall be paid in a lump sum to his designated Beneficiary or his estate if
there is no designated Beneficiary. Subject to the foregoing, each such
installment shall be paid as of a Valuation Date and, until all the Accounts of
the Member have been fully distributed, they shall continue to be revalued as of
each succeeding Valuation Date pursuant to Section 6.04.

 Notwithstanding the paragraph above, any Member who as of December 31,
1988 was or was entitled to be a Participant in the Volume Shoe Corporation
Profit Sharing Plan may elect that all Transferred Accounts distributable to him
pursuant to Section 9 be paid in the form of equal monthly installments over a
period not to exceed 120 months. Such payments shall otherwise be made in
accordance with the foregoing portion of this Subsection 10.01 (b).

 (c) A Member who is entitled to receive a distribution in
excess of 5,000 may elect to defer such distribution to the required minimum
distribution age, as determined by law from time to time. An election to defer
distribution shall conform to such requirements as to form, content, manner, and
timing as shall be determined by the Committee and which requirements shall be
applied in a manner which does not discriminate in favor of Members who are
highly compensated employees (within the meaning of Code Section 414(q)). All
Accounts of a Member who elects to defer his distribution shall continue to be
revalued as of each succeeding Valuation Date pursuant to

 33

Section 6.04. A deferred distribution shall be paid when such Member attains the
required minimum distribution age or at such earlier or later time as shall be
determined by the Committee as permitted by law. In the event of the death of a
Member prior to distribution of the deferred amounts, all amounts shall be
distributed in a lump sum to his designated Beneficiary or to his estate if
there is no designated Beneficiary. The value for payment shall be determined as
of the Valuation Date coincident with or next following such Member's birthday
coincident with the Member's required minimum distribution age or such other
payment date determined by the Committee.

 10.02 FORM OF PAYMENT. All distributions shall be made in the form
of cash, except that distributions from the Payless Common Stock Fund shall be
made in the form of full shares of Payless Common Stock, as applicable (with
payment in cash for a fraction of a share) or in cash if elected by the Member
or Beneficiary. The rights extended to a Member hereunder shall also apply to
any Beneficiary or alternate payee of such Member.

 10.03 INDIRECT PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. If any Member or Beneficiary has
been adjudged to be legally, physically or mentally incapable or incompetent,
payment may be made to the legal guardian or other legal representative of such
Member or Beneficiary as determined by the Committee. Such payments shall
constitute a full discharge with respect thereto.

 10.04 INABILITY TO FIND MEMBER. If a Member or Beneficiary or other
person to whom a benefit payment is due cannot be found during the three years
subsequent to the date a distribution was required to be made under this Plan,
the Accounts shall be forfeited at the end of such three-year period. The value
of such Accounts as of the date the distribution was required to be made shall
be restored if such Member or Beneficiary or other person makes a claim.

 10.05 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBER. In accordance
with US Code Section 401 (a)(9) and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
distributions to a Member must commence not later than the first day of April
following the calendar year in which the Member attains age 70 1/2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, distribution to a Member who is not a "five
percent owner" as defined in Section 20.10(f)(3) shall commence not later than
April 1 following the calendar year in which the Member attains age 70 1/2 or,
if later, the calendar year in which the Member retires.

 10.06 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARY.
Distributions to the Beneficiary entitled under Section 10.02 to receive any
payments payable under this Plan on account of a Member's death shall be made in
a lump sum payment not later than December 31 of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the Member died.

 10.07 COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTION TO ALTERNATE PAYEE.
Distributions to an alternate payee entitled under Section 16.01 to receive any
payments payable under this Plan pursuant to the terms of a Qualified Domestic
Relations Order

 34

shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Qualified Domestic Relations
Order and this Plan on or after the date on which the Member has attained his
"earliest retirement age" (as defined under ERISA Section 206(d)(3)) under the
Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distribution to an alternate payee may be
made prior to the Member's attainment of his earliest retirement age if, but
only if: (1) the Qualified Domestic Relations Order specifies distribution at
that time or permits an agreement between the Plan and the alternate payee to
authorize an earlier distribution; (2) the distribution is a single sum
distribution of the alternate payee's entire benefit entitlement under the Plan;
and (3) in the event the present value of the alternate payee's benefits under
the Plan exceeds 5,000, the alternate payee consents to any distribution
occurring prior to the Member's attainment of earliest retirement age.

 Nothing in this Section 10.07 shall be construed to permit a Member to
(1) receive a distribution at a time not otherwise permitted under the Plan, (2)
permit the alternate payee to receive a form of payment not otherwise permitted
under the Plan, or (3) cause his Plan accounts to be valued or otherwise
determined in a manner not otherwise permitted under the Plan.

 SECTION 11

 PERMITTED ROLLOVER OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS

 11.01 ROLLOVER AMOUNT TO OTHER PLANS. Notwithstanding any provision
of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election
under this Section, a distributee may elect, at the time and pursuant to
procedures prescribed by the Committee, to have his entire Plan distribution
paid directly to a qualified retirement plan described in the PR Code Section
1165(a) or to an individual retirement account as described in PR Code Section
1165(b)(2) specified by him.

 11.02 ROLLOVER AMOUNT FROM OTHER PLANS. An Associate eligible to
participate in the Plan, regardless of whether he has satisfied the
participation requirements of Section 2.01, may transfer to the Plan an Eligible
Rollover Distribution provided that such distribution is from an Eligible
Retirement Plan. If such transfer is not a direct transfer, such a transfer may
be made only if the following conditions are met:

 (a) the transfer occurs on or before the 60th day
following the Associate's receipt of the distribution from the Eligible
Retirement Plan; and

 (b) the amount transferred is equal to any portion of the
distribution the Associate received from the Eligible Retirement Plan, not in
excess of the fair market value of all property received in such a distribution
reduced by employee contributions, as defined in US Code Section 402 (a)(5)(E).

 35

The Committee shall develop such procedures, and may require such information,
from a Member desiring to make such a transfer, as it deems necessary or
desirable to determine that the proposed transfer will meet the requirements of
the Section. Upon approval by the Committee or its Administrative Delegate, the
amount transferred shall be deposited in the Trust Fund and shall be credited to
the Member's account. Such rollover amount shall be one hundred percent (100 vested in the Member, shall share in the income allocations in accordance with
Section 5, but shall not share in the Company Profit Sharing Contributions, the
Company Matching Contributions or the forfeiture allocations. Upon termination
of employment, the total amount of the rollover contribution shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

Upon such a transfer by an Associate who is otherwise eligible to participate in
the Plan but who has not yet completed the participation requirements of Section
2.01, his rollover amount shall represent his sole interest in the Plan until he
becomes a Member.

 11.03 DEFINITIONS. The following definitions shall apply for the
purposes of this Section 11:

 (a) ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION. An eligible rollover
 distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance
 of the credit of the distributee as defined in Code Section 402(c),
 except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
 distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic
 payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
 expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
 expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's beneficiary or
 for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the
 extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); and
 the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income
 (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
 appreciation with respect to employer securities).

 (b) ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible retirement plan is an
 individual retirement account described in Code Section 408, an
 individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 401(b), an
 annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified trust
 described in Code Section 401(a), which accepts or will make, as
 applicable, an Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case of
 an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a Member's surviving spouse, an
 eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or
 individual retirement annuity.

 (c) DISTRIBUTEE. A distributee includes a Member or former Member.
 In addition, the Member or former Member's surviving spouse and the
 Member's or former Member's spouse or former spouse who is the
 alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined
 in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of
 the spouse or former spouse.

 36

the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee as described in US
Code Section 401(a)(31).

level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not extending
beyond five years from the date of the loan. If such loan is used to acquire a
dwelling unit which within a reasonable time (determined at the time the loan is
made) will be used as the principal residence of the Member, the repayment
period shall not extend beyond twenty nine and one-half years from the date of
the loan. An assignment or pledge of any portion of the Member's interest in the

ShoeSource, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, such minimum amount limitation
shall not apply.

 (e) In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and
attachment of security will not occur until a distributable event occurs in the

 SECTION 13

 LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN

 This Section 13 is intended to conform the Plan to the requirements of
US Code Section 415 and limits the contributions that can be made by and for an
individual under the Plan.

 13.01 LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary:

 (a) The amounts allocated to a Participant during the Limitation
 Year under the Plan and allocated to the Participant under any other

 of:

 38

(1) 30,000; or

 (2) 25 of the Participant's remuneration from the
 Employer or any member of the Group during the Limitation Year; or

 (3) such other limits set forth in US Code Section 415.

 The amount set forth in subparagraph (1) above shall automatically be
 adjusted to reflect adjustments made by applicable law. Remuneration
 for purposes of this Section means remuneration as defined in US
 Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-2(d) and shall also include the

 employee pension plan which are excludible from gross income under US
 Code Section 408(k)(6)) and forfeitures.

 13.02 ADJUSTMENT FOR EXCESSIVE ANNUAL ADDITIONS

 (a) If, as a result of the allocation of forfeitures, a
reasonable error in estimating a Member's Pay or other facts and circumstances
to which US Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-6(b)(6) shall be applicable, the
"annual additions" under this Plan would cause the maximum "annual additions" to
be exceeded for any Member, the Committee shall (1) return any Member
Contributions credited for the "limitation year" to the extent that the return
would reduce the "excess amount" in the Member's Accounts, (2) hold any "excess
amount" remaining after the return of any Member Contributions in a "Section 415
suspense account", (3) use the "Section 415 suspense account" in the next
"limitation year" (and succeeding "limitation years" if necessary) to reduce
either Company Contributions for that Member if that Member is covered by the
Plan as of the end of the "limitation year" or if such Member is not covered by
the Plan at the end of the "limitation year" to reduce Company Contributions for
all Members in the Plan, before any Company Contributions or Member
Contributions which would constitute "annual additions" are made to the Plan for
such "limitation year," (4) reduce Company Contributions for such "limitation
year" by the amount of the "Section 415 suspense account" allocated and
reallocated during such "limitation year." For purposes of (3) above, the Plan
may not distribute "excess amounts" to Members or former Members.

Member for a "limitation year" shall mean the excess, if any, of (1) the "annual

without regard to the limitations of US Code Section 415 over (2) the maximum
"annual additions" determined pursuant to Section 13.01(a).

 (c) For purposes of this Section, "SECTION 415 SUSPENSE
ACCOUNT" shall mean an unallocated account equal to the sum of "excess amount"
for all Members in the Plan during the "limitation year." The "Section 415
suspense account" shall not share in any earnings or losses of the Trust Fund.

under this Plan and administrative expenses of this Plan.

 15.02 TRUSTEES. The Trust Fund may, at the direction of the Company,
be divided into one or more separate trusts, each of which may have a separate
Trustee appointed from time to time by the Company and subject to removal by the

Any or all of such separate trusts shall be referred to collectively from time
to time as the Trust Fund. Any division of the Trust Fund into one or more
separate trusts shall be at the direction of the Company.

exercisable by such Investment Manager.

 (c) In the event that the assets of the Trust Fund shall

Beneficiaries, and all persons claiming under or through them, shall have
recourse only to the Trust Fund for payment of any benefit hereunder.

 43

(b) The rights of the Members, their Beneficiaries and
other persons are hereby expressly limited and shall be only in accordance with
the provisions of the Plan. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give a
Member any interest in any specific property of the Trust or any interest other
than a right to receive payments pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.

 16.02 EMPLOYER-ASSOCIATE RELATIONSHIP. Neither the establishment of
this Plan nor its communication through a Summary Plan Description (or
otherwise) shall be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any
Associate or any other person to continue in employment or as interfering with
or affecting in any manner the right of the Company or the Employer to discharge
any Associate or otherwise act with relation to him. The Company and the
Employer may take any action (including discharge) with respect to any Associate
or other person and may treat him without regard to the effect which such action
or treatment might have upon him as a Member of this Plan.

 16.03 BINDING EFFECT. Each Member, by executing an enrollment form,
beneficiary designation and otherwise agreeing to participate in the Plan agrees
for himself, his beneficiary(ies), heirs, successors and assigns to be bound by

a written decision on the claim, unless an additional 90 days is required by
special circumstances which shall be explained to the claimant. If the claim is
denied, either in whole or in part, the decision shall include the reason or
reasons for the denial; a specific reference to the Plan provision or provisions
which are the basis for the denial; a description of any additional material or

to why the information or material is necessary; and an explanation of the
Plan's entire claim procedure. The claimant may file with the Committee, within
60 days after receiving the written decision from the Committee, a written
notice of request for review of the Committee's decision. The review shall be
made by a committee of up to three individuals (which may include members of the
Committee) appointed by the Company or by the Committee. Said committee shall
render a written decision on the claim containing the specific reasons for their
decision, including a reference to the Plan's provisions, normally within 60
days after receipt of the request for review, unless an additional 60 days is
required by special circumstances which shall be explained to the claimant. If a
Member or beneficiary does not file written notice of a claim with the Committee
or its designee at the times set forth above, he shall have waived any right to
a benefit other than as originally proposed by the Company or the Committee.

SECTION 17

 NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

 17.01 PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASSIGNMENT AND LEVY. No benefit
payable under this Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, levy or charge, and
any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, encumber, levy
upon or charge the same shall be void; nor shall any such benefit be in any
manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements
or torts of the person entitled to such benefit, except as specifically provided
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the creation, assignment, or recognition
of a right to any benefit payable to an alternate payee with respect to a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order shall not be treated as an assignment or
alienation prohibited by this Section. Any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary notwithstanding, if a Qualified Domestic Relations order requires the
distribution of all or part of a Member's benefits under the Plan, the
establishment or acknowledgment of the alternate payee's right to benefits under
the Plan in accordance with the terms of such Qualified Domestic Relations Order
shall in all events be deemed to be consistent with the terms of the Plan.

 Notwithstanding the above a Member's benefit will be offset
against any amount he or she is ordered or required to pay to the Plan pursuant
to an order or requirement which arises under a judgment of conviction for a
crime involving the Plan, under a civil judgment entered by a court in an action
involving a fiduciary breach, or pursuant to a settlement agreement between the
Participant and the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation. Any such offset shall be made pursuant to Section 206(d) of ERISA.

 17.02 ALTERNATE APPLICATION. If a Member or Beneficiary under this
Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer,
assign, pledge, encumber or charge any benefit under this Plan, except as
specifically provided herein, or if any benefit shall, in the discretion of the
Committee, cease, and in that event the Committee may hold or apply the same or
any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Member or Beneficiary, his
spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, or in such other manner
and in such proportion as the Committee may deem proper.

 SECTION 18

no such alteration, amendment or modification shall be made which shall decrease
the accrued benefit of any Member. Anything in this Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company in its sole discretion

 45

used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of
Members and their Beneficiaries under this Plan and administrative expenses of
this Plan.

 SECTION 19

 TERMINATION

 19.01 RIGHT TO TERMINATE. The Company reserves the right to

by the withdrawing Employer pursuant to a plan substantially similar to this
Plan assets equal in value to the assets of the Trust Fund allocable to the
Accounts of the Members of the withdrawing Employer.

merger, consolidation or transfer (if the transferee plan then terminated) which
is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive
immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan had then
terminated).

 SECTION 20

 CONSTRUCTION

 20.01 APPLICABLE LAW. The provisions of this Plan except as
otherwise governed by ERISA shall be construed, regulated, administered and

 EX-13.1 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

EXHIBIT 13.1

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

During March 2003, the Company completed a three-for-one stock split effected in
the form of a dividend. All references to the number of shares and per share
amounts of common stock have been restated to reflect the stock split.

SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Sales for the Company decreased to 2.88 billion in
fiscal 2002 from 2.91 billion in 2001, a decrease of 1.2 percent. Same-store
sales for fiscal 2002 decreased 3.2 percent. Diluted earnings per share for 2002
increased to 1.55 from 0.67 last year. Operating profit for 2002 increased to
 178.1 million from 99.9 million in 2001. Net earnings totaled 105.8 million
compared with 45.4 million in 2001. Return on sales was 3.7 percent in 2002, up
from 1.6 percent in 2001; return on equity was 22.6 percent in 2002 compared
with 11.1 percent in 2001; and return on net assets increased to 14.2 percent in
2002 from 10.9 percent in 2001.

EXPANSION During 2002, the Company had a net increase of 28 stores (232 openings
and 204 closings). Year-end 2002 store count was 4,992 stores. Included in the
2002 store openings were 55 new stores in Central America and the Caribbean,
which are operated under a joint-venture agreement, bringing total store count
in this region to 121. The Company intends to open approximately 25 to 30
additional stores in this region during 2003. Management believes this region
represents an opportunity to open a total of 150 to 200 stores.

 In addition, during 2002, the Company opened its first stores in South
America under a joint-venture agreement. The Company opened 42 stores in the
countries of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. The Company intends to open approximately
10 to 15 additional stores in this region during 2003. Management believes this
region represents an opportunity to open approximately 300 stores.

 The Company's expansion plans for fiscal year 2003 include a net increase of
approximately 50 to 60 stores. This includes 125 to 135 new stores, consisting
of approximately 80 domestic Payless ShoeSource locations, 10 Canadian stores,
25 to 30 Central American and Caribbean locations, and 10 to 15 South American
stores. The expansion plans for 2003 through 2007 would add approximately 175
net Payless ShoeSource stores. During this five-year period, the Company plans
to invest 245 million for new stores, 280 million to remodel existing stores,
and an additional 100 million on systems technology. These are the major
components of a projected 650 million, five-year capital improvement plan.

RESTRUCTURING During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a 70
million pre-tax, 43.1 million after-tax charge for restructuring initiatives
and asset impairments. The restructuring included the closing of the Company's
four domestic division offices, centralizing domestic retail operations in
Topeka, Kansas, and the closing of 104 under-performing stores. The store
closings differ from closings in the normal course of business in that they have
longer remaining lease terms.

 During 2002, the Company closed 93 of the 104 stores originally identified
as part of the restructuring. Based on further analysis, the Company determined
not to close seven of the 104 stores. The remaining four stores will be closed
in 2003. During 2002, the Company reversed 4.8 million pre-tax, 3.0 million
after-tax, of the 2001 charge due to lower than anticipated net costs associated
with the Company's restructuring. As of February 1, 2003, a 3.8 million reserve
recorded within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet remained to
complete the restructuring. The Company expects annualized savings from these
initiatives to total 25 to 30 million, pre-tax.

o REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting
operating results for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2003 (2002), February
2, 2002 (2001), and February 3, 2001 (2000). Fiscal years 2002 and 2001
contained 52 weeks each and the fiscal year 2000 contained 53 weeks. This
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that are
included in this annual report. References to years relate to fiscal years
rather than calendar years unless otherwise designated.

 Results for the past three years were as follows:

(1) The Company recorded a 4.8 million non-recurring benefit in 2002, of
 which 2.0 million is included in cost of sales and 2.8 million is
 included in non-recurring (benefits) charges.

 The Company recorded a 70.0 million non-recurring charge in 2001, of
 which 4.4 million is included in cost of sales and 65.6 million is
 included in non-recurring charges.

(2) Percent of sales columns for the provision of income taxes represent
 effective income tax rates.

NET SALES Net sales represent all sales during the period net of estimated
returns. Same-store sales is calculated on a weekly basis. If a store is open
the entire week in each of the two years being compared, its GAAP sales are
included in the same-store sales calculation for that week. Relocated and
remodeled stores are also included in the same-store sales calculation if they
were open during the entire week in each of the two years being compared.

In 2002, net sales decreased 1.2 percent from 2001, consisting of a 9.9
percent increase in unit volume and a 10.1 percent decrease in average selling
prices, reflecting the Company's continued expansion of its accessories product.
Footwear unit volume increased 0.8 percent and footwear average selling prices
decreased 3.7 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. Net sales for fiscal 2002
totaled 2.88 billion. Same-store sales decreased 3.2 percent in 2002. Net sales
declined in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to a decline in same-store sales. The
decline in same-store sales reflects the weakened retail environment. In
addition, lower inventory levels maintained during the first six months of the
year may have negatively impacted sales. During the first half of the year, the
Company's same-store sales had decreased by 6.1 percent. The Company's
same-store sales improved in the second half of the year to a positive 0.2
percent.

 In 2001, net sales decreased 1.2 percent from 2000, consisting of a 0.5
percent decrease in unit volume and a 0.7 percent decrease in average selling
prices. Footwear unit volume decreased 5.6 percent and footwear average selling
prices increased 3.8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. Net sales for fiscal
2001 were 2.91 billion. Same-store sales decreased 2.9 percent in 2001. The
decline in net sales in 2001 from 2000 was due to the 53rd week in 2000 and a
decline in same-store sales. The decline in same-store sales reflected the
weakened retail environment, particularly in the second through fourth quarters
of 2001. Despite the difficult economy, customers reacted favorably to offerings
of women's boots. The Company also introduced its new Bundles(R) line of socks
and hosiery within its accessories category in all Payless ShoeSource stores
during the fourth quarter of 2001, increasing its accessory sales during this
time period.

COST OF SALES Cost of sales includes cost of merchandise sold and the Company's
buying and occupancy costs. Cost of sales was 2.01 billion in 2002 compared
with 2.03 billion in 2001. As a percent of net sales, cost of sales was 69.7
percent in both 2002 and 2001. Cost of sales in 2002 includes approximately
 18.0 million of incremental freight costs associated with the work stoppage at
the West Coast ports, offset by a reduction in markdowns compared to 2001 and a
 6.4 million improvement in cost of sales due to the non-recurring benefits in
2002 and non-recurring charges in 2001.

 Cost of sales was 2.03 billion in 2001, compared with 2.01 billion in
2000. As a percent of net sales, cost of sales was 69.7 percent in 2001 compared
with 68.2 percent in 2000. The negative leverage of occupancy costs as a result
of a decline in same-store sales contributed to 1.2 percent of the increase and
an increase in markdowns contributed to 0.3 percent of the increase. The
increase in markdowns included 16.0 million of additional markdowns taken in
the third quarter to clear excess back-to-school and fall seasonal merchandise
and 4.4 million of inventory liquidation costs included in the Company's fourth
quarter restructuring charge.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative
expenses were 696.6 million in 2002 compared with 715.9 million in 2001, a 2.7
percent decrease. As a percent of net retail sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses were 24.2 percent for 2002 compared with 24.6 percent in
2001. Payroll-related savings due to the Company's restructuring actions
contributed to 0.3 percent of the decrease and a decrease in advertising costs
contributed to 0.1 percent of the decrease.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 715.9 million in 2001
compared with 700.3 million in 2000, a 2.2 percent increase. As a percent of
net retail sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.6 percent
for 2001 compared with 23.8 percent in 2000. An increase in store payroll
contributed 0.7 percent to the increase and negative leverage of occupancy costs
as a result of a decline in same-store sales contributed to 0.2 percent of the
increase. The increase was partially offset by a 0.1 percent decrease in
advertising costs.

NON-RECURRING CHARGES During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a
non-recurring charge of 70.0 million comprised of a 53.9 million restructuring
charge and a 16.1 million asset impairment charge. The cash portion of the
charge was 41.4 million, of which 26.7 million was paid during 2002 and 6.1
million was paid during 2001. As part of the restructuring, the Company
centralized all domestic retail operations functions in Topeka, Kansas. Four
domestic division offices in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, and Dallas were
closed. The Company also announced its intention to close 104 under-performing
stores, including 67 Parade stores and 37 Payless ShoeSource stores, as part of
the restructuring. The store closings differ from closings in the normal course
of business in that they have longer remaining lease terms. The remaining
Parade(R) locations will be concentrated in the Northeast and selected major
metropolitan areas. As of February 1, 2003, the Company has closed 93 stores and
has decided to continue to operate seven of the original 104 stores identified
for closure. The remaining four stores will be closed in 2003. The Company
eliminated a total of 230 positions in conjunction with the restructuring.

 The Company also recorded an impairment charge of 16.1 million to write
down the book value of certain long-lived assets to their fair value as
determined based upon estimated future cash flows. In conjunction with the
restructuring and asset impairment, the Company recorded a fourth quarter charge
of 70.0 million pre-tax, 43.1 million after-tax, as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS (CONT.)

 During 2002, the Company recorded a net non-recurring benefit, resulting
from lower than anticipated net costs associated with the Company's
restructuring recorded in 2001. In 2002, the Company recorded an additional
charge of 2.0 million for professional fees and 1.4 million for relocation
costs associated with implementing the restructuring that was announced during
the fourth quarter of 2001. These additional costs are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of earnings as non-recurring charges. The
Company anticipates that future charges to earnings associated with the 2001
restructuring to be less than 0.5 million. Also, during 2002, the Company
decreased its reserve for store closings by 8.0 million, inventory liquidations
by 2.0 million and increased its reserve for division closings by 1.8 million.
This net reversal is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of
earnings as non-recurring benefits.

 The Company expects the annualized benefits from the restructuring actions
to total 25 million to 30 million, pre-tax. The benefits are being realized in
both gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses.

 During 2002, in an effort to enhance global sourcing initiatives and align
with international expansion strategies, the Company reorganized its global
sourcing structure to focus on cost reduction initiatives from procurement of
materials through distribution of product. As part of these cost reduction
initiatives, the Company is now taking ownership of certain raw materials as the
materials enter the production process. These raw materials are included in
inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.

 In April 2000, the Company completed a self-tender through which it
repurchased 22.5 million shares of its common stock at 17.67 per share. This
represented approximately 25.5 percent of the Company's shares outstanding
immediately prior to the self-tender. During the first quarter of 2000, the
Company recorded an 8.0 million non-recurring charge, principally for costs
associated with the analysis and consideration of various strategic alternatives
and costs associated with the self-tender.

INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME) Interest expense and income components were:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000
- --------------------- ------- ------- -------
 
Interest expense ............................ 23.5 30.6 29.3
Interest income ............................. (4.3) (2.5) (4.3)
 ------- ------- -------
Interest expense, net ....................... 19.2 28.1 25.0
 ------- ------- -------

The decrease in 2002 interest expense was the result of principal payments
on the long-term debt, a reduction in interest rates on the unhedged portion of
long-term debt throughout 2002 and having no borrowings under the Company's
revolving line of credit during 2002.

 The increase in 2001 interest expense was the result of the issuance of a
 400 million term loan in April 2000 as part of the Company's 600 million
Credit Facility secured in association with the self-tender and borrowings under
the Company's revolving line of credit during the first two quarters of 2001.
The increase was partially offset by principal payments on the long-term debt
and a reduction in interest rates on the unhedged portion of long-term debt
throughout 2001.

INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5 percent in 2002
from 38.4 percent in 2001 and 38.9 percent in 2000. The reduction reflects the
tax impact of actions taken to restructure operations to support the increasing
globalization of the Company's business and to participate in jurisdictional tax
incentive programs.

IMPACT OF INFLATION Inflation did not have a material impact on the Company's
2002 sales growth or earnings.

o REVIEW OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH FLOW Cash flow from operations was 130.5 million in 2002 compared with
 178.0 million in 2001 and 222.6 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 cash
flow from operations is due primarily to the Company's additional investment in
inventories of 113.0 million to provide a better assortment of product
partially offset by the increase in net earnings of 60.4 million in 2002. The
decrease in 2001 cash flow from operations is due primarily to the decrease in
net earnings.

 Sources and (uses) of cash flows are summarized, as follows:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000
- --------------------- ------- ------- -------

 ------- ------- -------

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2002, the Company's capital expenditures totaled 98.8
million, including a 9.1 million contribution from the Company's joint-venture
partners in Latin America. The 98.8 million includes 51.4 million for new
stores, 28.7 million to remodel existing stores, 13.6 million for information
technology hardware and systems development and 5.1 million for other necessary
improvements. The Company expects that 2003 capital expenditures will be
approximately 130 million, including a 6.5 million contribution from the
Company's joint-venture partners in Latin America. Total capital expenditures
for the period 2003 through 2007 are planned at 650 million. The Company
intends to use internal cash flow, additional contributions from its joint
venture partners, and available financing from its 200 million revolving credit
agreement to finance substantially all of these expenditures. The Company
believes these sources will be sufficient for its capital expenditure needs.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES The Company has entered into 28.5 million of demand notes
payable to efficiently finance its Latin American subsidiaries. The Company
maintains cash balances of 28.5 million in certificates of deposit as
compensating balances to collateralize these notes payable. The notes payable
accrue interest at a weighted average 9.01 percent. The certificates of deposit
earn interest at a weighted average of 8.61 percent and are included in other
current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

 In April 2000, the Company completed a self-tender through which it
repurchased 22.5 million shares of its common stock at 17.67 per share. This
represented approximately 25.5 percent of the Company's shares outstanding
immediately prior to the self-tender. The aggregate purchase price was
approximately 400 million. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 24.0
million shares, including the self-tender, for an aggregate purchase price of
 425 million.

 In conjunction with the self-tender, the Company repaid 122 million of
unsecured notes and entered into a new 600 million senior secured Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility consists of a 400 million term loan and a 200
million revolving loan, both of which mature in 2005 subject to prepayment
without penalty by the Company at any time. During the first quarter of 2000,
the Company recorded a 3.6 million, after-tax extraordinary loss for the excess
of the amount paid over the carrying value of its unsecured notes.

 During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company amended its Credit Facility
to provide additional flexibility to implement its restructuring and support its
continuing business operations.

 The Company leases substantially all of its stores and is committed to
making lease payments over the varying lease terms. As of February 1, 2003, the
present value of future operating lease payments was 879.4 million.

FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS As of February 1, 2003, no amounts were drawn against the
Company's 200 million line of credit. The availability under the line of credit
has been reduced, however, by 22.3 million in outstanding letters of credit.
During 2002, a voluntary prepayment of 50 million was made on the Company's
term loan. The Company's financial commitments include required principal
payments on the term loan and required payments under

12
 
operating leases and capital leases (including interest) as of February 1, 2003,
as follows (dollars in millions):

YEAR TERM LOAN OPERATING LEASES CAPITAL LEASES OTHER

 --------- ---------------- ---------------- --------
Total ............. 216.1 1,097.1 3.1 5.4
 --------- ---------------- ---------------- --------

The Company also maintains demand notes payable of 28.5 million entered
into to efficiently finance its Latin American subsidiaries. The Company
maintains cash balances of 28.5 million in certificates of deposit as
compensating balances to collateralize the notes payable. The certificates of
deposit are included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.

FINANCIAL CONDITION RATIOS Return on equity and return on net assets are as
follows:

2002 2001 2000
 ------ ------ ------
 
Return on equity(1) .......... 22.6 11.1 17.1 
Return on net assets(2) ...... 14.2 10.9 17.6 
 ------ ------ ------

(1) Return on equity is computed as net earnings divided by beginning
 shareowners' equity and measures the Company's ability to invest
 shareowners' funds profitably. The 2002 increase results primarily from
 the increase in net earnings; the 2001 decrease, primarily from the
 decrease in net earnings.

(2) Return on net assets is computed as pre-tax earnings, net interest
 expense and the interest component of operating leases, divided by
 beginning of year net assets, including present value of operating
 leases (PVOL), and represents performance independent of capital
 structure. The 2002 increase results primarily from the increase in net
 earnings; the 2001 decrease, primarily from the decrease in net
 earnings.

 The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 29.7 percent, 41.2 percent and 44.2
percent for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 debt-to-capitalization
ratio decrease is the result of the repayment of long-term debt and the increase
in the Company's shareowners' equity, primarily from the Company's net earnings.
The 2001 debt-to-capitalization ratio decrease is the result of the repayment of
long-term debt and the increase in the Company's shareowners' equity, primarily
from the Company's net earnings. For purposes of the debt-to-capitalization
ratio, total debt is long-term debt including current maturities, notes payable
and borrowings under the revolving line of credit. Capitalization is defined as
total debt and shareowners' equity. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, including
the present value of future minimum rental payments under operating leases as
debt and as capitalization, would be 65.4 percent, 71.7 percent and 74.1 percent
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 The fixed charge coverage was 2.5x, 1.7x and 2.9x in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Fixed charges are defined as gross interest expense and the
interest component of rent expense. Fixed charge coverage measures the Company's
ability to meet debt obligations from earnings.

COMMON STOCK AND MARKET PRICES The Company's common stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol PSS. The Company has not paid a
dividend on its shares of common stock and is restricted from making dividend
payments under its Credit Facility. The quarterly intraday price ranges of the
common stock in 2002 and 2001 were:

2002 MARKET PRICE 2001 Market Price

Year ........................... 21.10 14.25 26.07 17.17

INTEREST RATE RISK Interest on the Company's Credit Facility is based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a variable margin as defined in the
credit agreement. Therefore, the Company's future borrowing costs may fluctuate
depending upon the volatility of LIBOR. The Company currently mitigates a
portion of its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap
agreements, whereby the Company has agreed to exchange, at specific intervals,
the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional amount.

 The table set forth as follows summarizes the fair values and notional
amounts of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by the
Company as of February 1, 2003 (dollars in millions):

MATURITY DATE 2003 2004 2005 TOTAL
- ------------- ------ ------ ------ ------
 
Variable Rate Debt ........... 82.0 106.0 28.1 216.1
 Average Interest Rate ...... 2.8 3.3 4.2 3.2 
Variable to Fixed Swaps ...... 120.0 -- -- 120.0
 Average Pay Rate ........... 6.9 -- -- 6.9 
 Average Receive Rate ....... 1.4 -- -- 1.4 
 ------ ------ ------ ------

The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, as presented in the
table above, are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not
represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. Interest rates on the variable
rate debt and the receive rate on the interest rate swaps are estimated using
the average implied LIBOR for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in
effect at February 1, 2003.

 As the long-term debt under the Credit Facility bears interest at current
market rates, its carrying value approximates market value at February 1, 2003.
The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is a pre-tax loss of 2.8
million at February 1, 2003. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap
agreements approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding contracts. Dealer
quotations are available for the Company's interest rate swap agreements.

 During the first quarter of 2001, the Company terminated two currency swaps,
which had effectively converted 30 million of the U.S. dollar-denominated
long-term debt into Canadian dollar-denominated obligations. These swaps had
been designated as a foreign currency hedge on the Company's net investment in
Canadian dollar-denominated subsidiaries. As a result, the 0.5 million
after-tax gain 0.8 million pre-tax) remains a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within total shareowners' equity on the accompanying
balance sheet.

o CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 The consolidated financial statements include results for the entire fiscal
year for all years presented and the accounts of the Company, all wholly-owned
subsidiaries and all subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the Company owns a
controlling interest. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. In preparing these financial statements, management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported within the
consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

INVENTORIES Merchandise inventories are valued by the retail method and are
stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis, or market. The retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to
its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a
calculated cost-to-retail ratio across groupings of similar items, known as
departments. As a result, the retail method results in an averaging of inventory
costs across similar items within a department. The cost-to-retail ratio is
applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine
the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. Current owned retail
represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a
regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns. As a result, the
retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a
traditional FIFO cost basis.

 Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management
judgments and estimates including initial mark-up, markdowns and shrinkage,
which can significantly impact the owned retail and, therefore, the ending
inventory valuation at cost. Specifically, the failure to take permanent or
clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost
under the retail method. Management believes that its application of the retail
method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market.

 During 2002, the Company reorganized its global sourcing structure to focus
on cost reduction initiatives from procurement of materials through distribution
of finished product. As a result, the Company now takes ownership of certain raw
materials as the materials enter the production process. These raw materials are
now included in inventories. Inventories prior to shipment to a specific store
are valued at the lower of cost using the FIFO basis, or market. Raw materials
of 15.5 million are included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet
at February 1, 2003. There were no raw materials in inventories at February 2,
2002, or February 3, 2001.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS (CONT.)

properties under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of their useful lives or their related lease terms. Property and
equipment are reviewed on a store-by-store basis if an indicator of impairment
exists to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable.
Estimated future cash flows are used to determine if impairment exists. The
Company uses current operating results and historical performance to estimate
future cash flows on a store-by-store basis.

INSURANCE PROGRAMS The Company retains its normal expected losses related
primarily to workers' compensation, physical loss to property and business
interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general, product, and
vehicle liability. The Company purchases third party coverage for losses in
excess of the normal expected levels. Provisions for losses expected under these
programs are recorded based upon estimates of aggregate liability for claims
incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations. These actuarial
calculations utilize assumptions to estimate the frequency and severity of
losses as well as the patterns surrounding the emergence, development and
settlement of claims based on historical results.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS
142"). SFAS No. 142 requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be
initially recognized and measured based on its fair value. This Statement also
provides that goodwill should not be amortized, but shall be tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential
impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. In the
first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and
completed the first step of the required two-step goodwill impairment testing.
The first step of the impairment test required the Company to compare the fair
value of each reporting unit to its carrying value to determine whether there
was an indication that impairment existed. If there had been an indication of
impairment, the Company would have allocated the fair value of the reporting
unit to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business combination. During 2002, no impairment losses were recorded under
SFAS No. 142.

 Effective fiscal 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of" ("SFAS 144"). This statement addresses accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The statement superseded SFAS
121, while retaining many of the fundamental provisions covered by that
statement. SFAS 144 differs fundamentally from SFAS 121 in that goodwill and
other intangible assets that are not amortized are excluded from the scope of
SFAS 144. Additionally, SFAS 144 addresses and clarifies implementation and
estimation issues arising from SFAS 121.

 SFAS 144 also superseded the accounting and reporting provisions of
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for
the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS 144 retains the basic provisions
of APB Opinion No. 30 for the presentation of discontinued operations in the
income statement but broadens that presentation to apply to a component of an
entity rather than a segment of a business. The application of SFAS 144 in 2002
did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

 During April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). This Statement rescinds SFAS 4, "Reporting Gains and
Losses from Extinguishment of Debt" and SFAS 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets of Motor Carriers." This Statement amends SFAS 13, "Accounting for
Leases," so that certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are
similar to sale-leaseback transactions are accounted for the same way as
sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, SFAS 13 is amended so that the
original lessee under an operating lease agreement that becomes secondarily
liable shall recognize the fair value of the guarantee obligation. SFAS 145 also
stipulates that gains or losses on extinguishment of debt would have to meet the
criteria of APB No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" to be classified as an
extraordinary item. In addition, extraordinary gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt in prior periods presented would require
reclassification. SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002. The application of SFAS 145 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 On July 30, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). This Statement supercedes
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 is different
from EITF Issue No. 94-3 in that SFAS 146 requires that a liability be
recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the
liability is incurred, that is when it meets the definition of a liability in
the FASB's conceptual framework. SFAS 146 also establishes fair value as the
objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal
activities. In contrast, under EITF Issue 94-3, a company recognized a liability
for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan. SFAS 146 is effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The
statement does not require retroactive application and, consequently, did not
have an impact on the Company's exit activity initially applied prior to the
adoption of SFAS 146; however, the adoption of SFAS 146 can be expected to
impact the timing of liability recognition associated with any future exit
activities.

 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 amends SFAS
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and provides alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in annual
and interim financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation.
The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for
financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS 148.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

o SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Payless ShoeSource, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the "Company"), is the
largest family footwear retailer in the Western Hemisphere.

 As of February 1, 2003, the Company operated 4,992 Payless ShoeSource family
shoe stores offering quality family footwear and accessories in all 50 of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad & Tobago.
The Company's operations in Central and South America are operated as joint
ventures in which the Company maintains a 60-percent ownership.

 The Company sources and utilizes a network of agents with factories in 11
foreign countries and the United States to source its products, which are
manufactured to meet the Company's specifications and standards. During 2002,
factories in the People's Republic of China were a direct source of 79.9 percent
of the Company's merchandise and 84.9 percent of the Company's footwear.

 The consolidated financial statements include results for the entire fiscal
year for all years presented and the accounts of the Company, all wholly-owned
subsidiaries and all subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the Company owns a
controlling interest. Significant inter-company transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

FISCAL YEAR The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January
31. Fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 ended on February 1, 2003, February 2,
2002, and February 3, 2001, respectively. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 included 52
weeks; fiscal year 2000, 53 weeks. References to years in these financial
statements and notes relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

USE OF ESTIMATES Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported within the consolidated balance sheet and the statements of
earnings, shareowners' equity and cash flows, and the notes to consolidated
financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

NET SALES Net sales ("sales") are recognized at the time the sale is made to the
customer, are net of estimated returns and current promotional discounts and
exclude sales tax.

COST OF SALES Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold and the
Company's buying and occupancy costs.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES Costs associated with the opening of new stores are
expensed as incurred.

ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs and sales promotion costs are expensed at
the time the advertising takes place. Selling, general and administrative
expenses include advertising and sales promotion costs of 95.0 million, 98.4
million and 100.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach known
as the liability method. The liability method accounts for deferred income taxes
by applying the statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance sheet
to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, and amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123." The Statement requires prominent disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company accounts for stock compensation awards under the intrinsic
value method of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25. APB Opinion
No. 25 requires compensation cost to be recognized based on the excess, if any,
between the quoted market price of the stock at the date of grant and the amount
an employee must pay to acquire the stock. All options awarded under all of the
Company's plans are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market
value on the date of the grant.

 SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," provides an alternative
method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which establishes a fair
value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity
instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate
the grant date fair value of its 1996 and later option grants. The fair value is
recognized over the option vesting period. As the fair value represents only
1996 and later option grants, the pro forma impact shown below may not be
representative of future years. The following table presents the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share had the Company adopted the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000

Basic earnings per share:
 As reported ............................ 1.56 0.68 1.70
 Pro forma .............................. 1.45 0.46 1.39

The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes calculations above:

 ------ ------ ------

Expected dividend yield .................. 0 0 0 
Expected option life ..................... 10 YRS 10 yrs 10 yrs
Expected volatility ...................... 32 35 35 

STOCK SPLIT During February 2003, the Company declared a three-for-one stock
split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to shareholders of record on
March 13, 2003, payable on March 27, 2003. The Company issued approximately 44.4
million shares of common stock as a result of the stock split. All references to
the number of shares and per share amounts of common stock have been restated to
reflect the stock split. The Company reclassified an amount equal to the par
value of the number of shares issued to common stock from retained earnings.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less. Receivables in the amount of 12.7
million and 11.3 million from banks and credit card companies for the
settlement of credit card transactions are included in cash and cash equivalents
as of February 1, 2003, and February 2, 2002, respectively, as they are
generally collected within three business days. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value.

INVENTORIES Merchandise inventories are valued by the retail method and are
stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis, or market. The retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to
its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a
calculated cost-to-retail ratio across groupings of similar items, known as
departments. As a result, the retail method results in an averaging of inventory
costs across similar items within a department. The cost-to-retail ratio is
applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine
the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. Current owned retail
represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a
regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns. As a result, the
retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a
traditional FIFO cost basis.

 Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management
judgments and estimates including initial mark-up, markdowns and shrinkage,
which can significantly impact the owned retail, and, therefore, the ending
inventory valuation at cost. Specifically, the failure to take permanent or
clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost
under the retail method. Management believes that its application of the retail
method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market.

 During 2002, the Company reorganized its global sourcing structure to focus
on cost reduction initiatives from procurement of materials through distribution
of finished product. As a result, the Company now takes ownership of certain raw
materials as the materials enter the production process. These raw materials are
now included in inventories. Inventories prior to shipment to a specific store
are

 19
 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT.)

valued at the lower of cost using the FIFO basis, or market. Raw materials of
 15.5 million are included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet at
February 1, 2003. There were no raw materials in inventories at February 2,
2002, or February 3, 2001.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
estimated useful life for each major class of property and equipment is as
follows:

Buildings 10 to 30 years
Leasehold improvements the lesser of 10 years or the
 remaining expected lease term
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 8 years
Property under capital lease 10 to 30 years

Property and equipment are reviewed for recoverability on a store-by-store basis
if an indicator of impairment exists to determine whether the carrying amount of
the assets is recoverable.

INSURANCE PROGRAMS The Company retains its normal expected losses related
primarily to workers' compensation, physical loss to property and business
interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general, product, and
vehicle liability. The Company purchases third-party coverage for losses in
excess of the normal expected levels. Provisions for losses expected under these
programs are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims
incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations based on historical
results.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Local currencies are the functional currencies for
all subsidiaries. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Adjustments
from the translation process are accumulated as part of other comprehensive
income and are included as a separate component of shareowners' equity. Income
and expense items of these subsidiaries are translated at average rates of
exchange.

FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies and
to minimize the risk associated with investments in foreign operations. The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS
133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" as of the
beginning of 2001. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be reflected as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet based on their fair value. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in the fair value
of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment through earnings, or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The change in a derivative's fair value related to the ineffective
portion of a hedge, if any, will be immediately recognized in earnings. The
effect of SFAS 133, as amended, did not have a material impact on the results of
operations or financial position of the Company.

RECLASSIFICATION Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current-year presentation, including, but not limited to, amounts in the
consolidated statements of cash flows.

o QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

 Quarterly results are determined in accordance with annual accounting
policies. They include certain items based upon estimates for the entire year.

Summarized quarterly results for the last two years were as follows:

(dollars in millions, except per share) 2002

 --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------

(1) Earnings per share were computed independently for each of the quarters
 presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount
 due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding.

o PROFIT SHARING PLAN

 The Company has two qualified profit sharing plans ("Payless Profit Sharing
Plans") that cover full-time associates who have worked for the Company for 90
days and have attained age 21 or part-time associates who work 1,000 hours or
more in a year and have attained age 21. The Company's profit sharing plans are
defined contribution plans that provide for Company contributions related to the
Company's annual performance and are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. The Company expects to contribute 2.5 percent of its pre-tax earnings
to the Company's profit sharing plans for 2002. Associates may voluntarily
contribute to the Company's profit sharing plans on both a pre-tax and after-tax
basis. The Company's contribution is allocated to all associates participating
in the Payless Profit Sharing Plans who have worked for the Company for at least
one year. Total profit sharing contributions accrued for 2002, 2001 and 2000
were approximately 4.2 million, 3.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively.

o PENSION PLAN

 The Company has a nonqualified, supplementary defined benefit plan for
certain management employees. The plan is an unfunded, noncontributory plan and
provides for benefits based upon years of service and cash compensation during
employment.

 Pension expense is based on information provided to an outside actuarial
firm that uses assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to
associates and allocates this cost to service periods. The actuarial assumptions
used to calculate pension expense are reviewed annually for reasonableness. The
components of net periodic benefit costs and actuarial assumptions for the plan
was:

o INCOME TAXES

 The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000
- --------------------- ------- ------- -------
 
 Federal ................................... 25.1 42.9 66.9

Deferred tax provision (benefit) ............ 20.7 (24.1) (1.7)
 ------- ------- -------
Total provision ............................. 58.0 27.6 79.0
 ------- ------- -------

The reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the
effective income tax rate was as follows:

2002 2001 2000
 ----- ----- -----
 
Statutory federal income tax rate ......... 35.0 35.0 35.0 
State and local income taxes

Other, net ................................ 0.1 (0.8) --
 ---- ---- ----
Effective income tax rate ................. 36.5 38.4 38.9 
 ---- ---- ----

Major components of deferred income tax assets were as
follows:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001
 ----- -----
 
Accrued expenses and reserves ...................... 28.8 35.6
Depreciation/amortization and basis differences .... 2.1 22.6

Net deferred income taxes .......................... 45.4 66.1
Less: Net current deferred income tax assets ....... 16.4 31.0
 ----- -----
Net noncurrent deferred income tax assets .......... 29.0 35.1
 ----- -----

The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets
if, based on management's assessment of historical and projected future
operating results and other available evidence, it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 2002, the
Company reduced the valuation allowance by 1.0 million related to state income
tax credits and included this amount within the provision for state and local
income taxes. In addition, the Company reduced its excess tax reserves by 3.2
million resulting from a review of the status of ongoing audits.

 At February 1, 2003, deferred tax assets for state and international net
operating loss carryforwards are 5.2 million. 4.6 million of these net
operating losses will expire between 2003 and 2023; 0.6 million may be carried
forward indefinitely. In addition, state income tax credit carryforwards are
 9.1 million, less a valuation allowance of 6.3 million. 1.3 million of these
net tax credit carryforwards will expire between 2003 and 2017; 1.5 million may
be carried forward indefinitely.

 Other than for Puerto Rico, federal and state income taxes are not accrued
on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because the
Company's intention is to reinvest these earnings indefinitely or to repatriate
earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.

o EARNINGS PER SHARE

 Basic earnings per share were 1.56, 0.68 and 1.70 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The per share amounts have been computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of shares outstanding.

 The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2002 and 2001 excludes the
impact of 1,930,332 and 1,397,439 stock options, respectively, because to
include them would have been antidilutive. Diluted earnings per share have been
computed as follows:

(dollars in millions, except per share;
shares in thousands) 2002 2001 2000

Extraordinary loss ....................... -- -- 0.05
Diluted earnings per share ............... 1.55 0.67 1.67
 ---------- ---------- ----------

o INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective February 3, 2002. SFAS
142 requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially
recognized and measured based on its fair value. This Statement also provides
that goodwill should not be amortized, but shall be tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment,
through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. In the first quarter
of fiscal 2002, the Company completed the required goodwill impairment testing
and ceased amortization of goodwill. No indication of impairment existed and
thus, no impairment losses were recorded upon the initial adoption of SFAS 142.
The Company's goodwill of 5.9 million at February 1, 2003, and February 2,
2002, is included in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet.

 The changes in goodwill are summarized below:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001
- --------------------- ---- ----
 
Carrying amount, beginning of year ................ 5.9 6.2
Amortization ...................................... -- (0.3)
 ---- ----
Carrying amount, end of year ...................... 5.9 5.9
 ---- ----

The effect of the adoption of SFAS 142 on net income and earnings per share
is as follows:

(dollars in millions, except per share
amounts) 2001 2000
- -------------------------------------- ----- ------
 
Net earnings as reported .......................... 45.4 120.6

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT.)

 In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company has reclassified
the 2001 balance of favorable lease rights to conform with the 2002
presentation. Favorable lease rights subject to amortization pursuant to SFAS
142 are as follows:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001
- --------------------- ----- -----
 
Gross carrying amount .............................. 89.4 88.5
Less: accumulated amortization ..................... (55.1) (51.0)
 ----- -----
Carrying amount, end of year ....................... 34.3 37.5
 ----- -----

The Company expects annual amortization expense for all intangible assets
for the next five years to be as follows (in millions):

Year Amount
- ---- ------
 
2003 ............................. 4.6
2004 ............................. 4.2
2005 ............................. 3.8

2007 ............................. 3.3

o NOTES PAYABLE

 The Company has entered into 28.5 million of demand notes payable to
efficiently finance its Latin American subsidiaries. The Company maintains cash
balances of 28.5 million in certificates of deposit as compensating balances to
collateralize these notes payable. The notes payable accrue interest at a
weighted average 9.01 percent. The certificates of deposit earn interest at a
weighted average of 8.61 percent and are included in other current assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

o ACCRUED EXPENSES

 Major components of accrued expenses included:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001
- --------------------- ---- ----
 
Sales, use and other taxes ........................ 28.8 24.5
Profit sharing, bonus, retention, and salaries .... 16.1 16.6
Store closings and real estate related ............ 7.5 31.3

o LONG-TERM DEBT

 Long-term debt and capital-lease obligations were:

(dollars in millions) 2002 2001
- --------------------- ------ ------
 
Term loan ......................................... 216.1 304.4
Capital-lease obligations ......................... 2.4 3.4
Other ............................................. 5.4 3.2
 ------ ------
Total debt ........................................ 223.9 311.0
Less current maturities of long-term debt ......... 83.2 65.9
 ------ ------
Long-term debt .................................... 140.7 245.1
 ------ ------

In April 2000, the Company repaid its 122 million of unsecured notes and
entered into a new 600 million senior secured Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility"). The excess of the amount paid over the carrying value of the
Company's unsecured notes was recorded as a 3.6 million extraordinary loss
related to early extinguishment of debt, net of 2.3 million of income tax.

 The Credit Facility consists of a 400 million term loan and a 200 million
revolving loan, both of which mature in 2005, subject to prepayment without
penalty by the Company at any time. The term loan and revolving loan bear
interest at the LIBOR rate, plus a variable margin of 1.25 to 2.0 . The
variable interest rate at February 1, 2003, was 2.9 . A quarterly commitment fee
of between 0.25 and 0.50 per annum is payable on the unborrowed balance of the
revolving loan. The margin on the term loan and the commitment fee varies based
upon performance criteria specified in the credit agreement. While no amounts
had been drawn on the 200 million revolving loan as of February 1, 2003, the
balance available to the Company was reduced by 22.3 million in outstanding
letters of credit. As the long-term debt under the Credit Facility bears
interest at current market rates, its carrying value approximates market value
at February 1, 2003.

 The Company's Credit Facility is secured by a first priority perfected
security interest in all of the capital stock of the Company's domestic
subsidiaries and 65 percent of the capital stock of its first-tier foreign
subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Credit Facility require the Company
to comply with various financial and other covenants, including the maintenance
of certain financial ratios and the limitation of additional share repurchases
to 50 million per year. As of February 1, 2003, the Company is in compliance
with all debt covenants.

 The required principal payments on the Company's 216.1 million term loan
balance as of February 1, 2003, are due as follows (in millions):

Year Amount
- ---- ------
 
2003 ........................... 82.0
2004 ........................... 106.0
2005 ........................... 28.1
 ------
Total .......................... 216.1
 ------

o DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

 In order to mitigate the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements
whereby the Company will receive interest at the three-month LIBOR rate and pay
a weighted average rate of 6.9 . The interest swaps expire in 2003.

 Effective February 4, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" ("SFAS 133"). The Company's interest rate swap agreements have been
designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Such instruments are those that
effectively convert variable interest payments on debt instruments into fixed
payments. As the critical terms of the Company's interest rate swap agreements
match those of the related hedged obligations, the Company has concluded that
there is no ineffectiveness in its hedges, and as a result, the adoption of SFAS
133 has no impact on net earnings.

 In connection with the adoption of SFAS 133, the Company recorded an
after-tax loss of 4.7 million 7.7 million pre-tax) to other comprehensive
income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the
first quarter of 2001. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap
agreements designated as cash flow hedging instruments are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income.

 During 2002, the Company recorded an after-tax loss of 1.3 million 2.0
million pre-tax) to other accumulated comprehensive income, representing the
decline in fair value of its interest rate swap agreements. At February 1, 2003,
the Company had a cumulative after-tax loss of 1.8 million 2.8 million
pre-tax) included in other accumulated comprehensive income related to its
interest rate swap agreements on a notional amount of 120.0 million. The
resulting liability is reflected in other current liabilities in the
accompanying balance sheet. The pre-tax loss is subsequently reclassified into
interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related
interest on the floating rate debt obligations affects earnings. During 2002,
 5.5 million of after-tax losses 8.7 million pre-tax) included in accumulated
other comprehensive income related to interest rate swap agreements was
reclassified to interest expense. For the year ending January 31, 2004,
approximately 1.8 million of after-tax losses 2.8 million pre-tax) in
accumulated other comprehensive income related to interest rate swap agreements
are expected to be reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment on
the Company's variable-rate long-term debt.

 During the first quarter of 2001, the Company terminated two currency swaps,
which had effectively converted 30.0 million of the U.S. dollar-denominated
long-term debt into Canadian dollar-denominated obligations. These swaps had
been designated as a foreign currency hedge on the Company's net investment in
Canadian dollar-denominated subsidiaries. As a result, a 0.5 million after-tax
gain 0.8 million pre-tax) remains a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within total shareowners' equity on the accompanying
balance sheet.

o LEASE OBLIGATIONS

 The Company leases substantially all of its stores. Rental expense for the
Company's operating leases consisted of:

Cumulative expense recognized on the straight-line basis in excess of cumulative
payments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 Future minimum lease payments at February 1, 2003, were as follows:

o NON-RECURRING CHARGES

 During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a non-recurring
charge of 70.0 million comprised of a 53.9 million restructuring charge and a
 16.1 million asset impairment charge. The cash portion of the charge was 41.4
million, of which 6.1 million was paid during 2001. As part of the
restructuring, the Company centralized all domestic retail operations functions
in Topeka, Kansas. Four domestic division offices in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago
and Dallas were closed. The Company also announced its intention to close 104
under-performing stores, including 67 Parade stores and 37 Payless ShoeSource
stores, as part of the restructuring. The store closings differ from closings in
the normal course of business in that they have longer remaining lease terms.
The remaining Parade locations will be concentrated in the Northeast and
selected major metropolitan areas. As of February 1, 2003, the Company has
closed 93 stores and has decided to continue to operate seven of the 104 stores
originally identified for closure. The remaining four stores will be closed in
2003. The Company eliminated a total of 230 positions in conjunction with the
restructuring.

 The Company also recorded an impairment charge of 16.1 million to write
down the book value of certain long-lived assets to their fair value as
determined based upon estimated future cash flows. In conjunction with the
restructuring and asset impairment, the Company recorded a fourth quarter 2001
charge of 70.0 million pre-tax, 43.1 million after-tax, as follows:

(dollars in millions)
- ---------------------
 
Store closing costs (including lease terminations,

During 2002, the Company recorded a net non-recurring benefit, resulting
from lower than anticipated net costs associated with the Company's
restructuring recorded in 2001. In 2002, the Company recorded an additional
charge of 2.0 million for professional fees and 1.4 million for relocation
costs associated with implementing the restructuring that was announced during
the fourth quarter of 2001. These additional costs are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of earnings as non-recurring charges. The
Company anticipates that future charges to earnings associated with the 2001
restructuring to be less than 0.5 million. Also, during 2002, the Company
decreased its reserve for store closings by 8.0 million, inventory liquidations
by 2.0 million and increased its reserve for division closings by 1.8 million.
This net reversal is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of
earnings as non-recurring benefits.

 During 2002, in an effort to enhance global sourcing initiatives and align
with international expansion strategies, the Company reorganized its global
sourcing structure to focus on cost reduction initiatives from procurement of

23

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT.)

materials through distribution of product. As part of these cost reduction
initiatives, the Company is now taking ownership of certain raw materials as the
materials enter the production process. These raw materials are included in
inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.

 In April 2000, the Company completed a self-tender through which it
repurchased 22.5 million shares of its common stock at 17.67 per share. This
represented approximately 25.5 percent of the Company's shares immediately prior
to the self-tender. During the first quarter of 2000, the Company recorded an
 8.0 million non-recurring charge, principally for costs associated with the
analysis and consideration of various strategic alternatives and costs
associated with the self-tender.

o COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

 During 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company repurchased 2.1 million (108
thousand shares), 4.1 million (210 thousand shares), and 425.0 million (24.0
million shares), respectively, of common stock under its stock repurchase
programs.

o STOCK OPTION AND STOCK-RELATED COMPENSATION PLANS

 Under the Company's common stock option plans, options are granted at the
average of the high and low trading price on the date of grant. Options to
purchase may extend for up to ten years, may be exercised in installments only
after stated intervals of time, and are conditional upon continued employment
with the Company. The options may be exercised during certain periods following
retirement, disability or death.

 A summary of the status of the various stock option plans at the end of
2002, 2001, and 2000, and the changes within years are presented below:

Under the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company is authorized to grant a
maximum of 400,000 shares of restricted stock to management associates.
Associates who receive restricted stock pay no monetary consideration.
Restricted stock can be granted with or without performance restrictions.
Restrictions, including performance restrictions, lapse over periods of up to
four years, as determined at the date of grant. Under the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan, the Company granted no shares of restricted stock in 2002 and 2001 and
191,200 shares of restricted stock in 2000.

 The Company's plans are accounted for as provided by APB Opinion No. 25. For
stock options, no compensation cost has been recognized because the option
exercise price is fixed at the average market price on the date of grant. For
restricted stock grants, compensation expense is based upon the grant date
average market price; it is recorded over the lapsing period. For
performance-based restricted stock, compensation expense is recorded over the
performance period based on estimates of performance levels.

o CONTINGENCIES

 Other than as described below, there are no material pending legal
proceedings other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the business
to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is subject.

 On or about December 20, 2001, a First Amended Complaint was filed against
the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, captioned
Adidas America, Inc. and Adidas-Salomon AG v. Payless ShoeSource, Inc. The First
Amended Complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages for
trademark and trade dress infringement, unfair competition, deceptive trade
practices and breach of contract. The Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to claims asserted in the lawsuit and has filed an answer and a motion
for summary judgment which the court granted in part. An estimate of the
possible loss, if any, or the range of loss cannot be made.

 On or about January 20, 2000, a complaint was filed against the Company in
the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, captioned Howard J.
Dananberg, D.P.M. v. Payless ShoeSource, Inc. The Complaint seeks injunctive
relief, unspecified treble monetary damages, attorneys' fees, interest and costs
for patent infringement. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to
claims asserted in the lawsuit. An estimate of the possible loss, if any, or the
range of loss cannot be made.

o SEGMENT REPORTING

 The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of
retail locations offering family footwear and accessories. The Company operates
its business in two reportable business segments: Payless Domestic and Payless
International. These segments have been determined based on internal management
reporting and management responsibilities. The Payless International segment
includes retail operations in Canada, South America, Central America and the
Caribbean. The Company's operations in Central and South America are operated as
joint ventures in which the Company maintains a 60-percent ownership. Certain
management costs are allocated to the Payless International segment for services
performed by Payless Domestic. The Payless Domestic segment includes retail
operations in the United States, Guam, and Saipan. Information on the segments
is as follows:

o SHAREOWNER RIGHTS PLAN

 The Company has a shareowner rights plan under which one right is attached
to each share of the Company's common stock. The rights become exercisable only
under certain circumstances involving actual or potential acquisitions of the
Company's common stock by a person or persons affiliated with such persons.
Depending on the circumstances, if the rights become exercisable, the holder may
be entitled to purchase units of the Company's preferred stock, shares of the
Company's common stock or shares of the common stock of the acquiring person.
The rights will remain in existence until April 30, 2006, unless they are
terminated, extended, exercised or redeemed.

o NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). SFAS No.
142 requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially
recognized and measured based on its fair value. This Statement also provides
that goodwill should not be amortized, but shall be tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment,
through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. In the first quarter
of fiscal 2002, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and completed the
first step of the required two-step goodwill impairment testing. The first step
of the impairment test required the Company to compare the fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying value to determine whether there was an
indication that impairment existed. If there had been an indication of
impairment, the Company would have allocated the fair value of the reporting
unit to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business combination. During 2002, no impairment losses were recorded under
SFAS No. 142.

 Effective fiscal 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 144").
This statement addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets. The statement superseded SFAS 121, while retaining many of
the fundamental provisions covered by that statement. SFAS 144 differs
fundamentally from SFAS 121 in that goodwill and other intangible assets that
are not amortized are excluded from the scope of SFAS 144. Additionally, SFAS
144 addresses and clarifies implementation and estimation issues arising from
SFAS 121.

 SFAS 144 also superseded the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business.
SFAS 144 retains the basic provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 for the presentation
of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that
presentation to apply to a component of an entity rather than a segment of a
business. The application of SFAS 144 in 2002 did not have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 During April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). This Statement rescinds SFAS 4, "Reporting Gains and
Losses from Extinguishment of Debt" and SFAS 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets of Motor Carriers." This Statement amends SFAS 13, "Accounting for
Leases," so that certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are
similar to sale-leaseback transactions are accounted for the same way as
sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, SFAS 13 is amended so that the
original lessee under an operating lease agreement that becomes secondarily
liable shall recognize the fair value of the guarantee obligation. SFAS 145 also
stipulates that gains or losses on extinguishment of debt would have to meet the
criteria of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting
the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" to be classified as an
extraordinary item. In addition, extraordinary gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt in prior periods presented would require
reclassification. SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002. The application of SFAS 145 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 On July 30, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). This Statement supercedes
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 is different
from EITF Issue No. 94-3 in that SFAS 146 requires that a liability be
recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the
liability is incurred, that is when it meets the definition of a liability in
the FASB's conceptual framework. SFAS 146 also establishes fair value as the
objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal
activities. In contrast, under EITF Issue 94-3, a company recognized a liability
for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan. SFAS 146 is effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The
statement does not require retroactive application and, consequently, did not
have an impact on the Company's exit activity initially applied prior to the
adoption of SFAS 146; however, the adoption of SFAS 146 can be expected to
impact the timing of liability recognition associated with any future exit
activities.

 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 amends SFAS
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and provides alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in annual
and interim financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation.
The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for
financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS 148.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

o REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

 Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of
the financial information included in this annual report. The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States applied on a consistent basis.

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Although the
financial statements reflect all available information and management's judgment
and estimates of current conditions and circumstances, and are prepared with the
assistance of specialists within and outside the Company, actual results could
differ from those estimates.

 Management has established and maintains an internal control structure to
provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from
unauthorized use or disposition, that the accounting records provide a reliable
basis for the preparation of financial statements, and that such financial
statements are not misstated due to material fraud or error. Internal controls
include the careful selection of associates, the proper segregation of duties
and the communication and application of formal policies and procedures that are
consistent with high standards of accounting and administrative practices. An
important element of this system is a comprehensive internal audit program.
Management continually reviews, modifies and improves its systems of accounting
and controls in response to changes in business conditions and operations and in
response to recommendations in the reports prepared by the independent public
accountants and internal auditors.

 Management believes that it is essential for the Company to conduct its
business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in
conformity with the law. This standard is described in the company's policies on
business conduct, which are publicized throughout the Company.

o AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 The Board of Directors, through the activities of its Audit and Finance
Committee, participates in the reporting of financial information by the
Company. The Committee meets regularly with management, the internal auditors
and the independent public accountants. The Committee reviewed the scope, timing
and fees for the annual audit and the results of the audit examinations
completed by the internal auditors and independent public accountants, including
the recommendations to improve certain internal controls and the follow-up
reports prepared by management. The independent public accountants and internal
auditors have free access to the Committee and the Board of Directors and attend
each regularly scheduled Audit and Finance Committee meeting.

 The Audit and Finance Committee consists of four outside directors all of
whom have accounting or financial management expertise. The members of the Audit
and Finance Committee are Howard R. Fricke, Michael E. Murphy, Robert L. Stark
and Robert C. Wheeler. The Audit and Finance Committee reports the results of
its activities to the full Board of Directors.

o INDEPENDENT AUDITOR REPORTS

To the Board of Directors, Payless ShoeSource, Inc., Topeka, Kansas:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Payless
ShoeSource, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 1, 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareowners' equity, and cash
flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of the
Company as of February 2, 2002, and for the years ended February 2, 2002, and
February 3, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations.
Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in
their report dated February 21, 2002, which included an explanatory paragraph
for the change in method of accounting for derivative financial instruments.

 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February
1, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

 As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as
of February 2, 2002, and for the years ended February 2, 2002, and February 3,
2001, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in
the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, these consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets", which was adopted by the Company as of February 3,
2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in the Notes to the
consolidated financial statements with respect to the years ended February 2,
2002 ("2001") and February 3, 2001 ("2000") included: (1) comparing the
previously reported net income to the previously issued consolidated financial
statements and the adjustments to reported net income representing amortization
expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods related
to goodwill to the Company's underlying analysis obtained from management, (2)
testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income
to reported net income, and the related earnings per share amounts, and (3)
agreeing the favorable lease rights gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization to the underlying records obtained from management. In our opinion,
the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements are appropriate.

 As described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed the composition of its reportable segments in 2002, and the
amounts in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements relating to reportable
segments have been restated to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable
segments. We audited the adjustments that were applied to the restated
disclosures for reportable segments reflected in the 2001 and 2000 financial
statements. Our procedures included: (1) comparing the adjusted disclosed
segment financial information to the Company's underlying analysis obtained from
management, and (2) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of
segment amounts to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied.

 As described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the 2001
and 2000 financial statements have been revised to give effect to the
three-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, declared
during February 2003. We audited the adjustments that were applied to revise the
2001 and 2000 financial statements for such stock split. Our audit procedures
included (1) comparing the amounts shown in the earnings per share disclosure
for 2001 and 2000 to the Company's underlying accounting analysis obtained from
management, (2) comparing the previously reported shares outstanding and income
statement amounts per the Company's accounting analysis to the previously issued
financial statements, and (3) recalculating the additional shares to give effect
to the stock split and testing the mathematical accuracy of the underlying
analysis. In our opinion, such adjustments have been properly applied.

 As described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, certain
amounts in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated statement of cash flows have been
reclassified to conform with the 2002 presentation. We audited the
reclassifications described in the Notes to the consolidated financial
statements that were applied to restate the 2001 and 2000 statement of cash
flows. Our procedures included agreeing the reclassifications to the Company's
underlying accounting analysis obtained from management. In our opinion, such
reclassifications are appropriate and have been properly applied.

 As described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has included the disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures About Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits." Our audit procedures with respect to the 2001 and 2000
disclosures in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included
agreeing the amounts to the valuation reports received from the Company's
independent third-party actuarial firm. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001
and 2000 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.

 Other than described above, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply
any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Company other
than with respect to such disclosures and adjustments and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Payless ShoeSource, Inc.:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Payless
ShoeSource, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of February 2,
2002 and February 3, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareowners' equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended February 2, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Payless ShoeSource, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended February 2, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

 As explained in the Derivative Instruments Note to the financial statements,
effective February 4, 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for
derivative financial instruments.
