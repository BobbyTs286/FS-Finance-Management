PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 GENERAL

 Egghead, Inc. (Egghead or the Company), a reseller of personal computer
 (PC) software, hardware, and related products, serves small businesses and
 individuals through retail outlets and mail order. As of March 30, 1996,
 the Company operated 164 retail stores, a direct response group, and Elekom
 Corporation (ELEKOM), all of which are included in continuing operations.

 The Company has also historically served corporate, governmental, and
 educational customers through its corporate, government, and education
 (CGE) division. On March 25, 1996, the Company announced the sale of the
 CGE Division to Software Spectrum, Inc. (SSI), a Texas corporation, for
 45.0 million in cash which did not include the CGE division's receivables
 and inventory that Egghead is liquidating in an orderly manner, all of
 which are expected to result in total gross cash proceeds of approximately
 90.0 million. The sale, which was effective, May 13, 1996 included a
 Fulfillment Agreement relating to the provision by Egghead to SSI of
 certain support services for a period not to exceed 120 days and a Call
 Center Lease detailing the lease for a period of three years of a portion
 of Egghead's Spokane facility to SSI. (Exhibits on Form 8-K filed May 23).
 Information contained in this filing excludes, unless otherwise stated, any
 data relative to the discontinued operations of the CGE division.

 Egghead, a Washington corporation, was incorporated in 1988 and is the
 successor to a corporation which was incorporated in Washington in 1984.
 Egghead is the parent company of DJ&J Software Corporation, Eggspert
 Software, Ltd. (Eggspert), EH Direct, Inc., Egghead International, Inc.
 (Egghead International) and ELEKOM. Eggspert and Egghead International
 became inactive subsidiaries on May 13, 1996 following the sale of the CGE
 division to SSI. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to
 "the Company" and "Egghead" include Egghead and its subsidiaries.
 Operating results of Eggspert and Egghead International are included in
 discontinued operations. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.

 Egghead's retail stores offer a broad in-store selection of products at
 competitive prices, as well as special order capabilities for additional
 products. The Company employs a knowledgeable sales force to assist
 customers in selecting software, hardware, and related products. At fiscal
 year end, the Company was operating 19 of its retail stores under a new
 merchandising format which is approximately twice the size of original
 stores and is arranged in a more user-friendly format. The performance of
 these new stores has been mixed and management continues to evaluate
 results while refining the format. While assessing the overall
 contribution of the new merchandising format, management intends to open
 six new stores. Pending such evaluation and refinement of the new format,
 the Company does not intend to open more than the six new stores.

In December 1995, Egghead formed ELEKOM, a new subsidiary. ELEKOM was
 formed to develop electronic commerce applications and services which link
 customers and their suppliers. EleTrade, a product being developed by
 ELEKOM, uses Lotus Notes and other notes networks to provide large
 organizations an easy-to-use, cost-effective, secure and reliable product
 ordering and order management system for non-production goods and services.
 EleTrade allows companies to create customized electronic catalogs with
 multi-media product information and customer-specific pricing. ELEKOM is
 also developing additional enhancements which will automate the internal
 requisition and approval process and which may create better
 asset/inventory management and allow electronic software distribution.
 ELEKOM, a development stage company, incurred selling, general and
 administrative costs of approximately 1.1 million in fiscal 1996 and is
 not expected to make significant sales or distribution of products in
 fiscal year 1997.

MARKET OVERVIEW

 The software industry is undergoing a noticeable degree of consolidation as
 large software publishers acquire either other software publishers or
 complete software product lines. Smaller software publishers are attempting
 to concentrate on specialized products in limited markets. Software
 resellers are also merging with or acquiring other software resellers.

 Both businesses and individual consumers have shown an increasing
 preference for integrated software packages which combine word processing,
 spreadsheet, presentation, and database software. These integrated
 packages are appealing to the consumer for several reasons. The purchase
 cost of an integrated software package is lower than the individual
 components purchased separately. In addition, integration reduces some of
 the complexity and learning time involved in using software. Integrated
 software packages also help standardize the computing environment for local
 area networks, which are becoming more common in the business world. This
 shift toward integration and standardization is viewed by many companies as
 a way to significantly reduce the cost of supporting PC applications in
 their organizations.

 Prices of microprocessor chips continue to fall due to increased
 competition among computer chip manufacturers, and the introduction of
 newer, faster microprocessor chips. The decrease in microprocessor chip
 prices has forced PC prices down, resulting in increased sales of PCs to
 businesses and individual consumers. Sales of home computers, especially
 those equipped for multimedia, have increased dramatically as consumers
 begin to use PCs for a variety of uses such as telecommuting, home
 productivity, entertainment, communications, and education.

 Price performance improvements in microcomputer hardware and the
 availability of CD-ROM technology have a dramatic impact on the retail
 segment of the market. Sales of PC hardware accessories, such as hard
 drives and modems, have increased as consumers enhance their PCs.
 Multimedia capability has enabled home users to more effectively use
 microcomputers for educational and entertainment purposes.

 Access to electronic communication networks, such as the Internet and
 commercially available on-line services, has become increasingly important
 to both businesses and individual consumers. These electronic
 communication networks have grown at a tremendous pace over the last year.
 The networks are expected to provide substantial opportunities both now and
 in the future for communications, commerce, and the exchange of data.
 Software publishers have recognized the significance of this trend, and
 have begun to integrate interfaces for these electronic communications
 networks into their operating systems and workgroup software.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

 Egghead resells PC software, hardware and related products, computer-
 related magazines and books, tutorials, and selected peripheral devices and
 accessories. Egghead has approximately 2,000 software products (including
 both IBM-Registered Trademark--compatible and Apple-Registered Trademark-
 Macintosh-Registered Trademark- software) and other products in its retail
 stores, and thousands more available through 1-800-EGGHEAD's special order
 service.

 The Company offers a broad array of customer support services to assist
 customers in the selection and administration of their software purchases,
 including the following:

 CUSTOM UPDATES AND EGGSTRAS (CUE-SM-) PROGRAM - a preferred customer
 membership program providing discounts and other benefits in the
 retail stores and direct response. CUE-SM- also provides the Company
 with a valuable database of customers, their PC equipment profiles,
 and a history of their software purchases.

 COMPUTER SELECT - a CD-ROM-based system updated monthly with
 information on most software and hardware products. Articles can be
 obtained from all major personal computer publications and sent to
 customers as requested.

 INTERNET SITE - Egghead now maintains a site on the internet for
 information, customer support, and product sales. Egghead's page can
 be found at http://www.egghead.com. The site allows Egghead to reach
 customers through a new medium as an expanding consumer base purchases
 hardware and/or software that allows Internet access. The site uses
 the new merchandising format to display SKUs in a manner similar to
 the new format Egghead retail stores. Egghead plans to begin offering
 electronic delivery of software in the second quarter of 1997.

 1-800-EGGHEAD - Egghead maintains a direct response unit which
 processes all telephone and mail orders. These orders are solicited
 through catalog distribution. Catalogs have been redesigned to use
 the merchandising format found in Egghead's new retail stores. 1-800-
 EGGHEAD also provides customer service for the 164 stores, as well as
 store referral to callers who would like to try a product. 1-800-
 EGGHEAD also allows customers access to products not available through
 retail outlets by offering a special order service.

 MARKETING, ADVERTISING, AND PROMOTION

 Egghead's marketing philosophy is to position itself as the reseller of
 choice by providing the customer with the best value in terms of
 competitive prices, selection, service, and convenience. In addition,
 Egghead strives to create primary demand for the products it sells. The
 Company's strategy to meet these objectives is to use aggressive
 advertising and marketing efforts.

 The Company's advertising campaign emphasizes a broad selection of
 available merchandise and competitive prices. Advertising is also used to
 promote major new product launches.

5

Egghead's primary advertising medium is direct mail, which is used to
 target the highly identifiable segment of the population which owns and/or
 uses computers. In addition to a database of more than 3 million of its
 CUE customers, Egghead sends regular direct mail product promotions to
 purchased lists of computer owners. The Company also uses both local and
 national newspapers. Catalogs are designed to reflect the same layout as
 customers will find in Egghead's new format retail stores. These catalogs
 are updated and distributed throughout the year.

 Egghead has entered into cooperative advertising and other promotional and
 market development fund agreements with numerous manufacturers and
 distributors. The funds obtained through these agreements assist the
 Company in achieving high visibility in the marketplace.

 CUSTOMERS

 Egghead has a diverse customer base comprised primarily of individuals and
 small businesses and uses specific marketing strategies to target different
 customer segments.

 RETAIL OPERATIONS

 Egghead's retail stores are designed to provide a pleasant shopping
 environment for walk-in customers, primarily individuals, who purchase PC
 software and hardware products for their personal use and/or for use in a
 small business. A knowledgeable sales force offers solutions-oriented
 assistance to customers selecting software, hardware, and related products.

 Egghead's retail stores offer customers competitive prices, a wide
 selection of products, excellent service, and convenient store locations.
 In addition to stocking approximately 2,000 SKUs in the retail stores,
 Egghead customers have access to thousands more through 1-800-EGGHEAD's
 special order service. The Company also stocks selected PC hardware
 products, computer-related magazines and books, tutorials, and selected
 peripheral devices and accessories. Egghead also provides installation
 services in most of its stores.

 During fiscal 1996, the Company introduced 19 stores based on a new
 merchandising format which is approximately twice the size of older format
 stores and is arranged in a more user-friendly environment. The
 performance of these new stores has been mixed and management continues to
 evaluate results while refining the format. While assessing the overall
 contribution of the new merchandising format, management intends to open
 six new stores. Pending such evaluation and refinement of the new format,
 the Company does not intend to open more than the six new stores. The
 balance of the Egghead stores contain approximately 2,500 square feet of
 retail selling space. Most stores are located in strip shopping centers.
 Store locations are researched and chosen to be in areas with high
 distribution of personal computers, high population density, and high mean
 income levels. Egghead provides in-store demonstration of software, with
 most stores having personal computers available for use by customers in
 evaluating software in the stores.

 MERCHANDISING

 Egghead purchases most of its products through a central merchandise buying
 department. Inventory levels and product mix are based upon rates of sale,
 seasonality, and store demographics and size. The Company also special
 orders non-inventoried software products to satisfy customers' special
 needs.

6

Egghead's decision to buy merchandise directly from manufacturers or
 through distributors is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis
 depending on cost, availability, and potential product obsolescence. For
 certain products, Egghead has sufficient sales volume to purchase directly
 from manufacturers at volume discounts. The Company purchases software and
 other products directly from more than 250 manufacturers. Egghead
 minimizes the administrative overhead associated with buying products from
 hundreds of smaller manufacturers by using a limited number of
 distributors.

 Egghead conducts business with major vendors including Microsoft and
 Western Digital. In fiscal years 1996 and 1995, sales derived from
 software programs supplied by Microsoft, Egghead's largest vendor,
 represented approximately 18 and 15 of total net sales, respectively.

 Egghead has certain exchange and return privileges with many of its
 vendors, which typically include time, volume, and other limitations.
 These exchange and return privileges allow the Company to reduce the risk
 of loss resulting from obsolete and defective merchandise.

 SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR COMPUTER SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND RELATED SUPPLIES

 Sales by Egghead and other similar resellers are dependent upon the
 continued purchase and expanded use of home and home office personal
 computers, as well as the continued development of personal computer
 software. A long-term decline in the purchase or use of home or home
 office personal computers, or an interruption in the continued development
 of personal computer software, would have a material adverse effect on the
 Company's results of operations and financial position.

 DISTRIBUTION

 Most inventory that Egghead purchases is received in one of the Company's
 distribution facilities before it is sent to a customer or to a retail
 store. Some products are sent directly from vendors or distributors to
 stores or customers. The Company's distribution facilities also process
 most returned merchandise. The Company leases a 138,000 square foot
 facility in Sacramento, California and a 125,000 square foot facility in
 Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

 The manner in which microcomputer software products are sold and
 distributed is changing rapidly. Other methods of distribution, such as
 electronic software distribution could have an impact on how the Company
 distributes products in the future.

 COMPETITION

 The business of selling microcomputer software and hardware is intensely
 competitive. The Company currently competes with other "direct sales"
 organizations, other software retailers, computer and office superstores,
 consumer electronic superstores, mass merchandisers, direct response
 companies, computer manufacturers, and software publishers that sell
 directly to end-users through traditional and electronic methods of
 distribution.

 Other software retail competitors include mall-based stores such as
 Electronics Boutique, Babbages, and Software Etc.

7

Computer and office superstores, such as CompUSA, Computer City, Micro
 Center, and Office Depot provide significant competition for Egghead's
 retail stores in the markets in which they are located. These stores are
 very price competitive. Computer superstores typically offer a wide
 product selection, while office superstores have a more limited selection.
 Large computer superstores, like Computer City, offer on-site installation
 of software and hardware upgrades. Some superstores also offer training
 and technical services.

 Consumer electronic superstores, such as Best Buy, Future Shop, and Circuit
 City, are a growing source of competition for the Company's retail stores
 in the markets in which they operate.

 Mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart, Incredible Universe, and Sears, and
 warehouse clubs such as SAM's and Price/Costco, generally concentrate on
 basic software products and carry relatively few titles.

 Direct response businesses, such as MicroWarehouse, Programmers Paradise,
 and PC Connection, are another important channel for software sales.
 MicroWarehouse sells their products internationally, and has experienced
 significant growth in international markets.

 Many superstores and computer manufacturers sell PCs to consumers with
 custom-installed hardware and pre-loaded software. This bundling of
 products is very convenient for the consumer, and eliminates many of the
 technical difficulties involved with the installation of software or
 hardware.

 Software publishers continue to directly market and sell to end-users. It
 is also becoming more common for software publishers to distribute software
 over electronic communications networks. Such networks provide the
 convenience of allowing the customer to purchase software products directly
 from their home or office. However, distribution directly by a publisher
 does not provide the customer with a broad selection, personal assistance
 from the sales force, or a full demonstration of the product prior to
 purchase. There has also been a continuing trend of software publishers
 offering new software products at deeply discounted introductory prices.

 Because the microcomputer software market is very competitive, software
 resellers typically have low gross margins and operating income as a
 percentage of sales. Therefore, the Company's profitability is highly
 dependent upon effective internal operating and cost control and the
 ability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in industry trends.

 EMPLOYEES

 At March 30, 1996, Egghead had approximately 2,300 employees, (including
 temporary employees) consisting of approximately 1,800 retail personnel
 (including direct response), 200 distribution center employees, and 300
 headquarters personnel. Employees are not represented by a collective
 bargaining unit.

TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES

 "EGGHEAD-Registered Trademark-", "EGGHEAD DISCOUNT SOFTWARE-Registered
 Trademark-", "EGG CARTON-Registered Trademark-", "EGGSPERT-Registered
 Trademark-", the "PROFESSOR EGGHEAD-Registered Trademark-" design, and
 "EGGCESSORIES-Registered Trademark-", are registered in the United States
 Patent and Trademark Office as service marks or trademarks of the Company.
 The Company also does business under the trade names "Egghead Software",
 "Egghead Discount Software", and "Mac's Place at Egghead." In addition,
 the Company is the owner of a number of common law trademarks and service
 marks, including "SOFTWARE ASSET MANAGEMENT-SM-", "SAM-SM-", "CUE-SM-",
 "EGGHEAD-Registered Trademark- EXPRESS-TM-", "ELEKOM-TM-", "EleTrade-TM-", 
 and certain "EGG" combination words, "MAC'S PLACE-SM-," and "MAC'S PLACE AT
 EGGHEAD-SM-." The Company believes the strength of its trademarks and
 service marks benefits its business and intends to continue to protect and
 promote its registered and common law trademarks and service marks.

 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

 Compliance with federal, state, and local laws enacted for protection of
 the environment has had no material effect upon Egghead's capital
 expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not
 anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature
 of its operations and the current focus of such laws.

 The Company leases 163 of its retail stores under leases expiring from
 fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2001. The Company expects those leases with terms
 expiring during fiscal year 1997 could be renewed under substantially
 similar terms. Substantially all of the Company's leases provide for a
 minimum monthly rent that is either constant or adjusts periodically
 throughout the lease term, including renewal periods.

10

The Company leases its distribution facilities in Lancaster, Pennsylvania
 and Sacramento, California; and an additional storage facility in Kent,
 Washington. The Company has a lease for a distribution facility in
 Wilmington, Ohio. The distribution from this facility will be discontinued
 following the CGE sale and management will attempt to sublease the
 facility. The lease terms on the Company's distribution facilities expire
 from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 2000, with renewal options available.

 The Company owns its administrative headquarters building in Spokane,
 Washington, its retail store in Issaquah, Washington and an office building
 in Kalispell, Montana. Approximately 51 of the Spokane facility is being
 leased to SSI pursuant to the Call Center Lease agreement entered into by
 Egghead and SSI in connection with the sale of the CGE division. The lease
 has a three year term with an option for renewal. The Company's direct
 response operation, 1-800-EGGHEAD is located in the Spokane, Washington
 building. The Company plans to sell or lease the building in Kalispell.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS

 GENERAL

 Egghead, Inc. (Egghead or the Company), a reseller of personal computer
 (PC) software, hardware, and related products, serves small businesses and
 individuals through retail outlets and mail order. Egghead's retail stores
 offer a broad in-store selection of products at competitive prices, as well
 as special order capabilities for additional products. On March 30, 1996,
 the Company operated 164 stores located throughout the United States. The
 Company employs a knowledgeable sales force to assist customers in
 selecting software, hardware, and related products. At the end of fiscal
 1996 the Company was operating 19 of its retail stores under a new
 merchandising format which is approximately twice the size of predecessor
 stores and is arranged in a more user-friendly format. The performance of
 these new stores has been mixed and management continues to evaluate
 results while refining the format. While assessing the overall
 contribution of the new merchandising format, management intends to open
 six new stores. Pending such evaluation and refinement of the new format,
 the Company does not intend to open more than six new stores.

 Egghead continues to implement changes to restructure the Company. The
 Company has historically served corporate, governmental and educational
 customers through its corporate, government and education sales (CGE)
 division. On March 25, 1996, the Company announced the sale of the CGE
 division to Software Spectrum, Inc. (SSI), a Texas corporation, for 45.0
 million in cash which did not include CGE division's receivables and
 inventory that Egghead is liquidating in an orderly manner, all of which
 are expected to result in total gross cash proceeds of approximately 90.0
 million. The sale, which was effective May 13, 1996, included a
 Fulfillment Agreement relating to the provision by Egghead to SSI of
 certain support services for a period not to exceed 120 days and a Call
 Center Lease detailing the lease for a period of three years of a portion
 of Egghead's Spokane facility to SSI. Information contained in this filing
 excludes, unless otherwise stated, any data relative to the discontinued
 operations of the CGE division. The sales and gross margin performance of
 the Company's CGE division had declined and selling, general and
 administrative expenses as a percentage of sales had increased in the
 months prior to the sale. The sale of the CGE division will allow
 management to focus on the Company's retail business. See "--Results of
 Operations--DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS."

 In December 1995, Egghead formed Elekom Corporation (ELEKOM), a new
 subsidiary. ELEKOM was formed to develop electronic commerce applications
 and services which link customers and their suppliers. EleTrade, a product
 being developed by ELEKOM, uses Lotus Notes and other notes networks to
 give large organizations an easy-to-use, cost-effective, secure and
 reliable product ordering and order management system for non-production
 goods and services. EleTrade allows companies to create customized
 electronic catalogs with multi-media product information and customer-
 specific pricing. ELEKOM is also developing additional enhancements which
 will automate the internal requisition and approval process and which may
 create better asset/inventory management and allow electronic software
 distribution. ELEKOM, a development stage company, incurred selling,
 general and administrative costs of approximately 1.1 million in fiscal
 1996 and is not expected to have significant sales or distribute products
 in fiscal year 1997.

16

Over the past twelve months, Egghead consolidated into a new corporate
 headquarters location in Spokane, Washington its direct response
 operations, formerly in Kalispell, Montana, and its administrative
 operations, previously located in Issaquah, Washington. The relocation,
 severance and related costs of approximately 4.6 million are included in
 the fiscal 1996 operating results. The Company implemented these changes
 to improve customer service and reduce future operating costs.

 The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year, ending on the Saturday nearest
 March 31 of each year. Fiscal years 1996, 1995, and 1994 each had 52
 weeks. All references herein to fiscal 1996, 1995, and 1994 relate to the
 fiscal years ended March 30, 1996, April 1, 1995, and April 2, 1994
 respectively.

 CERTAIN RISK FACTORS

 In addition to other information contained in this filing, the following
 factors could affect the Company's actual results and could cause such
 results to differ materially from those achieved in the past or expressed
 in the Company's forward-looking statements. When used in this filing, the
 words "expects," "believes," "anticipates," and similar expressions are
 intended to identify forward-looking statements.

 Competition - The personal computer software, hardware and other related
 products retailing industry is highly competitive. Egghead competes with
 other software specialty stores located in malls and in other locations, as
 well as with computer and office superstores, consumer electronic
 superstores, mass merchandisers, direct response businesses and software
 publishers. In addition, there can be no assurance that other methods of
 distribution will not emerge in the future which would result in increased
 competition for Egghead. Increased competition may lead to reduced profit
 margins on personal computer software, hardware and related products, which
 could have an adverse effect on Egghead's results of operations. Certain
 of Egghead's competitors have substantially greater financial and other
 resources than Egghead, which may give them certain competitive advantages.
 See "Business - Competition."

 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations - As is the case with many
 retailers, a significant portion of Egghead's sales will be generated in
 the fiscal quarter which includes the Christmas selling season. As a
 result, the annual earnings of Egghead will be heavily dependent on the
 results of that quarter. Egghead's quarterly results of operations may
 also fluctuate as a result of the amount of sales contributed by new
 stores, the timing of costs associated with the construction and opening of
 these stores, the timing of the closing of any stores, the timing of
 product releases and a variety of other factors.

 Dependence on Suppliers - Egghead expects to purchase a significant number
 of its products from Microsoft and Western Digital. During fiscal 1996 and
 1995, sales derived from products supplied by Microsoft and Western Digital
 accounted for 23.7 and 22.9 , respectively, of Egghead's total net sales.
 The Company believes the loss of Microsoft or Western Digital as a supplier
 could have a material adverse effect on Egghead's business and financial
 results. In addition, Egghead's financial performance is in a large part
 dependent on the terms it obtains from its suppliers. Such terms include
 unit prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market
 development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. If Egghead is
 unable to maintain favorable terms with its suppliers, its results of
 operations could be materially adversely affected. See "Business -
 Merchandising."

17

New Merchandising Store Format - Egghead's ability to open and operate new
 stores profitably will depend upon the success of the recently opened new
 merchandising format stores, the availability of suitable store locations,
 the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, its financial resources and its
 ability to control the operational aspects of its growth. While assessing
 the overall contribution of the new merchandising format, management
 intends to open six new stores. Pending such evaluation and refinement of
 the new format, the Company does not intend to open more than the six new
 stores. See "Business - Retail Operations."

 Dependence on Purchase and Use of Personal Computers and Software - Sales
 by Egghead of personal computer software, hardware and related products
 will be dependent upon the continued purchase and expanded use of home and
 home office personal computers, as well as the continued development of
 personal computer software. A long-term decline in the purchase or use of
 home or home office personal computers, or an interruption in the continued
 development of personal computer software, would have a material adverse
 effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.

 Dependence on Key Personnel - The success of Egghead will also be dependent
 upon its ability to attract, motivate and retain key management personnel
 involved in store operations, merchandising, marketing and administration.
 The loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect
 on Egghead's business and financial results. As of June 28, 1996, the
 Company did not have employment agreements with any officers or directors.

 Development Stage Subsidiary - In December 1995, the Company formed ELEKOM,
 a subsidiary, which is developing electronic commerce applications and
 services which link customers and their suppliers. Selling, general and
 administrative costs of approximately 1.1 million and 407,000 were
 incurred by ELEKOM in fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively. ELEKOM is
 expected to continue to incur costs in development of these products and is
 not expected to make significant sales or distribution of products in
 fiscal 1997. There can be no assurance that ELEKOM will complete
 development of these products, or if completed, that the products will have
 a market or that another similar product will not be already be introduced
 by a competitor. See "Business - General

 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company's forward-
 looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company
 undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to
 such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or
 circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
 unanticipated events.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 OVERVIEW

 Egghead reported a total net loss for continuing and discontinued
 operations of 10.7 million for fiscal 1996 compared to net income of 2.7
 million and a net loss of 514,000 for fiscal years 1995 and 1994,
 respectively. The net loss during fiscal 1996 was due primarily to a
 decrease in sales due to a reduction in the average number of stores in
 full operation during the year, one-time costs of approximately 4.6
 million associated with the relocation of the corporate headquarters, costs
 of rolling out the new format retail stores, and investments of
 approximately 1.1 million in ELEKOM. Fiscal year 1995 net income included
 a one-time theft insurance recovery of 1.65 million, pre-tax, related to
 inventory stolen from retail stores in prior years. Earnings (loss) per
 share for the fiscal years 1996, 1995, and 1994 was (0.62), 0.15, and
 (0.03), respectively.

 CONTINUING OPERATIONS

 Income (loss) from continuing operations includes the results of the
 Company's retail division, direct response divisions, and ELEKOM as well as
 selling, general, and administrative expenses related to these operations.
 The following table shows the relationship of certain items relating to
 continuing operations included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of
 Operations expressed as a percentage of net sales:

NET SALES in fiscal 1996 were 403.8 million, a decrease of 30.2 million
 or 7 from fiscal 1995 net sales of 434.0 million. Fiscal 1995 sales
 increased 60.5 million or 16 from fiscal 1994 sales of 373.5 million.
 Fiscal 1996 sales decreases were affected by a reduction in the average
 number of stores in full operation, which was 166 during fiscal 1996,
 compared to 178 stores during the previous year. Comparable retail store
 sales increased 0.1 in fiscal 1996 compared to fiscal 1995. Comparable
 store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1996 decreased 6.6 
 and 12.5 , respectively, as compared to the fiscal 1995 third and fourth
 quarters. Comparable store sales performance in the fiscal 1997 months of
 April and May have continued this trend with decreases of 7.4 and 6.1 
 over the same periods in fiscal 1996. In fiscal 1995, comparable retail
 store sales increased 21 compared to fiscal 1994. Comparable store sales
 measure sales for stores which were open in both periods being evaluated.
 Because new format stores were opened during fiscal 1996, their sales will
 not impact comparable store sales statistics until they have been active
 during all periods evaluated.

 During fiscal 1996, the Company opened 10 stores, remodeled 10 stores, and
 closed 15 stores, operating a total of 164 stores at March 30, 1996. This
 compares to the 169 stores open at fiscal year end 1995 and 189 stores open
 at fiscal year end 1994. At the end of fiscal 1996, the Company was
 operating 19 of its retail stores under a new merchandising format which is
 approximately twice the size of older format stores and is arranged in a
 more user-friendly format. The performance of these new stores has been
 mixed and management continues to evaluate results while refining the
 format. While assessing the overall contribution of the new merchandising
 format, management intends to open six new stores. Pending such evaluation
 and refinement of the new format, the Company does not intend to open more
 than the six new stores.

 GROSS MARGIN (net sales minus cost of sales, including certain buying,
 occupancy, and distribution costs) as a percentage of net sales was 11.5 
 in fiscal 1996, compared to 12.3 and 13.7 in fiscal years 1995 and 1994,
 respectively. During 1996, gross margins were negatively affected by the
 Company's promotion of Microsoft Windows 95 and a clearance sale during the
 last quarter of the fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of sales
 continues to be affected by industry-wide pricing pressure related to both
 competitors' pricing and vendors' pricing.

 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSE as a percentage of net
 sales was 14.8 in fiscal 1996, compared to 12.4 , and 15.0 in fiscal
 years 1995 and 1994, respectively. The increased expenses in fiscal 1996
 include 4.6 million incurred in connection with the relocation of the
 corporate offices to Spokane and 1.1 million related to development of
 products by ELEKOM. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales not
 including relocation expense or ELEKOM would be 13.3 in fiscal 1996 and
 12.3 in fiscal 1995. The improvement in the fiscal 1995 SG&A expense as a
 percentage of sales compared to fiscal 1994 was due mainly to sales
 increasing at a faster rate than expenses.

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, NET OF AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN COST OF
 SALES, of 7.4 million in fiscal 1996, compared to 7.4 million and 7.6
 million in fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively has remained constant.

 PROVISION FOR SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION of 1.2 million in fiscal 1994
 represents a charge for the settlement and related attorneys' fees, net of
 an insurance recovery, of a shareholders' lawsuit. See note 10 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements.

20

THEFT INSURANCE RECOVERY of 1.65 million in fiscal 1995 represents
 settlement of an insurance claim, net of expenses, for inventory stolen by
 members of a multi-state shoplifting ring from numerous retail stores
 during fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993.

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

 Due to the subsequent sale of the CGE division, all results for the
 operations of the CGE division are reported as a discontinued operation.
 Certain general, administrative and distribution areas have traditionally
 supported all of the Company's business lines. The expenses reflected in
 the discontinued operations results reflect only those activities directly
 related to the CGE business.

 NET SALES for the discontinued operations of CGE declined 65.2 million, or
 15.2 from 428.5 million to 363.3 million in fiscal 1996. Fiscal 1995
 net sales were 23.7 million, or 5.9 greater than net sales of 404.8
 million in fiscal 1994.

 GROSS MARGIN for CGE (net sales minus cost of sales, including certain
 buying, occupancy, and distribution costs) as a percentage of net sales was
 10.1 in fiscal 1996, compared to 11.3 and 12.8 in fiscal years 1995 and
 1994, respectively

 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSE as a percentage of net
 sales was 9.2 in fiscal 1996, compared to 8.6 , and 8.3 in fiscal years
 1995 and 1994, respectively.

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, NET OF AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN COST OF
 SALES, was 2.3 million in fiscal 1996, compared to 2.0 million and 1.1
 million in fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively.

 OPERATING INCOME, as a result of the foregoing factors, was 0.9 million in
 fiscal 1996, compared to 7.1 million and 12.8 million in fiscal years
 1995 and 1994, respectively

 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, was 0.6 million in fiscal 1996 compared to
 9.8 million and 12.9 million in fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Cash and cash equivalents increased 7.0 million from 42.6 million at the
 end of fiscal 1995, to 49.6 million at the end of fiscal 1996. The
 increase was due principally to a 13.8 million decrease in inventory, a
 14.9 million increase in accounts payable, all of which were partially
 offset by 16.2 million of additions to property and equipment. In
 addition, the Company had cash losses of 1.2 million in fiscal 1996,
 compared to cash income of 14.3 million in fiscal 1995.

 Net accounts receivable increased 3.6 million from 20.5 million at April
 1, 1995, to 24.1 million at March 30, 1996. The increase is due primarily
 to an increase of approximately 2.6 million in amounts due from vendors.

 Merchandise inventories decreased 13.8 million, or 11 , from 98.5 million
 at the end of fiscal 1995, to 84.7 million at the end of fiscal 1996. The
 decrease is consistent with current sales declines and management's efforts
 to reduce inventory levels.

21

Assets of discontinued operations include all of the current assets of CGE
 as of March 30, 1996 and April 1, 1995, respectively. These amounts are
 primarily trade accounts receivable. See Note 8 of Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Current and non-current deferred income taxes totaling 9.1 million and
 8.4 million at March 30, 1996, and April 1, 1995, respectively, resulted
 from taxes paid on temporary differences which caused taxable income to
 exceed financial reporting income.

 Net property and equipment increased 7.6 million, from 21.9 million at
 the end of fiscal 1995, to 29.5 million at March 30, 1996. The increase
 is principally due to the addition or remodel of 19 new format stores as
 well as improvements to the corporate headquarters building in Spokane.

 Accounts payable increased 14.9 million, from 104.4 million at April 1,
 1995, to 119.3 million at March 30, 1996. The increase in accounts
 payable is primarily attributable to merchandise purchases near the fiscal
 year end and outstanding vendor payables to be offset by product returns.

 During fiscal 1996, the Company financed its working capital requirements
 and capital expenditures with cash provided by operations. Effective
 December 8, 1995, the Company entered into a revolving loan agreement with
 two banks providing for unsecured borrowings of up to 35 million through
 April 30, 1996. Each bank provided a 17.5 million line of credit and one
 bank served as agent for the agreement. The Company could elect interest
 rates on the notes based on the participating banks' rates on certificates
 of deposit, LIBOR, or prime rate. The agreement contained a number of
 covenants, including a restriction on the payment of dividends and
 compliance with certain financial ratios. The Company was not in
 compliance with the net worth covenant at March 30, 1996. The Company had
 no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan agreement at March 30,
 1996. The line was not renewed at expiration.

 Capital expenditures in fiscal 1996 totaled approximately 16.2 million.
 Capital expenditures included leasehold improvements, fixtures, computer
 hardware, software and communications equipment, principally due to the
 remodel or addition of 19 new format stores and the relocation of the
 corporate headquarters. Capital expenditures in fiscal 1995 totaled
 approximately 14.7 million. Capital expenditures included land and a
 building in Spokane, Washington for the corporate headquarters. Other
 expenditures included computer software and communications equipment.

 Cash and cash equivalents at March 30, 1996 were 49.6 million. On May 13,
 1996, the Company also received 45.0 million of gross cash proceeds from
 the sale of CGE to SSI, which did not include the CGE division's
 receivables and inventory that Egghead is liquidating in an orderly manner,
 all of which are expected to result in total gross cash proceeds of
 approximately 90.0 million. The Company expects these balances will be
 adequate to meet future cash requirements for operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
 for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. This new standard requires long-
 lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be evaluated to
 determine whether the carrying amount is recoverable based on estimated
 future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and/or cash to be
 received upon disposal of the assets. The Company will adopt this standard
 in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 and anticipates the effect of the
 adjustment, primarily from goodwill associated with direct response to be a
 charge of approximately 1.3 million before income taxes.

 In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
 Based Compensation. This new standard requires entities to choose either a
 fair valued based method or an intrinsic value based method of accounting
 for all employee stock compensation plans. The Company currently uses and
 plans to continue to use the intrinsic value based method which requires no
 compensation cost to be recognized at the date of the stock compensation
 grant if the option is granted at the current market price. The Company
 will adopt this new standard during fiscal 1997 at which time additional
 footnote disclosure will be required.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of Egghead, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Egghead, Inc. (a
Washington corporation) and subsidiaries as of March 30, 1996 and April 1, 1995,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 30,
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Egghead, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of March 30, 1996 and April 1, 1995, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

All references herein to fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994 relate to the fiscal years
ended March 30, 1996, April 1, 1995, and April 2, 1994, respectively.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 BUSINESS
 Egghead, Inc. sells personal computer software, hardware and related
 products through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, DJ&J Software Corporation
 (DJ&J, d/b/a Egghead Software) and Eggspert Software, Ltd. (Eggspert, a
 Canadian subsidiary), EH Direct, Inc. (EH Direct), Egghead International,
 Inc. (Egghead International), and Elekom Corporation (Elekom). References
 to "the Company" and "Egghead" include Egghead, Inc., its predecessors, and
 its subsidiaries. Eggspert and Egghead International became inactive
 subsidiaries May 13, 1996 following the sale of corporate, government, and
 education (CGE) division to Software Spectrum, Inc. (SSI) SEE NOTE 8.

 CONSOLIDATION
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Egghead, Inc.
 and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, DJ&J, Eggspert, EH Direct, Egghead
 International, and ELEKOM, and include all such adjustments and
 reclassifications necessary to eliminate the effect of significant
 intercompany accounts and transactions. Operating results for Eggspert and
 Egghead International are included in discontinued operations. SEE NOTE
 8.

 ESTIMATES
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
 accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
 financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
 during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
 estimates.

 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
 three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The
 carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the
 short-term maturity of those instruments.

 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION
 Company sales made on credit generally have terms of net 30 days. The
 sales and corresponding trade receivables for inventoried product are
 recorded upon merchandise shipment. The Company records provisions for
 doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances based upon historical
 experience.

 Certain advertising and promotional expenditures are reimbursable from
 suppliers under cooperative advertising and other promotional and market
 development fund arrangements. Amounts qualifying for reimbursement are
 recorded as receivables from the suppliers and as a corresponding reduction
 of net advertising expense in the period the expenditure occurs. Also
 included in accounts receivable are credit card receivables and amounts due
 from vendors for returned inventory and other programs. The Company
 records a provision for uncollectible vendor receivables based upon
 historical experience.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES
 Merchandise inventories are accounted for using the moving weighted average
 cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Egghead
 maintains reserves for the obsolescence of merchandise inventory. These
 reserves totaled approximately 6.7 million and 8.0 million at March 30,
 1996 and April 1, 1995 respectively. Management has developed a plan to
 dispose of this obsolete inventory and believes the reserve is adequate to
 cover any losses on disposition. Inventories on the balance sheet are
 shown net of this reserve.

 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
 Depreciation of equipment, furniture, and fixtures is provided using the
 straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to
 seven years. Depreciation of buildings is provided using the straight-line
 method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 30 years.
 Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided using the straight-line
 method over the lesser of the lease term or the assets' estimated useful
 lives.

 GOODWILL
 Net assets of organizations acquired in purchase transactions are recorded
 at fair value at date of acquisitions. Unidentified intangibles are
 amortized straight line over the estimated life of the remaining long-term
 assets acquired. Unidentified intangibles at March 30, 1996 and April 1,
 1995 were 998,000 and 1.4 million, respectively, net of accumulated
 amortization of 993,000 and 595,000, respectively.

 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
 Outstanding checks included in accounts payable were 9.0 million and
 10.4 million at March 30, 1996 and April 1, 1995, respectively.

 DEFERRED RENT
 Certain store lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases or for
 rent payments to commence at a date later than the date of occupancy. In
 these cases, the Company recognizes the aggregate rent expense on a
 straight-line basis over the lease term beginning when the store opens.

 INCOME TAXES
 The Company determines its income tax accounts in accordance with Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109. Deferred income taxes result
 primarily from temporary differences in the recognition of certain items
 for income tax and financial reporting purposes.

 EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
 Earnings per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number
 of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during
 each period using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares
 result from the assumed exercise of stock options and from the conversion
 of cash related to the employee stock purchase plan into common shares
 based upon the terms of the plan which would have a dilutive effect in
 years where there are earnings. Common equivalent shares had no material
 effect on the computation in fiscal years 1996, 1995, or 1994.

 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 Balance sheet accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
 into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Results
 of operations are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during
 the fiscal year. The results of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on
 translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are
 recorded as a component of retained earnings. Realized gains and losses
 from foreign currency transactions are included in net income.

 OTHER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
 In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
 for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. This new standard requires long-
 lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be evaluated to
 determine whether the carrying amount is recoverable based on estimated
 future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and cash to be
 received upon disposal of the assets. The Company will adopt this standard
 in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 and anticipates the effect of the
 adjustment, primarily from goodwill associated with direct response, to be
 a charge of approximately 1.3 million before income taxes.

 In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
 Based Compensation. This new standard requires entities to choose either a
 fair valued based method or an intrinsic value based method of accounting
 for all employee stock compensation plans. The Company currently uses and
 plans to continue to use the intrinsic value based method which requires no
 compensation cost to be recognized at the date of the stock compensation
 grant if the option is granted at the current market price. The Company
 will adopt this new standard during fiscal 1997 at which time additional
 footnote disclosure will be required.

 FISCAL YEARS
 The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year, ending on the Saturday nearest
 March 31 of each year. Fiscal quarters are such that the first three
 quarters consist of 13 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of the
 remaining 13/14 weeks. Fiscal years 1996, 1995 and 1994 each had 52
 weeks.

NOTE 3 NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS

 Effective December 8, 1995, the Company entered into a revolving loan
 agreement with two banks providing for unsecured borrowings of up to 35
 million through April 30, 1996. Each bank provided a 17.5 million line of
 credit and one bank served as agent for the agreement. The Company could
 elect interest rates on the notes based on the participating banks' rates
 on certificates of deposit, LIBOR, or prime rate. The agreement contained
 a number of covenants, including a restriction on the payment of dividends
 and compliance with certain financial ratios. The Company was not in
 compliance with net worth ratios as of March 30, 1996. The Company had no
 outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan agreement at March 30,
 1996. The line was not renewed at expiration.

 A summary of borrowings under the lines of credit follows (in thousands):

NOTE 5 STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

 The Egghead, Inc. 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan currently provides
 options to acquire the Common Stock of the Company to substantially all
 full-time and certain other employees at the lesser of 85 of the fair
 market value of the Common Stock on August 1 of the first and second plan
 years and July 1 thereafter, or 85 of the fair market value on the
 following July 31 of the first plan year and June 30 of each plan year
 thereafter. Under the plan, a maximum of 650,000 shares were reserved for
 issuance. As of March 30, 1996, there were approximately 340,000 shares
 available for future issuance.

 THE 1993 STOCK OPTION PLAN

 In September 1993, the Company's shareholders approved the 1993 Stock
 Option Plan (the "1993 Plan"), under which 2,000,000 shares of the
 Company's Common Stock were reserved for issuance. The 1993 Plan replaced
 the 1986 Combined Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the "1986
 Combined Plan") under which 2,000,000 shares were originally reserved for
 issuance. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1993 Plan
 was increased by the shares reserved for issuance under the 1986 Combined
 Plan that were not subject to outstanding stock options. Shares presently
 subject to outstanding stock options under the 1986 Combined Plan, which
 subsequently are canceled or will expire, will increase the number of
 shares reserved for issuance under the 1993 Plan. No additional stock
 options will be granted under the 1986 Combined Plan.

 Options granted, exercised, and canceled under the above Plans are
 summarized as follows:

 THE EXECUTIVE PLAN

 In February 1989, the Board of Directors approved four-year employment
 agreements and stock option agreements for three executive officers who are
 no longer with the Company, Stuart Sloan, Ronald Weinstein, and Matthew
 Griffin, whereby the officers' compensation was based on equity incentives.
 Each drew an annual salary of 1 per year during their term of employment.
 Options to acquire up to 1,700,000 shares of common stock are authorized
 under the Plan. As of March 30, 1996, 325,000 shares were available for
 grant and 1,096,324 were subject to outstanding options which have been
 granted to the above named executive officers of the Company at prices
 ranging from 10.38 to 20.00. All outstanding options are vested and
 expire in February 1999. As of March 30, 1996, 278,676 of the options had
 been exercised at 10.38 per share.

NOTE 6 401(K) PLAN

 The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan for the benefit of its employees.
 After six months of full-time employment (more than 1,000 hours), an
 employee is eligible to participate in the plan. Employee contributions
 are matched by the Company at 50 of each employee's contribution up to 4 
 of their compensation. The Company's contributions are fully vested upon
 the completion of two years of service. The Company's contributions were

 Significant supplier
 In fiscal 1996 and 1995, one supplier accounted for sales aggregating
 approximately 71.6 million and 61.0 million, respectively. The loss of
 this supplier could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 business and financial results and condition.

 The Company leases retail stores and distribution facilities under
 operating leases with remaining lives on most leases ranging from one to
 five years. Some leases contain renewal options of one to five years which
 the Company may exercise at the end of the initial lease term. The leases
 generally require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, and certain common
 area maintenance costs.

 Aggregate rental expense, including common area maintenance charges, for
 all operating leases for the fiscal years ended 1996, 1995, and 1994 was
 approximately 15,990,829, 16,769,000 and 18,012,000, respectively. As

NOTE 10 SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION

 On June 9, 1994, the Company announced that it had settled a shareholders'
 lawsuit originally filed against the Company and two former officers who
 were also directors. The action, originally entitled FINUCAN V. EGGHEAD,
 ET AL., was filed in federal court in Seattle in September 1993 and was
 alleged to be brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company's common
 stock between February 11, 1992, and November 18, 1992, (other than the
 individual defendants and other individuals and entities otherwise
 affiliated with the Company). The settlement called for a cash payment by
 the Company of 2.625 million. Payment was made during fiscal 1995. This
 settlement was approved by the United States District Court for the Western
 District of Washington on January 12, 1995. Net of insurance recovery, the
 settlement and related attorneys fees resulted in a pretax charge of 1.2
 million in fiscal year 1994 0.04 per share, net of income tax impact).

 TOTAL SALES-OUT REBATE PROGRAM
 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Total Sales-out Rebate Program is to
increase the sales of Microsoft products. All license types (Select, Microsoft
Open License, Full Package Product, MLPs) are included in measuring performance
against this goal.
 
REBATE PERCENTAGES: The total possible rebate percentage achievable for the
Total Sales-out Rebate Program is [ ] of Qualified Sales for the July -
December, 1995 semester.
 
GOAL DEFINITIONS: The program goals are based upon the following:
 
 - CUSTOMER's historical sales-out of Microsoft products by Microsoft product
 division.
 
 - Microsoft's United States total sales-out goals.
 
 - CUSTOMER's contribution to Microsoft's historical sales.
 
REBATE GOALS: CUSTOMER has a first quarter sales-out goal and a total semester
sales-out goal. CUSTOMER's performance for the first three months of the July
- - -December, 1995 semester will be measured against the first quarter sales-out
goal. At the end of the first quarter, CUSTOMER will receive the percentage of
the eligible rebate earned based on performance against the first quarter goal.
At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be measured on their six-month
performance against the total semester goal. Even if CUSTOMER does not meet 100 
of the first quarter goal, CUSTOMER can still achieve 100 of the semester goal
provided that the semester goal is met at the end of the six-month period.
 
CUSTOMER's Total Sales-out Rebate Program goals are as follows:
 
 - Quarter 1 Goal (July - September, 1995): [ ]
 
 - Semester Goal (July - December, 1995): [ ]
 
SALES-OUT DEFINITIONS/MEASUREMENT: Microsoft Product Sales-out is defined as
those Microsoft net product units sold through CUSTOMER's outlet locations.
CUSTOMER's full packaged product, Microsoft Open License, and upgrade sales-out
units will be measured from the sales-out reported by CUSTOMER to Microsoft.
Licensing sales (Select, Microsoft Maintenance) are captured and generated by
Microsoft's financial systems and included in total sales-out used to measure
product sales-out rebate performance.
 
Microsoft Select 2.x and 1.x and Microsoft Maintenance revenue credit is granted
as Microsoft recognizes the revenue. This occurs when Microsoft has received the
customer's license reporting. Following receipt of reporting, Microsoft bills
the customer/reseller and simultaneously recognizes the revenue.
 
PAYMENT: At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be paid a sales-out rebate
based on performance against the semester goal. If CUSTOMER achieves greater
than sixty percent (60 of the semester sales-out goal, CUSTOMER will receive
the exact achieved percentage of the eligible sales-out rebate up to one hundred
percent (100 ). If CUSTOMER achieves less than sixty percent (60 of the
sales-out rebate goal, CUSTOMER will not receive any portion of the sales-out
rebate. The purpose of this scale is to offer an incentive for accounts to meet
a portion of their goal in the event they cannot achieve the full Microsoft
sales-out goal.

Although Microsoft pays the sales-out rebate ultimately based on performance
against the semester sales-out goal, Microsoft also pays a sales-out rebate at
the end of the first quarter based on performance against the first quarter
goal. Microsoft pays a portion of the rebate after the first quarter to provide
incentive for CUSTOMER to focus on sales-out throughout the entire semester. The
scale for the first quarter payment is the same as the scale for the semester
payment. The first quarter payment amount will be subtracted from the final
semester payment for the sales-out rebate.

REBATE CALCULATIONS AND PAYMENTS: Rebates will be paid in the form of a
Microsoft purchase credit forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarterly
rebate period (i.e. May 15th for January - March, 1996 quarter). Any such Rebate
paid shall be credited against CUSTOMER's account balance. In the event
CUSTOMER's account balance is less than the total Rebate payment, MS may, at its
sole discretion, elect to pay the Rebate in the form of a check. In no case
shall CUSTOMER deduct from invoice any Rebate payment due from MS prior to the
issue of the purchase credit or check. Rebates are calculated by multiplying the
achieved rebate percentage by the total Qualified Sales for the rebate period.
Revenue generated from Microsoft Select Enrollment Forms executed by MS on or
after July 1, 1994, shall be included in calculating CUSTOMER's achievement
toward the Sales-out goal, but shall not be included in CUSTOMER's final total
Qualified Sales for purposes of Rebate payment. Revenue generated from Microsoft
Select Enrollment Forms executed by MS prior to July 1, 1994 will be included in
calculating CUSTOMER's achievement towards the sales-out goal and will also be
eligible for a Grandfathered rebate. Rebate payment for such Select Enrollment
Forms shall be in the form of a purchase credit forty-five (45) days after the
end of each quarterly rebate period.
 
PURCHASES THROUGH DISTRIBUTION: CUSTOMER's full packaged product and MLP
purchases through distribution will be subtracted from CUSTOMER's Qualified
Sales for purposes of Rebate payment.
 
PRODUCT AVAILABILITY: If Microsoft is unable to ship a CURRENT VERSION of a
product for any ten (10) consecutive business days, CUSTOMER's purchases through
distribution of those SKUs will count toward CUSTOMER's Qualified Sales for
purchases of Rebate payment.
 
All copies of eligible purchase orders placed through distribution along with a
copy of the Microsoft Stock Out Report must be sent to Microsoft no later than
fifteen (15) days following the quarter end. Please send purchase order copies

 product can be advertised, merchandised and/or promoted immediately after
 such announcement, provided that all such promotions clearly state that
 the product is not yet available for purchase.

 period of up to twelve months, a Street Date product to any individual
 sales office, retail store, or outlet which Microsoft in its sole
 discretion has determined to be in violation of the Street Date
 Requirements.
 
In the event CUSTOMER violates the Street Date for any special products
specified in a Microsoft Street Date letter, CUSTOMER shall forfeit up to the
entire Compliance Rebate for the six month Rebate period in which the violation
occurred.

SELL-THROUGH OF COMPETITOR'S PRODUCTS IN THE WINDOWS SPREADSHEET CATEGORY.
 SALES-OUT REBATE PROGRAMS
 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVE: The objective of all Sales-out Rebate Programs is to
increase the sales of Microsoft products. All license types (Select, Microsoft
Open License, Full Package Product, MLPs) are included in measuring performance
against this goal, however, the Rebate is paid on full packaged product and MOLP
sales only.
 
REBATE GOALS: CUSTOMER has first quarter sales-out goals and total semester
sales-out goals. CUSTOMER's performance for the first three months of the
January - June, 1996, semester will be measured against the first quarter
sales-out goals. At the end of the first quarter, CUSTOMER will receive the
percentage of the eligible rebates earned based on performance against the first
quarter goals. At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be measured on their
six-month performance against the total semester goals. Even if CUSTOMER does
not meet 100 of the first quarter goals, CUSTOMER can still achieve 100 of the
semester goals provided that the semester goals are met at the end of the
six-month period.
 
SALES-OUT DEFINITIONS/MEASUREMENT: MS Product Sales-out is defined as those MS
net product units sold through CUSTOMER's outlet locations. CUSTOMER's full
packaged product, Microsoft Open License, and upgrade sales-out units will be
measured from the sales-out reported by CUSTOMER to MS. Licensing sales (Select,
Microsoft Maintenance) are captured and generated by MS' financial systems and
included in total sales-out used to measure product sales-out rebate
performance.
 
 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED
 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE REBATE AND PAGE H7
MARKETING FUND ADDENDUM TO THE
MICROSOFT 1995/1996 CHANNEL AGREEMENT
 
Any Microsoft Select 2.x and 1.x and Microsoft Maintenance revenue credit is
granted as MS recognizes the revenue. This occurs when MS has received the
customer's license reporting. Following receipt of reporting, MS bills the
customer/reseller and simultaneously recognizes the revenue.
 
PAYMENT: At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be paid sales-out rebates
based on performance against the semester goals. If CUSTOMER achieves greater
than sixty percent (60 of each semester sales-out goal, CUSTOMER will receive
the exact achieved percentage of the eligible sales-out rebate up to one hundred
percent (100 ). If CUSTOMER achieves less than sixty percent (60 of any
sales-out rebate goal, CUSTOMER will not receive any portion of that sales-out
rebate.
 
Although MS pays the sales-out rebate ultimately based on performance against
the semester sales-out goal, Microsoft also pays a sales-out rebate at the end
of the first quarter based on performance against the first quarter goal.
Microsoft pays a portion of the rebate after the first quarter to provide
incentive for CUSTOMER to focus on sales-out throughout the entire semester. The
scale for the first quarter payment is the same as the scale for the semester
payment. The first quarter payment amount will be subtracted from the final
semester payment for the sales-out rebate.
 
EXAMPLE: IF CUSTOMER HAS A QUARTERLY TOTAL SALES OUT GOAL OF 1,000,000 AND A
SEMESTER TOTAL SALES OUT GOAL 2,500,000, AND CUSTOMER SELLS 800,000 OVER THE
FIRST QUARTER PERIOD AND 2,600,000 OVER THE ENTIRE SEMESTER PERIOD, CUSTOMER

Microsoft purchase credit forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarterly
rebate period (i.e. May 15th for the January - March, 1996 quarter). Any such
Rebate paid shall be credited against CUSTOMER's account balance. In the event

sole discretion, elect to pay the Rebate in the form of a check. In no case
shall CUSTOMER deduct from invoice any Rebate payment due from MS prior to the
issue of the purchase credit or check. Rebates are calculated by multiplying the
achieved rebate percentage by the total Qualified Select Sales for the rebate
period. All Microsoft Select revenue will be included in calculating CUSTOMER's
performance against the Select Rebate goals. Revenue generated from Microsoft
Select Enrollment Forms executed by MS prior to July 1, 1994, shall be included

not be included in CUSTOMER's final total Qualified Select Sales for purposes of
the Rebate payment. Only revenue generated from Microsoft Select Enrollment
Forms executed by MS on or after July 1, 1994 (excluding any Microsoft Select
Maintenance) will be included in CUSTOMER's final total Qualified Select Sales
for purposes of the Rebate payment.

PAYMENT. If such written notice is not provided within thirty (30) days,

 the product can be advertised, merchandised and/or promoted immediately
 after such announcement, provided that all such promotions clearly state
 that the product is not yet available for purchase.

In the event CUSTOMER violates the Street Date for any special products
specified in a Microsoft Street Date letter, CUSTOMER shall forfeit up to the
entire Compliance Rebate for the six month Rebate period in which the violation
occurred.
 
Should CUSTOMER fail to comply with the Street Date Requirements, Microsoft may
also, for a period of up to twelve (12) months, withhold shipments to CUSTOMER
of future product until the Street Date of such product.
 
Should CUSTOMER wish to report a Street Date violation, CUSTOMER may fax a copy

5. SELECT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM
 
CUSTOMER shall participate in and obtain certification in the Microsoft Select
Certification Program for no less than two (2) CUSTOMER Select administration
contacts by June 30, 1996.
 
COMPLIANCE REBATE CALCULATION: The Microsoft Compliance Rebate will be
calculated on a monthly basis. If CUSTOMER has met all of the Compliance Rebate
criteria in a given month, CUSTOMER will be entitled to a Rebate payment equal
to one percent (1 of that month's total Qualified Select Sales. The rebate
payment will be made forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarterly rebate
period.
 
 SALES-OUT REBATE PROGRAMS
 
REBATE GOALS: CUSTOMER has first quarter sales-out goals and total semester
sales-out goals. CUSTOMER's performance for the first three months of the
January - June, 1996, semester will be measured against the first quarter
sales-out goals. At the end of the first quarter, CUSTOMER will receive the
percentage of the eligible rebates earned based on performance against the first
quarter goals. At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be measured on their
six-month performance against the total semester goals. Even if CUSTOMER does
not meet 100 of the first quarter goals, CUSTOMER can still achieve 100 of the
semester goals provided that the semester goals are met at the end of the
six-month period.
 
SALES-OUT DEFINITIONS/MEASUREMENT: MS Product Sales-out is defined as those MS
net product units sold through CUSTOMER's outlet locations. For the Business
Systems sales-out goal, CUSTOMERs full packaged product, Microsoft Open License,
and upgrade sales-out units will be measured from the sales-out reported by
CUSTOMER to MS. For the Maintenance and Enterprises sales-out goals, only the
appropriate Select license will be measured. Licensing sales (Select, Microsoft
Maintenance) are captured and generated by MS' financial systems and included in
total sales-out used to measure product sales-out rebate performance.
 
Any Microsoft Select 2.x and 1.x and Microsoft Maintenance revenue credit is
granted as MS recognizes the revenue. This occurs when MS has received the
customer's license reporting. Following receipt of reporting, MS bills the
customer/reseller and simultaneously recognizes the revenue.
 
PAYMENT: At the end of the semester, CUSTOMER will be paid sales-out rebates
based on performance against the semester goals. If CUSTOMER achieves greater
than sixty percent (60 of each semester sales-out goal, CUSTOMER will receive
the exact achieved percentage of the eligible sales-out rebate up to one hundred
percent (100 ). If CUSTOMER achieves less than sixty percent (60 of any
sales-out rebate goal, CUSTOMER will not receive any portion of that sales-out
rebate.
 
Although MS pays the sales-out rebate ultimately based on performance against
the semester sales-out goal, MS also pays a sales-out rebate at the end of the
first quarter based on performance against the first quarter goal. MS pays a
portion of the rebate after the first quarter to provide incentive for CUSTOMER
to focus on sales-out throughout the entire semester. The scale for the first
quarter payment is the same as the scale for the semester payment. The first
quarter payment amount will be subtracted from the final semester payment for
the sales-out rebate.

Performance against the Client to Server goal will be measured against all
license types of Microsoft Windows NT including full packaged product, MLPs,

Server Ratio, CUSTOMER's achievement against the Business Systems goal will be
based on CUSTOMER's performance against the Business Systems revenue goal.

license types.
 
CUSTOMER has a first quarter rebate goal and a total semester rebate goal.
CUSTOMER's performance for the first three months of the July - December, 1995
semester will be measured against the first quarter rebate goal. At the end of

semester goal, Microsoft also pays a rebate at the end of the first quarter
based on performance against the first quarter goal. Microsoft pays a portion of

semester will be measured against the first quarter rebate goal. At the end of
the first quarter, CUSTOMER will receive the percentage of the eligible rebate
based on performance against the first quarter goal. At the end of the semester,

CUSTOMER will be measured on their six-month performance against the total
semester goal. Even if CUSTOMER does not meet 100 of the first quarter goal,
CUSTOMER can still achieve 100 of the semester goal provided that the semester
goal is met at the end of the six-month period.
 
CUSTOMER's Maintenance Rebate Program goals are as follows:
 
 - Quarter 1 Goal (July - September, 1995): [ ]
 
 - Semester Goal (July - December, 1995): [ ]
 
PAYMENT: CUSTOMER will be paid a Maintenance rebate based on performance
against the semester goal at the end of the semester. If CUSTOMER achieves
greater than eighty percent (80 of the semester Maintenance rebate goal,
CUSTOMER will receive the exact achieved percentage of the eligible Maintenance
rebate up to one hundred percent (100 ). If CUSTOMER achieves less than eighty
percent (80 of the Maintenance rebate goal, CUSTOMER will not receive any
portion of the Maintenance rebate. The purpose of this scale is to offer an
incentive for accounts to meet a portion of their goal in the event they cannot
achieve the full Microsoft Maintenance goal.
 
Although Microsoft pays the rebate ultimately based on performance against the
semester goal, Microsoft pays a rebate at the end of the first quarter based on
performance against the first quarter goal. Microsoft pays a portion of the
rebate after the first quarter as an incentive for CUSTOMER to focus on the
Maintenance rebate program throughout the entire semester. The scale for the
first quarter payment is the same as the scale for the semester payment. The
first quarter payment amount will be subtracted from the final semester rebate
payment. However, if CUSTOMER does not meet the minimum attainment for the
semester goal, Microsoft will not seek reimbursement of the first quarter rebate
payment.

 ARTICLE I. PURPOSES

The purposes of the Egghead, Inc. Restated Nonemployee Director Stock Option
Plan (the "Plan") are to attract and retain the services of experienced and
knowledgeable nonemployee directors of Egghead, Inc. (the "Corporation") and to
provide an incentive for such directors to increase their proprietary interests
in the Corporation's long-term success and progress.

 ARTICLE II. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

Subject to adjustment in accordance with Article VI hereof, the total number of
shares of the Corporation's common stock (the "Common Stock") for which options
may be granted under the Plan is 450,000 (the "Shares"). The Shares shall be
shares presently authorized but unissued or subsequently acquired by the
Corporation and shall include shares representing the unexercised portion of any
option granted under the Plan that expires or terminates without being exercised
in full.

 ARTICLE III. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

The administrator of the Plan (the "Plan Administrator") shall be the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"). Subject to the terms of the Plan,
the Plan Administrator shall have the power to construe the provisions of the
Plan, to determine all questions arising thereunder, and to adopt and amend such
rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as it may deem
desirable. No member of the Plan Administrator shall participate in any vote by
the Plan Administrator on any matter materially affecting the rights of any such
member under the Plan.

 ARTICLE IV. PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN

Each member of the Board elected or appointed who is not otherwise an employee
of the Corporation or any parent or subsidiary corporation (an "Eligible
Director") shall automatically receive the following options:

1. INITIAL GRANTS
(a) Each Eligible Director who is in office on the day the Plan is adopted by
the Board and who continues in office after the annual meeting of shareholders
to be held in 1993 (the "1993 Annual Meeting") shall automatically receive a
grant of an option to purchase 9,000 Shares on the day this Plan is adopted by
the Board.
(b) Each Eligible Director who is elected for the first time at the 1993 Annual
Meeting or at any subsequent annual meeting of shareholders prior to June 7,
1995 shall automatically receive a grant of an option to purchase 9,000 Shares
on the day after such annual meeting.
(c) Each Eligible Director who is elected for the first time at an annual
meeting of shareholders after June 7, 1995 shall automatically receive a grant
of an option to purchase 22,500 Shares on the day after such annual meeting.
(d) Each Eligible Director who is appointed or elected after June 7, 1995 other
than at an annual meeting of shareholders shall, on the day of such appointment
or election, automatically receive a grant of an option to purchase that number
of Shares equal to 7,500 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 12
minus the number of whole months which have elapsed since the last annual
meeting of shareholders and the denominator of which is 12; provided, however,
that such option shall vest in full on the day of the first annual meeting of
shareholders to occur after the grant.

51

2. SUPPLEMENTAL INITIAL GRANTS
Each Eligible Director who is in office on June 7, 1995 shall automatically
receive a grant of an option to purchase 13,500 Shares on that date.

3. ADDITIONAL GRANTS
Each Eligible Director who holds an option granted on or after June 7, 1995 that
has become fully vested shall automatically receive a grant of an option to
purchase 22,500 Shares on the day after the annual meeting of shareholders at
which such prior option has become fully vested.
If insufficient Shares remain available for issuance under the Plan to fully
fund one or more grants to be made under this Article IV on the same grant date,
then such grant or grants shall be made as follows: (i) a single Initial Grant
shall be made for the remaining number of Shares reserved under this Article IV
on that grant date; and (ii) multiple Initial and/or Additional Grants shall be
reduced ratably so that the aggregate number of Shares subject to all such
grants equals the remaining number of Shares available for issuance under this
Article IV on that grant date. If the Company's shareholders do not approve the
amendment to the Plan dated June 7, 1995, all grants made pursuant to
paragraphs 1(c), 1(d), 2 and 3 above shall be deemed null and void.

 ARTICLE V. OPTION TERMS

Each option granted to an Eligible Director under the Plan and the issuance of
Shares thereunder shall be subject to the following terms:

1. OPTION AGREEMENT
Each option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an option agreement (an
"Agreement") duly executed on behalf of the Corporation. Each Agreement shall
comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Any
Agreement may contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Plan Administrator.

2. OPTION EXERCISE PRICE
The option exercise price for an option granted under the Plan shall be the fair
market value of the Shares covered by the option at the time the option is
granted. For purposes of the Plan, "fair market value" shall be the average of
the high and low sales prices at which the Common Stock was sold on such date as
reported by the Nasdaq National Market on such date or, if no Common Stock was
traded on such date, on the next preceding date on which Common Stock was so
traded.

52

4. TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTION
Each option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time; provided, however, that no fewer than 100 Shares (or the remaining Shares
then purchasable under the option, if less than 100 Shares) may be purchased
upon any exercise of option rights hereunder and that only whole Shares will be
issued pursuant to the exercise of any option.
Any option may be exercised by given written notice, signed by the person
exercising the option, to the Corporation stating the number of Shares with
respect to which the option is being exercised, accompanied by payment in full
for such Shares, which payment may be in whole or in part (i) in cash or by
check or (ii) in shares of Common Stock already owned for at least six
(6) months by the person exercising the option, valued at fair market value at
the time of such exercise.

5. TERM OF OPTIONS
Each option shall expire ten (10) years from the date of the granting thereof,
but shall be subject to earlier termination as follows:
(a) In the event that an optionee ceases to be a director of the Corporation
for any reason other than the death of the optionee, the options granted to such
optionee may be exercised by him or her only within one (1) year after the date
such optionee ceases to be a director of the Corporation and only as to that
portion of the option that has become vested as of the date of such cessation.
(b) In the event of the death of an optionee, whether during the optionee's
service as a director or during the one (1) year period referred to in
Section 5(a), the options granted to such optionee shall be exercisable, to the
extent vested as provided in Section 5(a) or as of the date of death, as the
case may be, and such options shall expire unless exercised within one (1) year
after the date of the optionee's death, by the legal representatives or the
estate of such optionee, by any person or persons whom the optionee shall have
designated in writing on forms prescribed by and filed with the Corporation or,
if no such designation has been made, by the person or persons to whom the
optionee's rights have passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

6. TRANSFERABILITY
During a optionee's lifetime, an option may be exercised only by the optionee.
Options granted under the Plan and the rights and privileges conferred thereby
shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process and may not be
transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any manner (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) other than by will or by the applicable laws of
descent and distribution except that, to the extent permitted by applicable law
and Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Plan Administrator may permit a
recipient of an option to designate in writing during the optionee's lifetime a
beneficiary to receive and exercise options in the event of the optionee's death
as provided in Section 5(b)). Any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any option under the Plan or of any right or
privilege conferred thereby, contrary to the provisions of the Plan, or the sale
or levy or any attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges
conferred hereby, shall be null and void.

7. PARTICIPANT'S OR SUCCESSOR'S RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
Neither the recipient of an option under the Plan nor the optionee's
successor(s) in interest shall have any rights as a stockholder of the
Corporation with respect to any Shares subject to an option granted to such
person until such person becomes a holder of record of such Shares.

8. LIMITATION AS TO DIRECTORSHIP
Neither the Plan nor the granting of an option nor any other action taken
pursuant to the Plan shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or
understanding, express or implied, that an optionee has a right to continue as a
director for any period of time or at any particular rate of compensation.

9. REGULATORY APPROVAL AND COMPLIANCE
The Corporation shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates
for Shares upon the exercise of an option granted under the Plan, or record as a
holder of record of Shares the name of the

53

individual exercising an option under the Plan, without obtaining to the
complete satisfaction of the Plan Administrator the approval of all regulatory
bodies deemed necessary by the Plan Administrator, and without complying, to the
Plan Administrator's complete satisfaction, with all rules and regulations under
federal, state or local law deemed applicable by the Plan Administrator.

 ARTICLE VI. CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS

The aggregate number and class of Shares for which options may be granted under
the Plan, the number and class of Shares covered by each automatic grant and
each outstanding option and the exercise price per Share thereof (but not the
total price) shall all be proportionately adjusted for any stock dividends,
stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations or exchanges of shares, split-ups,
split-offs, spinoffs, or other similar changes in capitalization. Upon the
effective date of a dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, or of a
reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Corporation with one or more
corporations that results in more than 20 of the outstanding voting shares of
the Corporation being owned by one or more affiliated corporations or other
affiliated entities, or of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets or
more than 20 of the then outstanding shares of the Corporation to another
corporation or other entity, this Plan and all options granted hereunder shall
terminate. In the event of such dissolution, liquidation, reorganization,
merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or transfer of stock, each optionee
shall be entitled, for a period of twenty days prior to the effective date of
such transaction, to purchase the full number of shares under his or her option
which he or she otherwise would have been entitled to purchase during the
remaining term of such option.
Adjustments under this Article VI shall be made by the Plan Administrator, whose
determination shall be final. In the event of any adjustment in the number of
Shares covered by any option, any fractional Shares resulting from such
adjustment shall be disregarded and each such option shall cover only the number
of full Shares resulting from such adjustment.

 ARTICLE VII. EXPENSES OF THE PLAN

All costs and expenses of the adoption and administration of the Plan shall be
borne by the Corporation; none of such expenses shall be charged to any
optionee.

 ARTICLE VIII. EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION OF THE PLAN

The Plan became effective on June 16, 1993. The Plan shall continue in effect
until it is terminated by action of the Board or the Corporation's shareholders,
but such termination shall not affect the then outstanding terms of any options.

 ARTICLE IX. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN

The Board may amend, terminate or suspend the Plan at any time, in its sole and
absolute discretion; provided, however, that if required to qualify the Plan
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, no
amendment may be made more than once every six (6) months that would change the
amount, price, timing or vesting of the options, other than to comply with
changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; and provided, further, that if required to
qualify the Plan under Rule 16b-3, no amendment that would
(a) materially increase the number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan,
(b) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in
the Plan, or
(c) otherwise materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under
the Plan shall be made without the approval of the Corporation's shareholders.

 ARTICLE X. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 16b-3

It is the intention of the Corporation that the Plan comply in all respects with
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and that Plan
participants remain disinterested persons ("Disinterested Persons") for purposes
of administering other employee benefit plans of the Corporation and having such
other plans be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, if any
Plan provision is later found not to be in compliance with Rule 16b-3 or if any
Plan

54

provision would disqualify Plan participants from remaining Disinterested
Persons, that provision shall be deemed null and void, and in all events the
Plan shall be construed in favor of its meeting the requirements of Rule 16b-3.
