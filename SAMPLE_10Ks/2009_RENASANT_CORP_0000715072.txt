 PART I This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain or incorporate by reference statements which may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and that
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include
those risks identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K and significant fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, economic recession, significant changes in the federal and state legal and regulatory environment, significant
underperformance in our portfolio of outstanding loans and competition in our markets. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to
future operating results over time. The information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is as of February 28, 2009, unless
otherwise indicated herein. ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Renasant Corporation (referred to herein as
the Company, we, our, or us ), a Mississippi corporation incorporated in 1982, owns and operates Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking association with operations in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee,
and Renasant Insurance, Inc., a Mississippi corporation with operations in Mississippi. Renasant Insurance, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renasant Bank. Renasant Bank is referred to herein as the Bank and Renasant Insurance, Inc.
is referred to herein as Renasant Insurance. Our vision is to be the financial services advisor and provider of choice in each
community we serve. With this vision in mind, management has organized the branch banks into community banks using a franchise concept. The franchise approach empowers community bank presidents to execute their own business plans in order to achieve
our vision. Specific performance measurement tools are available to assist these presidents in determining the success of their plan implementation. A few of the ratios used in measuring the success of their business plan include: 

return on average assets 
 
 net interest margin and spread 
 
 the efficiency ratio 
 
 fee income shown as a percentage of loans and deposits 
 
 loan and deposit growth 
 
 the number and type of services provided per household 
 
 net charge-offs to average loans 
 
 the percentage of loans past due and nonaccruing 
 While we have preserved decision-making at a local level, we have centralized our legal,
accounting, investment, loan review, human resources, audit and data processing functions. The centralization of these processes enables us to maintain consistent quality of these functions and achieve certain economies of scale. Our vision is further validated through our core values. These values state that (1) employees are our greatest assets, (2) quality is not
negotiable and (3) clients trust is foremost. Centered on these values was the development of five different objectives that are the focal point of our strategic plan. Those objectives include: (1) client satisfaction and
development, (2) financial soundness and profitability, (3) growth, (4) employee satisfaction and development and (5) shareholder satisfaction and development. Members of our Board of Directors also serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Responsibility for the management of our Bank remains with the Board of Directors and officers of
the Bank; however, management services rendered by the Company to the Bank are intended to supplement internal management and expand the scope of banking services normally offered by the Bank. Mergers On July 1, 2007, the Company merged
with Capital Bancorp, Inc. Capital ), a bank holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The Company issued approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately 56.0 million in cash as merger
consideration to the shareholders of Capital. The Company used the proceeds of its public offering of 2.76 million shares of its common stock completed in June 2007 to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration. Capital Bank 
Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital

with seven banking offices in the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area, was merged into the Bank immediately after the
consummation of the merger of Capital into the Company. Operations We have four reportable segments: a Mississippi community bank, a Tennessee community bank, an Alabama community bank and an insurance agency. Financial information about our segments, including information with
respect to revenues from external customers, profit or loss and total assets for each segment, is contained in Note N, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data. The description of the operations of the Bank immediately below applies to the operations of each of our three banking segments. Operations of the Bank Substantially all of our business activities are conducted through, and substantially all of our
assets and revenues are derived from, the Bank, which is a community bank offering a complete range of banking and financial services to individuals and to small to medium-size businesses. These services include checking and savings accounts,
business and personal loans, interim construction and residential mortgage loans, student loans, equipment leasing, as well as safe deposit and night depository facilities. Automated teller machines are located throughout our market area. Our
Internet Banking product and our call center also provide 24-hour banking services. Accounts receivable financing is also available to qualified businesses. On February 28, 2009, we had 63 banking and financial services offices located throughout our markets in north and north central Mississippi, west and middle Tennessee, and north and north central Alabama.
 Lending Activities . Income generated by our lending activities, in the form of both interest income and loan-related fees,
comprises a substantial portion of our revenue, accounting for approximately 68.03 , 71.61 and 69.24 of our total gross revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total gross revenues consist of interest income on a fully taxable equivalent
basis and noninterest income. Our lending philosophy is to minimize credit losses by following strict credit approval standards, diversifying our loan portfolio and conducting ongoing review and management of the loan portfolio. The following is a
description of each of the principal types of loans in our loan portfolio, the relative risk of each type of loan and the steps we take to reduce credit risk. A further discussion of our risk reduction policies and procedures can be found in
Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Risk Management Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses. We have omitted a discussion of lease financing,
as such financing comprised only approximately 0.07 of our portfolio at December 31, 2008. Commercial, Financial and Agricultural Loans . Commercial, financial and agricultural loans (referred to as commercial loans ), which accounted for approximately 12.35 of our
total loans at December 31, 2008, are customarily granted to established local business customers in our market area on a fully collateralized basis to meet their credit needs. Many of these loans have terms allowing the loan to be extended for
periods of between one and five years. Loans are usually structured either to fully amortize over the term of the loan or to balloon after the third year or fifth year of the loan, typically with an amortization period not to exceed 15 years. The
terms and loan structure are dependent on the collateral and strength of the borrower. The loan-to-value ratios range from 50 to 80 , depending on the type of collateral. Commercial lending generally involves different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction loans. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment
or other business assets, the repayment of these types of loans depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower (and any guarantors). Thus, the general business conditions of the local economy and the local business
borrower s ability to sell its products and services, thereby generating sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions, are the chief considerations when assessing the risk of a commercial loan. The
liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may, among other things, be obsolete or of limited use. To manage these risks, the Bank s policy is to secure its commercial
loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and any other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available. In addition, we actively monitor certain financial measures of the borrower, including advance rate, cash flow, collateral
value and other appropriate credit factors. We employ the use of commercial loan credit scoring models for smaller level commercial loans.

 Real Estate 
Construction . Our Real Estate Construction loans construction loans represented approximately 9.56 of our total loans at December 31, 2008. Our construction loan portfolio consists of loans for
the construction of single family residential properties, multi-family properties and commercial projects. Maturities for construction loans generally range from 6 to 12 months for residential property and from 12 to 24 months for non-residential
and multi-family properties. Construction lending entails significant additional risks compared to residential mortgage or commercial real estate lending. A significant additional risk is that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the
property under construction, which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and to calculate related loan-to-value ratios. To
minimize the risks associated with construction lending, we limit loan-to-value ratios to 85 of when-completed appraised values for owner-occupied and investor-owned residential or commercial properties. Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage . We
are active in the Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage area (referred to as residential real estate loans ), with approximately 35.02 of our total loans at December 31, 2008 being residential real estate loans. We offer both first
and second mortgages on residential real estate and loans for the preparation of residential real property prior to construction. In addition, we offer home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the
residences of borrowers for purchases, refinances, home improvements, education and other personal expenditures. Both fixed and variable rate loans are offered with competitive terms and fees. Originations of residential real estate loans are
generated through either retail efforts in our branches or wholesale marketing, which involves obtaining mortgage referrals from third-party mortgage brokers. We attempt to minimize the risk associated with residential real estate loans by strictly
scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower; typically, we also limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio. We retain loans for our
portfolio when the Bank has sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of established customers and when rates are favorable to retain the loans. We also originate residential real estate loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market
to third party private investors. These loans are collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate and are sold with servicing rights released. Mortgage loan originations to be sold are locked in at a contractual rate with third party
private investors, and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. The Company
does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans. We also offer home equity loans or lines of credit as an option to
borrowers who elect to utilize the accumulated equity in their homes by borrowing money through either a first or second lien home equity loan or line of credit. We limit our exposure to second lien home equity loans or lines of credit, which
inherently carry a higher risk of loss upon default, by limiting these types of loans to borrowers with high credit scores. Real Estate Commercial Mortgage . Our Real Estate Commercial Mortgage loans commercial real estate loans represented
approximately 40.14 of our total loans at December 31, 2008. We offer commercial real estate loans to developers of commercial properties for purposes of site acquisition and preparation and other development prior to actual construction. In
addition, loans in which the owner develops a property with the intention of occupying it are also included in commercial real estate loans. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful development, operation and management
of the properties, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as a whole, in addition to the borrower s ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay us. If our estimate
of value proves to be inaccurate, we may not be able to obtain full repayment on the loan in the event of default and foreclosure. We seek to minimize risks by limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio and strictly scrutinizing the financial
condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan. We also actively monitor such financial measures as advance rate, cash flow, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors. We
generally obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties to the transaction based on a review of personal financial statements. Installment Loans to Individuals . Installment Loans to Individuals (or consumer loans ), which represented
approximately 2.86 of our total loans at December 31, 2008, are granted to individuals for the purchase of personal goods. These loans are generally granted for periods ranging between one and six years at fixed rates of interest 1 to 5 
above the prime interest rate quoted in The Wall Street Journal. Loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences may represent risk of default to us. In the event of default, a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose
a loss to us in this loan category. Before granting a consumer loan, we assess 
 
 3 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

the applicant s credit history and ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations. Although the applicant s creditworthiness is the primary
consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. We obtain a lien against the collateral securing the loan and hold title until the loan is repaid in full.
 Deposit Services . We offer a broad range of deposit services and products to our consumer and commercial clients. Through our
community branch networks, we offer totally free consumer checking accounts with free Internet banking with bill pay and free debit cards, interest bearing checking, money market accounts and savings accounts. In addition, Renasant offers
certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts. For our commercial clients, we offer a competitive
suite of cash management products which include, but are not limited to, remote deposit capture, CD ROM statements with account reconciliation, electronic statements, positive pay, ACH origination and wire transfer, wholesale and retail lockbox,
investment sweep accounts, enhanced business Internet banking, outbound data exchange, multi-bank reporting and international services. The deposit services we offer accounted for approximately 11.29 , 10.30 and 11.40 of our total gross revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single or small group of
customers, and the loss of any single customer s deposits or a small group of customers deposits would not have a materially adverse effect on our business. The deposits held by our Bank have been primarily generated within the market
areas where the branches are located. Neither we nor the Bank have any foreign activities. Other Products and Services . Through the
Financial Services division of the Bank, we also offer a wide variety of fiduciary services and administer (as trustee or in other fiduciary or representative capacities) qualified retirement plans, profit sharing and other employee benefit plans,
personal trusts and estates. In addition, the Financial Services division offers annuities, mutual funds and other investment services through a third party broker-dealer. The Financial Services division does not constitute a separately-reportable
segment for financial reporting purposes. Operations of Renasant Insurance Renasant Insurance is a full-service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers. At December 31, 2008, Renasant Insurance contributed
total revenue of 4.0 million, or 1.54 , of the Company s total gross revenues and operated three offices in central and northern Mississippi. Competition Banking Vigorous competition exists in all major product and geographic areas in which we conduct banking business. We compete through our Bank for available loans and depository accounts with state, regional and national banks in all of our
service areas, as well as savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and investment companies. All of these numerous institutions compete in the delivery of services and
products through availability, quality and pricing, and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do, including higher total assets and capitalization, greater access to capital markets and a broader
offering of financial services. For 2008, we maintained approximately 17 of the market share (deposit base) in our Mississippi area,
approximately 2 in our Tennessee area and approximately 2 in our Alabama area. Certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate.
We have identified these markets, which are listed in the table below, as our key growth markets. At December 31, 2008, 82 of our loans and 63 of our deposits were located in these key markets. The following table shows our deposit share in the counties that we consider our key markets as of June 30, 2008 (which is the latest date that such
information is available):

Insurance We encounter strong competition in our markets in which we conduct insurance operations. Through our insurance subsidiary, we compete with independent insurance agencies and agencies affiliated with other banks and/or
other insurance carriers. All of these agencies compete in the delivery of personal and commercial product lines. There is no dominant insurance agency in our markets. Supervision and Regulation Banking Under the current regulatory environment, nearly every facet of our banking operations is regulated pursuant to various state and federal banking laws, rules and regulations. The primary focus of
these laws and regulations is the protection of depositors and the maintenance of the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole and the insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). While the following
summary addresses the regulatory environment in which we operate, it is not intended to be a fully inclusive discussion of the statutes and regulations affecting our operations. Discussions in this section focus only on certain provisions of such
statutes and regulations and do not purport to be comprehensive. Such discussions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the relevant statutes and regulations. In addition, the impact from future changes in federal or state legislation on
our operations cannot be predicted. We elected not to participate in the U.S. Treasury Department s Capital Purchase Program, which
is part of the federal government s Troubled Asset Relief Program. Thus, we will not be subject to any of the regulations enacted (and to be enacted) with respect to such program. We have, however, opted to participate in the FDIC s
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. We do not expect that the regulations we are subject to on account of our participation in this program will have a material effect on our business or operations. We are a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act ), and are registered as such
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ). We are required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and such other information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may
also make examinations of us and the Bank pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve has the authority (which to date it has not exercised) to regulate provisions of certain types of our debt. The Act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any
bank that is not already majority-owned by such bank holding company. The Act further provides that the Federal Reserve shall not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of
any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking. The Federal Reserve will also not approve any transaction in which the effect of the transaction might be to substantially lessen competition or in any
manner amount to a restraint on trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed 
 
 5

 Index to Financial Statements 

transaction are clearly outweighed by the benefits to the public interest resulting from the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience
and needs of the community to be served. The Act also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from itself engaging in
or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. The principal exception to this prohibition is for a bank holding company engaging in or acquiring shares of a company
whose activities are found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making determinations whether activities are closely related to banking or managing banks, the Federal
Reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in
efficiency of resources and whether such public benefits outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects, such as decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Company and the Bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act on any extensions
of credit to the Company or the Bank, on investments in the stock or other securities of the Company or the Bank and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower. On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the Financial Services Modernization Act was
signed into law. The Financial Services Modernization Act eliminates the barriers erected by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and amends the Act, among other statutes. Further, it allows for the affiliation of banking, securities and insurance activities
in new financial services organizations. A dominant theme of the Financial Services Modernization Act is functional regulation of
financial services, with the primary regulator of the Company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the Company or its subsidiaries wishes to engage. For example, the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC will regulate bank holding company securities transactions, and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities. The principal provisions of the Financial Services Modernization Act permit the Company, so long as it meets the standards for a well-managed and well-capitalized institution and has at least a
 satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act performance rating, to engage in any activity that is financial in nature, including security and insurance underwriting, investment banking and merchant banking investing in commercial
and industrial companies. The Company, if it satisfies the above criteria, can file a declaration of its status as a financial holding company FHC with the Federal Reserve and thereafter engage directly or through nonbank
subsidiaries in the expanded range of activities which the Financial Services Modernization Act identifies as financial in nature. Further, the Company, if it elects FHC status, will be able to pursue additional activities which are incidental or
complementary in nature to a financial activity or which the Federal Reserve subsequently determines to be financial in nature. We have not elected to become an FHC. Under the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the Interstate Act ), the Company or any other bank holding company located in Mississippi is able to acquire a bank located in
any other state, and a bank holding company located outside Mississippi can acquire any Mississippi-based bank, in either case subject to certain deposit percentage and other restrictions. The Interstate Act also provides that, unless an individual state has elected to prohibit out-of-state banks from operating interstate branches within its territory, adequately capitalized and
managed bank holding companies may consolidate their multistate bank operations into a single bank subsidiary and branch interstate through acquisitions. Under Mississippi law, out-of-state bank holding companies may establish a bank in Mississippi
only by acquiring a Mississippi bank or Mississippi bank holding company. Bank holding companies are allowed to acquire savings
associations under The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA ). Deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of FIRREA, and losses incurred by the FDIC in
connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally-insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally-insured financial institutions. The Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Mississippi and as a result is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by, the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance of
the State of Mississippi. Certain

restrictions exist under Mississippi law regarding the ability of our Bank to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The
approval of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance of the State of Mississippi is required prior to the Bank paying dividends. The amount of any dividend is limited to earned surplus in excess of three times its capital stock. Federal
Reserve regulations also limit the amount the Bank may loan to us unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. The
Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC, and the Bank is subject to examination and review by that regulatory authority. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA provides for increased funding for
the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund through risk based assessments and expands the regulatory powers of federal banking agencies to permit prompt corrective actions to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1997 requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in
meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and
applications to open a branch or facility. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial
Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the IMLAFA ). The IMLAFA substantially broadens existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations,
creates new crimes and penalties, compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States and clarifies the safe
harbor from civil liability to customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our Bank. The regulations impose new
obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The IMLAFA requires all financial institutions, as defined, to
establish anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Such programs must include, among other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance officer, employee training programs and an independent audit function to review
and test the program. The Company believes that it has complied with these requirements. Insurance Renasant Insurance is subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of the United States and the State of Mississippi. The laws and
regulations are primarily for the benefit of clients. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant,
renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including the violation of such regulations, conviction of crimes and the like. Possible sanctions which may be imposed for
violation of regulations include suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time, revocation of licenses, censures and fines. Monetary Policy and Economic Controls We and the
Bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures.
Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against
bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying degrees to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to
do so in the future. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the various money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the Federal Reserve, the effect on our, and the Bank s,
future business and earnings cannot be predicted with accuracy. Sources and Availability of Funds The funds essential to our, and our Bank s, business consist primarily of funds derived from customer deposits, federal funds purchased, securities
sold under repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and 
 
 7 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

borrowings from correspondent banks by the Bank. The availability of such funds is primarily dependent upon the economic policies of the federal government,
the economy in general and the general credit market for loans. Personnel At December 31, 2008, we employed 866 people at all of our subsidiaries on a full-time equivalent basis. Of this total, the Bank accounted for 829 employees, and Renasant Insurance employed
37 individuals. The Company has no additional employees; however, at December 31, 2008, 18 employees of the Bank served as officers of the Company in addition to their positions with the Bank. Dependence Upon a Single Customer Neither we nor
our subsidiaries are dependent upon a single customer or upon a limited number of customers. A discussion of concentrations of credit in our loan portfolio is set forth under the heading Risk Management Loan Concentrations in
Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Available Information Our Internet address is www.renasant.com . We make available at this address under the link SEC Filings , free of charge, our Annual

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors
should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. The risks disclosed below, either alone or in combination, could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Additional risks not
presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Related To Our Business and Industry Our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic
conditions in general. In recent months, the United States economy and the global economy have experienced a severe economic downturn.
Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Unemployment
has also increased. Since mid-2007, and particularly during the second half of 2008, the financial services industry and the securities
markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a significant lack of liquidity in the credit markets. This was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the
values of subprime mortgages. The global markets have since been characterized by substantially increased volatility and an overall loss of investor confidence, initially in financial institutions, but more recently in companies in a number of other
industries and in the broader markets. Declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market and
investor confidence, as well as other factors, have all combined to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings, and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity, despite very significant declines in Federal Reserve
borrowing rates and other government actions. As a result of this market volatility, many banks and other institutions have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due to the increased risk of default
and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral. This has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of many financial institutions worldwide, resulting in the failure or near-failure of many institutions. Despite
governmental intervention both in the United States and abroad, asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity in the credit markets continues to be very restricted. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is
highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. We anticipate that the business environment in our markets and the United States as a whole could continue to deteriorate for the
foreseeable future. If this occurs, these conditions could materially and adversely affect the credit quality of our loans as well as results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to lending risk. There are inherent risks associated with our lending activities.
These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic
conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. For the reasons explained below, if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue, we may
experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 62.05 of our loan portfolio
consisted of commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk to our financial condition than other types of loans due primarily to the large amounts loaned to individual
borrowers. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in
nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our commercial, construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios are
discussed in more detail under the caption Operations Operations of the Bank in Item 1, Business. 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

 We have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate. Approximately 84.72 of our loan portfolio had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan. The real estate
provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of a default by the borrower. Currently, United States real estate is experiencing severe declines in value. Although real estates values in the markets in which we operate have not declined as
dramatically as in other areas of the United States, any such adverse change in our markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount
necessary to satisfy the borrower s obligations to us. Furthermore, it is possible that, in a declining real estate market, we will be required to further increase our allowance for loan losses to address the deterioration in the value of the
real estate securing our loans. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have
a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 1.0 billion in
commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 40.14 of our loans outstanding on that date. In addition to the general risks associated with our lending activities described above, including the effects of declines in real estate values,
commercial real estate loans are subject to additional risks. Commercial real estate loans depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt. Cash flows, either in the form of rental income or the proceeds from sales of commercial real
estate, may be affected significantly by general economic conditions. A downturn in the local economy generally or in occupancy rates where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. In addition, in light of the current
downturn in United States real estate markets generally, banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting,
internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposure. Any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information
furnished by others about customers and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we
often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other
third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on
our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Our allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient.
 Although we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a
particular industry, management also maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The
appropriate level of the allowance is based on management s ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collateral impairment. Among other
considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses, management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan
portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which
may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase
in the allowance for loan losses. The current economic downturn has made it more difficult to estimate with precision the extent to which credit risks and future trends need to be addressed through a provision to our allowance for loan losses.
 In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for
loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the
allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial

condition and results of operations. A discussion of the policies and procedures related to management s process for determining the appropriate level
of the allowance for loan losses is set forth under the caption Risk Management Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 We are subject to interest rate risk. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets, such as loans and securities, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, such as
deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve.
Currently, to help combat the effects of the economic downturn in the United States, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it is likely to maintain a low interest rate policy with respect to its federal funds target rate for the foreseeable future.
Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) our
ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, which could reduce the amount of fee income generated, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (3) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. For
example, higher-fixed rate mortgages may be repaid faster than anticipated if long-term mortgage rates remain low and borrowers refinance into lower rate mortgages. Further, if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a
faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income could be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect our earnings. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates
received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Although
management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of our operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market
interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Volatility in interest rates may also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct
investments, such as U.S. Government and Agency securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, which generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve
requirements. Disintermediation could also result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. A
discussion of the policies and procedures used to identify, assess and manage certain interest rate risk is set forth under the caption Risk Management Interest Rate Risk in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 We rely on the dividends from the Bank as our primary source of funds. The primary source of the Bank s funds are customer
deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international
instability. Many of these conditions have arisen during the current economic downturn. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to
customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations or to support growth. Such
sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. While we believe that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity
demands. If the aforementioned sources of liquidity are not adequate for our needs, we may attempt to raise additional capital in the
capital markets. Over the past months, there has been a significant decline in major stock market indices, and our stock price has suffered as well. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in such markets at
that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital in this manner.

 If we are unable to meet our liquidity needs, we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth,
capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets. Our business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans, and our
financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Since 2004, we have significantly grown our business outside our Mississippi footprint through the acquisition of entire financial institutions and through de novo branching. We intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business
through de novo branching. In addition, although we have no current intentions regarding new acquisitions in the next few years, we expect to continue to evaluate attractive acquisition opportunities that are presented to us. Our prospects must be
considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in growth stages of development, including the following: Management of Growth . We may be unable to successfully: 

maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth; 

maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth; 

maintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and 

implement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth. Operating Results . There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other
operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of
future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices. Should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or should any existing location experience a decline in
profitability or incur losses, the adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company. Development of Offices . There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been
in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, our de novo branches can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale. Our expenses could be further increased if we
encounter delays in opening any of our de novo branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites
due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we have no assurance our de novo branches or branches that we may acquire will be successful even
after they have been established or acquired, as the case may be. Expansion into New Markets . Much of our recent growth, and all of
our growth through acquisitions, has been focused in the highly-competitive Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee and Birmingham and Huntsville, Alabama metropolitan markets. The customer demographics and financial services offerings in these markets are
unlike those found in the Mississippi markets that we have historically served. In these growth markets we face competition from a wide array of financial institutions, including much larger, well-established financial institutions. Our expansion
into these new markets may be unsuccessful if we are unable to meet customer demands or compete effectively with the financial institutions operating in these markets. Regulatory and Economic Factors . Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events, including regulatory changes enacted in response to
the current economic downturn. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely
affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering certain target markets or allow competitors to gain or
retain market share in our existing or expected markets. Failure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be
materially adversely affected.

 We may face risks with respect to future acquisitions. When we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions, we seek partners that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market
presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:

the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger partners; 

inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution; 

the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and
the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion; 

our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders; 

the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction; 

the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations; 

entry into new markets where we lack experience; and 

risks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, which are discussed below. Although we have no current intentions regarding new mergers or acquisitions in the next few years, we expect to continue to evaluate merger and
acquisition opportunities that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take
place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions of financial institutions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our
book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits
from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Details of the 2007 merger
with Capital are presented in Note T, Mergers and Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our integration efforts following any future mergers or acquisitions may not be successful. After giving effect to an acquisition, we may not be able
to achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience. The success of any merger or acquisition we enter into will
depend primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may not be able to integrate our operations without encountering difficulties, such as: 

the loss of key employees and customers; 

the disruption of our ongoing business and operations; 

our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; 

deposit attrition and revenue loss; 

possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; 

unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or 

problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel. Additionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of operations. If we have difficulties with the integration, we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect to result from the merger or acquisition. Failure to
achieve these anticipated benefits could result in greater than expected costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, all of which could materially impact our business, financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business may divert management s attention from other important issues

and could seriously harm our business. Finally, cost savings from any mergers or acquisitions may be offset by losses in revenues or charges to earnings.
 Competition in the banking industry is intense and may adversely affect our profitability. We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have, including
higher total assets and capitalization, greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also
face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The information under the
caption Competition in Item 1, Business, provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in our markets. Our industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. The economic downturn in the United States has already resulted in the consolidation of a number
of financial institutions, and we expect additional consolidation to occur. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service,
including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by
banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things: 

the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;

the ability to expand our market position; 

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; 

the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors; 

customer satisfaction with our level of service; and 

industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. Our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the states of Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama.
 Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the states of Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama and the specific
local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, 82 of our loans and 63 of our deposits as of December 31, 2008 were principally located in the Tupelo, Oxford and
DeSoto County, Mississippi; Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee; and Birmingham, Decatur and Huntsville, Alabama metropolitan areas. Although economic conditions in these areas have not deteriorated as dramatically as in other areas of the United
States, economic conditions have declined and could continue to decline. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the
value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Our earnings are significantly affected by general business
and economic conditions. In addition to the risks associated with the general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate,
our operations and profitability are also impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include liquidity in the credit markets, short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, deflated
money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we operate, all of
which are beyond our control. A continued deterioration in economic conditions that the United States is currently experiencing could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a
decrease in demand for our products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 We may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many
different industries and counterparties and from time to time execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of
these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the credit due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive government regulation, and such regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings. We and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance
funds and the banking system as a whole, not the economic or other interests of shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Furthermore, we
believe that it is likely that there will be changes to the regulations governing banks and other financial institutions in light of the recent performance of the financial institutions sector and the events that contributed to such performance. We
are unable to predict, however, the substance of these changes or their likely effect on our activities or profitability. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of the
foregoing, could affect us and/or the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer
competing financial services and products, among other things. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory
requirements, we and the Bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. If
we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework
could affect the confidence of our customers in us, thus compromising our competitive position. In addition, failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework or well managed under regulatory
examination procedures could compromise our status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for merger or acquisition proposals. We are also subject to laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC regulations. These laws, regulations and standards are
subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance
matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws,
regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or civil money penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. The information under the caption Supervision and Regulation in
Item 1, Business, and Note M, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, provides more information regarding the regulatory
environment in which we and the Bank operate. Our recent results may not be indicative of our future results. We do not expect to be able to sustain our historical rate of growth, and we may not even be able to grow our business at all. Our recent and rapid
growth, which was due in large part to our mergers with Renasant Bancshares, Inc., Heritage Financial Holding Corporation Heritage and Capital in 2004, 2005 and 2007, respectively, may distort some of our historical financial ratios
and statistics. During 2004 to 2007, we also benefited from a generally stable interest rate environment and a strong residential mortgage market. Our future rate of growth is unlikely to reflect the rate of our growth we have experienced since 2004
due to the recent deterioration in the United States and 
 
 18

 Index to Financial Statements 

the global economy and the resulting consequences of the current severe economic downturn. If we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of
growth, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled
people. Our success depends in part on our ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel
who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating a bank of our size. Competition for such personnel is intense in the banking industry, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require. The
unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements.
We expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that are competitive within the industry. We are subject
to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real
property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic
substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit
our ability to use or sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review
before the loan is recorded and before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.
Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. Risks Associated With Our Common Stock Our stock price can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more
difficult for an investor to resell our common stock when desired and at attractive prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things: 

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations; 

recommendations by securities analysts; 

operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; 

news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the banking and financial services industry; 

perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors; 

new technology used, or services offered, by us or our competitors; 

significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;

failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; 

changes in government regulations; and 

geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.

 General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events,
such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. The trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger bank holding companies. Although our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is lower than other publicly traded companies, generally less than that of many of our competitors and
other larger bank holding companies. For the three months ended February 28, 2009, the average daily trading volume for Renasant common stock was 84,836 shares per day. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth,
liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over
which we have no control. Significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause volatility in the price of our common stock. Our ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law, and we may be unable to pay future dividends. We are a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and
principal on debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay
dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The information under Note L, Restrictions on Cash, Bank
Dividends, Loans or Advances, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, provides a detailed discussion about the restrictions governing the Bank s ability
to transfer funds to us. Holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.
 We have supported a portion of our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and
accompanying junior subordinated debentures. Also, in connection with the Heritage and Capital mergers, we assumed junior subordinated debentures issued by Heritage and Capital, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding trust
preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling approximately 76 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the junior
subordinated debentures we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures (and
the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock. An
investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit. Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured
against loss by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, an investor may lose some or all of his investment in our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as certain banking laws, could decrease our chances of being acquired even if our acquisition is in our shareholders best interests.
 Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions impedes a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn,
could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our
common stock and discourage a takeover. Our shareholders authorized the Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights,
dividend rights, 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we
issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of
our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part
of our shareholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction favorable to our shareholders.

 The Company declares dividends on a quarterly basis. Funds for the payment of cash dividends are
obtained from dividends received by the Company from the Bank. Accordingly, the declaration and payment of cash dividends by the Company depends upon the Bank s earnings, financial condition, general economic conditions, compliance with
regulatory requirements and other factors. Restrictions on the Bank s ability to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends exist under federal and state law and regulations. See Note L, Restrictions on Cash, Bank
Dividends, Loans or Advances, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of these restrictions. There restrictions do not, and are not expected
in the future to, materially limit the Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. Please refer to the information under
 Equity Compensation Plan Information in Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, for a discussion of the securities authorized for issuance under the Company s
equity compensation plans. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities In the second quarter of 2008, warrants to purchase 16,755 shares of the Company s common stock were exercised. These warrants were assumed by the Company in connection with its acquisition

 Certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of
future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate. These markets are: Tupelo, Oxford and DeSoto County, Mississippi; Birmingham, Decatur and Huntsville/Madison, Alabama; and Germantown, Collierville, Memphis/Cordova, Tennessee,
and the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area. We have identified these markets as key growth markets, and when we refer in this item to our key markets, we are referring to such markets. We expect future loan growth to come primarily from our key markets. It is our strategy to fund this loan growth with deposits throughout all of our
markets. While we believe future deposit growth will come primarily from these key markets, deposits outside of these key markets remain valuable to us given the low cost of such deposits relative to the cost of deposits in our key markets.
 Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us
in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions used and considers other factors which could impact the estimation. The following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our
financial statements. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

 Allowance for Loan Losses The critical accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for
loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on a ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to
provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Statement No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies Statement 5 ). The collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under FASB Statement 114, Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan Statement 114 ). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under Statement 114 and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for
loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment.
Additionally, the estimate of the allowance required to absorb credit losses in the entire portfolio may change due to shifts in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and in prevailing economic conditions, as evidenced by changes in real
estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates and energy costs. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For a discussion of other considerations in
establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses. 
 Certain loans acquired in the mergers with Capital Bancorp, Inc. Capital and Heritage Financial Holding Corporation Heritage are accounted for under American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 03-3 SOP 03-3 ). SOP 03-3 prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in which the
acquirer concludes that it will not collect the contractual amount. As a result, these loans are carried at values which represent management s estimate of the future cash flow of these loans. Increases in expected cash flows to be collected
from the contractual cash flows are required to be recognized as an adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are required to be recognized as an impairment. A more detailed discussion of our
SOP 03-3 loans resulting from the Capital and Heritage mergers is set forth below under the heading Risk Management Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses and in Note C, Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Intangible Assets
 Our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill arises from business combinations and
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements of the business acquired. We test our goodwill for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Adverse changes in various
factors, including the prevailing economic environment and the operations of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates (our reporting units are the ongoing operations of the entities we have acquired) could result in a decline in the
estimated implied fair value of goodwill. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, we use both the market and income approaches to value our reporting units. The market approach averages the values derived by applying a market multiple,
based on observed purchase transactions, to the book value, tangible book value, loan and deposit balances and the last twelve months of net income. The income approach consists of discounting long-term projected future cash flows, which are derived
from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective reporting units. A variation in the market multiples, discount rates or other assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value could change the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit s goodwill. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recognized as a noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value which
could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core
deposit intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an
other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded as a noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, when or if they occur, could be material to our operating
results for any particular reporting period.

 Benefit Plans and Stock Based Compensation Our independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R Statement 158 ). The discount rate utilized in the December 31, 2008 valuation was 6.25 , compared to 6.50 
in 2007. Actual plan assets as of December 31, 2008 were used in the calculation and the expected long-term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 8.00 . Actual return on plan assets during 2008 approximated (27.76 ). Changes in
these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the benefit plan obligation and the funded status of the plan which in turn may impact shareholders equity through an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and future pension
expense. The pension plan covered under FASB Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, was frozen as of December 31, 1996. In January 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment Statement 123R ). Statement 123R requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all
share-based payments to employees. We have recognized compensation expense on our share-based payments since 2002 when we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We utilize the
Black-Scholes model for determining fair value of our options. Determining the fair value of, and ultimately the expense we recognize related to, our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected stock price
volatility, estimated forfeitures and the expected life of the option. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock-based compensation and the related expense to be recognized. Due to the low
historical forfeiture rate, the Company has not estimated any forfeitures in determining the fair value of options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Changes in this assumption in the future could result in lower expenses related to the Company s
stock option. For a description of our assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of our share-based payments, please refer to Note K, Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Income Taxes Accrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions, either currently or in the future, and are reported, on
a net basis, as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The calculation of our income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination. Management s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and
uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the Company and its subsidiaries
will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax assets. For certain business plans enacted by the Company,
management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management s current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax-related exposures. As part of this process, management consults with
its outside advisers to assess the relative merits and risks of our proposed tax treatment of such business plans. Although we have received from these outside advisers opinions that our proposed tax treatment should prevail, the examination of our
income tax returns, changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes. We believe we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost. We review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those
calculations to prior period costs. We also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations. We monitor the status
of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The impact of newly issued accounting standards is discussed in further detail in Note A, Significant Accounting
Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

2008 as compared to 1.66 for the prior year. Diluted earnings per share decreased .50 to 1.14 for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 1.64 for the prior year. The decrease in net income and earnings per share was primarily
attributable to an increase in the provision for loan losses for 2008 as compared to 2007. Earnings per share were further negatively impacted by the dilutive effect of the 5.56 million shares issued during 2007 in connection with our
acquisition of Capital and the related equity offering that were outstanding for all of 2008. Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2007 was 31,101, which represents an increase of 3,976, or 14.66 , from net income of 27,125 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was reduced by 360 in after-tax merger
expenses associated with the Capital merger. Basic earnings per share decreased .09 to 1.66 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 1.75 for the prior year. Diluted earnings per share decreased .07 to 1.64 for the year ended
December 31, 2007 as compared to 1.71 for the prior year. The decrease in earnings per share in 2007 as compared to 2006 is due primarily to the dilutive effect of the aforementioned shares issued in our equity offering and the Capital merger,
in the aggregate. Net Interest Income Net interest income, the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of our net income, comprising 67.66 of total net revenue in 2008. Total net
revenue consists of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. The primary concerns in managing net interest income are the mix and the repricing of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 13,622 to 113,083 in 2008 from 99,461 in 2007. Of the increase in net interest income, the
increase due to the favorable growth in the volume of net earning assets was 8,967. Net interest income was further increased by 4,655 due to management s ability to lower deposit costs or use lower costing alternative funding sources, which
offset reductions in interest income due to changes in the interest rate environment.

 Net interest margin, the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets, decreased to 3.44 during
2008 from 3.57 in the prior year. Net interest margin and net interest income are influenced by several factors, primarily changes in interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. Beginning in September 2007, the
Federal Reserve took several measures to encourage growth in the national economy, one of which was the reduction of its overnight borrowing rate by 100 basis points over the last four months of 2007. During 2008, the Federal Reserve reduced its
overnight borrowing rate an additional 400 to 425 basis points, down to a target of 0.00 to 0.25 . Additionally, other interest rate indices, specifically, the prime rate, rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities and the London Interbank Offering
Rate LIBOR also decreased. With each reduction in these rate indices, our loan yield on variable rate loans indexed to the rates decreased. At the same time, however, competitive and liquidity factors prevented the cost of deposits
(whose rates are not directly indexed to the interest rate indices described above) in several of our markets from declining proportionately. The combination of lower yields on variable rate loans due to interest rate changes and competitive factors
in deposit prices caused our net interest margin to decline. In an effort to mitigate the extent to which net interest margin declined, management continued its strategy implemented in late 2007 to utilize alternative lower costing funding sources
(primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB )) rather than increasing rates on deposits. Management believed the competition for deposits in our markets would eventually ease, resulting in lower deposit costs. Interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, grew to 204,603 for 2008 from 201,843 for 2007. The growth in interest income was driven primarily by
volume, as the average balance in interest-earning assets increased 502,393 during 2008, while the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased 102 basis points to 6.22 . The full year impact of the Capital acquisition and purchase of
investment securities during 2008 were the primary reason for 
 
 28

 Index to Financial Statements 

the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The reduction in interest rates which began in 2007 and continued through 2008 was the
primary reason for the reduction in the yield of earnings assets. Interest expense decreased to 91,520 for 2008 as compared to 102,382
for 2007. The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased 491,033 to 2,968,723 during 2008 as compared to the average balance for 2007. The full year impact of the Capital acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in the
average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 4.13 in 2007 to 3.08 in 2008, or 105 basis points. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 12,052 from 87,409 in 2006 to 99,461 in 2007. Of the tax equivalent increase, an increase of 21,421 was due to the favorable growth in net earning assets
while changes in interest rates resulted in a decrease of 9,369. Interest income grew 28.04 to 201,843 for 2007 from 157,639 for 2006. The growth in interest income was driven primarily by volume, as the average balance in interest-earning
assets increased 565,674 during 2007 primarily from the acquisition of Capital. The tax equivalent yield on earning assets increased 14 basis points to 7.24 . Interest expense for 2007 was 102,382 as compared to 70,230 for 2006. The average
balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 505,739 to 2,477,690 during 2007 as compared to the average balance for 2006. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 3.56 in 2006 to 4.13 in 2007, or 57 basis points.

In the above table, loans to fund residential real estate land development totaling 179,175 and
 188,425 were included under the caption Real estate 1-4 family mortgage at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Loans to fund commercial real estate land development totaling 99,260 and 99,078 were included under the
caption Real estate commercial mortgage at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We refer to loans to fund real estate land development, whether residential or commercial, as land development loans .
 As the table above shows, at December 31, 2008 loans decreased 55,707, or 2.15 , from December 31, 2007. The decrease in total
loans is a result of an overall slowdown in economic activity in our markets and a focus by management on diversifying the loan portfolio. As the general economic environment began to decline in the last half of 2007, management responded by
implementing a strategy to diversify our loan portfolio. Management reduced our exposure to construction and land development loans by applying more stringent levels of underwriting on new originations of construction and land development loans and
requiring principal reductions of these loans at time of renewal. Our construction loan portfolio was also reduced as construction loans were refinanced into permanent financing arrangements due to the completion of the construction phase of
underlying projects and thus reclassified to commercial or residential real estate loans. During 2008, loans in our Tennessee region grew
 44,972 while loans in our Alabama and Mississippi regions decreased 59,554 and 41,125, respectively. At December 31, 2008, 82 of our loans originated in our key

markets as compared to 81 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007 loans increased 759,831, or 41.59 , from December 31, 2006, which
includes 515,982 in loans acquired in connection with our merger with Capital. Organic loan growth in our Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi region was 94,418, 87,127, and 62,304, respectively. Our loan portfolio yield decreased to 6.48 in 2008 from 7.64 in 2007. The decrease in the loan yields was driven by a lower interest rate environment
in 2008 as compared to 2007, as the interest rate indices declined beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued to decline through the fourth quarter of 2008. A higher interest rate environment in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted in our
loan portfolio yields increasing to 7.64 in 2007 from 7.58 in 2006. Mortgage loans held for sale were 41,805 at December 31, 2008
compared to 37,468 at December 31, 2007. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled 742,090 for 2008 as compared to 605,594 for 2007. The increase in originations of mortgage loans to be sold is due in part to our expansion of our
mortgage operations. Mortgage loans to be sold are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. Gains and losses
are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within thirty days after the loan is funded. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from
mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market. The Company does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans. During 2008 we did not originate any subprime loans;
in 2007, originations of subprime mortgage loans constituted .04 of the aggregate originations of mortgage loans. As such, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market was not significantly impacted by the national concerns regarding subprime
mortgage loans. Further, we do not foresee these concerns affecting our ability to sell loans we originate to sale in the secondary market in the future. Investments and Investment Interest Income Investment income is the second largest component of
interest income. The securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings. The following table shows the carrying value of
our securities portfolio by investment type, and the percentage of such investment type relative to the entire securities portfolio, as of December 31:

In 2008, investment income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased 8,622 to 36,232 from investment
income on a tax equivalent basis for 2007. The average balance in the investment portfolio was 677,497, up 174,053, or 34.57 , over 2007. The tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 5.35 , down 13 basis points from 2007. 
 The balance of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 increased 155,516 to 695,106 compared to 539,590 at December 31, 2007.
During 2008, we purchased 326,064 in investment securities. The purchases were primarily mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations CMO s ), which in the aggregate made up approximately 77.00 of the
purchases. CMO s are included in the Mortgage-backed securities line item in the above table. The mortgage-backed securities and CMO s held in our investment portfolio are primarily issued by government sponsored entities. U.S.
Government Agency securities purchased accounted for approximately 6.10 , with the remainder of the purchases being primarily municipal securities. Maturities and calls of securities during 2008 totaled 159,506. At December 31, 2008, our
investment portfolio mix changed from prior periods as a result of purchases during the year of primarily mortgage-backed securities. We favor investments in mortgage-backed securities and CMO s because these securities provide monthly cash
flow streams and the yields on these securities, although taxable, are generally higher than yields on U.S. Government Agency securities. The change in portfolio mix was also impacted by the maturity and call of 76,890 in obligations of other U.S.

Government agencies and corporations. At December 31, 2008, unrealized losses of 18,326 were recorded on investment securities with a carrying value of
 91,484. The Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2008, this portfolio had a cost basis of
 29,669 and a fair value of 17,537. The investment in pooled trust preferred securities consists of four securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over 308 financial institutions. As of
December 31, 2008, management determined that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline in value of these securities is due to adverse changes that are likely to result in a permanent reduction in future cash flow.
Management s determination is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing banks and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for our
tranches is negatively impacted. The Company also holds investments in mortgage-backed securities and CMO s of institutions not
sponsored by government entities, commonly referred to as private-label securities. At December 31, 2008, this portfolio had a cost basis of 32,860 and a fair value of 27,978. As of December 31, 2008, management determined
that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline in value of these securities is due to adverse changes that are likely to result in a permanent reduction in future cash flow. Management s determination is based on the current
credit ratings of the securities, analysis of the credit scores of the underlying borrowers, analysis of the loan-to-value of the underlying collateral and the geographic location of the underlying borrowers. In 2007, investment income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased 4,639 to 27,610 from investment income on a tax equivalent basis for 2006. The average
balance in the investment portfolio was 503,444, up 66,088, or 15.11 , over 2006. The tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 5.48 , up 23 basis points from 2006. At December 31, 2007, the balance of our investment portfolio was
 539,590, an increase of 111,525 as compared to December 31, 2006. During 2007, we purchased 167,223 in investment securities. The purchases were primarily mortgage-backed securities and CMO s, comprising approximately 61.08 of the
purchases. U.S. Government Agency securities purchased accounted for approximately 18.33 , with the remainder of the purchases being primarily in municipal securities. Maturities and calls of securities during 2007 totaled 78,221. Deposits and Deposit Interest Expense The Company relies on deposits as its major source of funds. Total deposits were 2,344,331, 2,547,821 and 2,108,965 as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006 were 284,227, 299,394 and 271,237, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were 2,060,104, 2,248,427 and 1,837,728 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in deposits at December 31, 2008 as
compared to December 31, 2007 is due primarily to decreases in time deposits offset by increases in public fund transactional accounts. As competition for deposits, primarily money market accounts and time deposits, resulted in the costs of
these deposits remaining higher than alternative sources of funds during 2008, the Company was more selective in pricing these deposits and instead utilized lower costing funding sources, primarily FHLB borrowings. This strategy is the primary
reason for the decrease in time deposits. The increase in deposits at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006 is due
to the merger with Capital, which increased the balance of 2007 total deposits by 490,257. Excluding deposits from Capital, deposits decreased 51,401 during 2007. The decrease in deposits occurred primarily in time deposits. We intentionally
allowed 46,929 in brokered certificates of deposits acquired from Capital to expire. In addition, during the last half of 2007, rates paid on deposits, primarily time deposits, remained higher than alternative sources of funds. In response to these
conditions, we were more selective in pricing time deposits and instead utilized lower costing alternative funding sources including federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. As a result, our time deposits decreased in certain regions. 
 Deposits in the Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi regions decreased 115,420, 75,572 and 12,498, respectively, in 2008. Historically, rates paid on
deposits have been lower in our Mississippi region than our other regions. Deposits in the Tennessee region (excluding Capital deposits) decreased 7,094 while the Alabama region decreased 27,424 during 2007. The Mississippi region s deposits
grew 90,930 in 2007. At December 31, 2008, 63 of our deposits were from our key markets as compared to 67 at December 31, 2007.

 Interest expense on deposits was 63,509, 83,816 and 57,467 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.89 , 3.92 and 3.31 , for the same periods. A more detailed discussion of the cost of our deposits is set forth below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources in this item. From time to time, we participate in gathering public funds. Public funds may be readily obtained based on the Company s pricing bid in comparison
with competitors. The source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk and maintaining our net interest margin. Accordingly, funds are only acquired when needed and at a rate that is
prudent under the circumstances. Generally, public fund time deposits are higher costing due to the volume of the deposits and because they are obtained through a bid process. Our public fund transaction accounts are principally obtained from
municipalities including school boards and utilities. Borrowed Funds and Interest Expense on Borrowings Interest expense on total borrowings was 28,011, 18,566 and 12,763 for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total
borrowings include advances from the FHLB, junior subordinated debentures, federal funds purchased, treasury, tax and loan notes and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. FHLB advances were 768,302, 464,717 and 144,212 for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company had 225,000, 287,000 and 26,000 in short-term FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cost of our FHLB advances was 3.43 , 4.93 
and 4.52 for 2008, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2008, the Company had 173,099 of availability on unused lines of credit with the FHLB. As noted above, beginning in the last half of 2007 and continuing throughout most of 2008, costs of
borrowings at the FHLB were lower than costs of time deposits in certain of our markets. As management anticipated, in the last few weeks of 2008, competition for deposits eased and pricing of such deposits returned to more normal conditions. Going
forward, management believes it will be able to attract and garner deposits with more rational pricing strategies. Funds are borrowed from the FHLB to match-fund against certain loans, negating interest rate exposure when rates rise. Such
match-funded loans are typically large commercial or real estate loans. In addition, short-term FHLB advances and federal funds purchased are used to meet day to day liquidity needs. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures was 4,915, 5,469 and 4,918 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For more information about our
outstanding subordinated debentures, refer to the discussion in this item below under the heading Shareholders Equity and Regulatory Matters. The outstanding balance of treasury, tax and loan notes as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 4,494, 10,000 and 1,653, respectively. The balance in this account is contingent on the amount of funds we
pledge as collateral as well as the Federal Reserve s need for funds. Noninterest Income

 Total noninterest income includes fees generated from deposit services, loan services, insurance
products, trust and other wealth management products and services, security gains and all other noninterest income. Our focus over the last few years has been to develop and enhance our products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify
our revenue sources. Noninterest income as a percentage of total net revenues was 32.34 , 34.41 and 34.45 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our mergers since 2004 are providing us with additional opportunities to further grow our noninterest
income. Noninterest income was 54,042 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 1,855, or 3.55 , as compared to 2007.
For 2007, noninterest income was 52,187, an increase of 6,244, or 13.59 , over 2006. The operations of Capital contributed 3,527 to noninterest income during 2008, compared to 1,224 for the last six months of 2007. Charges for deposit services, the primary contributor to noninterest income, were 22,645 for 2008, an increase of 2,117, or 10.31 , from 2007. Service
charges on deposits in 2007 were 20,528, an increase of 2,082 from 2006. The primary reason we have experienced continued annual increases in service charges is attributable to the implementation of the High Performance Checking HPC program in 2003. Through the HPC program we have been able to increase the number of service-chargeable deposit accounts. Service charges include maintenance fees

on accounts, per item charges, account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees. Overdraft fees represented 90.00 , 88.51 and
86.63 of total charges for deposit services in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Fees and commissions (which includes fees charged for both deposit
services and loan services) increased 2.49 to 16,118 during 2008 as compared to 15,726 for 2007. Fees charged on loans include origination, underwriting, documentation and other administrative fees. Loan fees decreased 1,093 during 2008 to
 8,124 as compared to 2007. This decrease is due to the reduction in the types of loans we retain in our portfolio, rather than sell to third parties, as reflected by the decrease in loans during the same period. With respect to fees related to
deposit services, interchange fees on debit card transactions continue to be a strong source of noninterest income. For 2008, fees associated with debit card usage were 4,810, an increase of 20.18 as compared to 4,003 for 2007. Income derived
from use of our debit cards made up 29.84 of the total fees and commissions for 2008. We expect income from use of our debit cards to continue to grow as we make a direct effort to encourage usage by our customers. Fees and commissions increased 1,872 to 15,726 during 2007 as compared to 13,854 for 2006. Loan fees increased 13.86 during 2007 to 9,217 as
compared to 8,095 for 2006. The increase in loan fees during 2007 is attributable to loan growth during the same period. For 2007, fees associated with debit card usage were 4,003, an increase of 24.74 as compared to 3,209 for 2006. 
 Income earned on insurance products was 3,483, 3,549 and 3,533 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Through
Renasant Insurance, we offer a range of commercial and personal insurance products through major insurance carriers. Contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience
on our client s policies during the previous year. Increases and decreases in contingency income are reflective of corresponding increases and decreases in the amount of claims paid by insurance carriers. Contingency income, which is included
in Other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was 323, 265 and 152 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Trust department revenue is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the noninterest income section in the line account Trust revenue. Trust revenue was 2,444 for 2008 compared to 2,859 for 2007. The market value
of trust assets under management as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 461,881 and 526,347, respectively. The decline in the stock market during 2008 resulted in the reduction in trust revenue and in the market value of assets under
management. Trust revenue increased 344 to 2,859 for 2007 compared to 2,515 for 2006. The Company did not sell any securities during
2008. Gains of 78 for 2007 resulted from the sale of approximately 54,944 in securities compared to gains of 25 from the sale of approximately 35,660 in securities for 2006. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale for 2008 were 5,447, an increase of 584, or 12.01 , from 2007. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled 742,090 for 2008 as compared
to 605,594 for 2007. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale for 2007 were 4,863, an increase of 1,366 from 2006. Other
noninterest income for 2008 includes a 409 gain related to the redemption of shares as a result of the Visa initial public offering. In comparison, other noninterest income for 2007 includes a 499 gain recognized from the sale of other real
estate, a 141 gain resulting from insurance proceeds that exceeded the write-off of premises and equipment due to a fire and a 314 nontaxable death benefit from our life insurance policies. Noninterest Expense

 Total noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, data processing, net occupancy,
equipment and other noninterest expense. Noninterest expense was 107,968, 98,000 and 89,006 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Noninterest expense increased 9,968, or 10.17 , during 2008 as compared to 2007. The full year impact of the
operations of Capital increased noninterest expenses by 12,376 during 2008 as compared to 6,142 for the last six months of 2007. Salaries and employee benefits is the largest component of noninterest expenses and represented 53.16 , 56.11 , and 55.91 of total noninterest expense at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, salaries and
employee benefits increased 2,410, or 4.38 , to 57,400 as compared to 54,990 for 2007. The operations of

Capital contributed 5,680 to salaries and employee benefits expense during 2008 offset by a reduction in performance-based incentive payments in 2008 as
compared to 2007. During 2007, salaries and employee benefits increased 5,230, or 10.51 , to 54,990 as compared to 49,760 for 2006. The
additional salaries and employee benefits expense from Capital were 3,285 for 2007. Nonrecurring expense due to duplicate staff at our headquarters and in our Nashville operations needed to facilitate the consolidation of back office functions
related to the merger totaled 148. The remaining increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to normal annual salary increases and increases in health care benefits. The compensation expense recorded in connection with grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock, which is included within salaries and employee benefits, was 1,014, 1,444 and 1,471
at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Data processing costs increased 324, or 6.63 , to 5,209 for 2008 from 2007. Data
processing costs increased 604, or 14.11 , to 4,885 for 2007 from 2006. The increase in data processing costs for 2007 is reflective of increased loan and deposit processing from growth in the number of loans and deposits. In 2007, data processing
costs were further increased by the merger with Capital. Net occupancy expense in 2008 was 8,592, up 593 from 2007. The increase is due
primarily to the full year inclusion of Capital in the Company s operations. Our strategic focus is to evaluate opportunities to expand our footprint throughout our markets and, thus, we expect to continue to experience gradual increases in our
occupancy and equipment expense as expansion occurs. Occupancy expense in 2007 was 7,999, up 843 from 2006 primarily due the acquisition of Capital. Computer and equipment expense in 2008 was 4,703, an increase of 495, or 11.76 , over 2007. Computer and equipment expense in 2007 was 4,208, an increase of 329 over 2006. The increase in computer and equipment
expense is associated with additional equipment expense from the operations of Capital. Professional fees include fees we paid our
directors as well as fees for legal and accounting services. Professional fees were 3,509 for 2008 as compared to 2,705 for 2007 and 2,478 for 2006. Amortization of intangible assets increased 464 to 2,455 for 2008 compared to 1,991 for 2007. In connection with the Capital, Heritage and Renasant Bancshares, Inc. mergers, we recorded 5,974, 5,224 and 5,801,
respectively, in finite-lived intangible assets. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 5-10 years. Amortization of intangible assets increased 352 to 1,991 for 2007 compared to 1,639
for 2006.

 One measure of productivity in the banking industry is sometimes referred to as the
 efficiency ratio . This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. The
Company calculates this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. Our continued improvement in the efficiency ratio is attributable to growing our net interest
income and noninterest income at a greater rate than the growth in our noninterest expenses. We remain committed to aggressively managing our costs within the framework of our business model. Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 8,660, 14,069
and 11,467, respectively. The effective tax rates for those years were 26.47 , 31.15 and 29.71 , respectively. The effective tax rate for these periods is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates due to our continued investment in
tax-exempt securities and tax-free leases and loans. In both 2007 and 2006, we recorded nontaxable death benefits from life insurance. Risk Management The management of risk is an on-going process. Primary risks that are associated with the Company include
credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Credit and interest rate risk are discussed below, while liquidity risk is discussed in the next subsection under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.

 Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses Inherent in any lending activity is credit risk, that is, the risk of loss should a borrower default. Credit risk is monitored and managed by a credit administration department, loan committees
and a loss management committee. Credit quality and policies are major concerns of credit administration and these committees. We try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within
a particular industry. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio.
The appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under Statement 5.
The collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under Statement 114. The balance of these loans determined as impaired under Statement 114 and their
related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. Other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the
unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. If the allowance is deemed inadequate, management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses. The allowance
for loan losses was 34,905, 26,372 and 19,534 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We have a number of documented
loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function. Adherence to these policies and procedures is monitored by management and the Board of Directors. A number of committees and an underwriting
staff oversee the lending operations of the Company. These include in-house loan and loss management committees and a Board of Directors loan committee. In addition, we maintain a loan review staff. In compliance with policy, the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience. In addition, each lending officer s
prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits. Before funds are advanced on consumer and commercial loans below certain dollar thresholds, loans are reviewed and scored by
the underwriters. Grades are assigned based upon certain factors, which include the scoring of the loans. This information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality. Loan requests of amounts greater than the officers 
lending limits are reviewed by senior credit officers, in-house loan committees or the Board of Directors. The allowance for loan losses
is established after input from management, loan review and the Loss Management Committee. An evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is calculated quarterly based on the types of loans, the credit risk in the portfolio, economic conditions and
trends within each of these factors. Grades are assigned by lending personnel based on the scoring of the loans that are funded. Loan
grades range from 1 to 9, with 1 being loans with the least credit risk. Allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance factors are established
based on our loss experience by loan type (i.e. commercial, mortgage, consumer, etc.) and adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios. In making these adjustments to the allowance factors, management takes
into consideration factors which it believes are causing, or are likely in the future to cause, losses within our loan portfolio but which may not be fully reflected in our historical loss ratios. In 2008, these factors included changes in economic
conditions, changes in our loan portfolio composition and concentrations in certain loan types and/or collateral. For impaired loans, a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value.
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the
scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for problem loans of 50 or greater by either the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When the ultimate collectibility of a loan s principal is in doubt,
wholly or partially, the loan is placed on nonaccrual. Loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic
examination. The Loss Management Committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor and adjusts the loan grade accordingly. This information is used to
assist management in monitoring credit quality.

 Foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed. The collateral is
purchased from the borrower at public auction for fair market value, with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price. The purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the loan balance is greater than
the sales proceeds, the deficient balance is sent to the loan committee (comprised of the Board of Directors) for charge-off approval. These charge-offs reduce the allowance for loan losses. On a regular basis, management and the Board of Directors review loan ratios. These ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net charge-offs as a percentage of
average loans, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans. In addition, management reviews past due ratios by officer,
community bank and the Company as a whole. Charge-offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously
through the provision for loan losses. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2008 were 14,271, or 0.55 as a percentage of average loans. The increase in net charge-offs during 2008 as compared to prior years is a direct result of
the current economic environment s effect on the quality of our loan portfolio, specifically with respect to construction and land development loans. Although many of the markets in which we operate did not experience the extreme appreciation
in home values as experienced in other national markets over the past few years, the housing market in all of our markets began to slow down significantly in 2008. The large inventories of both completed residential homes and land that had been
developed for future residential home construction, coupled with declining consumer demand for residential real estate, caused a severe decline in the values of both homes and developed land. As a result, the credit quality of some of our loans in
the construction and land development portfolios deteriorated. Of the net charge-offs incurred in 2008, 2,257 or 15.82 were related to construction loans, 6,449, or 45.19 were related to residential land development loans and 50 or .40 were
related to commercial land development loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2007 were 3,253, or 0.14 as a percentage of average loans. Two loans which had been on nonperforming status since 2006 and had been fully reserved
for in the allowance for loan losses when they were placed on nonperforming status were charged-off in the fourth quarter of 2007, resulting in charge-offs of 1,870, or 0.08 of average loans. The table below reflects the activity in the allowance for loan losses, in thousands, for the years ended December 31. Net charge-offs related to
residential land development loans are included in the category Real estate 1-4 family mortgages while commercial land development loans are included in the category Real estate commercial mortgages in the table
below. Furthermore, we have omitted lease financing from the table, as there were no charge-offs or recoveries of such financing for the periods presented.

 The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.38 at December 31, 2008 as
compared to 1.02 at December 31, 2007 and 1.07 at December 31, 2006. The increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007 is attributable to the
increased provision for loan losses recorded as a result of credit deterioration identified by the Company in the loan portfolio, primarily related to the construction and land development loan segment of the portfolio. The decrease in the allowance
for loan losses as a percentage of loans at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006 is due to organic loan growth of 243,849, the merger with Capital, whose allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was lower than
ours, and the aforementioned charge-off of two loans totaling 1,870 which had been provided for in previous years. The SOP 03-3 loans
acquired in the Capital and Heritage mergers are carried at values which, in management s opinion, reflect the estimated future cash flows, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each respective loan at the date of acquisition. We
continually monitor these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows. The Company did not increase the provision for loan losses for loans accounted for under SOP 03-3 during
2008 or 2007. Management believes that as of December 31, 2008 the credit quality of the loans accounted for under SOP 03-3 has not deteriorated further since the date of acquisition and, thus, the carrying value of these loans at
December 31, 2008 continues to reflect the future cash flows. The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan
losses by loan category at December 31 for each of the years presented.

 Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are
contractually past due 90 days, on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of income is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually
90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management, the Loss Management Committee and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming. Restructured loans are
those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments. The following
table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans at December 31:

All loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have
serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the current repayment terms of the loan have been reflected in the table above. As of December 31, 2008, we do not hold any other interest-bearing assets that would be included in
the table above if such assets were loans. As shown in the above tables, nonperforming loans were 39,913 at December 31, 2008 as
compared to 16,277 at December 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007 is primarily attributable to continued credit deterioration in our construction and residential land
development loans. Nonperforming residential land development loans are included in the category Real estate 1-4 family mortgages in the above table and have a balance of 18,144, or 45.46 of total nonperforming loans, at
December 31, 2008 compared to 3,915, or 24.05 of total nonperforming loans, at December 31, 2007. There were no commercial land development loans classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2007 or 2008. Overall, the increase
in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006 is reflective of loans, primarily construction loans and real estate loans to fund land development, which experienced cash flow problems in the second half of
2007. As the housing slowdown began to impact the economy, management required the senior credit officers to review and inspect all construction loans and commercial and residential real estate loans to fund land development. Several of the loans
included in nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2007 were identified during this review. The merger with Capital increased nonperforming loans 1,496 at December 31, 2007. Management has evaluated the aforementioned loans and other
loans classified as nonperforming and concluded that all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2008.

Management also continually monitors loans past due 30-89 days for potential credit quality deterioration. Total loans past due 30-89 days were 48,473,
 28,330 and 13,125 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of
management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses was 22,804, 4,838 and 2,408 for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Factors considered in management s assessment for the periods presented include the internal risk rating of individual credits, the size and diversity of our loan portfolio, historical and current trends in net charge-offs, trends
in nonperforming loans, trends in loans past due 30-89 days and current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Specifically, management increased the provision for loan losses during 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of credit
deterioration identified by management and reflected in the increase in net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and loans past due 30-89 days. The increase in the provision for loan losses for 2007 as compared to 2006 is due to the Company providing
for organic loan growth, replenishing the reserve for loan charge-offs during the year and providing for loans placed on nonperforming status. Loan Concentrations The following table presents the percentage of loans, by category, to total loans at December 31

Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers
engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2008, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10 of total loans which are not disclosed as a category of
loans separate from the categories listed above. Interest Rate Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ
greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit-taking activities. Management believes
the most significant impact on the Company s financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure. We have an Asset/Liability Committee ALCO which is authorized by the Board of Directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to
make decisions relating to that process. The ALCO s goal is to structure our asset-liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net
interest income and capital. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at
the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and economic value of equity EVE using rate shock analysis. Net interest income simulations measure
the short-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest in a more rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying
hypothetical rate scenarios. The EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time. A decrease in EVE due to
a specified

rate change indicates a decline in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the
current balance sheet. The following rate shock analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income and EVE of immediate changes
in interest rates at the specified levels at December 31:

 The percentage change in this column represents our EVE in a
stable interest rate environment versus the EVE in the various rate scenarios. The preceding measures assume no change
in asset/liability compositions. Thus, the measures do not reflect actions the ALCO may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates. The balance sheet structure as of December 31, 2008 indicates we are asset sensitive, while we were
liability sensitive at December 31. 2007. This shift is primarily a result of the current interest rate environment, as management believes interest rates will not appreciably decrease further. The above results of the interest rate shock
analysis are within the limits set by the Board of Directors. The scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of 100 and 200 basis points. With the present position of the target federal funds rate, the declining rate
scenarios seem improbable. Further, it has been the Federal Reserve s policy to adjust the target federal funds rate incrementally over time. As interest rates are adjusted over a period of time, it is our strategy to proactively change the
volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the
behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds, competitive factors, the relative
price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results. To mitigate our interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap in December 2007. The swap has a notional amount of 31,000 whereby we receive
a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus 187 basis points and pay a fixed rate of 5.70 . The effective date of this swap was December 5, 2007 and its maturity date is March 15, 2010. The interest rate swap is a
designated cash flow hedge designed to convert the variable interest rate on 31,000 of our junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate. At December 31, 2008, the rate paid to us by the third-party was 114 basis points lower than the rate we
paid on this swap. The Company enters into mortgage loan commitments with its customers. Under the mortgage loan commitments, interest
rates for a mortgage loan are locked in with the customer for a period of time, typically thirty days. Once a mortgage loan commitment is entered into with a customer, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary
market to sell such loan on a best efforts basis. As such, the Company does not incur risk if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. Other than mortgage loan commitments and the interest rate swaps, we have not
entered into any other derivative activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers
needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Core deposits, which are deposits excluding time
deposits, are a major source of funds used by the Bank to meet cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to

assuring the Bank s liquidity. Management continues to monitor the liquidity and potentially volatile liabilities ratios to ensure compliance with ALCO
targets. As previously discussed, beginning in the last half of 2007 and continuing throughout most of 2008, the cost of borrowings from the FHLB was lower than the cost of certain types of deposits in our markets. As management anticipated, in the
last few weeks of 2008, competition for deposits eased and pricing of such deposits returned to more normal levels. Going forward, management believes it will be able to attract and garner deposits by offering rates that are favorable compared to
the cost of FHLB borrowings. Our securities portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets have readily
available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Within the next twelve months the securities available for sale portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow through maturities equal to 48.72 of the carrying value of the total
securities portfolio. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2008, securities with a carrying value of approximately 468,640 were pledged to secure
government, public and trust deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings as compared to 414,361 at December 31, 2007. Other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and advances from the FHLB.
Interest is charged at the market federal funds rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2008 totaled 63,800. Funds obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to match-fund real estate loans and
other longer-term fixed rate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk and may be used to meet day to day liquidity needs (primarily when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract
deposits). As of December 31, 2008, the balance of our outstanding short-term and long-term advances with the FHLB was 768,302. The total amount of the remaining credit available to us from the FHLB at December 31, 2008 was 173,099. We
also maintain lines of credits with other commercial banks totaling 75,500. These are unsecured lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under
these lines of credit. At December 31, 2008, our total cost of funds, including noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts, was
2.81 , compared to 3.71 at December 31, 2007 and 3.14 at December 31, 2006. Noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts made up approximately 8.96 of our average total deposits and borrowed funds at that date, compared to 10.13 at
December 31, 2007 and 11.70 at December 31, 2006. Interest bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts made up approximately 28.18 of our funds for 2008 and had an average cost of 1.64 , comparable to 31.42 
of our funds with an average cost of 2.63 for 2007 and 33.28 of our funds with an average cost of 2.16 for 2006. Another significant source of funds was time deposits, which are the highest costing deposit in our deposit mix. Time deposits made
up 39.16 of the total deposits and borrowed funds with an average cost of 3.80 at December 31, 2008, compared to 46.12 of the total with an average cost of 4.80 at December 31, 2007 and 44.37 of the total with an average cost of 4.18 
at December 31, 2006. FHLB advances, typically used for clients who prefer longer-term fixed rate loans, made up approximately 19.76 , 8.77 and 6.79 of our average total deposits and borrowed funds with an average cost of 3.43 , 4.93 and
4.52 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our strategy in choosing funds is focused on attempting to mitigate interest rate risk, and
thus we utilize funding sources that are commensurate with the interest rate risk associated with the assets. Accordingly, management targets growth of non-interest bearing deposits. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our
clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates we offer and with the deposit specials we offer. For example, we have been able to obtain public funds based on our aggressiveness in pricing. We constantly monitor our funds position and
evaluate the effect various funding sources have on our financial position. Our cost of funds in 2008 decreased due to management
specifically employing the strategy to utilize lower costing alternative funding sources rather than competing for high-cost deposits in our markets. Also, in the second half of 2007, customers began moving funds into short-term (less than one year)
time deposits as short-term interest rates were the same or higher than longer term rates. As such, 69.80 of our time deposits have a maturity of less than 12 months at December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents were 100,394 at December 31, 2008, compared to 99,793 at December 31, 2007 and 98,201 at December 31, 2006.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was 156,224, compared to 353,805 for the same period of 2007 and 215,717 in 2006. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes
the net cash paid for the Capital merger of 52,606. During 2008, the Company used 14,400 to fund loan growth as compared to 262,016 for 2007 and 185,774 in

2006. The Company used 326,064 to purchase investment securities in 2008. In 2008, we received proceeds of 159,506 from the maturity of our securities in
our investment portfolio. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 94,224 compared to 312,129
for the same period of 2007 and 183,992 in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities for 2007 includes the proceeds from the issuance of 2.76 million shares of the Company s common stock in a public equity offering. The proceeds from
the equity offering totaled 58,126 and were used to the fund the cash portion of the merger consideration for the Capital merger. Short-term and long-term borrowings increased 309,798 during 2008 which was used to offset deposit runoff of 203,345
during 2008. The Company completed the merger with Capital on July 1, 2007. The aggregate transaction value, including transaction
expenses and the dilutive impact of Capital s options assumed by the Company, was approximately 131,400. In accordance with the merger agreement, the Company delivered to Capital shareholders either cash, Company common stock or a combination
of cash and Company common stock, in exchange for the shares of Capital common stock owned by a shareholder. The cash portion of the merger consideration was 56,055 and was funded with the proceeds of the Company s equity offering. The Company
issued 2,797,238 shares of its common stock in the transaction, totaling approximately 67,497. These shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company s liquidity and capital resources are substantially dependent on the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. Please refer to Note L,
 Restrictions on Cash, Bank Dividends, Loans or Advances, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a detailed discussion of the federal and state
restrictions on the Bank s ability to transfer funds to the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions The Company enters into loan commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of its business. Loan commitments are made to accommodate the
financial needs of the Company s customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that
involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company s normal credit and underwriting policies. Collateral (e.g. securities, receivables, inventory and equipment) is obtained based on management s credit assessment of
the customer. Loan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company in that
while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company s unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 are as follows:

 As discussed above under the heading Risk Management Interest Rate Risk, we

 Excludes interest. Shareholders Equity and Regulatory Matters Total shareholders equity of the Company was
 400,371 and 399,073 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Book value per share was 19.00 and 19.15 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth in shareholders equity was attributable to earnings retention
offset by dividends declared and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income. To improve the liquidity and trading volume of the
Company s common stock, the Company issued a three-for-two stock split during the third quarter of 2006. Although certain components of shareholders equity were adjusted, the stock split did not result in a change to total
shareholders equity. The Company had a share repurchase plan in place at the beginning of 2008. The plan was adopted in September
2002 and authorized the repurchase of 2,595,031 shares of the Company s common stock, subject to a monthly purchase limit of 2.0 million. This plan was terminated by the Board of Directors in January 2008. Shares repurchased are held for
reissue in connection with stock compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. Approximately 96,000 shares of stock were purchased during 2008 for a total purchase price of 2,004. The Company repurchased approximately 384,000 shares during
2007 for a total purchase price of 7,810. In connection with the Capital merger, we assumed 12,372 in junior subordinated debentures
issued by Capital which pay interest quarterly at a fixed rate of 5.64 through June 30, 2010 and will reprice quarterly equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 150 basis points thereafter. The principal amount of the junior subordinated debentures
is due in 2035. During January 2005, we formed PHC Statutory Trust II for the purpose of issuing corporation-obligated mandatory redeemable capital securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such capital
securities solely in floating rate junior debentures of the Company. The 31,959 issue provided us with funds for the cash portion of the Heritage merger. The 30-year junior subordinated debentures pay interest quarterly equal to the three-month
LIBOR plus 187 basis points. In connection with the Heritage merger, we assumed 10,310 in junior subordinated debentures issued by Heritage which pay interest quarterly at a fixed rate of 10.20 . The principal amount of the junior subordinated
debentures is due in 2031. During 2003, we formed PHC Statutory Trust I for the purpose of issuing corporation-obligated mandatory redeemable capital securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such capital
securities in floating rate junior debentures of the Company. The 20,619 issue provided us with funds for the cash portion of the Renasant Bancshares, Inc. merger. The 30-year junior subordinated debentures pay interest quarterly equal to the
three-month LIBOR plus 285 basis points. All of the junior subordinated debentures described in the above paragraph are included in Tier I
capital at December 31, 2008. The Federal Reserve Board issued guidance in March 2005 providing more strict quantitative limits on the amount of securities, similar to our junior subordinated debentures, that are includable in Tier 1 capital.

The new guidance, which becomes effective in March 2009, is not expected to impact the amount of debentures we include in Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must
maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the following classifications:

 Report on Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Renasant Corporation (the Company is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements and notes
included in this annual report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include some amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments. We, as management of the Company, are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting that is designed
to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by
management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including
the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an
effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Management,
with the participation of the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an assessment of the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2008, its system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control Integrated Framework . Horne LLP, the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Renasant Corporation 
 Tupelo, Mississippi We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Renasant Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its
operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

 Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note A 
Significant Accounting Policies (In Thousands, Except Share Data) Nature of Operations : Renasant Corporation (referred to herein as the Company ), a Mississippi corporation, owns and operates Renasant Bank, a Mississippi-chartered bank with operations in
Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama, and Renasant Insurance, Inc., a Mississippi corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renasant Bank with operations in Mississippi. The Company offers a diversified range of financial and insurance services to
its retail and commercial customers through its full service offices located throughout north and north central Mississippi, west and middle Tennessee and north and north central Alabama. On July 24, 2006, the Company announced a three-for-two stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on August 28, 2006 to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2006. As a
result of the stock split, the Company issued 5,744,010 shares of its common stock. Share and per share amounts for prior periods included herein have been restated to reflect the three-for-two stock split. On July 1, 2007, the Company completed its merger with Capital Bancorp, Inc. Capital ). On the same date, Capital Bank Trust
Company was merged into Renasant Bank. The financial condition and results of operations for Capital are included in the Company s financial statements since the date of the merger. Consolidation : Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements ARB 51 ), requires a company s consolidated financial statements to
include subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling financial interest. The Company s consolidated financial statements include accounts of Renasant Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Renasant Insurance, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Renasant Bank. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The voting interest approach defined in ARB 51 is not applicable in identifying controlling financial interests in entities that are not controllable
through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks. In such instances, Interpretation No. 46 Revised, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 FIN 46R ), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), indicates when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. In general, a variable
interest entity VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient
financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE s activities or entitles it to receive a majority of
the entity s residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of any such entity. Business Combinations : Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting which reflects the net assets of the companies recorded at their fair value at the
date of acquisition. The financial condition and results of operations of entities acquired using the purchase method are included in the Company s financial statements from the date the acquisition is completed. Use of Estimates : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents : The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Securities Available for Sale : Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when purchased if management has the intent and ability to hold
the securities to maturity. The Company has no held to maturity securities. Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale. Presently, the Company has no intention of establishing a trading
classification. Available for sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity. The amortized cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Such amortization and accretion is included in
interest income from securities. Dividend income is also included in interest income from securities. Realized gains and losses, as well as declines in value judged to be other than

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Note A Significant Accounting Policies (continued) temporary, are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Management periodically reviews the security portfolio for impairment based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to, length of time and
extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the likelihood of the security s ability to recover any decline in its fair value, financial condition of the underlying issuer, ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations and
ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in fair value. Impairments on securities are recognized when management, based on its analysis, deems the impairment to be other-than-temporary. Disclosures about
unrealized losses in our securities portfolio that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments are provided in Note B, Securities Available for Sale. Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at
which the securities were sold. Securities, generally U.S. government and federal agency securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale represent residential mortgage loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at
the lower of aggregate cost or market value and are classified separately on the balance sheet. Loans to be sold are locked in at the contractual rate upon closing, thereby eliminating any interest rate risk for the Company. Gains and losses are
realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These gains and losses are classified under the caption Gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of income.
 Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses : Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or
until maturity or pay-off generally are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Renasant Bank defers certain nonrefundable
loan origination fees as well as the direct costs of originating or acquiring loans. The deferred fees and costs are then amortized over
the term of the note for all loans with payment schedules. Those loans with no payment schedule are amortized using the interest method. The amortization of these deferred fees is presented as an adjustment to the yield on loans. Interest income is
accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Generally, the accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time
the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer and other retail loans are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an
earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued for the current year, but not collected, for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off, is reversed against interest income. The interest on
these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future
payments are reasonably assured. Certain loans acquired in the Capital and Heritage Financial Holding Corporation Heritage mergers are accounted for in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer SOP 03-3 ). Increases in
expected cash flows to be collected on these loans are recognized as an adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as an impairment. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to be probable through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses
are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Before funds are advanced on all consumer and certain commercial loans above certain dollar thresholds, loans are reviewed and scored by our underwriters. Lending personnel classify all loans
into risk grades, which are assigned based on the scoring of the loans that are funded. These grades are continuously updated and used in the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Loan grades range between 1 and 9, with 1
being loans with the least credit risk. Loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination. Allowance factors established by management are multiplied by loan balances for each grade to determine the amount
needed in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance factors are established based on the Company s historical loss experience, adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in the Company s existing

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Note A Significant Accounting Policies (continued) portfolios. For impaired loans, a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value.
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the
scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans above a minimum dollar amount threshold by either the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When the ultimate collectibility of
an impaired loan s principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to interest income, to the extent any interest has
been foregone, and then they are recorded as recoveries of any amounts previously charged-off. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated credit losses for specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in
the loan portfolio. Management and the internal loan review staff evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses calculation quarterly. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated based on a continuing assessment of problem loans, the types
of loans, historical loss experience, new lending products, emerging credit trends, changes in the size and character of loan categories and other factors, including its risk rating system, regulatory guidance and economic conditions. This
evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed primarily by use of the straight-line method for furniture, fixtures, equipment and premises.
The annual provisions for depreciation and amortization have been computed primarily using estimated lives of forty years for premises, seven years for furniture and equipment and three to five years for computer equipment. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the period of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Other Real Estate
and Repossessions : Other real estate owned and repossessions of 25,111 and 8,584 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are included under the balance sheet heading Other Assets and consist of properties acquired through
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are
charged against the allowance for loan losses. Carrying values of other real estate and repossessions are continually monitored for subsequent declines or impairments after foreclosure by obtaining updated third party valuations. Reductions in the
carrying value subsequent to acquisition are charged to earnings and are included in Other in the noninterest expense section on the statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or more frequently
if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Goodwill is assigned to the Company s reporting segments. Fair values of reporting segments are determined using either discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts
or, if available, market-based valuation multiples for comparable businesses. No impairment was identified as a result of the testing performed during 2008, 2007 or 2006. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical
substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Bank-Owned Life Insurance: Bank-owned life insurance BOLI is an institutionally-priced insurance product that is specifically designed for purchase by insured depository
institutions. BOLI is a life insurance policy purchased by Renasant Bank on certain employees, with Renasant Bank being listed as the primary beneficiary. The carrying value of BOLI is recorded at the cash surrender value of the policies, net of any
applicable surrender charges. Changes in the value of the cash surrender value of the policies are reflected under the caption BOLI income on the statements of income. Insurance Agency Revenues: Renasant Insurance, Inc. is a full-service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major third-party insurance carriers.
Commissions and fees are

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Note A Significant Accounting Policies (continued) recognized when earned based on contractual terms and condition of insurance policies with the insurance carriers. Contingency fee income paid by the
insurance carriers is recognized upon receipt. Trust and Financial Services Revenues: The Company offers trust services as well as
various alternative investment products, including annuities and mutual funds. Trust revenues are recognized on the accrual basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the trust. Commissions and fees from the sale of annuities and mutual funds
are recognized when earned based on contractual terms with the third-party broker dealer. Income Taxes : Income taxes are accounted
for under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. It is the Company s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal
income tax return. Renasant Bank provides for income taxes on a separate-return basis and remits to the Company amounts determined to be currently payable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company enters into mortgage loan commitments with its customers. Under the mortgage loan commitments, interest rates for a mortgage loan may be locked in for
up to thirty days with the customer. Once a mortgage loan commitment is entered into with a customer, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell such loan on a best efforts basis. As such,
the Company does not incur risk if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. Mortgage loan commitments are derivatives; however, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended Statement 133 ). Accordingly, the mortgage loan commitments are recorded at fair value, and changes are recorded
in earnings. The fair value of the mortgage loan commitments are based on readily available fair values, obtained in the open market from mortgage investors. These fair values reflect the values of mortgage loans having similar terms and
characteristics to the mortgage loan commitments entered into by the Company. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of these commitments was 150, which has been recorded in Other Assets. Gains and losses arising from the valuation
of the mortgage loan commitments are reflected under the caption Gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of income. In December 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of 31,000 whereby it receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus 187 basis points and pays a fixed
rate of 5.70 . The interest rate swap is a designated cash flow hedge designed to convert the variable interest rate on 31,000 of its junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate. The maturity date of the swap is March 15, 2010. The swap is
considered to be effective and the assessment of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method. At December 31, 2008, the swap had a fair value of (953) which has been recorded in Other Liabilities. 
In March 2008, the Company terminated an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge designed to convert the variable interest rate on 100,000 of loans to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2008, there were 1,013 of deferred gains
related to the swap, which will be amortized into net interest income over the designated hedging period ending in May 2009. The Company
accounts for all derivatives in accordance with Statement 133. Treasury Stock : The Company had an active repurchase plan for the
acquisition of its common stock until January 24, 2008. Treasury stock is recorded at cost. Shares held in treasury are not retired. Stock-Based Compensation : In 2002, the Company adopted the fair value method of recording stock options under FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123 ). Beginning in
January 2006, the Company applied the revised procedures set forth in FASB s revision to Statement 123, Share-Based Payment Statement 123R ). The adoption of Statement 123R did not materially impact the Company.
Compensation expense for option grants and restricted stock awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the stock options and restricted stock on the applicable grant or award date. Further, compensation expense is based on an estimate
of the number of grants expected to vest and is recognized over the grants vesting period. The Company did not estimate any forfeitures for 2008, due to the low historical forfeiture rate. Expense associated with the Company s stock-based
compensation is included under the caption Salaries and employee benefits on the Statements of Income. See Note K, Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans, for further details regarding the Company s stock-based
compensation.

 Note A Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Earnings Per Common Share : Earnings per common share are obtained by dividing net income available to common shareholders by weighted-average
outstanding shares of common stock. Basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share takes into consideration the
dilutive effect of outstanding unexercised stock option awards and warrants assuming the awards were exercised into common shares based on the treasury stock method using the average market price. If the option exercise price exceeded the fair value
of the stock, the effect would be an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share and, consequently, those shares would not have been included in the stock awards adjustment. See Note S, Net Income Per Common Share, for the reconciliation
of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations. Prior period share and per share data have been restated to reflect a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a share dividend on August 28,
2006. Impact of Recently-Issued Accounting Standards : In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements Statement 157 ), which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This statement also requires expanded disclosures about the extent to which a company measures assets and liabilities at
fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. This statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. This statement does
not mandate the use of fair value in any circumstance. The Company adopted Statement 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption of Statement 157 did not have a material impact on the Company. See Note O, Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, for further disclosures regarding the Company s adoption of Statement 157. In September 2006, the FASB
ratified the consensus the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached regarding Issue No. 06-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
Arrangements EITF 06-4 ), which provides accounting guidance for postretirement benefits related to endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements, whereby the employer owns and controls the insurance policies. The consensus
concludes that an employer should recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit in accordance with Statement No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions Statement 106 or
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12, Omnibus Opinion-1967 APB 12 ). In addition, the consensus states that an employer should also recognize an asset based on the substance of the arrangement with the employee.
Entities should recognize the effects of applying EITF 06-4 through either (a) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings or to other components of equity or net assets in the statement of
financial position as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (b) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods EITF 06-4 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 with
early adoption permitted. In March 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus the EITF reached regarding Issue No. 06-10, Accounting
for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements EITF 06-10 ), which provides accounting guidance for postretirement benefits related to collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements, whereby the
employee owns and controls the insurance policies. The consensus concludes that an employer should recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit in accordance with Statement 106 or APB 12, as well as recognize an asset based on the substance
of the arrangement with the employee. Entities should recognize the effects of applying EITF 06-10 through either (a) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings or to other components of equity
or net assets in the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (b) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. EITF 06-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2007, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted EITF 06-4 and 06-10 on January 1, 2008, and the effect of adoption on the consolidated financial statements was a reduction in retained earnings of approximately
 78. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Statement 159 ). Statement 159 allows entities to voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure financial assets and financial liabilities (as well as certain nonfinancial instruments that are similar to
financial instruments) at fair value (the fair value option ). The election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, Statement 159 specifies that all
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Note A Significant Accounting Policies (continued) subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument must be reported in earnings. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement 159 on January 1,
2008. Since adoption, the Company has not elected the fair value option for eligible financial assets or financial liabilities not previously recorded at fair value. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations Statement 141R ), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations Statement 141 ). Statement 141R retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (formerly referred to as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and that an acquirer
be identified for each business combination. Statement 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves
control. Statement 141R requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their respective fair values. Statement 141R requires the
acquirer to recognize acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs separately from the business combination as period expense. Statement 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of Statement 141R will impact the Company s accounting for and reporting of acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an Amendment to ARB
No. 51 Statement 160 ). Statement 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be clearly identified, labeled, and
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent s equity. Statement 160 also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest
to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair
value, with the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment. Statement 160 also clarifies that changes
in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. Statement 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the
interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. Statement 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting Statement 160 on its financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement
No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133 Statement 161 ). Statement 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements for derivative
instruments and hedging activities as provided by Statement 133. Statement 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedging activities are
accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedging activities affect an entity s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet these objectives, Statement
161 requires qualitative disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments and engaging in hedging activities in the context of an entity s overall risk exposure, quantitative disclosures presented in tabular
format of the fair values of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk related contingent features in derivative instruments. Statement 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting Statement 161 on its financial statements.
 In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for
That Asset Is Not Active Staff Position 157-3 ). Staff Position 157-3 clarifies the application of Statement 157 in a market that is not active and addresses the following application issues: the manner in which the reporting
entity s own assumptions (that is, expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates) should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable inputs do not exist; the manner in which available observable inputs
in an inactive market should be considered when measuring fair value; and the manner in which the use of market quotes should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable inputs available to measure fair value. Staff
Position 157-3 was immediately effective, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company applied the guidance provided in Staff

The Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2008,
this portfolio had a cost basis of 29,669 and a fair value of 17,537. The investment in pooled trust preferred securities consists of four securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over 308
financial institutions. As of December 31, 2008, management determined that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline in value of these securities is due to adverse changes that are likely to result in a permanent reduction
in future cash flow. Management s determination is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing banks and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the
cash flow for our tranches is negatively impacted. The Company also holds investments in mortgage-backed securities and CMO s of
institutions not sponsored by government entities, commonly referred to as private-label securities. At December 31, 2008, this portfolio had a cost basis of 32,860 and a fair value of 27,978. As of December 31, 2008,
management determined that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline in value of these securities is due to adverse changes that are

likely to result in a permanent reduction in future cash flow. Management s determination is based on the current credit ratings of the securities,
analysis of the credit scores of the underlying borrowers, analysis of the loan-to-value of the underlying collateral and the geographic location of the underlying borrowers. Management does not believe unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, individually or in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, represent an other-than-temporary impairment.
The Company has both the intent and ability to hold the securities contained in the table above for the time necessary to recover the unrealized loss or until maturity. Note C Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses (In Thousands) The following is a summary of loans as of December 31:

Note I Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
 (In Thousands) Loan commitments are
made to accommodate the financial needs of the Company s customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially
the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company s normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management s credit assessment
of the customer. The Company s unfunded loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused lines of credit) and standby letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2008, were approximately 614,311 and 27,497, respectively, compared to 794,592 and 27,843, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Various claims and lawsuits, incidental to the ordinary course of business, are pending against the Company and Renasant Bank. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, resolution of these
matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Market risk resulting from interest rate
changes on particular off-balance sheet financial instruments may be offset by other on- or off-balance sheet transactions. Interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the Company for determining the net effect of potential changes in interest rates
on the market value of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Note J Income Taxes (In Thousands) Deferred income taxes, included in
 Other Assets, reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. No valuation allowance was
recognized as the deferred tax assets were determined to be realizable in future years. This determination was based on the Company s earnings history the Company has no basis for believing future performance will not continue to follow
the same pattern. Significant components of the provision for income taxes (benefits) are as follows:

The net operating loss carryforward arose through the operations of Heritage prior to the merger.
The Company believes the net operating loss carryforward will be fully utilized by 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has
 490 of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state income tax matters. If ultimately recognized, the Company does not anticipate any material increase in the effective tax rate during 2008 relative to any tax positions taken prior to
January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has accrued 55 for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company is
currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ending December 31, 2005 through 2008. The Company and its subsidiaries state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of
limitations for the years ended December 31, 2005 through 2008. Note K - Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans (In Thousands, Except Share Data) The Company
sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, under which participation and future benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 1996. The Company s funding policy is to contribute annually to the plan an amount at least equal to
the minimum amount determined by consulting actuaries in accordance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company did not make a contribution to the pension plan for 2008 or 2007. The Company anticipates that a contribution will be
required in 2009 due to changes made to the funding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and current market conditions. The plan s accumulated benefit obligations and the projected benefit obligations
are substantially the same since benefit accruals under the plan ceased at 1996 levels.

Plans (continued) 
 The Company also provides retiree health care benefits for certain employees who were employed by the
Company and enrolled in the Company s health plan as of December 31, 2004. To receive benefits, an eligible employee must retire from service with the Company and its affiliates, between age 55 and 65, and be credited with at least 15
years of service or with 70 points, determined as the sum of age and service at retirement. The Company periodically determines the portion of the premium to be paid by each eligible retiree and the portion to be paid by the Company. Coverage ceases
when an employee attains age 65 and is eligible for Medicare. The Company also provides life insurance coverage for each retiree in the face amount of 5,000 until age 70. Retirees can purchase additional insurance or continue coverage beyond age 70
at their sole expense. The Company has accounted for its obligation related to these retiree benefits in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company has limited its liability for the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) to
the rate of inflation assumed to be 4 each year. Increasing or decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would not materially increase or decrease the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation nor
the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit costs as of December 31, 2008, and for the year then ended. Pension Benefits represent the defined benefit pension plan previously maintained by the Company and Other Benefits represent the post-retirement health and life plans. There is no additional minimum pension liability required to be
recognized. Information relating to the defined benefit pension and post-retirement health and life plans as of December 31, 2008, and 2007 is as follows:

The investment objective for the pension or defined benefit plan is to achieve above average
income and moderate long term growth. Management seeks to accomplish this objective by combining an equity income strategy (approximately 50 ), which generally invests in larger capitalization common stocks, and an intermediate fixed income strategy
(approximately 50 ), which generally invests in U.S. Government securities and investment grade corporate bonds. It is management s intent to give the investment managers flexibility within the overall guidelines with respect to investment
decisions and their timing. However, significant modifications of any previously approved investments or anticipated use of derivatives to execute investment strategies must be approved by management. The plan s expected long-term rate of return was estimated using market benchmarks for investment classes applied to the plan s target asset
allocation. The expected return on investment classes was computed using a valuation methodology which projected future returns based on current equity valuations rather than historical returns.

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note K - Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation
Plans (continued) 
 The Company maintains a 401(k) plan, which is a contributory plan. Employees may contribute pre-tax
earnings, subject to a maximum established annually by the IRS. The Company matches employee deferrals, up to 4 of compensation. The Company also makes a nondiscretionary contribution for each eligible employee in an amount equal to 5 of plan
compensation and 5 of plan compensation in excess of the Social Security wage base. Employees are generally eligible to participate in the plan upon the attainment of age 21 and the completion of six months of service. Company contributions are
allocated to eligible employees who are employed on the last day of each plan year. The Company s costs related to the 401(k) plan, excluding employee deferrals, in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 3,605, 3,333 and 2,896, respectively. 
 The Company adopted the Performance Based Rewards incentive compensation plan on January 1, 2001, under which annual cash bonuses are
paid to eligible officers and employees, subject to the attainment of designated performance criteria. The Company designates minimum levels of performance for all applicable profit centers and rewards employees on performance over the minimum
level. The expense associated with the plan for 2007 and 2006 was 616 and 2,325, respectively. The Company did not make any payments under the plan during 2008 and thus did not incur any expense. The Company maintains three deferred compensation plans: a Deferred Stock Unit Plan and two conventional deferred compensation plans. Nonemployee
directors may defer all or any portion of their fees and retainer to the Deferred Stock Unit Plan or the deferred compensation plan maintained for their benefit. Officers may defer base salary and bonus to the Deferred Stock Unit Plan or to the
deferred compensation plan maintained for their benefit, subject to maximums that are determined annually by the Company. Amounts credited to the Deferred Stock Unit Plan are invested in units representing shares of the Company s common stock.
Amounts credited to a deferred compensation plan are invested in the discretion of each participant from among designated investment alternatives. Directors and officers who participated in the Company s deferred compensation plans on or before
December 31, 2006, may invest in a preferential interest rate investment that is derived from the Moody s Average Corporate Bond Rate, adjusted monthly, and the beneficiaries of participants in the deferred compensation plans as of such
date may receive a preretirement death benefit in excess of the amounts credited to plan accounts at the time of death. All of the Company s deferred compensation plans are unfunded. It is anticipated that the two conventional deferred
compensation plans will result in no additional cost to the Company because life insurance policies on the lives of the participants have been purchased in amounts estimated to be sufficient to pay plan benefits. The Company is both the owner and
beneficiary of the life insurance policies. The expense recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006 for the Company s deferred compensation plans, inclusive of deferrals, was 1,168, 1,128 and 1,200, respectively. The Company assumed four supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) in connection with the merger with Capital. The SERPs were established by
Capital to provide supplemental retirement benefits. The plans provide four officers of the Company specified annual benefits based upon a projected retirement date. These benefits are payable for a 15-year period after retirement. At
December 31, 2008, the supplemental executive retirement liabilities totaled 1,086. The plans are not qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. At December 31, 2008, an aggregate of 2,083,061 common shares were reserved for issuance under the Company s employee benefit plans. During 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 95,985 shares under an
approved repurchase plan. Repurchased shares will be used for various corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for business combinations and employee benefit plans. The repurchase plan was discontinued in January 2008. In 2001, the Company adopted a long-term equity incentive plan, which provides for the grant of stock options and restricted stock. Options granted under
the plan allow participants to acquire shares of the Company s common stock at a fixed exercise price and expire ten years after the grant date. Options vest and become exercisable in installments over a three-year period measured from the
grant date. Options that have not vested are forfeited and cancelled upon the termination of a participant s employment. The Company recorded compensation expense of 689, 934 and 724 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, for options granted under the plan. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each option grant:

date, the weighted average period over which this unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized was approximately 1.3 years and 1.4 years for stock options and restricted stock, respectively. In connection with its merger with Capital, the Company assumed the Capital Bancorp, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan, under which options to purchase an
aggregate of 224,966 shares of the Company s common stock were outstanding as of the date of assumption. No additional options or other forms of equity incentives will be granted or awarded under either of these plans.

The Company awards performance-based restricted stock to executives under the incentive plan and
time-based restricted stock to other officers and employees. The performance-based restricted stock vests upon completion of a one-year service period and the attainment of certain performance goals. Performance-based restricted stock is issued at
the target level; the number of shares ultimately awarded is determined at the end of each year and may be increased or decreased depending upon the Company meeting or exceeding financial performance measures defined by the Board of Directors. No
performance-based shares vested during 2008 because performance at the threshold level was not achieved. Time-based restricted stock vests at the end of a three-year service period. The fair value of each restricted stock grant is the closing price
of the Company s common stock on the day immediately preceding the grant date. The Company recorded compensation expense of 325, 510 and 747 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for restricted stock
awarded under the plan. The following table summarizes the changes in restricted stock as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008:

 Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note L - Restrictions on Cash, Bank Dividends, Loans or
Advances (In Thousands) Renasant
Bank is required to maintain average balances with the Federal Reserve. The average amount of those balances for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately 19,976 and 16,303, respectively. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is substantially dependent on the transfer from Renasant Bank of sufficient funds to pay
such dividends. Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of Renasant Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance is
required prior to Renasant Bank paying dividends, which are limited to earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock. At December 31, 2008, the unrestricted surplus for Renasant Bank was approximately 460,100. Federal Reserve regulations also limit the amount Renasant Bank may loan to the Company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. At
December 31, 2008, the maximum amount available for transfer from Renasant Bank to the Company in the form of loans was 31,587. There were no loans outstanding from Renasant Bank to the Company at December 31, 2008. Note M - Regulatory Matters (In Thousands) Renasant Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Renasant Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Renasant Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of Renasant Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. Renasant Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Renasant Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios. All banks are required to have core capital (Tier I) of at
least 4 of risk-weighted assets (as defined), 4 of average assets (as defined) and total capital of 8 of risk-weighted assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2008, Renasant Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
 As of December 31, 2008, the most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC categorized
Renasant Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Renasant Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios of 10 , 6 and
5 , respectively. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category. The following table provides the capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the Company and for our banking subsidiary at December 31:

 Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note N Segment Reporting (In Thousands) FASB Statement No. 131,
 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, requires public companies to report certain financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments (as defined by management) and certain
enterprise-wide financial information about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company s internal
reporting process is organized into four segments that account for the Company s principal activities: the delivery of financial services through its community banks in Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama and the delivery of insurance services
through its insurance agency. In order to give our regional management a more precise indication of the income and expenses they can control, the results of operations for the geographic regions of the community banks and for the insurance company
reflect the direct revenues and expenses of each respective segment. The Company believes this management approach will enable our regional management to focus on serving customers through loan originations and deposit gathering. Indirect revenues
and expenses, including but not limited to income from our investment portfolio, certain costs associated with other data processing and back office functions, are not allocated to our segments. Rather these revenues and expenses are shown in the
 Other column along with the operations of the holding company and eliminations which are necessary for purposes of reconciling to the consolidated amounts. The following table provides financial information for our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The increase in the Tennessee region for the year ended December 31, 2007
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 set forth in the table below primarily reflects the acquisition of Capital.

 Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note O Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (In Thousands) The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing balances with banks. The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and
cash equivalents approximates fair value. Securities available for sale : Fair values for securities available for sale are based on
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Mortgage loans held for sale : The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for mortgage loans held for sale approximates fair value. Loans : For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fixed-rate loan fair values, including
mortgages, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Derivative instruments : The fair value of the mortgage loan commitments are based on readily available fair values, obtained in the open market
from mortgage investors. The fair value of the interest rate swap is based on the projected future cash flows. Deposits : The fair
values disclosed for demand deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts are
estimated using a discounted cash flow based on currently effective interest rates for similar types of accounts. Short-term
borrowings : Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, treasury, tax and loan notes and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The fair value of these short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value of the amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheet for each respective account. Federal Home Loan Bank advances : The fair value for Federal
Home Loan Bank advances was determined by discounting the cash flow using the current market rate. Junior subordinated debentures :
The fair value for our junior subordinated debentures was determined by discounting the cash flow using the current market rate.

Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note O Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (continued) 
 Statement 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and also
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to a valuation based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1), moderate priority to a valuation based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and/or based on assumptions that are observable in the market (Level 2), and the lowest
priority to a valuation based on assumptions that are not observable in the market (Level 3). The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities on a
recurring basis: Securities available for sale : Securities available for sale consists primarily of debt securities such as
obligations of U.S. Government agencies and corporations, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and trust preferred securities. The fair values of these instruments are based on quoted market prices of similar
instruments or a discounted cash flow model as permitted under Staff Position 157-3. Securities available for sale also include equity securities that are not traded in an active market. The fair value of these securities approximates their
historical cost. Derivative instruments : Derivative instruments consist of mortgage loan commitments and an interest rate swap. The
fair value of the mortgage loan commitments reflect the values of mortgage loans having similar terms and characteristics to the mortgage loan commitments entered into by the Company. Interest rate swaps are extensively traded in over-the-counter
markets at prices based upon projections of future cash payments/receipts discounted at market rates. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap is determined based upon its discounted cash flows. The following table presents assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: 

Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Liabilities) (Level 1)

a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, during the year ended December 31, 2008:

Investments in pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value totaling 17,537 were
classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2008. These securities were classified as Level 3 primarily due to absence of market activity resulting in a lack of observable inputs for comparable trades that could be used to establish a benchmark for
valuation. Fair values for these securities were determined using discounted cash flow models, which incorporated certain assumptions and projections in determining fair values assigned.

Instruments (continued) 
 Certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value
adjustments typically are a result of the application of the lower of cost or market accounting or a write-down occurring during the period. The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company to estimate the fair values of the
Company s financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis: Mortgage loans held for sale : Mortgage loans held for sale
are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. If fair value is used, it is determined using current secondary market prices for loans with similar characteristics. Mortgage loans held for sale were carried at cost on the consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impaired loans: Loans considered impaired as defined in Statement 114 are
reserved for at the time the loan is identified as impaired taking into account the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets including but not limited to equipment, inventory and
accounts receivable. The fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. The fair value of the business assets is generally based on amounts reported on the business s financial statements.
Appraised and reported values may be adjusted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation and management s knowledge of the client and the client s business. Since not all
valuation inputs are observable, these nonrecurring fair value determinations are classified as Level 3. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same
factors previously identified. Other real estate owned : Other real estate owned OREO is comprised of commercial and
residential real estate obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. OREO acquired in settlement of indebtedness is recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or the fair value of the real estate less costs to sell.
Subsequently, it may be necessary to record nonrecurring fair value adjustments. Fair value, when recorded, is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers and adjusted for management s estimates of costs to sell. As such,
values for OREO are classified as Level 3. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during 2008 that were still held in
the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, the following table provides the hierarchy level and the fair value of the related assets:

 Impaired loans with a carrying value of 35,392 had an allocated allowance for loan losses of
 5,357 at December 31, 2008. The allocated allowance is based on the carrying value of the impaired loan and fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The 5,357 was included in the provision for loan losses for the
year ended December 31, 2008. In 2008, OREO with a carrying amount of 7,482 was written down to 6,735, resulting in a loss of 747,
which was included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Note T Mergers and Acquisitions (In Thousands, Except Share Data) On July 1, 2007, the Company completed its merger with
Capital, a bank holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Capital was the parent of Capital Bank Trust Company and operated seven banking offices in the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area
(the Nashville MSA ). The merger with Capital allowed the Company to further its strategic initiatives by expanding its geographic footprint into the Nashville MSA. The Company issued 2,797,238 shares of its common stock and paid approximately 56,055 in cash for 100 of the voting equity interests in Capital. The common stock issued by the Company was
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company used the proceeds of its public offering of 2.76 million shares of its common stock to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration. Three members of the Board of
Directors of Capital were added to the Company s Board. The aggregate transaction value, including the value of Capital s options assumed by the Company, was 131,400. In connection with the merger, the Company recorded approximately
 101,492 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes. The following table summarizes the
