Forward Looking Statements. The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 states that disclosure of forward looking information is desirable for investors
and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management. This Annual
Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply with the terms of
the safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of risks and uncertainties could cause its actual results and experience to
differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward looking statements. There
are risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development, growth projections and results of the Company's
business. They include, but are not limited to, economic growth, interest rate movements, timely development of technology enhancements
for products, services and operating systems, the impact of competitive products, services and pricing, customer requirements,
regulatory changes and similar matters. Readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements
that are subject to influence by these risk factors and unanticipated events. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially
from management's expectations. 

General 

First South Bancorp, Inc. First
South Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is a Virginia corporation that serves as the holding company for First South Bank
(the Bank ), a North Carolina chartered commercial bank. The Company s principal business is overseeing the
business of the Bank and operating through the Bank a commercial banking business. The Bank has one significant operating segment,
the providing of general commercial banking services to its markets located in the state of North Carolina. The Company s
common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FSBK . 

First South Bank. The Bank is a
North Carolina chartered commercial bank headquartered in Washington, North Carolina. The Bank received federal insurance of its
deposits in 1959. The Bank s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these
funds in commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans and loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied,
single-family residences in the Bank s market area. 

The Bank s income consists principally
of interest and fees earned on loans and investments, loan servicing and other fees, gains on the sale of loans and investments,
and service charges and fees collected on deposit accounts. The Bank s principal expenses are interest expense on deposits
and borrowings and noninterest expense such as compensation and employee benefits, office occupancy expenses, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses. Funds for these activities are
provided principally by deposits, borrowings, repayments of outstanding loans and investments and other operating revenues. 

Market Area. The Bank makes loans
and obtains deposits throughout eastern and central North Carolina, where the Bank s offices are located. As of December
31, 2012, management believes that a majority of all deposits and loans come from its primary market area. The economy of the
Bank s primary market area is diversified, with employment distributed among manufacturing, agriculture and non-manufacturing
activities. There are a significant number of major employers in the Bank s primary market area. 

The average unemployment rate in the Bank s
primary market area (10.9 exceeds the December 2012 National average (7.8 ), Federal Reserve Fifth District average (7.4 ),
and the State of North Carolina (9.2 ). 

Critical
Accounting Policies. The Bank has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding
of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Bank s business operations
is discussed throughout Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and 
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form
10-K, where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. 

Use of Estimates. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions. Estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

2 

Loan Impairment and Allowance for Credit
Losses. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will
be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or
lease agreement. All collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, while uncollateralized
loans and other loans determined not to be collateral dependent are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. 

The Bank uses several factors in determining
if a loan or lease is impaired. The Bank s internal asset classification procedures include a thorough review of significant
loans, leases and lending relationships and include the accumulation of related data. This data includes loan and lease payment
status, borrowers financial data and borrowers operating factors such as cash flows, operating income or loss, etc. 

The allowance for credit losses is increased
by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy
of the allowance for credit losses is based on the Bank s past loan and lease loss experience, known and inherent risks
in loans and leases held for investment and in unfunded loan commitments, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers 
ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, certain qualitative factors and current economic conditions.
While management believes that it has established the allowance for credit losses in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment,
there can be no assurance in the future that regulators or risks in loans and leases held for investment and in unfunded loan
commitments will not require adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. 

Income Taxes. Deferred tax
asset and liability balances are determined by application of temporary differences of the tax rate expected to be in effect when
taxes will become payable or receivable. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The
effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Risk. The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business
to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in
excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance
sheet instruments. See Unfunded Commitments Composition below for additional information. 

Recognized Subsequent Event 

On February 21, 2013, the Bank announced
a two-tiered Bulk Asset Disposition Plan (the Disposition Plan to significantly reduce its level of problem assets
through a bulk sale of problem loans and the disposition of other real estate owned OREO properties. Pursuant
to guidance set forth in ASC 855, Subsequent Events , while the events of the Disposition Plan occurred after December 31,
2012, the effect of these transactions on the value of the assets impacted is being reflected in the Company s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, as a recognized subsequent event. 

The Disposition Plan is segregated into
two phases. First, on February 20, 2013, the Bank executed an agreement to sell problem loans with a book value of 46.5 million
to Emerald Portfolio, LLC Emerald ), resulting in a 17.6 million pre-tax charge to 2012 earnings. Second, the Bank
wrote down the majority of its OREO assets in order to allow for the disposal of these problem assets in an accelerated time frame.
As a result, the Company realized a 5.2 million pre-tax valuation charge to 2012 earnings. 

The Bank completed the problem loan sale
on February 22, 2013, and received net proceeds of 25.1 million. The OREO disposal phase of the Disposition Plan is on-going.
The Bank believes the valuation adjustments taken as of December 31, 2012, against that portion of the OREO portfolio offered
for sale, resulted in book values that are at levels for which the assets can be disposed of at prices that are indicative of
market values. 

For the year ended December 31, 2012,
the Company recognized an 11.0 million net operating loss, or 1.13) per diluted share, compared to net income of 1.6 million,
or 0.16 per diluted common share, earned for the year ended December 31, 2011. Excluding the effects of the Disposition Plan,
net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, would have been 3.0 million, or 0.31 per diluted common share.

Summary of Bulk Asset Disposition Plan
and Impact on December 31, 2012 : 

The
 combined loss associated
 with the charge-off
 and write-down
 of these troubled
 assets, net of
 tax, totaled 14.0)
 million, or 1.44)
 per diluted share
 on an annual basis
 for 2012. 

The
 Company incurred
 charge-offs of
 22.5 million in
 association with
 the Disposition
 Plan s problem
 loans effective
 December 31, 2012.
 While reserves
 on this pool of
 loans had been
 set aside in previous
 periods, the Bank
 provided an additional
 17.2 million to
 the allowance for
 loan and lease
 losses ALLL in association
 with the problem
 loan disposition
 plan. 

The
 Company took a
 5.2 million valuation
 write-down on OREO
 assets associated
 with the Disposition
 Plan, effective
 December 31, 2012. 

The
 level of nonperforming
 assets declined
 from 52.8 million,
 or 7.36 of total
 assets as of September
 30, 2012, to 34.2
 million, or 4.84 
 of total assets
 as of December
 31, 2012. 

The
 ALLL at December
 31, 2012, relative
 to loans held for
 investment, adjusting
 for the loan charge-offs,
 is 1.78 and covers
 nonaccrual loans
 that are held for
 investment 1.77
 times, a favorable
 change from the
 0.43 times coverage
 at the end of the
 third quarter of
 2012. 

The
 Company will be
 able to execute
 this Disposition
 Plan without the
 need to raise additional
 capital. 

Despite
 the loss incurred,
 capital levels
 of the Company
 and the Bank remain
 very strong and
 in excess of regulatory
 minimums to be
 considered well
 capitalized . 

The table below reflects the impact of
the Disposition Plan on the Bank s asset quality metrics.

Lending Activities 

General. The Bank s loan
portfolio consists of loans held for sale and loans and leases held for investment. Loans held for sale totaled 44.7 million
at December 31, 2012, representing 6.3 of total assets at that date. Gross loans and leases held for investment totaled 442.9
million at December 31, 2012, representing 62.6 of total assets at that date. It is the Bank s policy to concentrate its
lending within its market area. 

Loans Held for Sale . The Bank originates
single family residential first mortgage loans. A certain portion of these originations are classified as loans held for sale.
At December 31, 2012, pursuant to ASC 825, Financial Instruments , the Bank marked these mortgage loans to market.
At December 31, 2012, the Bank had 20.3 million of mortgage loans held for sale. In addition, as of December 31, 2012, in conjunction
with the Disposition Plan, 46.9 million of loans previously held for investment were written down to a fair value of 24.4 million,
as a result of the bid price for these loans, and they were reclassified as held for sale. 

Loans Held for Investment. The
Bank originates a significant amount of loans held for investment. At December 31, 2012, commercial real estate, construction,
and lot/land loans amounted to 271.9 million, or 61.4 of gross loans held for investment. In recent years, the Bank has sought
to increase originations of commercial business loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2012, commercial business loans totaled
 20.8 million, or 4.7 of gross loans held for investment, and consumer loans totaled 68.3 million, or 15.4 of gross loans held
for investment. At December 31, 2012, 76.2 million, or 17.2 of gross loans held for investment, consisted of single-family,
residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had 5.7 million of lease receivables, or 1.3 of gross loans held
for investment. The Bank relies on ASC 310, Receivables , for general guidance regarding accounting disclosures for loans
receivable.

Unfunded Commitments Composition. The
Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily to meet the financing
needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, as listed
in the table above. Those instruments involve varying degrees and elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the balance sheet. The Bank s exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
The Bank uses the same credit underwriting policies and procedures in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does
for on-balance-sheet instruments. 

The Bank estimates probable
losses related to unfunded lending commitments and records a reserve for unfunded commitments in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. At December 31, 2012, and 2011, the balance of the reserve for unfunded commitments was 228,000 and 254,000,
respectively. 

See Historical Loss and Qualitative
Analysis below for additional information regarding the assessment of the reserve for unfunded commitments, including historical
loss percentages and qualitative factors allocated among the specific categories of unfunded commitments. In developing this analysis,
the Bank relies on actual historical loss experience for the most recent eight quarters and exercises management s best
judgment in assessing qualitative risk. There were no changes in the Bank s accounting policy and methodology used to estimate
the reserve for unfunded commitments at December 31, 2012. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding unfunded commitments and off-balance sheet risk.

Scheduled contractual principal repayments
of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans can be substantially less than their contractual
terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately
due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan
is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially
higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially
lower than rates on existing mortgage loans. 

Originations, Purchases and Sales of
Loans . The Bank has authority to originate and purchase loans secured by real estate located throughout the state of North
Carolina and the United States. Consistent with its emphasis on being a community-oriented financial institution, the Bank concentrates
its lending activities in its primary market area. 

The Bank s loan
originations are derived from a number of sources, including calling officers, referrals from depositors and borrowers, repeat
customers, advertising, as well as walk-in customers. The Bank s solicitation programs consist of advertisements in local
media, in addition to participation in various community organizations and events. Real estate loans are originated by the Bank s
loan personnel. The Bank s loan personnel consists of both salaried employees with an annual incentive and commission paid
mortgage loan officers. Loan applications are accepted at the Bank s offices, by mail, through the Bank s website,
and loan officers originating loans at off-site locations, such as a realtor office. Historically, the Bank generally has not
purchased loans; however, during the year ended December 31, 2012 the Bank purchased 6.3 million of participations in commercial
real estate loans. In the future, the Bank may consider making additional loan participation purchases. 

In recent years, the Bank has sold or
exchanged for mortgage-backed securities a significant amount of fixed-rate, single-family mortgage loans it originated. During
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, these transactions totaled 70.6 million, 60.9 million and 87.5 million,
respectively. Such loans are sold to, or exchanged with, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC , also
known as Freddie Mac ). The Bank generally retains servicing on loans sold to, or exchanged with, FHLMC. On February
21, 2013, the Bank announced a two-tiered Asset Disposition Plan which included a bulk sale of problem loans. For more information
on this transaction, see Recognized Subsequent Event above. 

Loan Underwriting Policies . The
Bank s lending activities are subject to the Bank s written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards, its outside
investors and to loan origination procedures prescribed by the Bank s Board of Directors (the Board and its
management. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower s willingness and ability to repay, and the
more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial information and confirmations.
All mortgage loans and any single commercial or consumer loan over 1.5 million or any borrower with aggregate credit of greater
than 3.0 million must be approved by the Directors Loan Committee, made up of three outside directors who serve on a rotating
basis. Such loans are presented weekly by the Management Loan Committee. The President does not serve on the loan committee of
the Board. Individual officers of the Bank have been granted authority by the Board to approve consumer and commercial loans up
to varying specified dollar amounts, depending upon the type of loan and the lender s level of expertise. In addition, committees
of credit administrators and loan officers have loan authorities greater than individual authorities. These authorities are based
on aggregate borrowings of an individual or entity. On a monthly basis, the full Board reviews the actions taken by the loan committees. 

Generally, after receipt of a loan application
from a prospective borrower, in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, a credit report and verifications are
ordered, or obtained, to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant s employment, income and credit standing.
If a proposed loan is to be secured by real estate, an appraisal of the real estate is usually undertaken either by an appraiser
approved by the Bank and licensed by the State of North Carolina or an evaluation by qualified Bank personnel. Applications for
single-family residential mortgage loans are underwritten and closed in accordance with the standards of FHLMC, investor guidelines
or the Bank s guidelines. The Bank uses an automated underwriting software program owned by FHLMC named Loan Prospector
on the majority of mortgage loans underwritten for sale to FHLMC. In addition, mortgage loans sold to other investors may be manually
underwritten by the Bank, or through FHLMC s Loan Prospector, or the respective investor, or the respective investor s
representatives, or through an investor s automated underwriting system, if applicable. In the case of single-family residential
mortgage loans, except when the Bank becomes aware of a particular risk of environmental contamination, the Bank generally does
not obtain a formal environmental report on the real estate at the time a loan is made. A formal environmental report may be required
in connection with nonresidential real estate loans. 

8 

It is the Bank s policy to record
a lien on the real estate securing a loan and to obtain title insurance which insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances
and other possible title defects. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when the property is in a
flood plain as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA ), obtain flood insurance. 

If the amount of a residential mortgage
loan originated or refinanced exceeds 80 of the lesser of the appraised value or contract price, the Bank s practice generally
is to obtain private mortgage insurance at the borrower s expense on that portion of the principal amount of the loan that
exceeds 80 . Certain government insured or guaranteed mortgage loans have loan-to-values higher than 95 , which are generally
sold to outside investors, servicing released. The Bank generally makes single-family residential mortgage loans with up to a
95 loan-to-value ratio if the required private mortgage insurance is obtained. The Bank generally limits the loan-to-value ratio
on commercial real estate mortgage loans to 85 , although the loan-to-value ratio on residential and commercial real estate loans
in limited circumstances has been as high as 100 . The Bank generally limits the loan-to-value ratio on multi-family residential
real estate loans to 85 , although in limited circumstances the loan-to-value ratio has been higher. The Bank is subject to regulations
that limit the amount the Bank can lend to one borrower. See Depository Institution Regulation Limits on Loans
to One Borrower. Under these limits, the Bank s loans-to-one-borrower were limited to 12.3 million at December 31,
2012. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. 

Interest rates charged by the Bank on
loans are affected principally by competitive factors, the demand for such loans and the supply of funds available for lending
purposes. These factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including
the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and government budgetary matters. 

Single-Family Residential Real Estate
Lending. The Bank is an originator of single-family, residential real estate loans in its market area. At December 31, 2012,
single-family, residential mortgage loans, excluding home improvement loans, totaled 76.2 million, or 17.2 of gross loans held
for investment. The Bank originates fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans at competitive interest rates. At December 31,
2012, 50.5 million, or 66.2 , of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans.
Generally, the Bank retains fixed-rate mortgages with maturities of less than 10 years, while fixed-rate loans with longer maturities
may be retained in portfolio or sold in the secondary market. The Bank also originates conventional and government mortgage loans
in its market area, which are underwritten, closed and sold servicing-retained in the secondary market or servicing-released to
an outside investor. 

The Bank also offers adjustable-rate residential
mortgage loans. The adjustable-rate loans currently offered by the Bank have interest rates which adjust every one, three, five,
seven, or ten years from the closing date of the loan or on an annual basis commencing after an initial fixed-rate period of one,
three, five, seven or ten years in accordance with a designated index plus a stipulated margin. The primary index utilized by
the Bank is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant comparable maturity equal to the loan
adjustment period, as made available by the Federal Reserve Board (the Treasury Rate ). The Bank offers adjustable-rate
loans that meet FHLMC underwriting standards, as well as loans that do not meet such standards. The Bank s adjustable-rate
single-family residential real estate loans that do not meet FHLMC standards have a cap of generally 2.0 on any increase in the
interest rate at any adjustment date, and include a cap on the maximum interest rate over the life of the loan, which cap generally
is 3.0 to 6.0 above the initial rate. In return for providing a relatively low cap on interest rate increases over the life
of the loan, the Bank s adjustable-rate loans provide for a floor on the minimum interest rate over the life of the loan,
which floor generally is the initial rate. Further, the Bank generally does not offer teaser rates, i.e. ,
initial rates below the fully indexed rate, on such loans. The adjustable-rate mortgage loans offered by the Bank that do conform
to FHLMC standards have a cap of up to 6.0 above the initial rate over the life of a loan and include a floor. All of the Bank s
adjustable-rate loans require that any payment adjustment resulting from a change in the interest rate of an adjustable-rate loan
be sufficient to result in full amortization of the loan by the end of the loan term and, thus, do not permit any of the increased
payment to be added to the principal amount of the loan, or so-called negative amortization. At December 31, 2012, 25.7 million,
or 33.8 of residential mortgage loans were adjustable-rate loans. 

9 

The retention of adjustable-rate loans
in the loan portfolio helps reduce exposure to increases or decreases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are
unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable-rate
loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate loans may increase
due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Further, although adjustable-rate loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity
of its interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the initial
fixed-rate period before the first adjustment and the lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that yields on the adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the cost of funds. 

The Bank makes a loan commitment on single-family
residential mortgage loans of between 15 and 90 days for each loan approved. If the borrower desires a longer commitment, the
commitment may be extended for good cause and upon written approval. Fees of between 175 and 650 are charged in connection with
the issuance of a commitment letter. The interest rate is guaranteed for the commitment period. 

Construction Lending. The Bank
also offers residential and commercial construction loans, with a substantial portion of such loans originated to date being for
the construction of single-family dwellings in the Bank s primary market area. Residential construction loans are offered
primarily to individuals building their primary, investment or secondary residence, as well as to selected local builders to build
single-family dwellings. Generally, loans to owner/occupants for the construction of owner-occupied, single-family residential
properties are originated in connection with the permanent loan on the property and have a construction term of 6 to 18 months.
Such loans are offered on a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate basis. Generally, interest rates on residential construction loans made
to the owner/occupant have interest rates during the construction period above the rate offered by the Bank on the permanent loan
product selected by the borrower. Upon completion of construction, the permanent loan rate will be set at the rate then offered
by the Bank on that permanent loan product, not to exceed the predetermined permanent rate cap. Interest rates on residential
construction loans to builders are generally set at the prime rate plus a margin of between 0.0 and 2.0 and adjust either monthly
or daily. Interest rates on commercial construction loans are generally based on the prime rate plus a negotiated margin of between
0.0 and 2.0 and adjust either monthly or daily, with construction terms generally not exceeding 18 months. Advances are made
on a percentage of completion basis. After successfully reducing its acquisition, development and construction (ADC) concentration,
the Bank has resumed originating speculative and pre-sold construction loans on 1 to 4 family residential properties in select
markets within its primary market area. At December 31, 2012, commercial construction loans totaled 20.5 million, which amounted
to 4.6 of gross loans held for investment. 

Prior to making a commitment to fund a
loan, the Bank requires an appraisal of the property by appraisers approved by the Board for loans in excess of 250,000. For
loans up to 250,000, the Bank requires an evaluation of the property by qualified Bank personnel, or an outside appraisal by
an approved appraiser. The Bank also reviews and inspects each project at the commencement of construction and periodically during
the term of the construction loan. The Bank generally charges a 0.0 to 1.0 construction loan fee for speculative builder loans
and for construction loans to owner-occupants. For residential construction loans, the Bank generally charges an origination fee,
construction fee, and/or a commitment fee up to 1.0 of the commitment amount. 

Construction financing generally is considered
to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction
loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction
and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in
delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate and the borrower is unable to meet the
Bank s requirements of putting up additional funds to cover extra costs or change orders, then the Bank will demand that
the loan be paid off and, if necessary, institute foreclosure proceedings, or refinance the loan. If the estimate of value proves
to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with collateral having a value which is
insufficient to assure full repayment. The Bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified
borrowers i.e. , borrowers who satisfy all credit requirements and whose loans satisfy all other underwriting standards
which would apply to the Bank s permanent mortgage loan financing for the subject property). On loans to builders, the Bank
works only with selected builders with whom it has experience and carefully monitors the creditworthiness of the builders. Builder
relationships are analyzed and underwritten annually by the Bank s credit administration department. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending. 
The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, generally limiting such originations to loans secured by properties in its primary
market area and to borrowers with whom it has other loan relationships. The Bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio
includes loans to finance the acquisition of small office buildings and commercial and industrial buildings with a preference
to owner occupied properties. Such loans generally range in size from 100,000 to 3.5 million. At December 31, 2012, commercial
real estate loans totaled 216.6 million, which amounted to 48.9 of gross loans held for investment. Commercial real estate loans
are originated for three to ten year terms with interest rates that adjust based on either the prime rate as quoted in The
Wall Street Journal , plus a negotiated margin of between 0.0 and 2.0 for shorter term loans, or on a fixed-rate basis
with interest calculated on a 15 to 20 year amortization schedule, generally with a balloon payment due after three to ten years. 

10 

Commercial real estate CRE lending entails additional risks, as compared with single-family residential property lending. Commercial real estate loans typically
involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically
is dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, retail establishment or business. These risks can be significantly
affected by supply and demand conditions in the market for office, retail and residential space, and, as such, may be subject
to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy generally. To minimize these risks, the Bank generally limits itself
to its market area or to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise known to the Bank. It has been the
Bank s policy to obtain annual financial statements of the business of the borrower or the project for which commercial
loans are made for loans over 1.0 million. In addition, in the case of commercial mortgage loans made to a partnership or a corporation,
the Bank obtains personal guarantees from an owner with 20 or more interest in the company and for loans over 1.0 million annual
financial statements of the principals of the partnership or corporation. 

The Bank put a moratorium on acquisition
and development loans A D loans) in June 2008. There have been no new A D loans originated since that time,
except for two new loans for phase 2 of existing projects. One project has performed as anticipated and was fully paid out as
of December 31, 2011, and the second project has a contract in place to purchase all the lots being developed. The Bank restricted
loans for lots and land beginning in mid-2009, and imposed a full moratorium on these types of loans in the third quarter of 2010.
Because the acquisition, development and construction portfolio ADC was not decreasing at the rate desired through
the moratoriums on A D, lots and land loans, the Bank restricted speculative construction loans beginning in January 2011.
The Bank has successfully met its concentration reduction plan objectives for reducing CRE concentrations, including various segments
of CRE in the commercial loan portfolio. All categories of CRE concentrations are now within acceptable levels established by
the Bank. With the successful reduction of its ADC concentration in 2012, the Bank has resumed originating speculative and pre-sold
construction loans on 1 to 4 family residential properties in select markets within its primary market area. 

Beginning in 2011, the Bank instituted
an policy that it will not extend, directly or indirectly, any additional credit to or for the benefit of any borrower who is
obligated in any manner to the Bank on any extension of credit or portion thereof that has been charged-off or is adversely classified
as doubtful or loss, so long as such credit remains uncollected. In addition, the Bank will not make additional advances to any
borrower whose loan or line of credit has been adversely classified as substandard without prior approval of a majority of the
Board of Directors. 

Commercial Lending. The Bank s
commercial loans consist of loans secured by commercial real estate and commercial business loans, which are not secured by real
estate. For a discussion of the Bank s commercial real estate lending see Commercial Real Estate Lending. 

The Bank originates commercial business
loans to small and medium sized businesses in its market area. The Bank s commercial borrowers are generally small businesses
engaged in manufacturing, distribution, retailing, service companies, or professionals in healthcare, engineering, architecture,
accounting and law. Commercial business loans are generally made to finance the purchase of inventory, new or used equipment or
commercial vehicles, to support trading assets and for short-term working capital. Such loans generally are secured by equipment
and inventory, and when appropriate, cross-collateralized by a real estate mortgage, although commercial business loans are sometimes
granted on an unsecured basis. Such loans generally are made for terms of five years or less, depending on the purpose of the
loan and the collateral, with loans to finance operating expenses made for one year or less, with interest rates that typically
either adjust daily at a rate equal to the prime rate as stated in The Wall Street Journal , plus a margin of between 0.0 
and 2.5 or at a negotiated fixed rate. Generally, commercial loans are made in amounts ranging between 5,000 and 2.0 million.
At December 31, 2012, commercial business loans totaled 20.8 million, or 4.7 of gross loans held for investment. 

11 

The Bank underwrites its commercial business
loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than relying solely
on the basis of underlying collateral value, and the Bank seeks to structure such loans to have more than one source of repayment.
The borrower is required to provide the Bank with sufficient information to allow the Bank to make its lending determination.
In most instances, this information consists of at least three years of financial statements, a statement of projected cash flows,
current financial information on any guarantor and any additional information on the collateral. For unsecured loans over 50,000
with maturities exceeding one year, the Bank requires that borrowers and guarantors provide updated financial information at least
annually throughout the term of the loan. 

The Bank s commercial business loans
may be structured as short-term loans, term loans or as lines of credit. Short-term commercial business loans are generally for
periods of 36 months or less and are generally self-liquidating from asset conversion cycles. Commercial business term loans are
generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of seven years or less. Commercial business lines of credit
are typically made for the purpose of supporting trading assets and providing working capital. Such loans are usually approved
with a term of 12 months and are reviewed annually. The Bank also offers both secured and unsecured standby letters of credit
for its commercial borrowers. The terms of standby letters of credit generally do not exceed one year, and they are underwritten
as stringently as any commercial loan and generally are of a performance nature. 

Commercial business loans may involve
greater risk than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation of the business
involved, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize
these risks through its underwriting guidelines, which require that the loan be supported by adequate cash flow of the borrower,
profitability of the business, collateral and personal guarantees of the individuals in the business. In addition, the Bank limits
this type of lending to its market area and to borrowers who are well known to the Bank, or the Bank is able to adequately confirm
the background and stability of the borrower. 

Lease Receivables. Lease receivables
are originated by the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, First South Leasing, LLC FSL ). FSL primarily offers
leases on equipment utilized for business purposes. Rental terms generally range from 12 to 60 months and include options
to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease. Most leases provide 100 of the cost of the equipment and are
secured by the leased equipment. FSL requires the leased equipment to be insured and that FSL be listed as a loss payee
and named as an additional insured on the insurance policy. At December 31, 2012, lease receivables totaled 5.7 million, or 1.3 
of gross loans held for investment. 

Consumer Lending. The Bank also
originates consumer loans. The consumer loans originated by the Bank include automobile loans, certificate of deposit loans, home
equity loans and miscellaneous other consumer loans, both secured and unsecured loans. At December 31, 2012, consumer loans totaled
 68.3 million, or 15.4 of gross loans held for investment. 

At December 31, 2012, the Bank had 26.7
million in home equity line of credit loans, representing 6.0 of gross loans held for investment. The home equity lines of credit
have adjustable interest rates tied to the prime interest rate plus a margin, and require monthly payments based on the outstanding
balance. Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by subordinate liens against residential real property. The Bank requires
that fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and if appropriate, flood insurance) be maintained in an amount at least sufficient
to cover its loan. Home equity loans are generally limited so that the amount of such loans, along with any senior indebtedness,
does not exceed 80 of the value of the real estate security. 

Consumer lending affords the Bank the
opportunity to earn yields higher than those obtainable on single-family residential lending. However, consumer loans entail greater
risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable
assets such as automobiles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment
of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency
often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are
dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by events
such as job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Further, the application of various state and federal laws, including
federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency law, may limit the amount which may be recovered. In underwriting consumer loans,
the Bank considers the borrower s credit history, an analysis of the borrower s income and ability to repay the loan,
and the value of the collateral. 

Loan Fees and Servicing . The Bank
receives fees in connection with late payments and for miscellaneous services related to its loans. The Bank also charges fees
in connection with loan originations. These fees can consist of origination, discount, construction and/or commitment fees, depending
on the type of loan. The Bank services loans sold to FHLMC with servicing retained, generally for an annual servicing fee of 0.25 
of the loan amount. 

12 

The Bank has also developed a program
to originate residential mortgage loans for a local credit union. The Bank receives a 1.0 origination fee for each loan as well
as an annual servicing fee of 0.375 of the loan amount. All of these loans are funded and closed in the name of the credit union.
The Bank has explored the possibility of developing similar arrangements with other institutions, although none are currently
planned. 

Nonperforming Loans and Other Problem
Assets . It is management s policy to continually monitor its loan portfolio to anticipate and address potential and
actual delinquencies. When a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan, the Bank takes immediate steps to have the delinquency
cured and the loan restored to current status. Loans which are delinquent more than 15 days incur a late fee of 4.0 on mortgage
and consumer loans and up to 6.0 on commercial loans, of the monthly payment of principal and interest due. As a matter of policy,
the Bank will contact the borrower after the loan has been delinquent 15 days. If payment is not promptly received, the borrower
is contacted again, and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency. Generally, after any loan is
delinquent 30 days or more, a default letter is sent to the borrower. If the default is not cured after 45 days from the default
letter, formal legal proceedings may commence to collect amounts owed. 

Loans generally are placed on nonaccrual
status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed, when, in management s judgment, it is determined that the collectability
of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful. This occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days, if not so
prior classified. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past due are generally charged off, or a specific allowance
may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when management concludes that they are uncollectible.
See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. 

Payments on nonaccrual loans which have
no impairment or impaired loans that have been adjusted to fair market value are applied to principal and interest as scheduled.
Payments on nonaccrual loans which are impaired but have not been adjusted to fair market value are posted as principal receipts.
Mortgage and consumer loans are generally removed from nonaccrual status and interest resumes accruing once a loan has had a period
of sustained payments, generally six months. Commercial loans are generally removed from nonaccrual status and interest resumes
accruing when none of the principal and interest is due and unpaid or when the loan becomes otherwise well secured and in the
process of collection and has had a period of sustained payments, generally six months. 

In a troubled debt restructuring TDR ),
the Bank s primary objective is to make the best of a difficult situation. Concessions are granted to protect as much of
the loan amount as possible. Additionally, the Bank expects to obtain more cash or other value from the borrower, or increase
the probability of collection, by granting a concession than by not granting one. The Bank faces significant challenges when working
with borrowers who are experiencing diminished operating cash flows, depreciated collateral values, or prolonged sales and rental
absorption periods. While borrowers may experience deterioration in their financial condition, many continue to be creditworthy
customers who have the willingness and capacity to repay their debts. In such cases, the Bank finds it mutually beneficial to
work constructively together with its borrowers, and that prudent restructurings are often in the best interest of the Bank and
the borrower. 

The Bank offers a variety of restructuring
concessions for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial condition that would not otherwise be considered.
TDR concessions may include, but are not limited to any one or a combination of the following: a modification of the loan terms
such as a reduction of the contractual interest rate, principal, payment amount or accrued interest; an extension of the maturity
date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new debt with similar risks; a change in payment type,
i.e. from principal and interest, to interest only with all principal due at maturity; a substitution or acceptance of additional
collateral; and a substitution or addition of new debtors for the original borrower. 

The Bank s restructuring success
includes but is not limited to any one or combination of the following: improves the prospects for repayment of principal and
interest; reduces the prospects of further write downs and charge-offs; reduces the prospects of potential additional foreclosures;
helps borrowers to maintain a creditworthy status; and ultimately will reduce the volume of classified, criticized and/or nonaccrual
loans. 

The Bank relies on ASC 310-40-50 for guidance
regarding disclosure of TDRs. Under ASC 310-40-50-2, information about an impaired loan that has been restructured in a TDR involving
a modification of terms need not be included in disclosures required by paragraphs 310-10-50-15(a) and 310-10-50-15(c) in years
after the restructuring if both of the following conditions exist: 

13 

1. The restructuring agreement specifies
 an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate that the creditor
 was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new
 loan with comparable risk; and 

2. The loan is not impaired based on
 the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. 

When a restructuring agreement with a
particular borrower specifies a rate that is less than a market rate the Bank would be willing to accept at the time of the restructuring
for a new loan with comparable risk, that loan will not qualify or be considered for redesignating in a subsequent period. Information
about any such loans that do not qualify for redesignating will continue to be disclosed as required. 

When a restructuring agreement with a
particular borrower specifies a rate that is equal to or greater than a market rate the Bank would be willing to accept at the
time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk, that loan may qualify and will be considered for redesignating
in a subsequent period if the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement and is in compliance
with its modified terms. Since these loans meet the conditions of ASC 310-40-50-2, information regarding these loans may be omitted
from disclosures required by paragraphs 310-10-50-15(a) and 310-10-50-15(c) in years after the restructuring. 

Generally, loans whose terms are modified
in troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment. However, if the Bank has written down a loan and the measure of
the restructured loan is equal to or greater than the recorded investment, no impairment would be recognized. The Bank is required
to disclose the amount of the write-down and the recorded investment in the year of the write-down, but is not required to disclose
the recorded investment in that loan in later years if the two criteria in ASC 310-40-50-2 are met. The Bank continues to measure
loan impairment on the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement in accordance with ASC 310-10-35-20 through
35-26 and 310-10-35-37 for those certain loans that may meet the criteria to be redesignated and are no longer called TDRs. 

On a loan-by-loan basis, the Bank restructures
loans that were either on nonaccrual basis prior to restructuring or on accrual basis prior to restructuring. If a loan was on
nonaccrual basis prior to restructuring, it remains on nonaccrual basis until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and
ability to meet the terms and conditions of the restructuring and to make the restructured loan payments, generally for a period
of at least six months. If a restructured loan was on accrual basis prior to restructuring and the Bank expects the borrower to
perform to the terms and conditions of the loan after restructuring (i.e. the loan was current, on accrual basis, the monthly
payment is not significantly larger than the contractual payment before restructuring, and the borrower has the ability to make
the restructured loan payments), the loan remains on an accrual basis and placement on nonaccrual is not required. 

The Bank also performs restructurings
on certain troubled loan workouts whereby existing loans are restructured into a multiple two note structure A Note and
B Note structure). The Bank separates a portion of the current outstanding debt into a new legally enforceable note (Note
A) that is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to prudently modified terms. The portion of the debt that
is not reasonably assured of repayment (Note B) is adversely classified and charged-off upon restructuring. 

The benefit of this workout strategy is
for the Note A to remain a performing asset, for which the borrower has the willingness and ability to meet the restructured payment
terms and conditions. In addition, this workout strategy reduces the prospects of further write downs and charge offs, and also
reduces the prospects of a potential foreclosure. Following restructuring, Note A credit classifications generally improves from
 substandard to pass , if supported by the borrower s ability to repay the loan. 

The general terms of the new loans restructured
under the Note A and Note B structure differ as follows: 

Note A : First lien position; fixed
or adjustable current market interest rate; fixed month term to maturity; payments interest only to maturity, or full
principal and interest to maturity. Note A is underwritten in accordance with the Company s customary underwriting standards
and is generally on an accrual basis. 

Note B : Second lien position; fixed
or adjustable below current market interest rate; fixed month term to maturity; payments due in full at maturity. Note
B is underwritten in accordance with the Company s customary underwriting standards, except for the below market interest
rate and payment terms, and is on a nonaccrual basis and charged-off.

 of the note. 

(3) As a result of the Disposition
 Plan, all Note A and Note B structure loans were sold on February
 22, 2013. 

Aside from the loans defined as nonaccrual,
over 90 days past due, classified, or restructured, there were no loans at December 31, 2012, where known information about possible
credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present
loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as nonaccrual, over 90 days past due or restructured. See Note 5 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding troubled debt restructuring. 

The level of non-performing
loans is primarily attributable to the current economic environment. Downward pressure has impacted the market values of housing
and other real estate, significantly impacting property values in the Bank s market area and credit quality of certain borrowers.
Management has evaluated its non-performing loans and believes they are either well collateralized or adequately reserved. However,
there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased risks in the loan portfolio, adverse changes in economic conditions
or other factors will not require further adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. 

Based on an impairment analysis of loans
held for investment, at December 31, 2012 there were 37.5 million of loans classified as impaired, net of 1.8 million in write-downs.
As of December 31, 2012, the allowance for loan losses included 460,000 specifically provided for these impaired loans. A loan
is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the
scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan arrangement. All collateral-dependent
loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, while uncollateralized loans and other loans determined
not to be collateral dependent are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the historical effective interest rate. The Bank uses several factors in determining if a loan is impaired. The internal asset
classification procedures include a thorough review of significant loans and lending relationships and include the accumulation
of related data. This data includes loan payments status, borrowers financial data and borrowers operating factors
such as cash flows, operating income or loss, and various other matters. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. 

At December 31, 2012, the Bank had 4.4
million of loans held for investment on nonaccrual status, segregated by the following classes of financing receivables: commercial
real estate - 2.8 million; commercial lots and raw land - 1.4 million; commercial non-real estate - 99,000; home equity lines-of-credit
- 97,000; consumer real estate - 77,000; and consumer other - 1,000. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. 

Other real estate owned OREO acquired in settlement of loans is classified as real estate acquired through foreclosure. It is recorded at the lower of the
estimated fair value (less estimated selling costs) of the underlying real estate or the carrying amount of the loan. In most
cases, the estimated fair values are derived from an initial appraisal, an updated appraisal or a broker s price opinion BPO with appropriate comparables. In certain instances when a listing agreement is renewed for a lesser amount,
management will adjust the recorded estimated fair value of the subject property accordingly. Additionally, in certain instances
when the Bank receives an offer to purchase near the end of a quarterly accounting period for less than the current carrying value
and the sale does not consummate until the next accounting period, management will adjust the recorded estimated fair value of
the subject property accordingly. The Disposition Plan resulted in the Bank taking a 5.2 million valuation write-down to OREO
assets. Costs related to holding such real estate is charged against income in the current period. Any required write-down of
a loan to its fair value (less estimated selling costs) is charged against the allowance for credit losses. See Notes 1,
6 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations for additional information.

Classified Assets and Credit Quality.
 Federal regulations require banks to review their classification of assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection
with regulatory examinations, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and if appropriate, classify them in their reports
of examination. There are four classifications for problem assets: special mention, substandard, doubtful 
and loss. Special mention assets contain a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention and
which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected. Substandard assets have one or more well-defined weaknesses and are
characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, questionable, and there is a high possibility
of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the
institution is not warranted. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss or is impaired, a bank must either establish
a specific allowance for loss in the amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss, or charge off such amount. Work-in-process
loans are loans that have been approved and sent to the attorney for closing, but have not yet been returned for processing. These
loans are not given a risk grade until they have been processed and are therefore excluded from the credit quality reporting. 

The Bank assigns a risk grade to each
commercial, consumer, and in-house mortgage loan. The grading system established by the Bank includes grades 1 through 9. These
grades are defined as follows: 1 is Excellent and considered to be of the highest quality with significant financial
strength, stability, and liquidity; 2 is Above Average and supported by above average financial strength and stability;
 3 is Average and supported by upper tier industry-average financial strength and stability; 4 is Acceptable
and supported by lower end industry-average financial strength and stability; 5 is Watch and has been identified
by the lender as a loan that has shown some degree of deterioration from its original status; 6 is Special Mention;
 7 is Substandard; 8 is Doubtful; and 9 is Loss. Risk grades 1 through 5 are collectively
labeled Pass by regulators, and have minimal risk and minimal loss history. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding credit quality indicators and risk grading. 

The Bank reviews the loans held for investment,
not less than quarterly, to determine whether any loans require classification or re-classification. At December 31, 2012, the
Bank had 37.5 million of classified loans, including 19.7 million classified as special mention, 17.8 million classified as
substandard, and none classified as doubtful or as loss, reflecting the positive impact of the Disposition Plan; compared to 106.5
million of classified loans at December 31, 2011, including 37.3 million classified as special mention, 69.1 million classified
as substandard, and none classified as doubtful or as loss. 

Allowance for Credit Losses. The
Bank maintains both general and specific allowances for loan and lease losses and an allowance for unfunded loan commitments,
collectively, the allowance for credit losses ACL at levels the Bank believes are appropriate in light of the
risk inherent in loans and leases held for investment and in unfunded loan commitments. The Bank has developed policies and procedures
for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk and impairment analysis.
This assessment includes an analysis of qualitative and quantitative trends in the levels of classified loans. Future assessments
of credit risk may yield different results, depending on changes in the qualitative and quantitative trends, which may require
increases or decreases in the allowance for credit losses. 

The Bank uses a variety of modeling and
estimation tools for measuring its credit risk and performing impairment analysis, which is the basis used in developing the allowance
for credit losses. The factors supporting the allowance do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for credit losses is
available to absorb probable losses in both the loans and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments. The Bank s principal
focus is on maintaining the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses. Based on the overall credit quality of the loan
and lease receivable portfolio, the Bank believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), and has taken into account the views of its regulators
and the current economic environment. Management evaluates the information upon which it bases the allowance for credit losses
quarterly and believes its accounting decisions remain accurate. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators,
increased risks in its loans and leases portfolio, changes in economic conditions and other factors will not require additional
adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. 

16 

The ACL calculation methodology takes
into account GAAP and regulatory guidance. The calculation methodology is focused on current borrower analysis and loss factors
that are indicative of actual historical loss experience over the most recent eight quarters. The allowance for credit losses
contains both general and specific reserves. The Bank may establish a specific reserve for certain loans calculated using an estimate
of the expected cash flows from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, and for collateral dependent
loans for which an impairment analysis has not yet been completed. For collateral dependent loans when impairment can be reasonably
calculated, the Bank will write down the affected loan by the level of that impairment. See Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
for additional information regarding lending activities and the allowance for credit losses.

Historical Loss and Qualitative Analysis.
 The assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses includes an analysis of actual historical loss percentages
of both classified and pass loans, as well as qualitative risk factors allocated among specific categories of loans. In developing
this analysis, the Bank relies on actual loss history for the most recent eight quarters and exercises management s best
judgment in assessing credit risk. 

The assessment of qualitative factors
includes various subjective component areas assessed in terms of basis points used in determining the overall adequacy of the
ACL. The evaluation of qualitative risk factors will result in a positive or negative adjustment to the ACL validation. Adjustments
for each qualitative risk component may range from +25 basis points to -10 basis points. A component score of 0 basis points indicates
no effect on the ACL. A component rating of +25 basis points indicates the assessed maximum potential of increased risk to the
adequacy of the ACL. A -10 basis point component rating indicates the most positive effect on the ACL. 

There were no changes in the Company s
accounting policy and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Investment Securities Activities 

General . Interest income from investment
securities generally provides the second largest source of income to the Bank, after interest and fees on loans. The Board has
authorized investment in U.S. Government and agency securities, state government obligations, municipal securities, obligations
of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ), mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds. The Bank s
objective is to use investment securities to reduce credit risk and provide liquidity. At December 31, 2012, the Bank s
investment securities portfolio totaled 164.8 million, with unrealized securities gains of 5.2 million, net of deferred taxes. 

Investment and aggregate investment limitations
and credit quality parameters of each class of investment are prescribed in the Bank s investment policy. The Bank performs
an analysis on the investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the impact on earnings and market value under
various interest rate scenarios and prepayment conditions. Securities purchases are subject to the oversight of the Bank s
Investment Committee consisting of four directors, and are reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis. The Bank s President
has authority to make specific investment decisions within the parameters determined by the Board. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities . At
December 31, 2012, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of 132.5 million and a carrying value of 140.3 million,
or 19.8 of total assets, were held as available for sale. Mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale are carried
at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale mortgage-backed securities are recognized as direct increases
or decreases in equity, net of applicable income taxes. 

Mortgage-backed securities represent a
participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which are
passed from the mortgage originators through intermediaries that pool and repackage the participation interest in the form of
securities to investors such as the Bank. Such intermediaries may include government sponsored entities such as FHLMC, the Federal
National Mortgage Association FNMA , also known as Fannie Mae and the Government National Mortgage
Association GNMA , also known as Ginnie Mae which guarantee the payment of principal and interest
to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally increase the quality of the Bank s assets by virtue of the guarantees
that back them, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations
of the Bank. 

The FHLMC is a public corporation chartered
by the U.S. Government. The FHLMC issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. The FHLMC
guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. FHLMC securities
are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States; however, their securities are considered to be good quality
investments with marginal credit risks. Mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the FHLMC are weighted at no more than
20 for risk-based capital purposes, compared to a weight of 50 to 100 for residential loans. See Depository Institution
Regulation Capital Requirements for additional information. 

At December 31, 2012,
the mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 3.76 . The yield is based upon the interest income and
the amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount related to the mortgage-backed security. Premiums and discounts on
mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted over the estimated term of the securities using a level yield method. At
December 31, 2012, the average contractual maturity of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio was approximately 24.1 years.
The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when the mortgagors prepay or repay the underlying mortgages. 

19 

Municipal Securities. At December
31, 2012, municipal securities with an amortized cost of 24.0 million and a carrying value of 24.6 million, or 3.5 of total
assets, were held as available for sale. Municipal securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value, and
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale mortgage-backed securities are recognized as direct increases or decreases in
equity, net of applicable income taxes. 

Municipal securities represent debt securities
issued by a state, municipality or county to finance capital expenditures, such as the construction of highways, bridges or schools.
Municipal securities purchased by the Bank are generally exempt from federal taxes, and from state and local taxes where the security
is issued by a municipality located in the state of North Carolina. 

At December 31, 2012, the municipal securities
portfolio had a weighted average yield of 3.00 , and the average contractual maturity of the municipal securities portfolio was
approximately 17.5 years. 

Investment Securities . Investments
in certain securities are classified into three categories and accounted for as follows: (1) debt securities bought with the intent
to hold to maturity are classified as held for investment and reported at amortized cost; (2) debt and equity securities bought
and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near 

 term are classified as trading securities
and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; (3) debt and equity securities not classified
as either held for investment securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of equity. 

The Bank had 1.9 million of FHLB stock
at December 31, 2012.

Deposit Activity and Other Sources
of Funds 

General. Deposits are the primary
source of the Bank s funds for lending, investment activities and general operational purposes. In addition to deposits,
the Bank derives funds from loan principal and interest repayments, maturities and paydowns on investment securities, and interest
payments thereon. Although loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, deposit inflows and outflows are significantly
influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for
reductions in the availability of funds, or on a longer term basis for general operational purposes. The Bank has access to borrowings
from the FHLB of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as from other larger correspondent banks. 

Deposits. The Bank attracts deposits
principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market
accounts, statement savings accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts, and certificates of deposit which range in maturity from
seven days to five years. Deposit terms vary according to the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest
rate. Maturities, terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties for its deposit accounts are established by the Bank on a periodic
basis. The Bank reviews its deposit pricing on a weekly basis or more frequently based on market conditions. In determining the
characteristics of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers the rates offered by competing institutions, lending and liquidity
requirements, growth goals and federal regulations. Management believes it prices its deposits comparably to rates offered by
its competitors. The Bank did not have any brokered deposits, at December 31, 2012. 

The Bank attempts to
compete for deposits with other institutions in its market area by offering competitively priced deposit instruments that are
tailored to meet the needs of its customers. Additionally, the Bank seeks to meet customers needs by providing convenient
customer service to the community, efficient staff and convenient hours of service. Substantially all of the Bank s depositors
are North Carolina residents. To provide additional convenience, the Bank participates in the Cirrus and STAR Automatic Teller
Machine networks at locations throughout the United States, through which customers can gain access to their accounts at any time.
To better serve its customers, the Bank has installed automatic teller machines at twenty-three office locations. The Bank provides
both personal and business on-line banking services. These services include, but are not limited to, eStatements, bill paying,
access to check images, funds transfers between accounts, ACH originations, wire transfers and stop payment orders for checks,
as applicable by personal or business account type. The Bank also provides imaged check statements, thereby eliminating the cost
of returning paper items. 

The following table sets forth the distribution
of the Bank s deposit accounts based on their original contractual maturities, and corresponding weighted average interest
rates based on year-end balances. Management does not believe that the use of year-end balances instead of average balances resulted
in any material difference in the information presented.

At December 31, 2012, FHLMC mortgage-backed
securities with an amortized cost of 2.7 million were pledged as collateral for deposits from public entities. 

Borrowings. During
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Bank s borrowings consisted of FHLB advances and retail repurchase
agreements. Deposits remain the primary source of funds for the Bank s lending, investment and general operating activities. 

The Bank is authorized
to access advances from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement its liquidity needs for funds to meet loan origination and deposit withdrawal
requirements. The FHLB of Atlanta functions as a central correspondent bank providing credit for its member financial institutions.
As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to own stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and is authorized to apply for advances.
FHLB advances are available under several different programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.
The FHLB capital stock requirement is based on the sum of a membership stock component totaling 0.15 of the Bank s total
assets with a cap of 26.0 million, and an activity-based stock component of 4.5 of outstanding FHLB advances. Advances from the
FHLB of Atlanta are secured by the Bank s stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and other eligible assets. 

Retail repurchase agreements
represent agreements to sell securities under terms which require the Bank to repurchase the same, or substantially similar securities,
by a specified date. The Bank discontinued the retail repurchase agreement program effective as of November 1, 2012. 

See Note 11 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Competition. The Bank faces strong
competition in originating real estate, commercial business and consumer loans and in attracting deposits. The Bank competes for
real estate and other loans principally on the basis of interest rates, the types of loans it originates, the deposit products
it offers and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. The Bank also competes by offering products which are tailored
to the local community, including lease financing. Its competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other
commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies
provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. Competition may increase as a result of the reduction of restrictions on the
interstate operations of financial institutions. 

The Bank attracts its deposits through
its branch offices primarily from the local communities. Consequently, competition for deposits is principally from other commercial
banks, savings institutions, credit unions and brokers in the Bank s primary market area. The Bank competes for deposits
and loans by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, a commitment to outstanding
customer service and a well-trained staff. The Bank believes it has developed strong relationships with local realtors and the
community in general. The Bank s primary market area for gathering deposits and/or originating loans is central, eastern,
northeastern and southeastern North Carolina, where the Bank s offices are located. 

The Bank also makes securities brokerage
services available through an affiliation with an independent broker-dealer. 

Employees. As of December 31, 2012,
the Bank had 231 full-time and 24 part-time employees, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management
considers the Bank s relationships with its employees to be good. 

Depository Institution Regulation 

General. The Bank is a North Carolina
chartered commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF administered by
the FDIC. The Bank is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks Commissioner and the FDIC and to North Carolina and federal statutory and regulatory provisions governing such
matters as capital standards, mergers, subsidiary investments and establishment of branch offices. The FDIC also has the authority
to conduct special examinations. The Bank is required to file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities
and financial condition and is required to obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, including mergers
with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. 

As a federally insured depository institution,
the Bank is subject to various regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal
Reserve Board or FRB ), including Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity), Regulation D (Reserve Requirements),
Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers), Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), Regulation CC (Availability of Funds and Collection
of Checks), Regulation DD (Truth in Savings), the Fair Housing Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, among others. 

The system of supervision and regulation
applicable to the Bank establishes a comprehensive framework for the operations of the Bank, and is intended primarily for the
protection of the FDIC and the depositors of the Bank, rather than stockholders. Changes in the regulatory framework could have
a material effect on the Bank that in turn, could have a material effect on the Company. Certain legal and regulatory requirements
are applicable to the Bank and the Company. This discussion does not purport to be a complete explanation of all such laws and
regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations involved. 

North Carolina Banking Law Modernization
Act. On October 1, 2012, as a result of the recommendations of the Joint Legislative Study Commission on the Modernization
of North Carolina Banking Laws, legislation went into effect that comprehensively modernizes North Carolina s banking laws
for the first time since the Great Depression. As a result of the legislation, Articles 1 through 10, 12, and 13 of Chapter 53
of the North Carolina General Statutes were repealed, and new Chapter 53C, entitled Regulation of Banks, became law.
Major changes enacted by the law include: a comprehensive list of definitions enhancing the clarity and meaning of the various
sections of North Carolina s banking law, a broader reliance on the North Carolina Business Corporations Act, and incorporation
of modern concepts of capital adequacy and regulatory supervision. On March 4, 2013, a bill was filed for consideration by the
North Carolina General Assembly to make certain technical corrections and clarifications to Chapter 53C. 

24 

Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure
and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding
companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare
numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting rules and regulations,
and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many years. The Dodd-Frank
Act included, among other things: 

the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify
emerging systemic risks posed by financial firms, activities and practices, and to improve cooperation between federal agencies; 

the creation of a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection authorized
to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products, which would affect both banks and non-bank
financial companies; 

the establishment of strengthened capital and prudential standards for
banks and bank holding companies; 

enhanced regulation of financial markets, including derivatives and
securitization markets; 

the elimination of certain trading activities by banks; 

a permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance to 250,000 per deposit
category and an increase in the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve requirement from 1.15 to 1.35 , with assessments to be
based on assets as opposed to deposits; 

amendments to the Truth in Lending Act aimed at improving consumer protections
with respect to mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment considerations;
and 

new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation
and corporate governance. 

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository
institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them
from owning equity interests in excess of three percent (3 of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as
the Volcker Rule ). The Federal Reserve released a final rule in early 2011 which requires a banking entity, 
a term that is defined to include bank holding companies like the Company, to bring its proprietary trading activities and investments
into compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act restrictions no later than two years after the earlier of: (1) July 21, 2012,
or (2) 12 months after the date on which interagency final rules are adopted. Pursuant to the compliance date final rule,
banking entities are permitted to request an extension of this timeframe from the Federal Reserve. In late 2011, the federal banking
agencies released for comment proposed regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The public comment period closed in early 2012.
The proposed rules are highly complex and many aspects of their application remain uncertain. Due to the complexity of the new
rules, the challenges of agency coordination, and the volume of public comments received, implementation of the Volcker Rule has
been delayed. We do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations. However, until
a final rule is adopted, the precise impact of the Volcker Rule on the Company cannot be determined. 

A number of
other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be implemented through the rulemaking process
at various regulatory agencies. We are unable to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the forthcoming rules and regulations
will impact our business. However, we believe that certain aspects of the legislation, including, without limitation, the additional
cost of higher deposit insurance coverage and the costs of compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements and examinations
could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we cannot predict
whether there will be additional proposed laws or reforms that would affect the U.S. financial system or financial institutions,
whether or when such changes may be adopted, how such changes may be interpreted and enforced, or how such changes may affect us. 

Safety and Soundness Guidelines. 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA ), as amended by the Riegle Community
Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the CDRI Act ), each federal banking agency was required to establish
safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. The interagency guidelines require depository institutions
to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size, nature and
scope of the institution s business. The guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth and information security. The guidelines further provide that depository
institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees and benefits that are excessive or that could
lead to material financial loss, and should take into account factors such as comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions.
If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness
guidelines, it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines. A depository
institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within 30 days of receipt of a request for
such a plan. Failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. Management believes
that the Bank substantially meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines. 

25 

Capital Requirements . The FRB and
the FDIC have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies
with consolidated assets of 150 million or more and state nonmember banks, respectively. The regulations impose two sets of capital
adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain a specified
minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios
of capital to risk-weighted assets. The regulations of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board require bank holding
companies and state nonmember banks, respectively, to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total
assets of 3.0 to be considered adequately capitalized under the federal banking regulations. Although setting a
minimum 3.0 leverage ratio, the capital regulations state that only the strongest bank holding companies and banks, with excellent
asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure, and the highest regulatory rating, are permitted to operate at or near
such minimum level of capital. All other bank holding companies and banks must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 to be
considered adequately capitalized. As discussed in greater detail below, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires
the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to FDIC-insured institutions that
do not meet minimum capital requirements. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholders equity, noncumulative perpetual
preferred stock (including any related surplus), and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries; minus all intangible assets
(other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and credit card receivables), identified losses and certain investments.
The regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within Tier 1 capital
and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. 

DIF-insured banks must also deduct from
Tier 1 capital an amount equal to its investments in, and extensions of credit to, subsidiaries engaged in activities that are
not permissible for national banks, other than debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as
agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities or in subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies. Any
bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth is expected to maintain capital well above the minimum
levels. In addition, the FRB has indicated that whenever appropriate, and in particular when a bank holding company is undertaking
expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks, it will consider, on a case-by-case
basis, the level of an organization s ratio of tangible Tier 1 capital to total assets in making an overall assessment of
capital. 

In addition to the leverage ratio, the
regulations of the FRB and the FDIC require bank holding companies and state chartered nonmember banks to maintain a minimum ratio
of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , of which at least 4.0 must be Tier 1 capital. Qualifying
total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items which include allowances for
loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity
of 20 years or more, certain other capital instruments and up to 45 of unrealized gains on equity securities. The includible amount
of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the institution s Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount
of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes,
reciprocal cross-holdings of capital securities issued by other banks and certain other deductions. The risk-based capital regulations
assign balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items to one of four broad risk weight
categories ranging from 0 to 100 . The aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that
category based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor. The sum of these weighted values equals the
bank holding company or the bank s risk-weighted assets. 

In June 2012, the federal bank regulatory
agencies jointly issued three proposed rules that would revise the general risk-based capital rules to incorporate certain revisions
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework (Basel III). While the regulatory agencies had initially
proposed an effective date of January 1, 2013 for the new rules, the agencies have since confirmed that the implementation will
be delayed as a result of the many industry participants, including community banks, that expressed concern over the impact of
the proposed rules. When and if the proposed rules become effective, they would, among other things: revise the definition of regulatory
capital components and related calculations, add a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, and increase the minimum Tier 1 Capital
Ratio requirement from 4 to 6 percent. If the proposed rules are implemented as written, the amount of capital that the Bank
would be required to hold would likely increase.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.
 Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution
fails to satisfy the minimum capital requirements discussed above, including a leverage limit, a risk-based capital requirement,
and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository
institution. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying
any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements.
An institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure (an undercapitalized institution may be: (i) subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (ii) required to submit an acceptable
capital restoration plan within 45 days; (iii) subject to asset growth limits; and (iv) required to obtain prior regulatory approval
for acquisitions, branching and new lines of businesses. The capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s
holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive
quarters, under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of 5 of the institution s total assets or the
amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration
plan. A significantly undercapitalized institution, as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit
an acceptable capital restoration plan, may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization, broader application of restrictions
on transactions with affiliates, limitations on interest rates paid on deposits, asset growth and other activities, possible replacement
of directors and officers, and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution. Any
company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest
subsidiaries. The senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases
in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated
debt. In their discretion, the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution
if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions.
If an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critical capital level established
by the appropriate federal banking regulator, the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified
time periods. 

Under the implementing regulations, the
federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total
risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of its total capital to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of
its core capital to risk-weighted assets) and leverage ratio (the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets). The following
table shows the Bank s actual capital ratios and the required capital ratios for the various prompt corrective action categories
as of December 31, 2012.

rating and meets certain other criteria. 

A critically undercapitalized 
institution is defined as one that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than 2.0 . Tangible equity
is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and related surplus) less all intangibles other than qualifying
supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights. The FDIC may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as
adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory
actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category (but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized
institution as critically undercapitalized) if the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the institution
is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for
any regulatory rating category. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. 

North Carolina Capital Requirements
and Regulatory Action. Under North Carolina banking law, a bank s required capital is equal to at least
the amount required for the bank to be considered adequately capitalized under the federal regulatory capital standards
described above. Inadequate capital is defined as an amount of capital equal to at least 75 but less than 100 of
required capital. Insufficient capital is defined as an amount of capital less than 75 of required capital. 

27 

The Commissioner is empowered to take regulatory
action if a bank s capital falls below the required capital level. If the Commissioner determines that a bank has inadequate
capital or insufficient capital, the Commissioner may order the bank to take corrective action. If the Commissioner
determines that that a bank has insufficient capital and is conducting business in an unsafe or unsound manner or in a fashion
that threatens the financial integrity of the bank, the Commissioner may serve a notice of charges and show-cause order on the
bank and, if after a hearing, he determines that supervisory control of the bank is necessary to protect the bank s customers,
creditors, or the general public, the Commissioner may take supervisory control of the bank. The Commissioner may also take custody
of the books and records of a bank and appoint a receiver if the bank s capital is impaired such that the likely realizable
value of the bank s assets is insufficient to pay and satisfy the claims of its depositors and creditors. 

Community Reinvestment Act. The
Bank, like other financial institutions, is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act CRA ). The purpose of the CRA
is to encourage financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including the needs of low-and
moderate-income neighborhoods. The federal banking agencies have implemented an evaluation system that rates an institution based
on its actual performance in meeting community credit needs. Under these regulations, an institution is first evaluated and rated
under three categories: a lending test, an investment test and a service test. For each of these three tests, the institution is
given a rating of either outstanding, high satisfactory, low satisfactory, needs
to improve, or substantial non-compliance. A set of criteria for each rating has been developed and is included
in the regulation. If an institution disagrees with a particular rating, the institution has the burden of rebutting the presumption
by clearly establishing that the quantitative measures do not accurately present its actual performance, or that demographics,
competitive conditions or economic or legal limitations peculiar to its service area should be considered. The ratings received
under the three tests will be used to determine the overall composite CRA rating. The composite ratings currently given are: outstanding, 
 satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial non-compliance. 

The Bank s CRA rating would be a
factor to be considered by the FRB and the FDIC in considering applications submitted by the Bank to acquire branches or to acquire
or combine with other financial institutions and take other actions and, if such rating was less than satisfactory, 
could result in the denial of such applications. During the Bank s last compliance examination, the Bank received an outstanding
rating with respect to CRA compliance. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The
FHLB System consists of 12 district FHLBs subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA ).
The FHLBs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is
required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with
investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock of 1.9 million at December 31, 2012. The FHLB of Atlanta serves as a reserve or central bank
for its member institutions within its assigned district. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated
obligations of the FHLB System. It offers advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHFA
and the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Atlanta. Long-term advances may only be made for the purpose of providing funds for residential
housing finance, small businesses, small farms and small agribusinesses. 

Reserves. Pursuant to FRB regulations,
the Bank must maintain average daily reserves against its net transaction accounts, equal to 3 of the amount over 12.4 million
up to and including 79.5 million, plus 10 on the amount over 79.5 million. This percentage is subject to adjustment by the FRB.
Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of
the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest-earning assets. The Bank is also subject to
the reserve requirements of North Carolina commercial banks. North Carolina law requires state nonmember banks to maintain, at
all times, a reserve fund in an amount equal to the amount or ratio fixed by the North Carolina Banking Commission. As of December
31, 2012, the Bank met all of its reserve requirements. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The
Bank s deposits are insured up to limits set by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF of the FDIC. The DIF was
formed on March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the Reform Act ). The Reform Act established a range of 1.15 to 1.50 within
which the FDIC may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (the reserve ratio ). The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater
discretion to manage the DIF, raised the minimum DIF reserve ratio to 1.35 , and removed the upper limit of 1.50 . In 2010, the
FDIC adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35 by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank
Act. The FDIC also proposed a comprehensive, long-range plan for management of the DIF. As part of this comprehensive plan, the
FDIC has adopted a final rule to set the reserve ratio at 2.0 . 

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently
increased FDIC insurance coverage to 250,000 per depositor. 

28 

The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit insurance
premium assessment on member institutions in order to maintain the DIF. This assessment system was amended by the Reform Act and
further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution
vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the
FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition,
in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain
specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to
time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the methodology for calculating deposit
insurance assessments from the amount of an insured institution s domestic deposits to its total assets minus tangible capital.
In 2011, the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing these revisions to the assessment system. 

In addition to the assessment for deposit
insurance, insured institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation FICO ),
established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to recapitalize the former Federal Savings Loan Insurance Corporation FSLIC deposit insurance fund. The FDIC established the FICO assessment rate effective for the first quarter of
2012 at 0.66 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits. The Bank s quarterly FICO payments during the year ended December
31, 2012 was 0.66 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits. 

In 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program (the TLGP to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The
TLGP consists of two components: a temporary guarantee of newly-issued senior unsecured debt named the Debt Guarantee Program,
and a temporary unlimited guarantee of funds in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC insured institutions named the
Transaction Account Guarantee Program TAG ). All newly-issued senior unsecured debt will be charged an annual assessment
of up to 100 basis points (depending on term) multiplied by the amount of debt issued and calculated through the date of that debt
or June 30, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Bank elected to opt out of the Debt Guarantee Program. The Bank elected to participate
in the TAG Program. In 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule extending the TAG portion of the TLGP for six months through June 30,
2010, and it was extended again through December 31, 2010. The Bank elected to continue to participate in the TAG Program through
December 31, 2010. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act extended unlimited FDIC insurance coverage to noninterest-bearing transaction
deposit accounts from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012. On January 1, 2013, funds in a non-interest bearing account
(including Lawyer Trust Accounts) were no longer eligible for the unlimited deposit insurance coverage. These funds will now be
insured to the legal maximum of 250,000 for each ownership category. 

During 2009, the FDIC took several measures
aimed at replenishing the DIF. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC imposed a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured institution s
assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC voted to require insured institutions to prepay
their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, as well as all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For purposes
of determining the prepayment, the FDIC used an institution s assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009. On December
30, 2009, the Bank paid a 4.7 million prepaid assessment and it was accounted for as a prepaid expense with a zero risk-weighting
for risk-based regulatory capital purposes. On a quarterly basis after December 31, 2009, the Bank expenses its regular quarterly
deposit insurance assessment and records an offsetting credit to the prepaid assessment asset, until the asset is exhausted. If
the prepaid assessment is not exhausted by June 30, 2013, any remaining amount will be returned to the Bank. The Bank s remaining
prepaid assessment asset was 1.3 million at December 31, 2012. 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance
assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results
of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated
by the FDIC upon a finding that an insured institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition
to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management
of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of its FDIC deposit insurance. 

Liquidity Requirements . FDIC policy
requires that banks maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets (cash, certain time deposits, mortgage-backed securities,
loans held for sale and specified United States government, state, or federal agency obligations) in an amount which it deems adequate
to protect the safety and soundness of the bank. The FDIC currently has no specific level which it requires. The Bank maintains
its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. Based
on its policy calculation guidelines, the Bank s calculated liquidity ratio was 29.7 of total deposits and short-term borrowings
at December 31, 2012, which management believes is adequate. 

29 

Dividend Restrictions. Under FDIC
regulations, the Bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if after making the distribution, the Bank would have:
(i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 ; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 ; or (iii) a leverage
ratio of less than 4.0 . 

Limits on Loans to One Borrower. 
The Bank generally is subject to both FDIC regulations and North Carolina law regarding loans to any one borrower, including related
entities. Under applicable law, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit by a state chartered nonmember
bank to a person outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount
of the loan or extension of credit shall not exceed 15 of the unimpaired capital of the Bank. Loans and extensions of credit fully
secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loan or extension of credit
shall not exceed 10 of the unimpaired capital fund of the Bank. Under these limits, the Bank s loans to one borrower were
limited to 12.3 million at December 31, 2012. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower
limit. Notwithstanding the statutory loans-to-one-borrower limitations, the Bank has a self-imposed loans-to-one-borrower limit,
which currently is 7.2 million, which it has exceeded from time to time as approved in advance by the Board of Directors; however,
there have been no borrowers over that limit since August 31, 2010. At December 31, 2012, the Bank s largest lending relationship
was a 6.5 million relationship consisting of three commercial real estate loans. All loans within this relationship were current
and performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December 31, 2012. 

Transactions with Related Parties. 
Transactions between a state nonmember bank and any affiliate are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An
affiliate of a state nonmember bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the
state nonmember bank. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state nonmember bank (such as the Company)
and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings institution or state nonmember
bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which an institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered
transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such institution s capital stock and surplus, and
contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus
and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or
subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase
of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. 

Loans to Directors, Executive Officers
and Principal Stockholders. State nonmember banks also are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal
Reserve Act and the applicable regulations thereunder on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under
Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer and to a greater than 10 stockholder of a state nonmember bank and certain
affiliated interests of such persons, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests,
the institution s loans-to-one-borrower limit and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking
agency to directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders of a depository institution, and their respective affiliates,
unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution with any interested 
director not participating in the voting. Regulation O prescribes the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to
such person) as to which such prior board of directors approval is required as being the greater of 25,000 or 5 of capital and
surplus (or any loans aggregating 500,000 or more). Further, Section 22(h) requires that loans to directors, executive officers
and principal stockholders generally be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons.
Section 22(h) also generally prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or
directors. 

State nonmember banks also are subject
to the requirements and restrictions of Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act on loans to executive officers. Section 22(g)
of the Federal Reserve Act requires approval by the board of directors of a depository institution for such extensions of credit
and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type, amount and terms of credits to such officers. In
addition, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA prohibits extensions of credit to
executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has
a correspondent banking relationship with the institution, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as
those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment
or present other unfavorable features. 

30 

Under North Carolina law, a bank may extend
credit to, and engage in transactions with, its affiliates, directors, executive officers, principal shareholders, and their respective
immediate family members to the extent permitted by, and subject to such restrictions and conditions as are imposed by applicable
state and federal laws and regulations. 

Restrictions on Certain Activities .
State chartered nonmember banks with deposits insured by the FDIC are generally prohibited from engaging in equity investments
that are not permissible for a national bank. The foregoing limitation, however, does not prohibit FDIC-insured state banks from
acquiring or retaining an equity investment in a subsidiary in which the bank is a majority owner. State chartered banks are also
prohibited from engaging as a principal in any type of activity that is not permissible for a national bank and, subject to certain
exceptions, subsidiaries of state chartered FDIC-insured banks may not engage as a principal in any type of activity that is not
permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank, unless in either case, the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant
risk to the DIF and the bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with applicable capital standards. 

USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot
Act Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement s and the intelligence communities 
abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions
of all kinds is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency
laws and imposes various regulations including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote
cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in
terrorism or money laundering. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering
and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could result in legal consequences for the
institution. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
.. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others.
These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury s Office of
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however,
they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country,
including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S.
persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or
assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals
of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property
in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn,
set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure of a financial institution to comply with these sanctions
could result in legal consequences for the institution. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act GLBA (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999) expanded certain activities in which
banks and bank holding companies may engage. The GLBA made three fundamental changes: repealed key provisions of the Glass-Steagall
Act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks; modified the Bank Holding Company Act BHCA to
permit companies that own commercial banks to engage in any type of financial activity; and allows subsidiaries of banks to engage
in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for banks themselves. The GLBA also contains a range of supervisory
requirements and activities, including the privacy of customer information. 

Privacy . In addition to expanding
the activities in which banks and bank holding companies may engage, the GLBA imposes new requirements on financial institutions
with respect to customer privacy. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to non-affiliated third parties
unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are
further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to
comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA. The privacy provisions became effective on July 1,
2002. The GLBA contains a variety of other provisions including a prohibition against ATM surcharges unless the customer has first
been provided notice of the imposition and amount of the fee. 

31 

Regulation of the Company 

General . The Company, as the sole
shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company and is registered with the Federal Reserve Board. Bank holding companies are
subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the BHCA, and the regulations of the FRB. As a bank holding company, the Company
is required to file with the FRB annual reports and such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular
examinations by the FRB. The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things,
the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company
divest subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiaries. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and
regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

Under the BHCA, a bank holding company
must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank
or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 of such shares (unless it already owns
or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding
company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In evaluating applications for acquisitions, the
FRB considers such things as the financial condition and management of the target and the acquirer, the convenience and needs of
the communities involved (including CRA ratings) and competitive factors. 

The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding
company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of
any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those
of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions
involve certain nonbank activities which, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely
related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among
other things, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing
certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance
agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders,
travelers checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and
preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The Company currently
engages in some of these permitted activities through the Bank, but has no present plans to operate a credit card company or factoring
company, perform data processing operations, real estate and personal property appraising or provide tax planning and tax preparation
services. 

The GLBA authorized bank holding companies
that meet specified qualitative standards to opt to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company
may engage in activities that are permissible for bank holding companies in addition to activities deemed to be financial in nature
or incidental to financial activities. These include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has not opted to
become a financial holding company. 

The FRB has adopted guidelines regarding
the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital
to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See Depository Institution Regulation Capital Requirements. 

Acquisition of Bank Holding Companies
and Banks. Under the BHCA, any company must obtain approval of the FRB prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank.
For purposes of the BHCA, control is defined as ownership of more than 25 of any class of voting securities of the
Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence
over management or policies of the Company or the Bank. The Change in Bank Control Act CBCA and the related regulations
of the FRB require any person or persons acting in concert, to file a written notice with the FRB before such person or persons
may acquire control of the Company or the Bank. The CBCA defines control as the power, directly or indirectly, to
vote 25 or more of any voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank;
however, a rebuttable presumption of control exists upon the acquisition of power to vote 10 or more of a class of voting securities
for a company whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

32 

Interstate Banking. Federal law
allows the FRB to approve an application of an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to acquire control
of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company s home
state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The FRB may not approve the acquisition
of a bank that has not been in existence for a minimum of five years without regard for a longer minimum period specified by the
law of the host state. The FRB is prohibited from approving an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates)
controls or would control (i) more than 10 of the insured deposits in the United States, or (ii) 30 or more of the deposits in
the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not limit a state s
authority to restrict the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding
company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states
may also waive the 30 state-wide concentration limit. 

The federal banking agencies are also authorized
to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless
the home state of one of the banks has adopted a law opting out of the interstate mergers. Interstate acquisitions of branches
are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch
acquisitions are subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. North Carolina
has enacted legislation permitting interstate banking acquisitions. 

The Dodd-Frank Act allows national and
state banks to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered
in that state. 

Dividends. The FRB has issued a
joint interagency statement on the payment of cash dividends by banking organizations, which expresses the FRB s view that
 in setting dividend levels, a banking organization should consider its ongoing earnings capacity, the
adequacy of its loan loss allowance, and the overall effect that a dividend payout would have on its cost of funding, its capital
position, and, consequently, its ability to serve the expected needs of creditworthy borrowers. Banking organizations should
not maintain a level of cash dividends that is inconsistent with the organization's capital position, that could weaken the organization's
overall financial health, or that could impair its ability to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers. Supervisors will continue
to review the dividend policies of individual banking organizations and will take action when dividend policies are found to be
inconsistent with sound capital and lending policies. 

The FRB has also issued a supervisory letter
(SR 09-4) to provide greater clarity regarding payment of dividends. The letter largely reiterates FRB supervisory policies and
guidance, and heightens expectations that a bank holding company will inform and consult with the FRB supervisory staff sufficiently
in advance of (i) declaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e. declaring and paying a dividend
that exceeds earnings for the period which the dividend is being paid); (ii) redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments
when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weakness; or (iii) redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual
preferred stock that could result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding
compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. 

Furthermore, under the prompt corrective
action regulations adopted by the FRB, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s
bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized . See Depository Institution Regulation Prompt
Corrective Regulatory Action. 

Bank holding companies are required to
give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration
for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the
preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the their consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption
if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order,
directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with the FRB. Bank holding companies whose capital ratios exceeded
the thresholds for well capitalized banks on a consolidated basis are exempt from the foregoing requirement if they were given
satisfactory ratings in their most recent regulatory inspection and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. 

Incentive Compensation Policies and
Restrictions. In 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance which applies to all banking
organizations supervised by the agencies. Pursuant to the guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, a banking
organization s incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) provide employees with incentives that appropriately
balance risk and reward; (2) be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong
corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organization s board of directors. Monitoring
methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and
its use of incentive compensation. 

33 

In addition, in 2011, the federal banking
agencies, along with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, released a proposed rule intended
to ensure that regulated financial institutions design their incentive compensation arrangements to account for risk. Specifically,
the proposed rule would require compensation practices of the Registrant to be consistent with the following principles: (1) compensation
arrangements appropriately balance risk and financial reward; (2) such arrangements are compatible with effective controls
and risk management; and (3) such arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance. In addition, financial institutions
with 1 billion or more in assets would be required to have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the rule and would
be required to submit annual reports to their primary federal regulator. The comment period has closed and a final rule has not
yet been published. 

Taxation General. The Company
files its federal and state income tax returns based on a fiscal year ending December 31. 

Federal Income Taxation. The Company
reports income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards which require the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the temporary difference between financial statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using
the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The Company has assessed if it had any significant uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012 and determined
there were none. Accordingly, no reserve for uncertain tax positions was recorded. The Company and the Bank file a consolidated
federal income tax return. The Company s federal income tax returns have been audited through the year ended December 31,
2007. 

State Income Taxation. Under North
Carolina law, the corporate income tax currently is 6.90 of federal taxable income as computed under the Internal Revenue Code,
subject to certain state adjustments. An annual state franchise tax is imposed at a rate of 0.15 applied to the greater of the
institution s (i) capital stock, surplus and undivided profits, (ii) investment in tangible property in North Carolina or
(iii) appraised valuation of tangible property in North Carolina. The Company and the Bank file separate state income tax returns.

Dividends. 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock is principally dependent on
the Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is subject to various regulatory restrictions and limitations.
In order to preserve the Bank s capital, in December 2010 the Company suspended quarterly cash dividend payments. The Board
will continue to review the status of future dividend payments, which will depend upon the Company s financial condition,
earnings, equity structure, capital needs, economic conditions and regulatory requirements. For additional information on the regulatory
restrictions and limitations on the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders and on the Bank to pay dividends
to the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulation of the Company Dividends.

Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General. First South Bancorp, Inc.
(the Company was formed to issue common stock, owning 100 of First South Bank (the Bank and operating
through the Bank a commercial banking business; therefore, this discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and
results of operation relates primarily to the Bank. The business of the Bank consists principally of attracting deposits from the
general public and using them to originate secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, permanent mortgage and construction
loans secured by single-family residences and other loans. The Bank's earnings depend primarily on its net interest income, the
difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The volume of
noninterest income and noninterest expenses also impacts the Bank s earnings. 

Prevailing economic conditions, competition,
as well as federal and state regulations, affect the operations of the Bank. The Bank's cost of funds is influenced by interest
rates paid on competing investments, rates offered on deposits by other financial institutions in the Bank's market area and by
general market interest rates. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and various types of
commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, and by the interest rates offered on such financing. The Bank's business emphasis is to
operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality
customer service and meeting the financial needs of the communities it serves. The Bank believes it has been effective in serving
its customers because of its ability to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs and inquiries. The Bank's ability to
provide these services has been enhanced by the stability of the Bank's senior management team. 

The Company's common stock is listed and
trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FSBK. 

Recognized Subsequent Event. See
 Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized Subsequent Event above for disclosure regarding a two-tiered Disposition
Plan to significantly reduce the level of problem assets through the bulk sale of troubled loans and disposition of OREO properties. 

Management and the Board of Directors (the
 Board recognize that the loss generated from this Disposition Plan represents a significant use of capital. After
careful consideration of the financial ramifications, the Board concluded the benefits derived from the improved asset quality
position achieved from an accelerated disposition plan, outweighed the initial impacts of the transaction on the Bank. A portion
of these losses embedded in the Bank s balance sheet would have been realized in future periods, as these problem assets
were subsequently resolved. Due to its strong capital levels prior to this transaction, the Bank will be able to execute the Disposition
Plan of these problem assets without a simultaneous capital raise. After the bulk asset sales are completed, the Bank will remain
well capitalized. In addition, with the uncertainty associated with a high level of adversely classified assets having been removed,
management can shift its core focus from credit resolution and asset disposition to franchise growth and the pursuit of future
business opportunities. Management and the Board believe this shift in focus, coupled with improved solid core earnings potential,
should lead to greater shareholder value. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity
generally refers to the Bank's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its funding needs. Adequate liquidity guarantees
sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan commitments, maintain adequate reserve requirements, pay
operating expenses, provide funds for debt service, and meet other general commitments. The Bank maintains its liquidity position
under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank's primary sources
of funds are customer deposits, loan principal and interest payments, proceeds from loan and securities sales, and advances from
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB ). While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable
sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and local competition.
The Bank s primary investing activity is originating commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, lease financing receivables
and purchases and sales of investment securities. The Bank s primary financing activities are attracting checking, certificate,
savings deposits, repurchase agreements and obtaining FHLB advances. 

The levels of cash and cash equivalents
depend on the Bank's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents
declined to 12.4 million at December 31, 2012, from 32.8 million at December 31, 2011. The Bank has other sources of liquidity
if a need for additional funds arises. Investment securities available for sale, consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities
and municipal securities, increased to 164.8 million at December 31, 2012, from 138.5 million at December 31, 2011. During the
years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank sold and exchanged real estate loans totaling 70.6 million and 60.9 million,
respectively. 

39 

Borrowings consisting of FHLB advances
and junior subordinated debentures increased to 26.8 million at December 31, 2012, from 12.4 million at December 31, 2011. 

The Bank has pledged its FHLB Atlanta stock
and certain loans as collateral for actual or potential FHLB advances. The Bank has credit availability with the FHLB of 20 of
the Bank s total assets. The Bank had 126.8 million of remaining credit availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2012,
compared to 153.1 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had lendable
collateral value with the FHLB totaling 63.3 million. Additional collateral would be required in order to access total borrowings
up to the credit availability limit. In addition, at December 31, 2012, the Bank had available contingency funding sources of 45.0
million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information . 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled
 10.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. They were issued in 2003 through a private placement pooled trust preferred
securities offering by First South Preferred Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. The trust preferred securities bear interest
at three-month LIBOR plus 2.95 payable quarterly. They have a 30-year maturity and were first
redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2008, with certain exceptions. For regulatory purposes, 10.0 million
of the trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company, and for the Bank, as the Company invested the proceeds
in the Bank as additional paid-in capital. Proceeds from the trust preferred securities were used by the statutory trust to purchase
junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information . As described in Part I, Item 1. Business Depository Institution
Regulation Capital Requirements, in June 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules
to implement the capital reforms of the Basel III framework. These proposed regulatory capital guidelines would phase out the Tier
1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities for institutions with less than 15 billion in total assets over a ten-year period,
beginning in 2013, until they are fully phased out in 2022. The bank regulatory agencies have delayed implementation of these proposed
rules. At this time, it is not clear when, or in what form, these proposed rules will be implemented. 

As a North Carolina chartered commercial
bank and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC insured institution, the Bank is required to meet various
state and federal regulatory capital standards. The Bank's total regulatory capital was 80.2 million at December 31, 2012, compared
to 81.6 million at December 31, 2011. The FDIC requires the Bank to meet a minimum leverage capital requirement of Tier 1 capital
(consisting of retained earnings and common stockholders' equity, less any intangible assets) to assets ratio of at least 4 , and
a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8 , of which 4 must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Bank is also subject
to the capital requirements of North Carolina banking law, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business Depository Institution
Regulation North Carolina Capital Requirements and Regulatory Action. The Bank was in compliance with all regulatory
capital requirements at December 31, 2012 and 2011. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description
of the Bank s actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. 

Stockholders' equity declined to 74.7
million at December 31, 2012, from 84.1 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of an 11.0 million operating loss for
fiscal 2012, and a 1.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. There were 9,751,271 shares of common stock
outstanding at both December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, net of 1,502,951 treasury shares. 

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate
risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates. The risk of loss can be reflected in diminished
and/or reduced potential net interest income in future periods. Interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent
in lending and deposit taking activities. The Bank considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk, which could potentially
have a material impact on operating earnings. Interest rate risk is measured by computing estimated changes in net interest income
and the economic value of equity EVE of the cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the
event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The Bank's exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a quarterly
basis by management and the Board. Exposure to interest rate risk is measured with the use of interest rate sensitivity analysis
to determine the potential change in net interest income and EVE in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates, while
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. If estimated
changes to net interest income and EVE are not within Board established target risk tolerance limits, the Board may direct management
to adjust the Bank's asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within the approved target limits. 

40 

The EVE calculation is based on the net
present value of discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical
interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and
deposit decay rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the computations do not contemplate
any actions the Bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. 

EVE represents the economic value of portfolio
equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance
sheet items. The interest rate sensitivity analysis assesses the potential loss in risk sensitive instruments in the event of sudden
and sustained 1 to 4 increases and decreases in market interest rates. With the Federal Reserve s current policy of continuing
to hold interest rates at lower levels, it is not foreseeable that interest rates can decline below zero if downward rate environment
assumptions were run. Any data produced by these assumptions would not be reliable. Therefore, Table 1 below does not reflect downward
rate interest rates projections. The Board has adopted an interest rate risk management policy that establishes maximum decreases
in EVE of 15 , 20 , 25 and 35 , and maximum increases in net interest income of 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 , in the event of sudden and
sustained 1 to 4 increases in market interest rates. 

Table 1 below presents a static simulation
projection of changes in EVE and net interest income, before provision for credit losses PCL ), only in the event
of sudden and sustained increases in market interest rates for the various rate shock levels at December 31, 2012. Loan data used
in the December 31, 2012 static simulation projection was based on balances before the Disposition Plan. At December 31, 2012,
the Bank's estimated changes in EVE and net interest income were within the Board established target limits. The Bank uses IPS-Sendero
modeling software in the preparation of its interest rate risk simulation projections.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the
method of analysis presented in Table 1. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities to repricing,
they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities
may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market
rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis
and over the life of the asset. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank's portfolio could decrease in
future periods due to refinance activity if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels. Further, in the event
of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table. Also,
the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in interest rates. 

Asset/Liability Management. The
Bank strives to maintain consistent net interest income and reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by matching
the terms to repricing of its interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Factors beyond the Bank's control, such as market interest
rates and competition, may also impact interest income and interest expense. The Bank's net interest income will generally increase
when interest rates rise over an extended period of time, and conversely, will decrease when interest rates decline. The Bank can
significantly influence its net interest income by controlling the increases and decreases in its interest income and interest
expense, which are primarily caused by changes in market interest rates. 

Interest rate risk and trends, liquidity
and capital ratio requirements are reported to the Board on a regular basis. The Board reviews the maturities of the Bank's assets
and liabilities and establishes policies and strategies designed to regulate the flow of funds and to coordinate the sources, uses
and pricing of such funds. The first priority in structuring and pricing assets and liabilities is to maintain an acceptable interest
rate spread while reducing the net effects of changes in interest rates. The Bank's management is responsible for administering
the policies and determinations of the Board with respect to the Bank's asset and liability goals and strategies. 

41 

A primary component in managing interest
rate risk is based on the volume of interest sensitive assets such as loans and leases held for investment. Loans and leases held
for investment declined to 441.8 million at December 31, 2012, from 534.0 million at December 31, 2011. The Bank also had 44.7
million of loans held for sale at December 31, 2012, compared to 6.4 million at December 31, 2011. Depending on conditions existing
at a given time, the Bank may sell fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. In managing its portfolio of
investment securities, all securities are held as available for sale, allowing the Bank to sell a security in a timely manner should
an immediate liquidity need arise. Investment securities classified as available for sale increased to 164.8 million at December
31, 2012, from 138.5 million at December 31, 2011. 

The Bank uses interest sensitivity gap
analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,
while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount
of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities
maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-sensitive assets
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities, and is considered negative when the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive assets. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would adversely
affect net interest income, while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely, during a period
of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would negatively
affect net interest income. The Bank's goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations
and earnings. 

Rate/Volume Analysis . Net interest
income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume on average interest-earning assets
and average interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in
the volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income
and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of average interest-earning asset and average interest-bearing
liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (i) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate);
(ii) changes in rate (percentage change in rate multiplied by old volume); (iii) changes in rate-volume (percentage changes in
rate multiplied by changes in volume); and (iv) net change (total of the previous columns).

Analysis of Net Interest Income. 
Net interest income primarily represents the difference between income derived from interest-earning assets and interest expense
on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by both the difference between the yield on earning assets and
the average cost of funds interest rate spread ), and the relative volume of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing
liabilities and noninterest-bearing deposits. 

42 

Table 3 below contains information relating
to the Company's average Statements of Financial Condition and Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011, and 2010, reflecting the yield on average earning assets and the average cost of funds for the periods indicated. Average
balances are derived from month end balances. The Company does not believe that using month end balances rather than average daily
balances has caused any material difference in the information presented. The average loans receivable balances listed in interest
earning assets do not include nonaccrual loan balances. Tax equivalent yields related to certain investment securities are exempt
from federal income tax is stated on a fully taxable basis, using a 34 federal tax rate and reduced by a disallowed portion of
the tax exempt interest income. 

The decline in net interest income results
primarily from the decline in market interest rates and the decline in the volume of average earning assets. The decline in market
interest rates has been significantly influenced by the Federal Reserve s current policy of holding interest rates at record
low levels in efforts to stimulate current economic conditions. The decline in the volume of average earning assets has been influenced
by a slowdown in loan originations during the current economic cycle, and the volume of nonperforming assets.

Results of Operations 

See Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized
Subsequent Event above for additional information regarding the impact of the Disposition Plan on the results of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at
December 31, 2012 and 2011 . 

Total assets declined to 707.7 million
at December 31, 2012, from 746.9 million at December 31, 2011. Average earning assets declined to 667.1 million for 2012, from
 700.2 million for 2011, reflecting a net decline in the volume of the loans and leases held for investment, and somewhat offset
by an increase in investment securities and loans held for sale. The ratio of earning assets to total assets increased to 91.5 
at December 31, 2012, from 91.2 at December 31, 2011. 

43 

Investment securities available for sale
increased to 164.8 million at December 31, 2012, from 138.5 million at December 31, 2011. During 2012, this was due to 38.3
million of purchases, 32.7 million of sales, 23.6 million of principal repayments, 41.0 million of securitizations, 2.1 million
increase in unrealized holding gains, 288,000 of net accretion of premiums and discounts, and 1.5 million of gains on sale. The
Bank sells investment securities and securitizes mortgage loans held for sale into mortgage-backed securities in order to support
a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes and to provide liquidity. During 2012, the Bank implemented a strategy
to diversify its investment portfolio through the purchase of tax-exempt municipal securities. At December 31, 2012, the municipal
securities portfolio totaled 24.6 million, compared to none at December 31, 2011. See Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. 

Loans held
for sale increased to 44.7 million at December 31, 2012, from 6.4 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of originations,
sales, net realized gains, securitizations into mortgage-backed securities and transfers from loans held for investment. During
the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 82.0 million of net originations, 29.5 million of sales, 2.4 million of net realized
gains, 41.0 million of securitizations, and in conjunction with the Disposition Plan, 24.4
million of loans previously held for investment were reclassified as held for sale. The Bank also sells selected mortgage loans
in the secondary mortgage market in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate and credit risk, while retaining servicing rights
to generate additional fee income. Loans serviced for others declined to 313.8 million at December 31, 2012, from 319.4 million
at December 31, 2011. 

Loans and leases receivable held for investment,
net of the allowance for loan and lease losses and deferred loan fees, declined to 434.0 million at December 31, 2012, from 518.8
million at December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of principal repayments and write downs, net of originations, net charge offs,
transfers to OREO; and transfers to loans held for sale. During 2012, there were 26.2 million of principal payments and write
downs, net of originations, 23.3 million of provisions for credit losses, 10.9 million of transfers to OREO and 24.4 million
of transfers to loans held for sale pursuant to the Disposition Plan. The Bank originates both fixed and adjustable rate secured
and unsecured loans held for investment. Adjustable rate loans provide shorter terms to maturity and the ability to better manage
exposure to market and interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates. The Bank continues to limit the origination of new
acquisition and development loans, lot loans or land loans. After successfully reducing its acquisition, development and construction
(ADC) concentration, the Bank has resumed originating speculative and pre-sold construction loans on 1 to 4 family residential
properties in select markets within its primary market area. 

Total loans held for investment on nonaccrual
status declined to 4.4 million at December 31, 2012, from 43.0 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting management s efforts
to resolve the Bank s problem loans during 2012. As a result of the Disposition Plan, the level of nonaccrual loans declined
by 29.2 million at December 31, 2012. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed,
when in management s judgment, it is determined that the collectability of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful.
Generally, this occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past
due are generally charged off or a specific allowance may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when
management concludes that they are uncollectible. Management has thoroughly evaluated all nonperforming loans and believes they
are either well collateralized or adequately reserved. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased
risks in the loan portfolio, adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors will not require additional adjustments to
the allowance for credit losses. Aside from the loans identified on nonaccrual status, there were no loans at December 31, 2012,
where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability
of the borrowers to comply with their current loan repayment terms. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined to 4.4 
at December 31, 2012, from 8.0 at December 31, 2011. 

Based on an impairment analysis of the
loan and lease portfolio, there were 37.5 million of loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2012, net of 1.8 million in
write-downs, compared to 78.9 million classified as impaired at December 31, 2011, net of 13.4 million in write-downs. As a result
of the Disposition Plan, the level of impaired loans declined by 41.3 million at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012 and December
31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses included 460,000 and 1.6 million specifically provided for impaired loans,
respectively. A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will be unable
to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan arrangement.
All collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, while uncollateralized loans
and other loans determined not to be collateral dependent are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. The Bank uses several factors in determining if a loan is impaired.
The internal asset classification procedures include a thorough review of significant loans and lending relationships and include
the accumulation of related data. This data includes loan payments status, borrowers financial data and borrowers 
operating factors such as cash flows, operating income or loss, and various other matters. See Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized
Subsequent Event , Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Provision for Credit Losses 
and Allowance for Credit Losses below for additional information.

Other real estate owned acquired from
foreclosures declined to 12.9 million at December 31, 2012, from 17.0 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of additions,
disposals and fair value adjustments. During 2012 there were 10.9 million of additions, 7.2 million of disposals, and 7.8 million
of fair value adjustment, including a 5.2 million valuation write-down taken at December 31, 2012, as a result of the Disposition
Plan. Other real estate owned consists of residential and commercial properties, developed lots and raw land. The Bank believes
the adjusted carrying values of these properties are representative of their fair market values, although there can be no assurances
that the ultimate sales will be equal to or greater than the carrying values. See Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized
Subsequent Event and Notes 1, 6 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Goodwill related to prior period acquisitions
was 4.2 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is not amortized according to provisions of financial accounting
standards. The unamortized balance of the Company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually. The Company has performed
annual impairment testing and determined there was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011. 

Total deposits declined to 600.9 million
at December 31, 2012, from 642.6 million at December 31, 2011. Demand accounts (personal and business checking accounts and money
market accounts) increased to 274.7 million at December 31, 2012, from 243.7 million at December 31, 2011. Time deposits declined
to 295.7 million at December 31, 2012, from 369.9 million at December 31, 2011. Savings accounts increased to 30.6 million
at December 31, 2012, from 29.0 million at December 31, 2011. The Bank attempts to manage its cost of deposits by monitoring
the volume and rates paid on maturing certificates of deposits in relationship to current funding needs and market interest rates.
The Bank did not renew certain higher rate maturing time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2012 and was able to reprice
new and maturing time deposits at lower rates. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Interest Expense
 below for additional information regarding deposits and the cost of funds. 

Total borrowings increased to 26.8 million
at December 31, 2012, from 12.4 million at December 31, 2011. FHLB advances increased to 16.5 million at December 31, 2012,
from none at December 31, 2011. The Bank uses lower costing FHLB borrowings as a funding source, providing an effective means
of managing its overall cost of funds. Junior subordinated debentures were 10.3 million at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. Retail
repurchase agreements representing funds held in cash management accounts for commercial banking customers, declined to none at
December 31, 2012, from 2.1 million at December 31, 2011. The Bank discontinued the retail repurchase agreement program effective
November 1, 2012, and subsequently, will sweep commercial banking customers excess cash funds into an interest bearing
deposit account. 

Stockholders' equity declined to
 74.7 million at December 31, 2012, from 84.1 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of an 11.0 million operating
loss for fiscal 2012, and a 1.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company s tangible
equity to assets ratio declined to 10.0 at December 31, 2012, from 10.7 at December 31, 2011. There were 9,751,271 common
shares outstanding at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Tangible book value per common share declined to
 7.09 at December 31, 2012, from 8.06 at December 31, 2011. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased to 5.2 million
at December 31, 2012, from 3.7 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting an increase in unrealized gains on available for
sale securities, net of deferred income taxes. 

The Company paid no quarterly cash dividends
in 2012 or 2011. In order to preserve the Bank s capital, the Company suspended quarterly cash dividend payments in December
2010. The Board will continue to review the status of future dividend payments, which will depend upon the Company s financial
condition, earnings, equity structure, capital needs and economic conditions. 

The Company did not purchase any shares
of its common stock during 2012 or 2011. Shares previously purchased are held as treasury stock, at cost. Treasury shares were
1,502,951 totaling 32.0 million at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. Treasury shares are intended to be used for general corporate
purposes including the future exercise of stock options and providing shares for potential future stock splits. Additionally,
no shares were issued from the exercise of stock options during 2012 or 2011. 

45 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 

General . The Company reported a
net operating loss of 11.0 million for 2012, compared to net income of 1.6 million for 2011. The net loss per diluted common
share was 1.13 per share for 2012, compared to net income per diluted common share of 0.16 per share for 2011. Excluding the
effects of the Disposition Plan, net income for 2012 would have been 3.0 million, or 0.31 per diluted common share. See Part
I, Item 1. Business Recognized Subsequent Event for additional information. 

In addition to the Disposition Plan, net
earnings for 2012 and 2011 were influenced by the amount of provisions for credit losses necessary to maintain the allowance for
loan and lease losses at an adequate level; a decline in the volume of average earning assets; and expenses attributable to other
real estate owned properties; while being partially offset by a reduction in interest expense and gains on mortgage loan and investment
securities sales. The economic environment has presented a challenging credit management issue for the Bank and for some of its
customers. As the Bank addressed and managed through these challenges, it has remained focused on long-term strategies. These
strategies include maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity, improving efficiency in operations, building core customer
relationships and improving franchise and stockholder value. Subsequent to the Disposition Plan, the Bank continues to maintain
a strong capital position in excess of the well-capitalized regulatory guidelines, and combined with the level of the allowance
for credit losses, provides the Bank with a strong foundation from which to grow as economic conditions improve. 

Key performance ratios are return on average
assets (ROA), return on average equity (ROE) and efficiency. These key ratios were negatively impacted by the execution of the
Disposition Plan. For 2012, ROA and ROE declined to (1.50) and (12.87) , respectively, from ROA and ROE of 0.20 and 1.91 , respectively,
achieved for 2011. The efficiency ratio (noninterest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income)
increased to 87.3 for 2012, from 67.8 for 2011. The efficiency ratio measures the proportion of net operating revenues that
are absorbed by overhead expenses, that increased during the reporting periods primarily due to increased OREO valuation adjustments.
Excluding the effects of the Disposition Plan, ROA, ROE and the efficiency ratio for 2012 would have been 0.41 , 3.52 and 73.6 ,
respectively. 

Interest Income . Interest income
declined to 34.2 million for 2012, from 39.3 million for 2011. The reduction in the amount of interest income is due primarily
to lower interest rates during the comparative reporting periods and a decline in the volume of average interest-earning assets.
Average interest-earning assets declined to 667.1 million for 2012, from 700.2 million for 2011. The reduction in average interest-earning
assets reflects the net effect of the combined decrease in loans and leases receivable; sales and principal payments on investment
securities, net of purchases; and the volume of other real estate owned and non-performing loans. The tax equivalent yield on
average interest-earning assets declined to 5.15 for 2012, from 5.61 for 2011. 

Interest Expense . Interest expense
declined to 4.7 million for 2012, from 7.6 million for 2011, reflecting declines in interest rates paid for funds and the volume
of average interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-bearing liabilities declined to 544.3 million for 2012, from 590.9
million for 2011. The average balance of noninterest-bearing demand deposits declined to 95.4 million for 2012, from 99.8 million
for 2011. The average cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, declined to 0.73 for 2012, from 1.09 for 2011.
The Bank was able to improve its funding cost through a combination of lower costing borrowings and demand accounts, and pricing
new time deposits and repricing of maturing time deposits at lower interest rates. 

Net Interest Income . Net interest
income declined to 29.5 million for 2012, from 31.7 million for 2011. The decline in net interest income during 2012 was influenced
by lower interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate
spread (the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning assets and the average cost of funds) declined
marginally to 4.42 for 2012, from 4.53 for 2011. Tax equivalent yields related to certain investment securities exempt from
federal income tax are stated on a fully taxable basis, using a 34 federal tax rate and reduced by a disallowed portion of the
tax exempt interest income. See Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis and Table
3 - Yield/Cost Analysis above for additional information on interest income, interest expense, net interest income, average
balances and yield/cost ratios. 

46 

Provision for Credit Losses . The
Bank recorded 23.3 million of provisions for credit losses in 2012, including 17.2 million associated with the Disposition Plan,
compared to 10.8 million in 2011. Credit loss provisions are necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level
that management believes is adequate to absorb probable future losses in the loan portfolio. The Bank's methodology for determining
its provision for credit losses includes amounts specifically allocated to credits that are individually determined to be impaired,
as well as general provisions allocated to groups of loans that have not been individually assessed for impairment. See Part I,
 Item 1. Business Recognized Subsequent Event , Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit
Losses , Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Allowance for Credit Losses below for
additional information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses. The
Bank maintains allowances for loan and lease losses held for investment and for unfunded loan commitments (collectively the allowance
for credit losses ), at levels management believes are adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in loans and leases held
for investment and in unfunded loan commitments. The Bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses, that reflect the assessment of credit risk and impairment analysis. This assessment includes
an analysis of qualitative and quantitative trends in the levels of classified loans. In developing this analysis, the Bank relies
on historical loss experience, estimates and exercises judgment in assessing credit risk. Future assessments of credit risk may
yield different results, depending on changes in the qualitative and quantitative trends, which may require adjustments in the
allowance for credit losses. 

The Bank uses various modeling, calculation
methods and estimation tools for measuring credit risk and performing impairment analysis, which is the basis used in developing
the allowance for credit losses. Factors supporting the allowance do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb probable losses in loans and leases held for investment and in unfunded loan commitments. The Bank s
principal focus is on the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses. Based on the overall credit quality of loans and
leases held for investment, management believes the Bank has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to generally
accepted accounting principles, and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment. Management
reassesses the information upon which it bases the allowance for credit losses quarterly, and believes their accounting decisions
remain accurate. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased risks in loans and leases, changes
in economic conditions and other factors will not require additional adjustments to the allowance. 

The allowance for credit losses was 8.1
million at December 31, 2012, compared to 15.4 million December 31, 2011, reflecting the net of provisions for credit losses
and net charge offs. During 2012, there were 23.3 million of provisions for credit losses and 30.6 million of net charge offs.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans and leases held for investment was 1.78 at December 31, 2012, compared
to 2.84 at December 31, 2011. See Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized Subsequent Event , Item 1. Business-Lending
Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses and Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information. 

Noninterest Income . Noninterest
income increased to 11.3 million for 2012, from 9.4 million for 2011. Noninterest income consists of fees, service charges and
servicing fees earned on loans, service charges and insufficient funds fees collected on deposit accounts, net gains from loan
and securities sales and other miscellaneous income. The Bank strives to maintain a consistent level of noninterest income across
both loan and deposit service offerings. Fees, service charges and loan servicing fees collected were 6.8 million for both 2012
and 2011. Fees, service charges and loan servicing fees earned during each period are influenced by the volume of loans receivable
and deposits outstanding, the volume of the various types of loan and deposit account transactions processed, the volume of loans
serviced for others and the collection of related fees and service charges. 

Gains on sales of mortgage loans held
for sale increased to 2.4 million for 2012, from 864,000 for 2011. The Bank may sell fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to
reduce interest rate and credit risk exposure, and provide a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes, while
retaining certain other held for sale mortgage loans for future securitization into available for sale mortgage-backed securities.
The Bank sold 29.5 million of loans held for sale in 2012, compared to 23.7 million sold in 2011. The Bank also securitized
 41.0 million of mortgage loans held for into available for sale mortgage-backed securities in 2012, compared to 37.2 million
of securitizations during 2011. 

Gains from sales of investment securities
available for sale increased to 1.5 million for 2012, from 519,000 for 2011. Proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans and investment
securities provide additional liquidity to support the Bank s operating, financing and lending activities. The Bank sold
 32.7 million of investment securities available for sale in 2012, compared to 11.9 million sold in 2011. 

47 

In its efforts of disposing of nonperforming
assets, the Bank recorded net losses on sales of other real estate owned properties of 529,000 for 2012, compared to 68,000
of net losses recorded for 2011. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Noninterest
Expenses . Noninterest expense increased to 35.6 million for 2012, including 5.2 million
of additional valuation adjustments to OREO properties resulting from the Disposition Plan, compared to 28.0 million for 2011.
Compensation and fringe benefits, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased to 15.7 million for 2012, from 14.9
million for 2011. The increase during 2012, results primarily from accelerating the accrual of lump-sum retirement benefits payable
to the former CEO upon his retirement at the end of August 2012. In 2012, the Bank accrued 1.5 million for his lump-sum retirement
benefits payable, compared to 149,000 accrued in 2011. 

FDIC insurance premiums declined to 987,000
for 2012, from 1.2 million for 2011, reflecting the decline in the volume of insured deposit account balances, and changes in
the FDIC s deposit insurance assessment calculation. The FDIC changed their deposit insurance assessment calculation during
2011, to be based on assets and Tier 1 capital rather than deposits. 

Expenses attributable to valuation adjustments,
renovating, maintenance and property taxes paid for the current volume of OREO properties increased to 8.8 million for 2012,
including 5.2 million of additional valuation adjustments to OREO properties resulting from the Disposition Plan, from 2.0 million
for 2011. See Part I, Item 1. Business Recognized Subsequent Event and Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. 

Data processing costs declined to 1.9
million for 2012, from 2.6 million for 2011, reflecting favorable initial pricing from a core data processing system upgrade
completed during 2012. Upon the expiration of these pricing concessions, data processing expenses are anticipated to approximate
previously reported amounts. Other noninterest expenses including premises and equipment, advertising, repairs and maintenance,
office supplies, professional fees, taxes and insurance, etc., remained relatively consistent during the respective reporting
periods. 

Income Taxes . The Company recorded
a 7.1 million income tax benefit for 2012, compared to 848,000 of income tax expense for 2011, reflecting the tax benefits associated
with the Disposition Plan. The pretax operating loss was 18.1 million for 2012, compared to pretax income of 2.4 million for
2011. Changes in the amount of income tax expense or benefit reflect changes in pretax income or loss, deductible expenses, the
application of permanent and temporary differences and the applicable income tax rates in effect during each period. The effective
income tax benefit rate for 2012 was 39.4 , compared to an effective income tax expense rate of 35.3 for 2011. See Notes 1 and
12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. 

General . The Company reported net
income of 1.6 million for 2011, compared to a net operating loss of 2.4 million for 2010. The net income per diluted common
share was 0.16 per share for 2011, compared to net loss per diluted common share of 0.24 per share for 2010. 

The increase in pretax earnings during
2011 was influenced by an 11.3 million reduction in the amount of provisions for credit losses required to replenish net charge-offs,
an 854,000 increase in earnings on investments, and a 1.5 million reduction in interest funding expense, between the respective
reporting periods. These increases were partially offset by a 4.4 million decline in interest income on loans, a 1.4 million
decline in non-interest income and a 1.2 increase in non-interest expenses, as further discussed below. 

Key performance ratios are return on average
assets (ROA), return on average equity (ROE) and efficiency. ROA increased to 0.20 for 2011, from (0.29) for 2010; while ROE
increased to 1.91 for 2011, from (2.74) for 2010. These ratios were negatively impacted in 2010 based on the reported net operating
loss. The efficiency ratio increased to 67.8 for 2011, from 59.7 for 2010. The efficiency ratio increased during the reporting
periods primarily due to costs associated with other real estate owned. 

Interest Income . Interest income
declined to 39.3 million for 2011, from 42.9 million for 2010. This decline was influenced by the decline in the volume of average
earning assets and continued lower interest rates during the reporting periods. The average balance of interest-earning assets
declined to 700.2 million for 2011, from 738.1 million for 2010. The yield on average interest-earning assets declined to 5.6 
for 2011, from 5.8 for 2010. 

Interest Expense . Interest expense
declined to 7.6 million for 2011, from 9.0 million for 2010. The decline in interest expense during 2011 reflects the decline
in interest rates paid for funds and a decline in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-bearing
liabilities declined to 590.9 million for 2011, from 623.2 million for 2010. The average balance of noninterest-bearing demand
deposits increased to 99.8 million for 2011, from 94.7 million for 2010. The average cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing
deposits, declined to 1.1 for 2011, from 1.3 for 2010. This decline reflects a combination of lower interest rates, the repayment
of higher costing borrowings and management s efforts of controlling the Bank s deposit cost. 

48 

Net Interest Income . Net interest
income declined to 31.7 million for 2011, from 33.9 million for 2010. The decline in net interest income during 2011 is primarily
attributable to lower market interest rates and greater decline in the volume of interest-earning assets than in interest-bearing
liabilities. The net yield on interest-earning assets declined marginally to 4.5 for 2011, from 4.6 for 2010. The interest rate
spread also declined marginally to 4.5 for 2011, from 4.6 for 2010. 

Provision for Credit Losses . The
Bank provided 10.8 million for credit losses in 2011, compared to 22.2 million provided in 2010. Credit loss provisions are
necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable future
losses in the loan portfolio. 

Allowance for Credit Losses. The
Bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at levels it believes are adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan
and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses was 15.4 million at December 31, 2011,
compared to 19.1 million at December 31, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans and leases held for investment
was 2.9 at December 31, 2011, compared to 3.1 at December 31, 2010, which management believes is appropriate. 

Noninterest Income . Noninterest
income declined to 9.4 million for 2011, from 10.8 million for 2010. During 2011 and 2010, the Bank strived to maintain a consistent
level of revenue across loan and deposit service offerings. Fees, service charges and loan
servicing fees declined to 6.8 million for 2011, from 7.6 million for 2010. Fees, service charges and loan servicing fees are
influenced by the volume of loans receivable and deposits outstanding, the volume of various types of loan and deposit account
transactions processed, the volume of loans serviced for others and the collection of related fees and service charges. 

Gains from mortgage loan sales were 864,000
for 2011, compared 1.2 million for 2010. Proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale was 23.7 million in 2011, compared to
 39.1 million sold in 2010. Gains from the sale of securities available for sale declined to 519,000 for 2011, from 1.7 million
for 2010. The Bank sold 11.9 million of securities available for sale during 2011, compared to 37.8 million sold during 2010.
The Bank recorded net losses from the sales of other real estate owned of 68,000 for 2011, compared to 523,000 for 2010. The
Bank sold 5.7 million of other real estate owned during 2011, compared to 12.6 million sold during 2010. 

Noninterest Expenses . Noninterest
expenses increased to 28.0 million for 2011, from 26.7 million for 2010. The largest component of these expenses, compensation
and fringe benefits, declined to 14.9 million in 2011, from 15.6 million in 2010. Full-time equivalent employees declined to
251 at December 31, 2011, from 281 at December 31, 2010, reflecting management s efforts of controlling human resources
costs, while simultaneously maintaining sufficient staffing levels necessary to support retail customer service, credit administration
and banking operations. 

FDIC insurance premiums were 1.2 million
for both 2011 and 2010, reflecting the volume of insured deposit accounts during the respective reporting periods, and changes
in the FDIC s deposit insurance assessment calculation. The FDIC changed their deposit insurance assessment calculation
during 2011 to be based on assets and tier one capital versus on deposits. Expenses attributable to valuation adjustments, renovating,
maintenance and property taxes paid for the current volume of other real estate owned properties increased to 2.0 million for
2011, from to 534,000 for 2010. Other noninterest expenses including premises and equipment, advertising, data processing, repairs
and maintenance, office supplies, professional fees, taxes and insurance, etc., have remained relatively consistent during the
respective reporting periods. 

Income Taxes . The Company recorded
income tax expense of 848,000 for 2011, compared to a 1.8 million income tax benefit for 2010. Pretax income increased to 2.4
million for 2011, from a pretax operating loss of 4.2 million for 2010. Changes in the amount of income tax expense or benefit
reflect changes in pretax income or loss, deductible expenses, the application of permanent and temporary differences and the
applicable income tax rates in effect during each period. The effective income tax expense rate for 2011 was 35.3 , compared to
an effective income tax benefit rate of 43.1 for 2010. 

49 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices.
 The consolidated financial statements of the Company and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They require the measurement of financial position and operating
results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and
due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Bank's operations. Unlike most industrial
companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on
the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same
direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. 

Accounting Standards Codification .
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 
(the Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities. All previous US GAAP standards
issued by a standard setter are superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the Codification will be considered
non authoritative. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting
pronouncements and changes in accounting principles, the respective effective and adoption dates, and the expected impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. T he Bank is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, to which in the
normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and
interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. See Item 1. Business Lending
Activities Unfunded Commitments Composition and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and the Stockholders 

 First South Bancorp, Inc. 

 Washington, North Carolina 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition of First South Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. First South Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary s management is responsible for
these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First South Bancorp, Inc. and
Subsidiary at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the results of their operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), First South Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 29, 2013
expressed an unqualified opinion.

FIRST SOUTH BANCORP, INC. AND Subsidiary 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Organization and
Nature of Operations 

First South Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. First South Bank (the Bank ),
the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina. The Federal
Reserve Board regulates the Company, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the North Carolina
Office of the Commissioner of Banks regulate the Bank. 

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company, the Bank, and the Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, First South Leasing, LLC. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The Company follows accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices within the financial services industry as summarized
below: 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include highly
liquid assets such as cash on hand, non-interest bearing deposits and amounts in clearing accounts due from correspondent banks
and clearing balances required to be maintained with the Federal Reserve. At times, the Bank places deposits with high credit
quality financial institutions in amounts which may be in excess of federally insured limits. 

Investment Securities 

Investments in certain securities are
classified into three categories and accounted for as follows: (1) debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and
the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held for investment HFI and reported at amortized cost; (2)
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified
as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; (3) debt and equity securities
not classified as either held for investment securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale AFS securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other
comprehensive income, a separate component of equity. 

A decline in the market value of any AFS
or HFI security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value.
The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. To determine whether an impairment
is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price
recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary.
Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes
in value subsequent to year-end and forecasted performance of the investee. 

Premiums and discounts on debt securities
are amortized or accreted, as adjustments to interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity. Gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method. Mortgage-backed securities represent
participating interests in pools of long-term first mortgage loans. Municipal securities represent
debt securities issued by a state, municipality or county to finance capital expenditures. Municipal securities are exempt from
federal taxes and from most state and local taxes, especially in the state in which the bond is issued.

Loans Held for Investment and Allowance
for Credit Losses 

Loans held for investment are stated at
the amount of unpaid principal, net of deferred origination fees, and reduced by an allowance for credit losses. Interest on loans
is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and is recognized using the interest method. Loan origination fees, as well
as certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred. Such costs and fees are recognized as an adjustment to yield over the
contractual lives of the related loans. Commitment fees to originate or purchase loans are deferred, and if the commitment is
exercised, recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. If the commitment expires unexercised, commitment fees
are recognized in income upon expiration. Fees for originating loans for other financial institutions are recognized as loan fee
income. 

A loan is considered impaired, based on
current information and events, if it is probable that scheduled payments of principal or interest due according to the contractual
terms of the loan agreement is uncollectible. Uncollateralized loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at historical effective interest rates; while collateral-dependent loans are measured for
impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. The Bank uses several factors in determining if a loan is impaired. Internal
asset classification procedures include a review of significant loans and lending relationships and obtaining related data. This
data includes the borrower s loan payment status, current financial data and factors such as cash flows, operating income
or loss, etc. 

At December 31, 2012, there were 37.5
million of loans held for investment identified as impaired, net of 1.8 million in write-downs, compared to 78.9 million of
loans identified as impaired, net of 13.4 million in write-downs at December 31, 2011. The allowance for loan losses included
 460,000 and 1.6 million specifically provided for these impaired loans as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest
income recognized on impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 2.0 million and 3.9 million, respectively. 

The allowance for credit losses is increased
by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect
the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. While management
believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment, there can be no assurance
that in the future the Bank's regulators or risks in its portfolio will not require further changes in the allowance. 

Loans Held for Sale 

The Bank originates single family residential
first mortgage loans. A certain portion of these originations are classified as loans held for sale. At December 31, 2012, pursuant
to ASC 825, Financial Instruments , the Bank marked these mortgage loans to market. The Bank originates mortgage loans for
sale that have been approved by secondary investors. The Bank issues a rate lock commitment to a borrower and concurrently locks-in 
with a secondary market investor, under a best efforts delivery mechanism. The terms of the loan are set by the secondary investors
and are transferred within a short time period of the Bank initially funding the loan. The Bank receives origination fees from
borrowers and servicing release premiums from investors that are recognized in income when the loan is sold. 

Loans held for sale at December 31, 2012
and 2011 had estimated fair market values of 44,725,450 and 6,673,835, respectively. Net gains on sales of loans held for sale
were 2,400,614, 864,233 and 1,155,690 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Bank exchanged loans with principal balances of 41,034,564, 37,225,850 and 48,372,395,
respectively, with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC for mortgage-backed securities of equal value. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Real estate assets acquired through loan
foreclosure are recorded as other real estate OREO owned at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property
less estimated costs to sell or the carrying amount of the loan plus unpaid accrued interest at the date of foreclosure. The carrying
amount is subsequently reduced by additional valuations which are charged to earnings if the estimated fair value declines below
its initial value plus any capitalized costs. Costs related to the improvement of the property are capitalized, whereas costs
related to holding the property are expensed. Valuation adjustments recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010 were 7.8 million, 2.5 million and 3.2 million, respectively.

Recognized Subsequent Event 

On February 21, 2013, the Bank announced
a two-tiered Bulk Asset Disposition Plan (the Disposition Plan to significantly reduce its level of problem assets
through a bulk sale of problem loans and the disposition of OREO properties. Pursuant to guidance set forth in ASC 855, Subsequent
Events , while the events of the Disposition Plan occurred after December 31, 2012, the effect of these transactions on the
value of the assets impacted is being reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2012, as a recognized subsequent event. 

The Disposition Plan is segregated into
two phases. First, on February 20, 2013, the Bank executed an agreement to sell problem loans with a book value of 46.9 million,
resulting in a 17.6 million pre-tax charge to 2012 earnings. Second, the Bank wrote down the majority of its OREO assets in order
to allow for the disposal of these problem assets in an accelerated time frame. As a result, the Company realized a 5.2 million
pre-tax valuation charge to 2012 earnings. 

The Bank completed the problem loan sale
on February 22, 2013, and received net proceeds of 25.1 million. The OREO disposal phase of the Disposition Plan is on-going.
The Bank believes the valuation adjustments taken as of December 31, 2012, against that portion of the OREO portfolio offered
for sale, resulted in book values that are at levels for which the assets can be disposed of at prices that are indicative of
market values. 

For the year ended December 31, 2012,
the Company recognized an 11.0 million net operating loss, or 1.13) per diluted share, compared to net income of 1.6 million,
or 0.16 per diluted common share, earned for the year ended December 31, 2011. Excluding the effects of the Disposition Plan,
net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, would have been 3.0 million, or 0.31 per diluted common share. 

Income Recognition on Impaired and
Nonaccrual Loans 

Loans, including impaired loans, are generally
classified as nonaccrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than 90
days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful
or is partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past
due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. 

Loans may be returned to accrual status
when all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment within an
acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months) by the
borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms of interest and principal. 

While a loan is classified as nonaccrual
and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied
as a reduction to principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortization where the payment is generally
applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may
be recognized on a cash basis limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual
interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for credit losses until prior charge-offs
have been fully recovered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

The Bank identifies loans for potential
restructuring on a loan-by-loan basis using a variety of sources which may include, but are not limited to, any one or a combination
of the following: being approached or contacted by the borrower to modify loan terms; review of borrower s financial statements
indicates borrower may be experiencing financial difficulties; past due payment reports; loans extending past their stated maturity
date; and nonaccrual loan reports. Not all loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). Identifying
whether a loan restructuring is a TDR is based upon individual facts and circumstances and requires the use of judgment on a loan-by-loan
basis. The Bank must first determine if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. A restructuring constitutes a TDR if
for economic or legal reasons related to an individual borrower s financial condition, the Bank grants a concession to the
borrower that would not otherwise be considered. A restructuring that results in only a delay in payment that is insignificant
is not a concession.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

When mortgage loans are sold, the proceeds
are allocated between the related loans and the retained mortgage servicing rights based on their relative fair values. Servicing
assets and liabilities are amortized on a straight line basis over the average period of estimated net servicing income (if servicing
revenues exceed servicing costs) or net servicing loss (if servicing costs exceed servicing revenues). All servicing assets or
liabilities are assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on their fair value. The Company recorded amortization of
mortgage servicing rights of 425,136, 511,258 and 462,345 for prepayments during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. There were no impairments recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based
on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for leasehold improvements and buildings, and 3 to
7 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred, and additions
and improvements to premises and equipment are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in earnings. 

Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank
Stock 

As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Atlanta FHLB ), the Bank is required to invest in Class B capital stock, par value 100, of the FHLB. The FHLB
capital stock requirement is based on the sum of a membership stock component totaling 15 of the Bank s total assets with
a cap of 26.0 million, and an activity based component of 4.5 of outstanding FHLB advances. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the
Bank owned 18,592 and 18,869 shares of the FHLB s capital stock, respectively. The Bank carries this investment at cost.
Due to the redemption provisions of the FHLB, the Bank estimated that fair value equals cost and that this investment was not
impaired at December 31, 2012. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Net assets of entities acquired in purchase
transactions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and as such, the historical cost basis of individual assets
and liabilities are adjusted to reflect their fair value. Identified intangible assets resulting from branch offices acquired
in 2004 are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Amortization expense of 31,440 per year was recorded for
each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for potential
impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. The impairment test is performed in two phases. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if
the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedure must be performed. That additional procedure
compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss
is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. 

Income Taxes 

The Company has adopted FASB ASC 740-10,
regarding uncertain income tax positions. Under this standard, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income
tax returns must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon audit by
the relevant taxing authority. The standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure, and transition issues with respect to tax positions. The Company has
determined that it has no uncertain income tax positions as of December 31, 2012. Also, the Company does not anticipate
any increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months that would result in a material change to
its financial position. The Company includes interest and penalties in the financial statements as a component of income
tax expense; however, no interest or penalties are included in the Company's income tax expense for the years ended December
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return, and separate state
income tax returns. The Company's income tax returns for years ended after December 31, 2007 remain open for examination.

Segment Information 

The Company follows financial accounting
standards which specify guidelines for determining its operating segments and the type and level of financial information to be
disclosed. Based on these guidelines, management has determined that the Bank operates in one business segment, the providing
of general commercial financial services to customers located in its market areas. The various products are those generally offered
by community banks. The allocation of Bank resources is based on overall performance of the Bank, rather than individual branches
or products. 

Advertising 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company incurred advertising expense totaling 211,524, 181,121 and
 148,380, respectively. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The Company's comprehensive income (loss)
includes net income (loss) and changes in other comprehensive income. The components of other comprehensive income primarily include
net changes in unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, and the reclassification of net gains and losses
on available for sale securities recognized in income during the respective reporting periods. 

New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes
in Accounting Principles 

The following summarizes recent accounting
pronouncements and their expected impact on the Company. 

In July 2012, the FASB issued new guidance
on Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would not be required to calculate
the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless it determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is not
more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. The guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment
tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2012, the FASB issued new guidance
on Subsequent Accounting for an Indemnification Asset Recognized at the Acquisition Date as a Result of a Government-Assisted
Acquisition of a Financial Institution. This guidance addresses the diversity in practice of how to interpret the terms on
the same basis and contractual limitations when subsequently measuring an indemnification asset recognized in a government-assisted
(Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration) acquisition of a financial institution, that includes
a loss-sharing agreement (indemnification agreement). This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
on or after December 15, 2012. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In January 2013, the FASB issued new guidance
on Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . The objective of this guidance is to clarify
offsetting disclosures that apply to accounting for derivatives and hedging, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company will evaluate the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In January 2013, the FASB issued new guidance
on Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The objective of this guidance is to
improve reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance does not change current requirements
for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. The guidance requires an entity to provide information
about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component, and present either in the income statement
or notes, significant amounts reclassified by the respective line items of net income. For public entities, this guidance is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company will evaluate the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated
financial statements. 

Other accounting standards that have been
issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Credit Quality Indicators . The
Bank assigns a risk grade to each loan in the portfolio as part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. 

Commercial loans are graded on a scale
of 1 to 9. A description of the general characteristics of the 9 risk grades is as follows: 

Risk Grade 1 (Excellent) - Loans in this category are considered
 to be of the highest quality. The borrower(s) has significant financial
 strength, stability, and liquidity. Proven cash flow is significantly
 more than required to service current and proposed debt with consistently
 strong earnings. Collateral position is very strong and a secondary
 source of repayment is self-evident. Guarantors may not be necessary
 to support the debt. 

Risk Grade 2 (Above Average) - Loans are supported by above
 average financial strength and stability. Cash flow is more than
 sufficient to meet current demands. Earnings are strong and reliable,
 but may differ from year to year. Collateral is highly liquid and
 sufficient to repay the debt in full. Guarantors may qualify for
 the loan on a direct basis. 

Risk Grade 3 (Average) - Credits in this group are supported
 by upper tier industry-average financial strength and stability.
 Liquidity levels fluctuate and need for short-term credit is demonstrated.
 Cash flow is steady and adequate to meet demands but can fluctuate.
 Earnings should be consistent but operating losses have not occurred
 recently. Collateral is generally pledged at an acceptable loan
 to value, but the credit can support some level of unsecured exposure.
 Guarantors with demonstrable financial strength are typically required
 on loans to business entities, but may not be on loans to individual
 borrowers. 

Risk Grade 4 (Acceptable) - Credits in this group are supported
 by lower end industry-average financial strength and stability.
 Liquidity levels fluctuate but are acceptable and need for short
 term credit is demonstrated. Cash flow is adequate to meet demands
 but can fluctuate. Earnings may be inconsistent but operating losses
 have not occurred recently. Collateral is generally pledged at
 an acceptable loan to value. Guarantors with demonstrable financial
 strength are required on loans to business entities, but may not
 be on loans to individual borrowers. 

Risk Grade 5 (Watch) - An asset in this category is one that
 has been identified by the lender, or credit administration as
 a loan that has shown some degree of deterioration from its original
 status. These loans are typically protected by collateral but have
 potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention,
 but are not yet at a point to become a classified asset. There
 may be unsecured loans that are included in this category. These
 are loans that management feels need to be watched more closely
 than those rated as acceptable and if left uncorrected, these potential
 weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects
 for the asset to warrant including them as classified assets. 

Risk Grade 6 (Special Mention) - An asset in this category
 is currently protected by collateral but has potential weaknesses
 that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
 these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the
 repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s position
 at some future date. 

Risk Grade 7 (Substandard) - A Substandard loan is inadequately
 protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of
 the debtor(s) or of the collateral pledged, if any. These credits
 have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the
 liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility the Bank
 will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Risk Grade 8 (Doubtful) - A loan graded in this category has
 all the weaknesses inherent in one graded Substandard with the
 added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation
 in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions,
 and values highly questionable and improbable. 

Risk Grade 9 (Loss) - A loan graded as Loss is considered uncollectible
 and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is
 not warranted. This grade does not mean that the loan has absolutely
 no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or
 desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even
 though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 

Consumer loans are graded on a scale of
1 to 9. A description of the general characteristics of the 9 risk grades is as follows: 

Risk Grades 1 - 5 (Pass) - Loans in this category generally
 show little to no signs of weakness or have adequate mitigating
 factors that minimize the risk of loss. Some of the characteristics
 of these loans include, but are not limited to, adequate financial
 strength and stability, adequate cash flow, collateral with acceptable
 loan to value, additional repayment sources, and reliable earnings.

Risk Grade 6 (Special Mention) - An asset in this category is currently protected by collateral but has potential weaknesses
that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration
of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s position at some future date. 

Risk Grade 7 (Substandard) - A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity
of the debtor(s) or of the collateral pledged, if any. These credits have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize
the liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Risk Grade 8 (Doubtful) - A loan graded in this category has all the weaknesses inherent in one graded Substandard with the
added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions,
and values highly questionable and improbable. 

Risk Grade 9 (Loss) - A loan graded as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable
asset is not warranted. This grade does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not
practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the
future. 

Mortgage loans are graded on a scale of
1 to 9. A description of the general characteristics of the 9 risk grades is as follows: 

Risk Grades 1 - 5 (Pass) - Loans in this category generally show little to no signs of weakness
or have adequate mitigating factors that minimize the risk of loss. Some of the characteristics of these loans include, but are
not limited to, adequate financial strength and stability, acceptable credit history, adequate cash flow, collateral with acceptable
loan to value, additional repayment sources, and reliable earnings. 

Risk Grade 6 (Special Mention) Special Mention loans are currently protected by collateral but have potential weaknesses
that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration
of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s position at some future date. 

Risk Grade 7 (Substandard) - Substandard loans are inadequately protected by their sound net worth and paying capacity of the
borrower(s). Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They
are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Risk Grade 8 (Doubtful) - Loans classified Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the
added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions,
and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Risk Grade 9 (Loss) - Loans classified Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as
bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value,
but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may
be affected in the future.

owned consisted of 27 single-family residences, 106 vacant lots, three residential subdivisions containing raw land and 89 developed
lots, ten parcels of land and 29 commercial properties. 

Fair value adjustments are recorded in
order to adjust the carrying values of other real estate owned to estimated fair market values. In most cases, estimated fair
market values are derived from an initial appraisal, an updated appraisal or other forms of internal evaluations. In certain instances
when a listing agreement is renewed for a lesser amount, carrying values will be adjusted to the lesser fair value amount. Additionally,
in certain instances when an offer to purchase is received near the end of a quarterly accounting period for less than the carrying
value, and the sale does not close until the next accounting period, the carrying value will adjust to the lesser fair value offer
amount.

with balances of 100,000 or more was 148,838,963 and 195,429,182 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

The Bank participates in a defined contribution
plan which covers substantially all employees. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, employees may contribute
from 1 to 100 of compensation, subject to an annual maximum as determined by the Internal Revenue Code. The Bank makes matching
contributions of 100 of employees' contributions up to 5 of the employees' salaries. The plan provides that employees' contributions
are 100 vested at all times and the Bank's contributions vest 25 for each year of service. 

Expenses related to the Bank's contributions
to this plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 327,544, 321,243 and 316,729, respectively. 
 Directors and certain officers participate in deferred compensation plans. These plans provide for fixed payments beginning
at retirement, and are earned over service periods of up to ten years, and include provisions for deferral of current payments.
The expense related to these plans during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 1,763,474, 328,863 and 328,667,
respectively. The plans include provisions for forfeitures of unvested portions of payments, and vesting in the event of death
or disability. The total liability under this plan was 1,454,702 and 3,266,218 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company had two stock-based compensation
plans at December 31, 2012. The shares outstanding are for grants under the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan and the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan (collectively, the Plans ). The 1997 Plan matured
on April 8, 2008, and no additional options may be granted under that plan. At December 31, 2012, the 1997 Plan had 51,004 granted
unexercised shares. At December 31, 2012, the 2008 Plan includes 103,000 granted unexercised shares and 855,000 shares available
to be granted. 

Stock options expire ten years from the
date of grant and vest over service periods ranging from one year to five years. The Plans have a change in control provision
under which all options vest immediately if a change in control occurs. Options granted under the 2008 Plan are granted at the
closing sales price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant. The Company settles
stock option exercises with treasury shares. 

The average fair value of options granted
during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 1.76 and 2.21, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants
during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

collateral for actual or potential FHLB advances. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank had approximately 126.8 million and
 153.1 million, respectively, of additional credit available with the FHLB. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had lendable collateral
value with the FHLB totaling 63.3 million. Additional collateral would be required in order to access total borrowings up to

13. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

Dividend payments made by the Company
are subject to regulatory restrictions under Federal Reserve Board policy as well as to limitations under applicable provisions
of Virginia corporate law. The Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding
company's bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. Under Virginia law, dividends may be paid out of surplus
or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal
year. Furthermore, under FDIC regulations, the Bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if, after making the distribution,
the Bank would have: (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 ; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than
4.0 ; or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 . 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Bank's financial statements. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios, as set forth in the table below. Management believes, as of December
31, 2012, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The Company s most significant asset
is its investment in the Bank. Consequently, the information concerning capital ratios is essentially the same for the Company
and the Bank. The Bank's actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are presented in the table
below:

13. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (Continued) 

As of December 31, 2012, the most recent
report filing date with the FDIC, the Bank s regulatory capital position is categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum amounts and ratios,
as set forth in the table above. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2012, that management believes has changed
the Bank's well capitalized category. 

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

The following table provides a reconciliation
of income (loss) available to common stockholders and the average number of shares outstanding (less unearned deferred stock awards
and treasury shares) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Options to purchase 154,004, 166,833 and 181,441 shares
of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011, there were no options that were dilutive, as the exercise prices for these years exceeded the average market price of
the Company s common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 177 options were dilutive, as the average market price
of the Company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of these options. These 177 options were included in the calculation
of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

15. MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 

Mortgage loans serviced for others are
not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. The unpaid principal balances of mortgage loans
serviced for others were 313,823,285, 319,363,434 and 318,217,911 at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Servicing
loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors
and foreclosure processing. Loan servicing income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors
and certain charges collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees. 

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, mortgage
servicing rights reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition, net of amortization, were 1,261,355 and 1,237,161,
respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, the Bank recorded additional servicing assets of
 449,329 and 390,761 as a result of sales of loans or mortgage-backed securities. Amortization of servicing assets during the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 aggregated 425,136, 511,258 and 462,345, respectively. The fair value of recognized
servicing assets amounted to approximately 1,661,000 and 1,901,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Bank's
significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value include weighted average life, prepayment speeds, and expected costs
to transfer servicing to a third party.

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK 

The Bank is a party to financial instruments
with off-balance sheet risk. These risks are incurred in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers
and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit
and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated
statements of financial condition. The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the
financial instruments for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments
to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon
extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. 

The Bank's lending is concentrated primarily
in central, eastern, northeastern and southeastern North Carolina. Credit has been extended to certain of the Bank's customers
through multiple lending transactions. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, amounts
reported do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A summary of the contractual amounts of the Bank's exposure to
off-balance sheet risk as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: 

December 31, 

2012

18. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value of nonfinancial
assets and liabilities. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall
level is an indication of the market observability of the fair value measurement. In order to determine the fair value, the Bank
must determine the unit of account, highest and best use, principal market, and market participants. These determinations allow
the Bank to define the inputs for fair value and level of hierarchy. Outlined below is the application of the fair value hierarchy
to the Bank s financial assets that are carried at fair value. 

Level 1-inputs to the valuation methodology
are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability
to access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall
be used to measure fair value whenever available. The type of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally includes investments
such as U. S. Treasury and U. S. government agency securities. 

80 

18. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) 

Level 2-inputs to the valuation methodology
include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and price quotations can vary substantially either over
time or among market makers. The type of assets carried at Level 2 fair value generally include mortgage-backed securities issued
by Government Sponsored Enterprises GSEs ), municipal bonds, corporate debt securities and mortgage loans held for
sale. 

Level 3-inputs to the valuation methodology
are unobservable to the extent that observable inputs are not available. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances and might include the Bank s own assumptions. The Bank shall not ignore information about
market participant assumptions that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The type of assets carried at Level
3 fair value generally include investments backed by non-traditional mortgage loans or certain state or local housing agency obligations,
of which the Bank has no such assets or liabilities. Level 3 also includes other loans held for sale and other real estate owned.

 to ASC 310-10-35 (formerly FAS 114) resulted in no impairment loss
 recognition.

Quoted market price for similar assets
in active markets is the valuation technique for determining fair value of available for sale securities. Unrealized gains on
available for sale securities are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of the Stockholders 
Equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The estimated fair value of loans held for sale is based
on commitments from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. 

81 

18. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) 

The Company does not record loans held
for investment at fair value on a recurring basis. However, when a loan is considered impaired an impairment write down is taken
based on the loan s estimated fair value. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including
collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those loans not
requiring a write down represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments
in such loans, and are not included above. 

Impaired loans where a write down is taken
based on fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is
based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Company records the impaired loan as non-recurring Level
2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below
the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the impaired loan as non-recurring Level 3. 

OREO acquired through loan foreclosure
is recorded at lower of cost or fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets, based on the appraised market value
of the property. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based
upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral.
When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is impaired below the appraised
value and there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the foreclosed asset as non-recurring Level 3. Fair value
adjustments of 7.8 million, 2.5 million and 3.2 million were made to OREO during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. 

Net losses realized and included in earnings
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are reported in other revenues as follows:

19. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(Continued) 

Fair values have been estimated using
data which management considers as the best available, and estimation methodologies deemed suitable for the pertinent category
of financial instrument. The estimation methodologies used by the Bank were as follows: 

Cash and Due from banks and Interest
 Bearing Deposits in Other Banks : The carrying amounts for cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits in
other banks are equal to their fair value. Fair value hierarchy Input level 1. 

Investment Securities Available for
Sale : The estimated fair value of investment securities is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
These are based on quoted market prices, when available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using
quoted market prices for similar securities. Fair value hierarchy Input level 2. 

Loans Held for Sale. The estimated
fair value of loans held for sale is based on commitments from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics.
Fair value hierarchy Input level 2. 

Loans and Leases Held for Investment,
Net : Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans and leases held for investment with similar financial characteristics.
Loans and leases are segregated by collateral type and by fixed and variable interest rate terms. The fair value of each category
is determined by discounting scheduled future cash flows using current interest rates offered on loans or leases with similar
characteristics. Fair values for impaired loans and leases are estimated based on discounted cash flows or underlying collateral
values, where applicable. Fair value hierarchy Input level 2. 

Stock in Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta : The fair value for FHLB stock approximates carrying value, based on the redemption provisions of the Federal Home
Loan Bank. Fair value hierarchy Input level 2. 

Deposits and Advances from FHLB :
The fair value of demand deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of certificates of deposits
and FHLB advances are estimated using the rates currently offered for similar instruments with similar remaining maturities. Fair
value hierarchy Input level 2. 

Accrued Interest Receivable, Repurchase
Agreements and Junior Subordinated Debentures : The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable. Repurchase agreements and
junior subordinated debentures approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. Fair value hierarchy
Input level 2. 

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance
Sheet Risk : With regard to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value
of future financing commitments.

21. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES 

The Company has sponsored a trust, First
South Preferred Trust I (the Trust), of which 100 of the common equity is owned by the Company. The Trust was formed for the
purpose of issuing company-obligated preferred trust securities (the Preferred Trust Securities) to third-party investors and
investing the proceeds from the sale of such Preferred Trust Securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the Company
(the Debentures). The Debentures held by the Trust are the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions on the Preferred Trust Securities
issued by the Trust are payable quarterly at a rate equal to the interest rate being earned by the Trust on the Debentures held
by that Trust. The Preferred Trust Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the
Debentures. The Company has entered into an agreement, which fully and unconditionally guarantees the Preferred Trust Securities
subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Debentures held by the Trust are first redeemable, in whole or in part, by the Company
on or after September 30, 2008. Subject to certain limitations, the Junior Subordinated Debentures qualify as Tier 1 capital for
the Company under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. 

83 

21. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (Continued) 

In June 2012, the federal bank regulatory
agencies issued proposed rules to implement the capital reforms of the Basel III framework. These proposed regulatory capital
guidelines would phase out the Tier 1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities for institutions with less than 15 billion
in total assets over a ten-year period, beginning in 2013, until they are fully phased out in 2022. The bank regulatory agencies
have delayed implementation of these proposed rules. At this time, it is not clear when, or in what form, these proposed rules
will be implemented. 

Consolidated debt obligations as of December
31, 2012 related to a subsidiary Trust holding solely Debentures of the Company follows: 

LIBOR + 2.95 junior subordinated debentures
 owed to First South Preferred Trust I due September 26, 2033

22. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Company had loans outstanding to executive
officers, directors and their affiliated companies. Management believes that these loans are made and processed on the same basis
as loans to non-related parties. An analysis of the activity with respect to such aggregate extensions of credit to related parties
is as follows:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. It should be
noted that the design of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain reasonable assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no reasonable assurance that any design of disclosure controls and procedures
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote, but the Company s
principal executive and financial officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are, in
fact, effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

The annual report of management on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report thereon issued by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm are set forth below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting and Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm .

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting 

[Letterhead of First South Bancorp, Inc.] 

Management of First South Bancorp, Inc.
and subsidiary (the Company is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of its published
financial statements as of December 31, 2012, and for the year then ended. The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, as such, include
some amounts that are based on judgments and estimates of management. 

Management of the Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this evaluation
under the framework in INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by COSO, management of the Company has concluded the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. 

Internal control over financial reporting
cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis by internal control over financial reporting. 

Management is also responsible for compliance
with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness which are designated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and
the appropriate state banking regulatory agency. Management assessed its compliance with these designated laws and regulations
relating to safety and soundness and believes that the Company complied with such laws during the year ended December 31, 2012. 

Turlington and Company, L.L.P., an independent

[Letterhead of Turlington and Company,

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 First South Bancorp, Inc. 

 Washington, North Carolina 

We have audited First South Bancorp, Inc.
and Subsidiary s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
First South Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, First South Bancorp, Inc.
and Subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012,
based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of
First South Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary, and our report dated March 29, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion. 

We do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance on management's statement referring to compliance with designated laws and regulations related to safety and
soundness.

notice to the Person required to provide indemnification (the Indemnifying Party promptly after such
Indemnified Party receives written notice of any claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be sought; provided that 
the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this Section 6.3(a) shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under ARTICLE 6 , except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the rights of any
such Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party makes a claim on account of a Loss which may be covered by third party indemnification
or insurance, the Indemnified Party shall undertake diligent and good faith efforts to pursue recovery available under such third
party indemnification or insurance policy and shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of such efforts, but shall
not be required to make any claim or exhaust any remedies under any third party indemnification or insurance policy as a condition
to making a claim under this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; and, if the Indemnifying Party agrees

indemnification provisions under the terms of this Agreement (an Indemnification Claim ), the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying

days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If

Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense,
in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (A) so requested by the Indemnifying Party
to participate or (B) in the written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party that the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate; provided

counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.

judgment unless the third party claimant and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all Liability in
respect of the Indemnification Claim and such other party is not required to make any payment in connection with such settlement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party s willingness to accept the settlement
offer and pay the amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, then the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of
any ultimate Liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder
shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus, without
duplication, the aggregate reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense of such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer, to the extent such fees would
be due and payable pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(A) or (B), and (B) the Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits
or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnification Claim.

such matter.

payment or a recovery from a third party in respect of its Loss after payment has been made under any indemnification provision
of this Agreement in respect of that Loss, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance
payment or third party recovery received by the Indemnified Party (less the Indemnified Party s reasonable costs incurred
to secure such insurance payment or third party recovery) within five (5) business days after such insurance payment or third party

This Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents (including any certificates referred to herein or therein) represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant
to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach

any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right,

Section
7.6 Severability. 

If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms or

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order

This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in

except as provided below. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Buyer
or Seller, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party and

party, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek to enforce its rights under this Agreement in any court of equity by decree
of specific performance, and appropriate injunctive relief may be sought in connection therewith. Such remedy of specific performance
and any and all other remedies provided for in this Agreement shall, except as provided in Section 6.5 , be cumulative in
nature and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies whatsoever that a non-breaching party may otherwise have. 

Section

No past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of

33 

Section
7.12 Litigation
Transition. 

Prior to Closing, Seller
shall deliver written notification to Buyer of (i) the Purchased Assets in litigation including the names, addresses, telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses of all parties involved in such litigation and (ii) all documents related to such litigation. Within
five (5) business days after Closing, Seller shall (i) notify the clerk of the court and all counsel of record involved in such
litigation that ownership of the Purchased Asset in question has been transferred from Seller to Buyer, (ii) through its attorney,
if requested by Buyer and in cooperation with Buyer s attorney, file appropriate pleadings with the court that will (x) substitute
Buyer s attorney for Seller s attorney, and (y) remove Seller as a party to the litigation and substitute Buyer as
the real party in interest. If Seller fails to substitute Buyer s attorney for Seller s attorney or to remove Seller
as a party in interest, then Seller shall pay continued legal expenses in such litigation until such time as the substitution is
effected. In no event shall (i) Buyer be liable for any contingency arrangements of Seller with Seller s attorneys or (ii)
such substitution shall include (or be otherwise construed as) any assumption by Buyer of any Seller Retained Liabilities; provided,
that in the event any settlement or other resolution of litigation involves or creates a Seller Retained Liability, Buyer shall
obtain Seller s prior written consent to such settlement or resolution. For the period from and after the Closing Date, Seller
consents to the engagement by Buyer of counsel to Seller in connection with any litigation or other matter relating to the Purchased
Assets or otherwise, subject to appropriate limitations on the scope of such engagement, an agreement between such counsel and
Seller satisfactory to Seller, and maintenance of the attorney-client privilege as to all communications between the Seller and
such counsel prior to the Closing; provided that (a) no such counsel shall represent either Seller or Buyer in connection with
any dispute under this Agreement or between Seller and Buyer and (b) Buyer agrees that Seller may retain such counsel for any new
matters unrelated to such litigation or other matters. 

Section
7.13 Insurance Policies. 

To the extent the Loan
Documents contain casualty insurance policies, credit life or disability policies, private insurance guarantor policies, or other
similar types of documents (the Policies ), Seller agrees to (a) deliver the original Policies (or if
original Policies are not available, copies of such Policies) to Buyer on or before the Servicing Transfer Date, (b) prior to the
Servicing Transfer Date, notify each of the insurance carriers of the sale of the applicable Loans to Buyer and cause the applicable
insurance carrier to substitute Buyer or its designee as the new loss payee on each of the Policies as of the Closing Date to the
extent required by the terms of each such Policy, and (c) otherwise cooperate with Buyer (at no cost or expense to Buyer) to substitute
Buyer or Buyer s designee as loss payee for any Policies in which the Seller is listed as loss payee as of the Closing Date. 

Section
7.14 Nondisclosure. 

Buyer and Seller agree
to maintain the Purchase Price and the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each Purchased Asset, any non-public information
contained in the Disclosure Schedule, and all negotiations relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as confidential between
the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any party (or its Affiliates) may disclose such confidential
information to its lenders, in the course of its (or its Affiliates normal reporting practices to its (or their) regulators
or direct or indirect owners, or if required by applicable law or regulations, including but not limited to federal securities
laws and regulations, or any rule of any stock exchange (in each case, including pursuant to a registration statement or other
document filed with a governmental authority under applicable law) or if necessary for it to perform any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, all as determined by such party in its discretion. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
shall have the right to (x) disclose to those Persons directly related to the Purchased Assets (for example, Borrowers, guarantors,
title companies, tenants, etc.) that Buyer has purchased the Purchased Assets and shall have the right without the consent of Seller
or any other Person to disclose such confidential information as may be necessary or desirable to inform such Persons that Buyer
is the owner of the Purchased Assets and/or to enforce the related Loan Documents; (y) Buyer and its agents and Affiliates shall
have the right to disclose confidential information that is necessary or desirable in Buyer s opinion to enforce its rights
under the Purchased Assets and related Loan Documents, and (z) Buyer shall have the right to disclose to any potential buyer, lender,
bondholder or rating agency such confidential information as may be necessary or desirable to disclose in connection with a sale,
transfer, secured or unsecured financing or securitization of the Purchased Assets by Buyer or its Affiliates. 

34 

Section
7.15 Further Assurances. 

At any time, and from
time to time hereafter, upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Seller will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, and will cause
to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of
attorney, recordings and assurances as may be reasonably required in order to assign, transfer, grant, convey, assure and confirm
to Buyer, or to permit Buyer to collect and reduce to possession, any or all of the Purchased Assets sold hereunder and to effectuate
and evidence the assignment of judgments related thereto. All instruments relating to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets
pursuant to this Agreement, and all proceedings taken in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be in form and substance mutually satisfactory to Buyer and Seller. 

Section
7.16 Disclosure Schedule. 

Seller has set forth
information on the Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates.
A matter set forth in one section of the Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section so long as its relevance
to such other section of the Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information
disclosed therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and
(b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
by Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.
