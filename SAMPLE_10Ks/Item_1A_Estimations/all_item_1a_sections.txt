1A. RISK FACTORS. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 

WE
ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE
HAVE NOT YET BEGUN GENERATING SIGNIFICANT REVENUES AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF OUR MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER TO CONTINUE
OPERATIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ASSUMING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR CONTINUATION AS A GOING
CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON IMPROVING OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE CONTINUING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF OUR ASSUMPTION
REGARDING IMPROVEMENT OF PROFITABILITY OR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT VALID, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE OUR BUSINESS
PLAN OR CONTINUE OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 FURTHERMORE, THE VALUE OF YOUR SECURITIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY BE AFFECTED OR BECOME WORTHLESS. 

WE
INTEND TO MINT OUR OWN DOTS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT OUR DOTS ARE NOT INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NOT A SECURITY AS DESCRIBED
BY THE SUPREME COURT IN SEC V. W.J. HOWEY CO., 328 U.S. 293 (1946). A PARTICULAR DIGITAL ASSET S STATUS AS A SECURITY 
IN ANY RELEVANT JURISDICTION IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROPERLY CHARACTERIZE OUR DOTS, WE MAY
BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY, INVESTIGATIONS, FINES, AND OTHER PENALTIES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS,
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

THE SEC AND ITS STAFF HAVE TAKEN
THE POSITION THAT CERTAIN CRYPTO ASSETS FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A SECURITY UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.
THE LEGAL TEST FOR DETERMINING WHETHER ANY GIVEN DIGITAL ASSET IS A SECURITY IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX, FACT-DRIVEN ANALYSIS THAT EVOLVES OVER
TIME, AND THE OUTCOME IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE SEC GENERALLY DOES NOT PROVIDE ADVANCE GUIDANCE OR CONFIRMATION ON THE STATUS OF ANY
PARTICULAR DIGITAL ASSET AS A SECURITY. THOUGH THE SEC S STRATEGIC HUB FOR INNOVATION AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHED A FRAMEWORK
FOR ANALYZING WHETHER ANY GIVEN DIGITAL ASSET IS A SECURITY IN APRIL 2019, THIS FRAMEWORK IS ALSO NOT A RULE, REGULATION OR STATEMENT
OF THE SEC AND IS NOT BINDING ON THE SEC. 

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED
DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN CLASSIFYING DIGITAL ASSETS AS SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN DIGITAL ASSETS MAY BE DEEMED TO BE
A SECURITY UNDER THE LAWS OF SOME JURISDICTIONS BUT NOT OTHERS. VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS MAY, IN THE FUTURE, ADOPT
ADDITIONAL LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR DIRECTIVES THAT AFFECT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DIGITAL ASSETS AS SECURITIES. 

THE CLASSIFICATION OF A DIGITAL
ASSET AS A SECURITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAW HAS WIDE-RANGING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THAT FLOW FROM THE OFFER, SALE,
TRADING, AND CLEARING OF SUCH ASSETS. FOR EXAMPLE, A DIGITAL ASSET THAT IS A SECURITY IN THE UNITED STATES MAY GENERALLY ONLY BE OFFERED
OR SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SEC OR IN AN OFFERING THAT QUALIFIES FOR AN EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT. PERSONS THAT EFFECT TRANSACTIONS IN DIGITAL ASSETS THAT ARE SECURITIES
IN THE UNITED STATES MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC AS A BROKER OR DEALER. PLATFORMS THAT BRING
TOGETHER PURCHASERS AND SELLERS TO TRADE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT ARE SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION
AS NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES, OR MUST QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION, SUCH AS BY BEING OPERATED BY A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AS AN ALTERNATIVE
TRADING SYSTEM, OR ATS, IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES FOR ATSS. PERSONS FACILITATING CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO
REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC AS A CLEARING AGENCY. FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS MAY HAVE SIMILAR LICENSING, REGISTRATION, AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. 

WE HAVE INTERNALLY CONDUCTED OUR
OWN ANALYSIS AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DOTS ARE NOT A SECURITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. REGARDLESS OF OUR CONCLUSIONS, WE
COULD BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL OR REGULATORY ACTION IN THE EVENT THE SEC, A FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT
OUR DOT IS A SECURITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. HOWEVER, IF THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING
DIGITAL ASSETS CHANGE, IF WE ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDE THAT OUR DOTS ARE NOT SECURITIES, OUR OPERATIONS WOULD LIKELY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECTED SUCH THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MINT DOTS OR THE SEC, A FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR A COURT DETERMINES THAT OUR
DOTS CONSTITUTES A SECURITY, WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO OFFER OR SELL THE DIGITAL
ASSET IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT, OR FOR ACTING AS A BROKER, DEALER, OR NATIONAL
SECURITIES EXCHANGE WITHOUT APPROPRIATE REGISTRATION IN THE FUTURE. SUCH AN ACTION COULD RESULT IN INJUNCTIONS, CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS,
AS WELL AS CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, FINES, AND DISGORGEMENT, CRIMINAL LIABILITY, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. USERS OF OUR DOTS COULD ALSO
SEEK TO RESCIND OUR SALES TRANSACTIONS ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS CONDUCTED IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT
LIABILITY. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CEASE MINTING AND SELLING OUR DOTS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS,
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MINT OUR OWN DOTS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE HARMED AND THE
VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN US MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSFER
OF COINLLECTIBLES LIMITED, COINLLECTIBLES (HK) LIMITED AND COINLLECTIBLES WEALTH LIMITED TO DR. LEE PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND DR. LEE DATED DECEMBER 15, 2022, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MINTED ANY DOTS, AND ANY DOTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY AS OWNERSHIP
DOCUMENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL ARTWORK OR COLLECTIBLE ARE OBTAINED FROM A THIRD PARTY. 

THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER
THE DOTS WE MINT ARE SECURITIES IS BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE RISK-BASED JUDGMENTS MADE
BY US AND ARE NOT A LEGAL STANDARD NOR ARE THEY BINDING ON ANY REGULATORY BODY OR COURT. 

OUR CURRENT POLICY IS TO PERFORM
A LEGAL ANALYSIS UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS FOR EACH DOT THAT WE MINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH DOT IS A SECURITY. THIS ASSESSMENT
IS BASED ON FACT GATHERING AND A LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT IS INFORMED BY THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF A SECURITY UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES
LAWS, SUPREME COURT DECISIONS APPLYING THE DEFINITION OF SECURITY (E.G., SEC V. W.J. HOWEY CO., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) HOWEY ),
REVES V. ERNST YOUNG (1990)), OTHER JUDICIAL DECISIONS APPLYING THE DEFINITION OF A SECURITY, INCLUDING RECENT COURT RULINGS PERTAINING
TO CRYPTO ASSETS, THE FINHUB FRAMEWORK, AND FACTORS ARTICULATED IN PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SEC, NO-ACTION LETTERS,
AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. 

28 

TO HELP FACILITATE OUR ASSESSMENT
OF WHETHER A CRYPTO ASSET IS MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO BE A SECURITY, WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK USING A POINTS-BASED
RATING SYSTEM CENTERED AROUND FACTUAL QUESTIONS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS EACH OF THE TEST FACTORS ARTICULATED IN HOWEY: (I) WHETHER CRYPTO
PURCHASERS INVESTED MONEY; (II) IN A COMMON ENTERPRISE; (III) WITH A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PROFIT; AND (IV) BASED ON THE EFFORTS OF
OTHERS. AS ADVISED BY FINHUB IN THE LETTER TO THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ON JANUARY 27, 2020 (THE FINHUB
LETTER ), OUR ASSESSMENT SEEKS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, FACTORS ENUMERATED WITHIN THE FINHUB FRAMEWORK, CASE
LAW, AND OTHER GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS OUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF DIGITAL ASSET TECHNOLOGIES. 

OUR FRAMEWORK RECOGNIZES THAT,
IN GENERAL, THE MORE FACTORS THAT ARE IMPLICATED, THE GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A CRYPTO ASSET MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS AN INVESTMENT CONTACT.
WE ALSO WEIGH FACTORS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS IN THAT ASSESSMENT, IN ORDER TO GENERATE A SCALED SCORE. WE BELIEVE
THIS APPROACH ALLOWS US TO MORE METHODICALLY APPLY AND ANALYZE FACTS CONSISTENTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT ASSETS AND ACROSS THE SAME ASSET OVER
TIME. AS INDICATED IN THE FINHUB LETTER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE USE OF OUR FRAMEWORK OR OTHER MODEL INDUSTRY OR STATE BASED FRAMEWORKS
OR WHITELISTS HAS NOT BEEN ENDORSED BY THE SEC OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE APPLICATION OF SECURITIES LAWS
TO THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIGITAL ASSETS MAY BE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND THAT A LISTING DETERMINATION BY US
DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY CONCLUSION UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. FURTHER, OUR RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT IS NOT BINDING ON ANY REGULATOR
OR COURT. 

HOWEVER, IF THE INTERPRETATION
OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING DIGITAL ASSETS CHANGE OR IF WE ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDE THAT OUR DOTS ARE NOT SECURITIES,
OUR OPERATIONS WOULD LIKELY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MINT DOTS OR THE SEC, A FOREIGN
REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR A COURT DETERMINES THAT OUR DOTS CONSTITUTES A SECURITY, WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO OFFER OR SELL THE DIGITAL ASSET IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES
ACT, OR FOR ACTING AS A BROKER, DEALER, OR NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE WITHOUT APPROPRIATE REGISTRATION IN THE FUTURE. SUCH AN ACTION
COULD RESULT IN INJUNCTIONS, CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, AS WELL AS CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, FINES, AND DISGORGEMENT, CRIMINAL LIABILITY,
AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. USERS OF OUR DOTS COULD ALSO SEEK TO RESCIND OUR SALES TRANSACTIONS ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS CONDUCTED IN VIOLATION
OF APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CEASE MINTING AND SELLING OUR DOTS, WHICH
COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MINT OUR OWN DOTS, OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE HARMED AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN US MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSFER OF
COINLLECTIBLES LIMITED, COINLLECTIBLES (HK) LIMITED AND COINLLECTIBLES WEALTH LIMITED TO DR. LEE PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND DR. LEE DATED DECEMBER 15, 2022, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MINTED ANY DOTS, AND ANY DOTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY AS OWNERSHIP
DOCUMENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL ARTWORK OR COLLECTIBLE ARE OBTAINED FROM A THIRD PARTY. 

THERE ARE MATERIAL RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTODIANS OF DOTS 

THE COMPANY USES ITS MULTIPLE
CUSTODIAN SYSTEM TO HOLD DOTS FOR ITS BUSINESS LINE. SUCH CUSTODIANS MAY OR MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. STATE OR FEDERAL
OR NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR OTHER REGULATORY OR SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF
ITS DOTS IN ONE LOCATION OR WITH ONE CUSTODIAN, WHICH MAY BE PRONE TO LOSSES ARISING OUT OF HACKING, LOSS OF PASSWORDS, COMPROMISED ACCESS
CREDENTIALS, MALWARE OR CYBERATTACKS. CUSTODIANS MAY NOT INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ANY LOSSES OF DOTS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO INCUR COSTS RELATED
TO MAINTENANCE OF THE CUSTODIAN SYSTEM. ANY SECURITY BREACH, INCURRED COST OR LOSS OF DOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF A CUSTODIAN COULD
(AS WITH ANY ASSET OF ANY COMPANY) MATERIALLY AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TRADING EXECUTION, THE VALUE OF OUR AND THE VALUE OF ANY INVESTMENT
IN OUR COMMON SHARES. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS, AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE, UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW U.S. AND NON-U.S. LAWS WILL BE APPLIED
WITH RESPECT TO CUSTODY OF DOTS HELD ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A DOT IS, FOR WHATEVER REASON DEEMED AS A FORM OF SECURITY
(WHICH IS UNLIKELY AS A DOT IS MERELY A DIGITAL COPY OF A CONTRACT) U.S.- REGULATED INVESTMENT ADVISERS MAY (THOUGH MOST UNLIKELY) BE
REQUIRED TO KEEP CLIENT FUNDS AND SECURITIES WITH A QUALIFIED CUSTODIAN THERE REMAIN NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THIS RULE, AND HOW TO IDENTIFY A QUALIFIED CUSTODIAN OF, DOTS, WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY KEPT IN A
DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL SECURITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH SUCH RULES WERE WRITTEN. THE UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS QUESTION AND RELATED QUESTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOP AND LAUNCH
OUR BUSINESS LINES. ANY SECURITY BREACH, INCURRED COST OR LOSS OF DOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF A CUSTODIAN COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE EXECUTION OF HEDGING ETPS, THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY S ASSETS AND THE VALUE OF ANY INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON SHARES. 

THE LOSS OR DESTRUCTION
OF MORE THAN HALF OF THE PRIVATE KEYS REQUIRED TO ACCESS A DIGITAL ASSET MAY BE IRREVERSIBLE AND, AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY S LOSS
OF ACCESS TO ITS PRIVATE KEYS OR ITS EXPERIENCE OF A DATA LOSS RELATING TO ITS DOTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

DOTS ARE CONTROLLABLE ONLY BY
THE POSSESSOR OF BOTH THE UNIQUE PUBLIC KEY AND PRIVATE KEY RELATING TO THE LOCAL OR ONLINE DIGITAL WALLET IN WHICH THE DOTS ARE HELD.
THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED BY THE OPERATION OF BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS TO PUBLISH THE PUBLIC KEY RELATING TO A DIGITAL WALLET IN USE WHEN IT
FIRST VERIFIES A SPENDING TRANSACTION FROM THAT DIGITAL WALLET AND DISSEMINATES SUCH INFORMATION INTO THE RESPECTIVE NETWORK. THE COMPANY
SAFEGUARDS AND KEEPS PRIVATE THE PRIVATE KEYS RELATING TO ITS DOTS BY USING ITS SYSTEM WHERE MULTIPLE WALLET HOLDERS, INSTEAD OF A SINGLE
WALLET HOLDER, ARE NEEDED TO APPROVE ANY TRANSACTION. TO THE EXTENT MORE THAN A HALF OF PRIVATE KEYS ARE LOST, DESTROYED OR OTHERWISE
COMPROMISED AND NO BACKUP OF THE PRIVATE KEYS IS ACCESSIBLE, THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE DOTS HELD BY THEM AND THE PRIVATE
KEYS WILL NOT BE CAPABLE OF BEING RESTORED BY THE RESPECTIVE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY LOSS OF PRIVATE KEYS RELATING TO DIGITAL WALLETS
USED TO STORE THE COMPANY S DOTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

29 

THE DOT TRANSACTIONS RELATING
TO THE DIGITAL CONTRACTS UNDERLYING THE FINE ARTS AND COLLECTIBLES ARE IRREVOCABLE, AND STOLEN OR INCORRECTLY TRANSFERRED DOTS MAY BE
IRRETRIEVABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ANY INCORRECTLY EXECUTED DOT TRANSACTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY S
TRANSFERS OF DOTS WILL REGULARLY BE MADE TO OR FROM VARIOUS PARTIES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, THROUGH COMPUTER OR HUMAN ERROR, OR THROUGH
THEFT OR CRIMINAL ACTION, THE COMPANY S DOTS COULD BE TRANSFERRED IN INCORRECT AMOUNTS OR TO UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES. TO THE
EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SEEK A CORRECTIVE TRANSACTION WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY OR IS INCAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING THE THIRD PARTY
WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE COMPANY S DOTS THROUGH ERROR OR THEFT, THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO REVERT OR OTHERWISE RECOVER INCORRECTLY
TRANSFERRED DOTS IN THE ABSENCE OF RELEVANT COURT ORDER FROM A COMPETENT JUDICIAL BODY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SEEK
REDRESS FOR SUCH ERROR OR THEFT, SUCH LOSS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE LIMITED RIGHTS OF LEGAL
RECOURSE AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY S LACK OF INSURANCE PROTECTION, EXPOSES THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS TO THE RISK
OF LOSS OF ITS DOTS FOR WHICH NO PERSON IS LIABLE. 

WHILE THE PHYSICAL ART PIECES
AND COLLECTIBLES STORED IN THE COMPANY S WAREHOUSE ARE INSURED, THE DOTS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN HELD BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE INSURED.
THEREFORE, A LOSS MAY BE SUFFERED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY S DOTS WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND FOR WHICH NO PERSON IS
LIABLE IN DAMAGES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, PLEASE
NOTE THAT THE PHYSICAL ART PIECES ARE STORED IN THE COMPANY S WAREHOUSE AND SUCH ART PIECES ARE INSURED. THE THEORATICAL THEFT OF
A DOT (WHICH IS THE SAME AS STEALING A PDF COPY OF A CONTRACT) DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE ANY ADVERSE EFFECT TO THE PHYSICAL GOODS.
THEORETICALLY, IF A DOT IS INDEED OBTAINED BY ILLEGAL MEANS, THE MAL-ACTOR WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE COURTS TO ENFORCE THE LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER
THE DOT UPON WHICH BONAFIDE OWNERS TO THE PHYSICAL ART PIECES CAN ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS ACCORDINGLY. 

THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RECOVERY IF ITS DOTS ARE LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED. 

IF THE COMPANY S DOTS ARE
LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES RENDERING A PARTY LIABLE TO THE COMPANY, THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL
RESOURCES SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS CLAIM. FOR EXAMPLE, AS TO A PARTICULAR EVENT OF LOSS, THE ONLY SOURCE OF RECOVERY FOR THE COMPANY
MIGHT BE LIMITED, TO THE EXTENT IDENTIFIABLE, OTHER RESPONSIBLE THIRD PARTIES E.G. , A THIEF OR TERRORIST), ANY OF WHICH MAY NOT
HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES (INCLUDING LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE) TO SATISFY A VALID CLAIM BY THE COMPANY. 

DOTS HELD BY THE COMPANY
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FDIC OR SIPC PROTECTIONS. 

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD ITS
DOTS WITH A BANKING INSTITUTION OR A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION FDIC OR THE SECURITIES INVESTOR
PROTECTION CORPORATION SIPC AND, THEREFORE, ITS DOTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROTECTIONS ENJOYED BY DEPOSITORS WITH FDIC
OR SIPC MEMBER INSTITUTIONS. 

WE
FACE SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION AND REGULATORY RISKS. 

AS
AN ENTERPRISE WHOSE BUSINESS LINES INCLUDE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS PAYMENTS MADE IN CRYPTOCURRENCY, WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT
EXTENT ON ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CLIENTS AND ITS REPUTATION FOR INTEGRITY AND HIGH-CALIBER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. AS A RESULT, IF
A CLIENT IS NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICES OR IF THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER CONDUCT, INCLUDING IMPROPER CONDUCT BY ANY OF OUR
PARTNERS, BY PRIVATE LITIGANTS OR REGULATORS, WHETHER THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE TO US, OR IF THERE IS NEGATIVE
PUBLICITY AND PRESS SPECULATION ABOUT US, WHETHER OR NOT VALID, IT MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION AND MAY BE MORE DAMAGING TO US THAN TO BUSINESSES
IN OTHER INDUSTRIES UNRELATED TO THIS SECTOR. 

30 

WITH
REGULATORS STILL ESTABLISHING FRAMEWORKS FOR THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY UTILIZED BY US, AS WELL AS THE PAYMENT MECHANISMS USED, WE MAY
BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT, INCLUDING PERIODIC EXAMINATION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. WE COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF INQUIRIES,
INVESTIGATIONS, SANCTIONS, CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, TERMINATIONS OF LICENSES OR QUALIFICATIONS, LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS BY COUNTERPARTIES,
CLIENTS, OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND REGULATORY AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INCREASED EXPENSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.
RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS, LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE MATTER, IS TIME-CONSUMING
AND EXPENSIVE AND CAN DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR ESTIMATE
UNTIL LATE IN THE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH MAY LAST A NUMBER OF YEARS. 

THE
RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE GREATER FOR COMPANIES IN THE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER AND NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN INDUSTRIES AS IT IS RELATIVELY NEW
AND CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES AND REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO NEED SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
THAT RELY ON SUCH TECHNOLOGIES. 

FURTHERMORE,
WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN POTENTIAL LIABILITIES, SUCH INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER ALL TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF POTENTIAL LIABILITIES
AND IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS EXCLUSIONS AS WELL AS CAPS ON AMOUNTS REFUNDABLE. EVEN IF WE BELIEVE A CLAIM IS COVERED BY INSURANCE, INSURERS
MAY DISPUTE OUR ENTITLEMENT FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE TIMING AND, IF THE INSURERS PREVAIL, THE AMOUNT
OF OUR RECOVERY. ANY CLAIMS OR LITIGATION, EVEN IF FULLY INDEMNIFIED OR INSURED, COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE. 

IF
WE AND/OR ANY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY BELIEVE THAT IT HAS ACCEPTED CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY, OR IS OTHERWISE HOLDINGS ASSETS OF, ANY PERSON
OR ENTITY THAT IS ACTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN VIOLATION OF ANY MONEY LAUNDERING OR CORRUPTION LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, TREATIES,
SANCTIONS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORIST OR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, SUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKER OR SENIOR
FOREIGN POLITICAL FIGURE(S) SUSPECTED IN ENGAGING IN FOREIGN CORRUPTION, WE AND/OR SUCH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY MAY FREEZE THE ASSETS 
OF SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO REPORT AND REMIT OR TRANSFER THOSE ASSETS TO A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. ANY SUCH ACTION
MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE
RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND ANY INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICES PROVIDED
BY THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT OUR USERS. 

WE
RELY ON THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING PAYMENT PROCESSORS, CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES AND DATA
CENTERS THAT PROVIDE FACILITIES, INFRASTRUCTURE, WEBSITE FUNCTIONALITY AND ACCESS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DATABASES AND
DATA CENTER FACILITIES AND CLOUD COMPUTING, WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO OUR INTENDED OPERATIONS. BECAUSE WE INTEND TO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES
TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AND TO FACILITATE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE FACE INCREASED OPERATIONAL RISKS. WE DO NOT CONTROL
THE OPERATION OF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THE THIRD-PARTY REGULATED TRUST AND CUSTODIAN ENTITIES WE WILL USE. THESE THIRD
PARTIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LABOR ISSUES, CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, BREAK-INS, COMPUTER VIRUSES, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE
ATTACKS, SABOTAGE, ACTS OF VANDALISM, PRIVACY BREACHES, SERVICE TERMINATIONS, DISRUPTIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT. THEY
ARE ALSO VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM HUMAN ERROR, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FIRES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES,
HURRICANES, TORNADOES, PANDEMICS (INCLUDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC) AND SIMILAR EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY BREACH THEIR
AGREEMENTS WITH US, DISAGREE WITH OUR INTERPRETATION OF CONTRACT TERMS OR APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, REFUSE TO CONTINUE OR RENEW
THESE AGREEMENTS ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, FAIL OR REFUSE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES ADEQUATELY,
TAKE ACTIONS THAT DEGRADE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVICES, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS OR REQUIREMENTS ON US OR OUR CUSTOMERS, OR GIVE
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO COMPETITORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL PROVIDE SERVICES TO US OR TO OUR USERS
WILL DO SO ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF ANY THIRD PARTIES DO NOT ADEQUATELY OR APPROPRIATELY PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES OR PERFORM
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO US OR OUR USERS, SUCH AS IF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS CLOSE THEIR DATA CENTER FACILITIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE
NOTICE, ARE UNABLE TO RESTORE OPERATIONS AND DATA, FAIL TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED, OR EXPERIENCE OTHER UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, WE MAY BE
UNABLE TO PROCURE ALTERNATIVES IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS
DISRUPTIONS, LOSSES OR COSTS TO REMEDIATE ANY OF THE DEFICIENCIES, USER DISSATISFACTION, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS,
OR OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
ARE INDEBTED TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF US 683,588. 

AS
OF DECEMBER 31, 2021, WE ARE INDEBTED TO COMPANIES BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY LEE YING CHIU HERBERT, OUR DIRECTOR AND SHAREHOLDER, IN AN AMOUNT
OF 410,558, AND CHAN MAN CHUNG, OUR CEO, CFO, SECRETARY AND DIRECTOR, IN AN AMOUNT OF 273,030. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT
CASH FLOW TO REPAY THESE LOANS. IF WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES AS REPAYMENT, OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION.
THE ADVANCES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE REPAYABLE WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, LOAN REPAYMENT BEFORE ACHIEVEMENT OF PROFITABILITY
MAY CAUSE US TO DELAY IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS PLANS TO EXPAND. 

31 

WE
ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT AFFECT MANY OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING: 

INCREASING
 COSTS, THE VOLATILITY OF COSTS AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER LEGAL MANDATES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, ESPECIALLY PENSION AND HEALTHCARE
 BENEFITS; 

THE
 INCREASING COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY MANDATES (INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES
 ACT) AND DEFENDING AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE OR UNJUSTIFIED ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER ACTIONS BY SUCH AGENCIES; 

THE
 IMPACT OF ANY INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS ON THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES IN GENERAL, THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY OR US IN PARTICULAR,
 AND WHAT EFFECTS THESE EVENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR COSTS OR THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES; 

ANY
 IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS RESULTING FROM NEW DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATION; 

MARKET
 ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW SERVICE AND GROWTH INITIATIVES; 

THE
 IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS ON OUR OPERATIONS AND ON DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES; 

GOVERNMENTAL
 UNDER-INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR SERVICE LEVELS DUE TO
 TRAFFIC CONGESTION OR SUB-OPTIMAL ROUTING OF OUR VEHICLES; 

WIDESPREAD
 OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS OR ANY OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS; 

AVAILABILITY
 OF FINANCING ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF
 OUR OPERATIONS; 

THE
 IMPACT OF CYBERATTACKS AND SECURITY BREACHES ON OUR PLATFORM, OUR CRYPTO WALLETS OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS; 

ANY
 IMPACTS ON OUR CRYPTO ASSETS OR CUSTOMER ASSETS DUE TO THE IMPROPER TREATMENT OF THE CRYPTO WALLETS, OR THE FAILURE OF THE CRYPTO
 STORAGE SYSTEM ON OUR PLATFORM OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS; 

CHANGES IN MARKET SENTIMENTS
 TOWARDS DIGITAL ASSETS AND CRYPTO; 

THE
 IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS DUE TO THE SYSTEM FAILURE OF OUR PLATFORM OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS; 

ANY
 IMPACTS ON THE VALUE OF OUR CRYPTO ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE VOLATILE CHANGES IN CRYPTO PRICES; 

OUR
 ABILITY TO ATTRACT, MAINTAIN, AND GROW OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND ENGAGE OUR CUSTOMERS; 

PRICING
 FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; 

OUR
 ABILITY TO DIVERSIFY AND GROW OUR SERVICES REVENUE; 

CHANGES
 IN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS; 

ADVERSE
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING AND ENFORCEMENT-RELATED COSTS; 

OUR
 ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENT; AND 

OUR
 ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS. 

IF
WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF OUR TRADE SECRETS, OUR BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION WOULD BE HARMED. 

WE
MAY RELY ON TRADE SECRETS, INCLUDING UNPATENTED KNOW-HOW, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.
HOWEVER, TRADE SECRETS ARE DIFFICULT TO PROTECT. WE LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF SUCH TRADE SECRETS WHERE POSSIBLE BUT WE ALSO SEEK TO PROTECT
THESE TRADE SECRETS, IN PART, BY ENTERING INTO NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH PARTIES WHO DO HAVE ACCESS TO THEM,
SUCH AS OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, CONSULTANTS, ADVISORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ANY OF THESE PARTIES
MAY BREACH THE AGREEMENTS AND MAY UNINTENTIONALLY OR WILLFULLY DISCLOSE OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING OUR TRADE SECRETS, AND
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE REMEDIES FOR SUCH BREACHES. ENFORCING A CLAIM THAT A PARTY ILLEGALLY DISCLOSED OR MISAPPROPRIATED
A TRADE SECRET IS DIFFICULT, EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING, AND THE OUTCOME IS UNPREDICTABLE. IN ADDITION, SOME COURTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES ARE LESS WILLING OR UNWILLING TO PROTECT TRADE SECRETS. MOREOVER, IF ANY OF OUR TRADE SECRETS WERE TO BE LAWFULLY OBTAINED
OR INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED BY A COMPETITOR, WE WOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO PREVENT THEM, OR THOSE TO WHOM THEY COMMUNICATE IT, FROM USING
THAT TECHNOLOGY OR INFORMATION TO COMPETE WITH US. IF ANY OF OUR TRADE SECRETS WERE TO BE DISCLOSED TO OR INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED BY
A COMPETITOR, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WOULD BE HARMED. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR FINANCES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

WE
WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED, WHICH WOULD FORCE US TO DELAY ANY BUSINESS EXPANSIONS OR
ACQUISITIONS. 

OUR
BUSINESS PLAN CONTEMPLATES THE EXPANSION OF OUR LOGISTICS AND DELIVERY OPERATIONS THROUGH ORGANIC MEANS AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS
IN ADDITIONAL COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. WHILE WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMITMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO ANY
OF THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS, WE DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE EXPANSION OR ACQUISITION NEEDS. WE EXPECT
TO FINANCE SUCH FUTURE CASH NEEDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OFFERINGS, DEBT FINANCINGS OR CORPORATE COLLABORATION AND LICENSING
ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING
WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY, REDUCE THE SCOPE
OF OR ELIMINATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS. 

32 

RAISING
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY CAUSE DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS, RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS OR REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. 

UNTIL
SUCH TIME, IF EVER, AS WE CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY OFFERINGS,
DEBT FINANCINGS, GRANTS AND LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COLLABORATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL
CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, YOUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST WILL BE DILUTED, AND THE TERMS OF THESE SECURITIES
MAY INCLUDE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER PREFERENCES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. DEBT FINANCING AND PREFERRED EQUITY
FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE, MAY INVOLVE AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE COVENANTS LIMITING OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTIONS,
SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR DECLARING DIVIDENDS. 

IF
WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD
PARTIES, WE MAY HAVE TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES, FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS, RESEARCH PROGRAMS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES
OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FAVORABLE TO US. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS
WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY, LIMIT, REDUCE OR TERMINATE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR FUTURE COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS OR GRANT
RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE PREFER TO DEVELOP AND MARKET OURSELVES. 

RISKS
RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS IN HONG KONG 

WE
FACE THE RISK THAT CHANGES IN THE POLICIES OF THE PRC GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE BUSINESS WE MAY BE ABLE TO
CONDUCT IN HONG KONG AND THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESS. 

WE
CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AND GENERATE OUR REVENUE IN HONG KONG. ACCORDINGLY, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRC WILL
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS. THE PRC ECONOMY IS IN TRANSITION FROM A
PLANNED ECONOMY TO A MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY SUBJECT TO PLANS ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT SET NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS.
POLICIES OF THE PRC GOVERNMENT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE PRC. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRC WILL CONTINUE
TO STRENGTHEN ITS ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND THAT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PRC WILL CONTINUE TO
FOLLOW MARKET FORCES, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. OUR INTERESTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES
IN POLICIES BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING: 

CHANGES

SUBSTANTIAL
UNCERTAINTIES AND RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE PRC GOVERNMENT AND PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE BUSINESS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONDUCT IN THE PRC AND ACCORDINGLY ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

OUR
BUSINESS OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT AND FUTURE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE PRC. THE PRC GOVERNMENT HAS EXERCISED
AND CONTINUES TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER VIRTUALLY EVERY SECTOR OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY THROUGH REGULATION AND STATE OWNERSHIP.
WE EXPECT THE HONG KONG LEGAL SYSTEM TO RAPIDLY EVOLVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND MAY BECOME CLOSER ALIGNED WITH LEGAL SYSTEM IN CHINA WITH
THE PRC GOVERNMENT EXERTING MORE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER COMPANIES OPERATING IN HONG KONG, OFFERINGS CONDUCTED OVERSEAS AND OR FOREIGN
INVESTMENT IN HONG KONG BASED ISSUERS. THE INTERPRETATIONS OF MANY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY NOT ALWAYS BE UNIFORM AND THE ENFORCEMENT
OF THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY INVOLVE UNCERTAINTIES FOR YOU AND US. OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN HONG KONG, CONDUCT OVERSEAS
OFFERINGS AND CONTINUE TO INVESTMENT IN HONG KONG BASED ISSUERS MAY BE HARMED BY THESE CHANGES IN ITS LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING
THOSE RELATING TO TAXATION, IMPORT AND EXPORT TARIFFS, HEALTHCARE REGULATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LAND USE AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
RIGHTS, AND OTHER MATTERS. ACCORDINGLY, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING ANY DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT RECENT ECONOMIC
REFORMS AND TO RETURN TO A MORE CENTRALLY PLANNED ECONOMY OR REGIONAL OR LOCAL VARIATIONS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES,
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN HONG KONG OR PARTICULAR REGIONS THEREOF, AND COULD LIMIT OR COMPLETELY HINDER
OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OR CONTINUE TO OFFER SECURITIES TO INVESTORS OR REQUIRE US TO DIVEST OURSELVES OF ANY INTEREST WE THEN HOLD IN HONG
KONG PROPERTIES OR JOINT VENTURES. ANY SUCH ACTIONS (INCLUDING DIVESTURE OR SIMILAR ACTIONS) COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
ON US AND ON YOUR INVESTMENT IN US AND COULD RENDER OUR SECURITIES AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES WORTHLESS.

THERE
ARE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS, OR THE ENFORCEMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BORROWERS IN
THE EVENT OF THE IMPOSITION OF STATUTORY LIENS, DEATH, BANKRUPTCY OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. ONLY AFTER 1979 DID THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
BEGIN TO PROMULGATE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF LAWS THAT REGULATE ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN GENERAL, DEAL WITH ECONOMIC MATTERS SUCH AS FOREIGN
INVESTMENT, CORPORATE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE, COMMERCE, TAXATION AND TRADE, AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA. ALTHOUGH
THE INFLUENCE OF THE LAW HAS BEEN INCREASING, CHINA HAS NOT DEVELOPED A FULLY INTEGRATED LEGAL SYSTEM AND RECENTLY ENACTED LAWS AND REGULATIONS
MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY COVER ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN CHINA. ALSO, BECAUSE THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE RELATIVELY NEW,
AND BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED VOLUME OF PUBLISHED CASES AND THEIR LACK OF FORCE AS PRECEDENTS, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LAWS
AND REGULATIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES. NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT EXISTING AND PROPOSED FUTURE BUSINESSES MAY ALSO
BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN CONSTANT CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS
IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THE RAPIDLY CHANGING SOCIETY AND ECONOMY IN CHINA. BECAUSE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND COURTS THAT PROVIDE INTERPRETATIONS
OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND DECIDE CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES AND ISSUES MAY CHANGE THEIR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT VERY RAPIDLY WITH LITTLE
ADVANCE NOTICE AT ANY TIME, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF CHINESE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO EITHER BUSINESSES
WITH FOREIGN INVESTMENT OR THE EFFECTIVENESS ON ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN CHINA. THE UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING NEW LAWS AND
REGULATIONS AND CHANGES OF EXISTING LAWS, MAY CAUSE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS TO FOREIGN INVESTORS. 

ALTHOUGH
THE PRC GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PURSUING ECONOMIC REFORM POLICIES FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES, THE PRC GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT
CONTROL OVER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE PRC THROUGH THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, CONTROLLING PAYMENTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY, SETTING MONETARY
POLICY AND IMPOSING POLICIES THAT IMPACT PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE
TO PURSUE POLICIES FAVORING A MARKET ORIENTED ECONOMY OR THAT EXISTING POLICIES WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED, ESPECIALLY IN THE
EVENT OF A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP, SOCIAL OR POLITICAL DISRUPTION, OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE
IN THE PRC. 

THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT EXERTS SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES . WE ARE
CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO LIST ON U.S. EXCHANGES. HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT EXERTS MORE CONTROL OVER OFFERINGS CONDUCTED OVERSEAS AND/OR FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA-BASED ISSUERS OVER TIME AND IF OUR
PRC SUBSIDIARIES OR THE HOLDING COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL IN THE FUTURE AND WERE DENIED PERMISSION FROM CHINESE AUTHORITIES
TO LIST ON U.S. EXCHANGES, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE LISTING ON U.S. EXCHANGE AND THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY SIGNIFICANTLY
DECLINE OR BECOME WORTHLESS, WHICH WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE INTEREST OF THE INVESTORS. 

THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS EXERCISED AND CONTINUES TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER VIRTUALLY EVERY SECTOR OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY THROUGH
REGULATION AND STATE OWNERSHIP. OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN HONG KONG MAY BE HARMED BY CHANGES IN ITS LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE
RELATING TO TAXATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LAND USE RIGHTS, PROPERTY AND OTHER MATTERS. THE CENTRAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THESE
JURISDICTIONS MAY IMPOSE NEW, STRICTER REGULATIONS OR INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES
AND EFFORTS ON OUR PART TO ENSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS OR INTERPRETATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE,
INCLUDING ANY DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT RECENT ECONOMIC REFORMS AND TO RETURN TO A MORE CENTRALLY PLANNED ECONOMY OR REGIONAL
OR LOCAL VARIATIONS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CHINA OR PARTICULAR
REGIONS THEREOF, AND COULD REQUIRE US TO DIVEST OURSELVES OF ANY INTEREST WE THEN HOLD IN CHINESE PROPERTIES. 

FOR
EXAMPLE, THE CHINESE CYBERSECURITY REGULATOR ANNOUNCED ON JULY 2 THAT IT HAD BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION OF DIDI GLOBAL INC. (NYSE: DIDI)
AND TWO DAYS LATER ORDERED THAT THE COMPANY S APP BE REMOVED FROM SMARTPHONE APP STORES. 

AS
SUCH, THE COMPANY S BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY INTERFERENCE IN THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
THEY OPERATE. THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS POLITICAL AND REGULATORY ENTITIES, INCLUDING VARIOUS LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL
AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT SUB-DIVISIONS. THE COMPANY MAY INCUR INCREASED COSTS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING AND NEWLY ADOPTED LAWS
AND REGULATIONS OR PENALTIES FOR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY. THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
BY EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO ITS BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY. GIVEN THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MAY INTERVENE OR INFLUENCE
OUR OPERATIONS AT ANY TIME, IT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR OPERATION AND THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. GIVEN RECENT STATEMENTS
BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT INDICATING AN INTENT TO EXERT MORE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER OFFERINGS THAT ARE CONDUCTED OVERSEAS, ANY SUCH
ACTION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OR COMPLETELY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OR CONTINUE TO OFFER SECURITIES TO INVESTORS AND CAUSE THE
VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE OR BE WORTHLESS. 

FURTHERMORE,
IT IS UNCERTAIN WHEN AND WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM THE PRC GOVERNMENT TO LIST ON U.S. EXCHANGES
IN THE FUTURE, AND EVEN WHEN SUCH PERMISSION IS OBTAINED, WHETHER IT WILL BE DENIED OR RESCINDED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY NOT
REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM ANY OF THE PRC FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO OBTAIN SUCH PERMISSION AND HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY DENIAL
TO LIST ON THE U.S. EXCHANGE, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
RELATING TO ITS BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE IN VALUE DRAMATICALLY OR EVEN BECOME WORTHLESS SHOULD
WE BECOME SUBJECT TO NEW REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM THE PRC GOVERNMENT TO LIST ON U.S. EXCHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

RECENTLY,
THE GENERAL OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND THE GENERAL OFFICE OF THE STATE COUNCIL JOINTLY ISSUED
THE OPINIONS ON SEVERE AND LAWFUL CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL SECURITIES ACTIVITIES, WHICH WERE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON JULY 6, 2021.
THESE OPINIONS EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE ADMINISTRATION OVER ILLEGAL SECURITIES ACTIVITIES AND THE SUPERVISION ON OVERSEAS
LISTINGS BY CHINA-BASED COMPANIES. THESE OPINIONS PROPOSED TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES, SUCH AS PROMOTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF RELEVANT
REGULATORY SYSTEMS, TO DEAL WITH THE RISKS AND INCIDENTS FACING CHINA-BASED OVERSEAS-LISTED COMPANIES AND THE DEMAND FOR CYBERSECURITY
AND DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION. MOREOVER, THE STATE INTERNET INFORMATION OFFICE ISSUED THE MEASURES OF CYBERSECURITY REVIEW (REVISED DRAFT
FOR COMMENTS, NOT YET EFFECTIVE) ON JULY 10, 2021, WHICH REQUIRE OPERATORS WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MORE THAN 1 MILLION USERS
WHO WANT TO LIST ABROAD TO FILE A CYBERSECURITY REVIEW WITH THE OFFICE OF CYBERSECURITY REVIEW. THE AFOREMENTIONED POLICIES AND ANY RELATED
IMPLEMENTATION RULES TO BE ENACTED MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS
ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS, AS THESE OPINIONS WERE RECENTLY ISSUED, OFFICIAL GUIDANCE AND INTERPRETATION OF THE OPINIONS REMAIN UNCLEAR
IN SEVERAL RESPECTS AT THIS TIME. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL REMAIN FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
OF THESE OPINIONS OR ANY FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION RULES ON A TIMELY BASIS, OR AT ALL. 

THE
HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT REQUIRES THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (PCAOB) TO BE PERMITTED TO INSPECT THE
ISSUER S PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM WITHIN THREE YEARS. THIS THREE-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE SHORTENED TO TWO YEARS IF THE ACCELERATING HOLDING
FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT IS ENACTED. THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES UNDER THE PRC SECURITIES LAW RELATING TO THE PROCEDURES AND REQUISITE
TIMING FOR THE U.S. SECURITIES REGULATORY AGENCIES TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND COLLECT EVIDENCE WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF THE PRC. IF
THE U.S. SECURITIES REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE UNABLE TO CONDUCT SUCH INVESTIGATIONS, THEY MAY SUSPEND OR DE-REGISTER OUR REGISTRATION WITH
THE SEC AND DELIST OUR SECURITIES FROM APPLICABLE TRADING MARKET WITHIN THE US. 

THE
HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT (HFCAA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 18, 2020, AND REQUIRES AUDITORS OF PUBLICLY TRADED
COMPANIES TO SUBMIT TO REGULAR INSPECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS TO ASSESS SUCH AUDITORS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.
ON JUNE 22, 2021, THE U.S. SENATE PASSED THE ACCELERATING HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT WHICH, IF PASSED BY THE U.S. HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SIGNED INTO LAW, WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE NON-INSPECTION YEARS REQUIRED FOR TRIGGERING THE PROHIBITIONS
UNDER THE HFCAA FROM THREE YEARS TO TWO. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2021, THE PCAOB ADOPTED RULES TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE PCAOB TO USE WHEN
DETERMINING, AS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE HFCAA, WHETHER IT IS UNABLE TO INSPECT OR INVESTIGATE COMPLETELY REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRMS LOCATED IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF A POSITION TAKEN BY ONE OR MORE AUTHORITIES IN THAT JURISDICTION. ON DECEMBER 2, 2021,
THE SEC ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO FINALIZE RULES IMPLEMENTING THE SUBMISSION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN THE HFCAA. THE RULES APPLY TO
REGISTRANTS THAT THE SEC IDENTIFIES AS HAVING FILED AN ANNUAL REPORT WITH AN AUDIT REPORT ISSUED BY A REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
THAT IS LOCATED IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION AND THAT THE PCAOB IS UNABLE TO INSPECT OR INVESTIGATE COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF A POSITION TAKEN
BY AN AUTHORITY IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION. ON DECEMBER 16, 2021, THE PCAOB ISSUED A REPORT ON ITS DETERMINATIONS THAT IT IS UNABLE TO
INSPECT OR INVESTIGATE COMPLETELY PCAOB-REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS HEADQUARTERED IN CHINA AND IN HONG KONG BECAUSE OF POSITIONS
TAKEN BY PRC AND HONG KONG AUTHORITIES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. THE PCAOB HAS MADE SUCH DESIGNATIONS AS MANDATED UNDER THE HFCAA. PURSUANT
TO EACH ANNUAL DETERMINATION BY THE PCAOB, THE SEC WILL, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, IDENTIFY ISSUERS THAT HAVE USED NON-INSPECTED AUDIT FIRMS
AND THUS ARE AT RISK OF SUCH SUSPENSIONS IN THE FUTURE. 

OUR
AUDITOR IS BASED IN KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA AND IS SUBJECT TO PCAOB INSPECTION. IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE DETERMINATIONS ANNOUNCED BY THE
PCAOB ON DECEMBER 16, 2021. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THE MALAYSIAN AUTHORITIES SUBSEQUENTLY TAKE A POSITION DISALLOWING THE PCAOB TO INSPECT
OUR AUDITOR, THEN WE WOULD NEED TO CHANGE OUR AUDITOR. 

ON AUGUST 26, 2022, THE CHINA
SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION, OR CSRC, THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE OF THE PRC, AND THE PCAOB SIGNED A STATEMENT OF PROTOCOL, OR THE PROTOCOL,
GOVERNING INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF AUDIT FIRMS BASED IN CHINA AND HONG KONG. PURSUANT TO THE PROTOCOL, THE PCAOB SHALL HAVE INDEPENDENT
DISCRETION TO SELECT ANY ISSUER AUDITS FOR INSPECTION OR INVESTIGATION AND HAS THE UNFETTERED ABILITY TO TRANSFER INFORMATION TO THE SEC. 

ON DECEMBER 15, 2022, THE
PCAOB DETERMINED THAT THE PCAOB WAS ABLE TO SECURE COMPLETE ACCESS TO INSPECT AND INVESTIGATE REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS HEADQUARTERED
IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG AND VOTED TO VACATE ITS PREVIOUS DETERMINATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. HOWEVER, SHOULD PRC AUTHORITIES OBSTRUCT
OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO FACILITATE THE PCAOB S ACCESS IN THE FUTURE, THE PCAOB WILL CONSIDER THE NEED TO ISSUE A NEW DETERMINATION.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE EVENT IT IS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE PCAOB IS UNABLE TO INSPECT OR INVESTIGATE COMPLETELY OUR AUDITOR,
THEN SUCH LACK OF INSPECTION COULD CAUSE OUR SECURITIES TO BE DELISTED FROM THE STOCK EXCHANGE. 

ON JUNE 22, 2021, THE U.S.
SENATE PASSED THE ACCELERATING HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT AND ON DECEMBER 29, 2022, THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHICH CONTAINED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN IDENTICAL PROVISION TO ACCELERATING HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES
ACCOUNTABLE ACT AND AMENDED THE HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE ACT BY REQUIRING THE SEC TO PROHIBIT AN ISSUER S SECURITIES
FROM TRADING ON ANY U.S. STOCK EXCHANGES IF ITS AUDITOR IS NOT SUBJECT TO PCAOB INSPECTIONS FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS INSTEAD OF THREE,
THUS REDUCING THE TIME BEFORE OUR ORDINARY SHARES MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM TRADING OR DELISTED. 

THE DELISTING OF OUR ORDINARY
SHARES, OR THE THREAT OF THEIR BEING DELISTED, MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 

THE SEC IS ASSESSING HOW
TO IMPLEMENT OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE HFCAA, INCLUDING THE LISTING AND TRADING PROHIBITION REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
IN RESPECT OF INCREASING U.S. REGULATORY ACCESS TO AUDIT INFORMATION ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RULE-MAKING PROCESS AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. 

WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN DIALOGUE AMONG THE CSRC, THE SEC
AND THE PCAOB REGARDING THE INSPECTION OF PCAOB-REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRMS IN MAINLAND CHINA, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL
BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY U.S. REGULATORS IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO CURRENT POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN
MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG, OR IF ANY COMPONENT OF OUR AUDITOR S WORK PAPERS BECOME LOCATED IN MAINLAND CHINA IN THE FUTURE. DELISTING
OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES LIKELY WOULD FORCE HOLDERS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES TO SELL THEIR ORDINARY SHARES. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY
SHARES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF ANTICIPATED NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THESE EXECUTIVE OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS UPON, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THESE EXECUTIVE OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND REGARDLESS OF OUR ACTUAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE. 

35 

ADVERSE
REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REVIEW, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATORY
SCRUTINY TO BE ADOPTED BY THE SEC IN RESPONSE TO RISKS RELATED TO RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE
REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES LIKE US WITH SIGNIFICANT CHINA-BASED OPERATIONS, ALL OF WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUBJECT
US TO ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. 

THE
RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON CHINA-BASED COMPANIES RAISING CAPITAL OFFSHORE,
MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REVIEW IN CHINA OVER OUR FINANCING AND CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION,
WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE ADOPTED BY THE RELEVANT PRC AUTHORITIES, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING
OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS, RESTRICTING THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA, OR CAUSING THE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS
IN CHINA ENTIRELY, ALL OF WHICH WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE
MAY HAVE TO ADJUST, MODIFY, OR COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO ADVERSE REGULATORY CHANGES OR POLICY DEVELOPMENTS,
AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ANY REMEDIAL ACTION ADOPTED BY US CAN BE COMPLETED IN A TIMELY, COST-EFFICIENT, OR LIABILITY-FREE MANNER
OR AT ALL. 

ON
JULY 30, 2021, IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA AND ACTIONS ADOPTED BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT, THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE SEC ISSUED A STATEMENT ASKING THE SEC STAFF TO SEEK ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FROM OFFSHORE ISSUERS ASSOCIATED WITH CHINA-BASED OPERATING
COMPANIES BEFORE THEIR REGISTRATION STATEMENTS WILL BE DECLARED EFFECTIVE, INCLUDING DETAILED DISCLOSURE RELATED TO WHETHER THE ISSUER
RECEIVED OR WERE DENIED PERMISSION FROM CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO LIST ON U.S. EXCHANGES AND THE RISKS THAT SUCH APPROVAL COULD BE DENIED
OR RESCINDED. ON AUGUST 1, 2021, THE CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION STATED IN A STATEMENT THAT IT HAD TAKEN NOTE OF THE NEW DISCLOSURE
REQUIREMENTS ANNOUNCED BY THE SEC REGARDING THE LISTINGS OF CHINESE COMPANIES AND THE RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA, AND THAT
BOTH COUNTRIES SHOULD STRENGTHEN COMMUNICATIONS ON REGULATING CHINA-RELATED ISSUERS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT
TO TIGHTENED REGULATORY REVIEW AND WE COULD BE EXPOSED TO GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN CHINA. 

WE
MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES UNDER THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, AND ANY DETERMINATION THAT WE VIOLATED THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES
ACT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICE ACT FCPA ), AND OTHER LAWS THAT PROHIBIT IMPROPER PAYMENTS OR OFFERS OF PAYMENTS
TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BY U.S. PERSONS AND ISSUERS AS DEFINED BY THE STATUTE FOR THE PURPOSE
OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS. WE WILL HAVE OPERATIONS, AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND MAKE SALES IN HONG KONG, WHICH MAY EXPERIENCE
CORRUPTION. OUR PROPOSED ACTIVITIES MAY CREATE THE RISK OF UNAUTHORIZED PAYMENTS OR OFFERS OF PAYMENTS BY ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS,
OR SALES AGENTS OF OUR COMPANY, BECAUSE THESE PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS SUBJECT TO OUR CONTROL. IT WILL BE OUR POLICY TO IMPLEMENT SAFEGUARDS
TO DISCOURAGE THESE PRACTICES BY OUR EMPLOYEES. ALSO, OUR EXISTING PRACTICES AND ANY FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS MAY PROVE TO BE LESS THAN EFFECTIVE,
AND THE EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, OR SALES AGENTS OF OUR COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN CONDUCT FOR WHICH WE MIGHT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. VIOLATIONS
OF THE FCPA MAY RESULT IN SEVERE CRIMINAL OR CIVIL SANCTIONS, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT
OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MAY SEEK TO HOLD OUR COMPANY LIABLE FOR SUCCESSOR
LIABILITY FCPA VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST OR THAT WE ACQUIRE. 

PRC
REGULATION OF LOANS TO AND DIRECT INVESTMENT IN PRC ENTITIES BY OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CURRENCY CONVERSION
MAY DELAY OR PREVENT US FROM USING THE PROCEEDS WE RECEIVE FROM OFFSHORE FINANCING ACTIVITIES TO MAKE LOANS TO OR MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND AND EXPAND
BUSINESS. 

ANY
TRANSFER OF FUNDS BY US TO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES, EITHER AS A SHAREHOLDER LOAN OR AS AN INCREASE IN REGISTERED CAPITAL, MAY BECOME
SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY OR REGISTRATION OR FILING WITH RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN CHINA. ACCORDING TO THE RELEVANT PRC REGULATIONS
ON FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES IN CHINA, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO PRC SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF OR FILING WITH THE
MINISTRY OF COMMERCE IN ITS LOCAL BRANCHES AND REGISTRATION WITH A LOCAL BANK AUTHORIZED BY SAFE. IT IS UNCLEAR IF HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES
WILL BE DEEMED A PRC SUBSIDIARY. IF HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEEMED TO BE PRC SUBSIDIARIES, (I) ANY FOREIGN LOAN PROCURED BY OUR
HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED WITH SAFE OR ITS LOCAL BRANCHES OR FILED WITH SAFE IN ITS INFORMATION SYSTEM;
AND (II) OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROCURE LOANS WHICH EXCEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR TOTAL INVESTMENT
AMOUNT AND REGISTERED CAPITAL OR, AS AN ALTERNATIVE, ONLY PROCURE LOANS SUBJECT TO THE CALCULATION APPROACH AND LIMITATION AS PROVIDED
IN THE PEOPLE S BANK OF CHINA NOTICE NO. 9 PBOC NOTICE NO. 9 ). WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE GOVERNMENT
APPROVALS OR COMPLETE SUCH REGISTRATIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS, IF AT ALL, WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR FOREIGN LOANS
BY US TO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES, IF REQUIRED. IF WE FAIL TO RECEIVE SUCH APPROVALS OR COMPLETE SUCH REGISTRATION OR FILING, OUR ABILITY
TO USE THE PROCEEDS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR OFFSHORE FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND TO CAPITALIZE OUR HONG KONG OPERATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED,
WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO FUND AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. THERE IS, IN EFFECT, NO STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE
AMOUNT OF CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION THAT WE CAN MAKE TO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT
OF REGISTERED CAPITAL FOR OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES, AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES
BY SUBSCRIBING FOR THEIR INITIAL REGISTERED CAPITAL AND INCREASED REGISTERED CAPITAL, PROVIDED THAT THE HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES COMPLETE
THE RELEVANT FILING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

THE
CIRCULAR ON REFORMING THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SETTLEMENT OF CAPITAL OF FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES, OR SAFE CIRCULAR
19, EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 1, 2015, AS AMENDED BY CIRCULAR OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON REFORMING AND REGULATING
POLICIES ON THE CONTROL OVER FOREIGN EXCHANGE SETTLEMENT UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT, OR SAFE CIRCULAR 16, EFFECTIVE ON JUNE 9, 2016,
ALLOWS FIES TO SETTLE THEIR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CAPITAL AT THEIR DISCRETION, BUT CONTINUES TO PROHIBIT FIES FROM USING THE RENMINBI FUND
CONVERTED FROM THEIR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CAPITALS FOR EXPENDITURE BEYOND THEIR BUSINESS SCOPES, AND ALSO PROHIBIT FIES FROM USING SUCH RENMINBI
FUND TO PROVIDE LOANS TO PERSONS OTHER THAN AFFILIATES UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED UNDER ITS BUSINESS SCOPE. IF SAFE CIRCULARS 16 AND
19 ARE INTERPRETED TO APPLY TO THE HONG KONG DOLLAR, OUR ABILITY TO USE HONG KONG DOLLARS CONVERTED FROM THE NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR OFFSHORE
FINANCING ACTIVITIES TO FUND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW ENTITIES IN HONG KONG, TO INVEST IN OR ACQUIRE ANY OTHER HONG KONG OR PRC COMPANIES
MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

BECAUSE
OUR HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE CREATES RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS LIMITED. 

WE
ARE A HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY ASSETS ARE OUR OWNERSHIP OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE CONDUCT NO OTHER BUSINESS
AND, AS A RESULT, WE DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON OUR SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW. IF WE DECIDE IN THE FUTURE TO PAY DIVIDENDS,
AS A HOLDING COMPANY, OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND MEET OTHER OBLIGATIONS DEPENDS UPON THE RECEIPT OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHER PAYMENTS
FROM OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES. OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND PROJECTS MAY BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS
OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER FUNDS TO US PRIOR TO THE SATISFACTION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES OR DEBT
SERVICE, APPROPRIATION TO RESERVES PRESCRIBED BY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, COVERING LOSSES IN PREVIOUS YEARS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONVERSION
OF LOCAL CURRENCY INTO U.S. DOLLARS OR OTHER HARD CURRENCY, COMPLETION OF RELEVANT PROCEDURES WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR BANKS
AND OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS. UNDER THE APPLICABLE PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS, FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES IN CHINA MAY PAY DIVIDENDS
ONLY OUT OF THEIR ACCUMULATED PROFITS, IF ANY, DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRC ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, A
FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISE IN CHINA IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE A PORTION OF ITS AFTER-TAX PROFIT TO FUND SPECIFIC RESERVE FUNDS PRIOR
TO PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN PARTICULAR, AT LEAST 10 OF ITS AFTER-TAX PROFITS BASED ON PRC ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EACH YEAR IS REQUIRED
TO BE SET ASIDE TOWARDS ITS GENERAL RESERVES UNTIL THE ACCUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF SUCH RESERVES REACH 50 OF ITS REGISTERED CAPITAL. THESE
RESERVES ARE NOT DISTRIBUTABLE AS CASH DIVIDENDS. IF FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE PAID IN RMB, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE CONVERSION
OF ANY OF THESE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY U.S. STOCKHOLDERS UPON CONVERSION OF THE DIVIDEND
PAYMENT INTO U.S. DOLLARS. FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS FACING THE COMPANY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR
OPERATIONS IN HONG KONG, PLEASE REFER TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS CHINA . WE DO NOT PRESENTLY
HAVE ANY INTENTION TO DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING
DIVIDENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. 

IF
ANY DIVIDEND IS DECLARED IN THE FUTURE AND PAID IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY, YOU MAY BE TAXED ON A LARGER AMOUNT IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN THE U.S.
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE. 

IF
YOU ARE A U.S. HOLDER OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, YOU WILL BE TAXED ON THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF YOUR DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, AT THE TIME
YOU RECEIVE THEM, EVEN IF YOU ACTUALLY RECEIVE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLARS WHEN THE PAYMENT IS IN FACT CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS.
SPECIFICALLY, IF A DIVIDEND IS DECLARED AND PAID IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY SUCH AS THE RMB, THE AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION THAT
YOU MUST INCLUDE IN YOUR INCOME AS A U.S. HOLDER WILL BE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE PAYMENTS MADE IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY, DETERMINED
AT THE SPOT RATE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TO THE U.S. DOLLAR ON THE DATE THE DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION IS INCLUDIBLE IN YOUR INCOME, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PAYMENT IS IN FACT CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THUS, IF THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DECREASES BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY
CONVERT THE CURRENCY INTO U.S. DOLLARS, YOU WILL BE TAXED ON A LARGER AMOUNT IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU WILL
ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE. 

DIVIDENDS
PAYABLE TO OUR FOREIGN INVESTORS AND GAINS ON THE SALE OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BY OUR FOREIGN INVESTORS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO TAX
BY THE PRC. 

UNDER
THE ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE PRC, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED UNDER
RELEVANT TAX TREATIES, A 10 PRC WITHHOLDING TAX IS APPLICABLE TO DIVIDENDS PAYABLE TO INVESTORS THAT ARE NON-RESIDENT ENTERPRISES, WHICH
DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHMENT OR PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THE PRC OR WHICH HAVE SUCH ESTABLISHMENT OR PLACE OF BUSINESS BUT THE DIVIDENDS
ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH SUCH ESTABLISHMENT OR PLACE OF BUSINESS, TO THE EXTENT DIVIDENDS ARE DERIVED FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE
PRC. SIMILARLY, ANY GAIN REALIZED ON THE TRANSFER OF SHARES BY SUCH INVESTORS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO PRC TAX AT A CURRENT RATE OF 10 , SUBJECT
TO ANY REDUCTION OR EXEMPTION SET FORTH IN RELEVANT TAX TREATIES, IF SUCH GAIN IS REGARDED AS INCOME DERIVED FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE
PRC. IF WE ARE DEEMED A PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE, DIVIDENDS PAID ON OUR SHARES, AND ANY GAIN REALIZED FROM THE TRANSFER OF OUR SHARES,
WOULD BE TREATED AS INCOME DERIVED FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE PRC AND WOULD AS A RESULT BE SUBJECT TO PRC TAXATION. FURTHERMORE, IF WE ARE
DEEMED A PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE, DIVIDENDS PAYABLE TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS WHO ARE NON-PRC RESIDENTS AND ANY GAIN REALIZED ON THE TRANSFER
SHARES BY SUCH INVESTORS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRC TAX AT A CURRENT RATE OF 20 , SUBJECT TO ANY REDUCTION OR EXEMPTION SET FORTH IN APPLICABLE
TAX TREATIES. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER WE OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ESTABLISHED OUTSIDE OF CHINA ARE CONSIDERED A PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE
OR WHETHER HOLDERS OF SHARES WOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM THE BENEFIT OF INCOME TAX TREATIES OR AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN CHINA AND OTHER
COUNTRIES OR AREAS. IF DIVIDENDS PAYABLE TO OUR NON-PRC INVESTORS, OR GAINS FROM THE TRANSFER OF OUR SHARES BY SUCH INVESTORS ARE SUBJECT
TO PRC TAX, THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SHARES MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS FACING THE COMPANY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN HONG KONG, PLEASE REFER TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS

OUR
GLOBAL INCOME MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRC TAXES UNDER THE PRC ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX LAW, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

UNDER
THE PRC ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX LAW, OR THE NEW EIT LAW, AND ITS AMENDMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION RULES, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY
2008, AN ENTERPRISE ESTABLISHED OUTSIDE OF THE PRC WITH A DE FACTO MANAGEMENT BODY LOCATED WITHIN THE PRC IS CONSIDERED
A PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX AT THE RATE OF 25 ON ITS GLOBAL INCOME. THE IMPLEMENTATION
RULES DEFINE THE TERM DE FACTO MANAGEMENT BODIES AS ESTABLISHMENTS THAT CARRY OUT SUBSTANTIAL AND OVERALL MANAGEMENT
AND CONTROL OVER THE MANUFACTURING AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS, PERSONNEL AND HUMAN RESOURCES, FINANCE AND TREASURY, AND BUSINESS COMBINATION
AND DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES AND OTHER ASSETS OF AN ENTERPRISE. ON APRIL 22, 2009, THE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF TAXATION (THE
 SAT ), ISSUED A CIRCULAR, OR SAT CIRCULAR 82, WHICH PROVIDES CERTAIN SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THE DE
FACTO MANAGEMENT BODY OF A PRC-CONTROLLED ENTERPRISE THAT IS INCORPORATED OFFSHORE IS LOCATED IN CHINA. ALTHOUGH THE SAT CIRCULAR
82 ONLY APPLIES TO OFFSHORE ENTERPRISES CONTROLLED BY PRC ENTERPRISES OR PRC ENTERPRISE GROUPS, NOT THOSE CONTROLLED BY PRC INDIVIDUALS
OR FOREIGNERS, THE DETERMINING CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE SAT CIRCULAR 82 MAY REFLECT THE SAT S GENERAL POSITION ON HOW THE DE
FACTO MANAGEMENT BODY TEXT SHOULD BE APPLIED IN DETERMINING THE RESIDENT STATUS OF ALL OFFSHORE ENTERPRISES FOR THE PURPOSE OF
PRC TAX, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY PRC ENTERPRISES OR INDIVIDUALS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR LEGAL ENTITIES
ORGANIZED OUTSIDE OF THE PRC CONSTITUTE PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PRC TAX AUTHORITIES COULD REACH A DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION. IN SUCH CASE, WE MAY BE CONSIDERED A PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE AND MAY THEREFORE BE SUBJECT TO THE 25 ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX
ON OUR GLOBAL INCOME, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR TAX BURDEN AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY.
IN ADDITION TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW THE NEW PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISE CLASSIFICATION FOR TAX PURPOSES MAY APPLY, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT THE RULES MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, POSSIBLY WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT. FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS FACE UNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO INDIRECT TRANSFERS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISES BY THEIR NON-PRC
HOLDING COMPANIES. 

ON
FEBRUARY 3, 2015, THE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF TAXATION ISSUED AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON SEVERAL ISSUES CONCERNING ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX ON INCOME
ARISING FROM INDIRECT TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY BY NON-PRC RESIDENT ENTERPRISES, OR ANNOUNCEMENT 7, WITH THE SAME EFFECTIVE DATE. UNDER ANNOUNCEMENT
7, AN INDIRECT TRANSFER REFERS TO A TRANSACTION WHERE A NON-RESIDENT ENTERPRISE TRANSFERS ITS EQUITY INTEREST AND OTHER
SIMILAR INTEREST IN AN OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY HOLDS CHINESE TAXABLE ASSETS (THE ASSETS OF AN ESTABLISHMENT
OR PLACE SITUATED IN CHINA; REAL PROPERTY SITUATED IN CHINA AND EQUITY INTEREST IN CHINESE RESIDENT ENTERPRISES) AND ANY INDIRECT
TRANSFER WITHOUT REASONABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES ARE SUBJECT TO THE PRC TAXATION. IN ADDITION, ANNOUNCEMENT 7 SPECIFIES THE CONDITIONS
UNDER WHICH AN INDIRECT TRANSFER IS DEEMED TO LACK A REASONABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSE WHICH INCLUDE: (1) 75 OR MORE OF THE VALUE OF THE
OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANY S EQUITY IS DERIVED FROM CHINESE TAXABLE ASSETS, (2) ANYTIME IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE
INDIRECT TRANSFER OF CHINESE TAXABLE ASSETS, 90 OR MORE OF THE TOTAL ASSETS (EXCLUDING CASH) OF THE OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANY ARE DIRECT
OR INDIRECT INVESTMENTS IN CHINA, OR 90 OR MORE OF THE REVENUE OF THE OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANY WAS SOURCED FROM CHINA; (3) THE FUNCTIONS
PERFORMED AND RISKS ASSUMED BY THE OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANY(IES), ALTHOUGH INCORPORATED IN AN OFFSHORE JURISDICTION TO CONFORM TO THE
CORPORATE LAW REQUIREMENTS THERE, ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND (4) THE FOREIGN INCOME TAX PAYABLE IN
RESPECT OF THE INDIRECT TRANSFER IS LOWER THAN THE CHINESE TAX WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF THE DIRECT TRANSFER IF
SUCH TRANSFER WERE TREATED AS A DIRECT TRANSFER. AS A RESULT, GAINS DERIVED FROM SUCH INDIRECT TRANSFER WILL BE SUBJECT TO PRC ENTERPRISE
INCOME TAX, CURRENTLY AT A TAX RATE OF 10 . 

ANNOUNCEMENT
7 GRANTS A SAFE HARBOR UNDER CERTAIN QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING TRANSFERS IN THE PUBLIC SECURITIES MARKET AND CERTAIN INTRAGROUP
RESTRICTING TRANSACTIONS, HOWEVER, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANNOUNCEMENT 7. FOR EXAMPLE, ANNOUNCEMENT 7 REQUIRES
THE BUYER TO WITHHOLD THE APPLICABLE TAXES WITHOUT SPECIFYING HOW TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CALCULATE TAXES AND WHEN THE
APPLICABLE TAX SHALL BE SUBMITTED. ANNOUNCEMENT 7 MAY BE DETERMINED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES TO BE APPLICABLE TO OUR OFFSHORE RESTRUCTURING
TRANSACTIONS OR SALE OF THE SHARES OF OUR OFFSHORE SUBSIDIARIES WHERE NON-RESIDENT ENTERPRISES, BEING THE TRANSFERORS, WERE INVOLVED.
THOUGH ANNOUNCEMENT 7 DOES NOT IMPOSE A MANDATORY OBLIGATION OF FILING THE REPORT OF TAXABLE EVENTS, THE TRANSFERRING PARTY SHALL BE
SUBJECT TO PRC WITHHOLDING TAX IF THE CERTAIN TAX FILING CONDITIONS ARE MET. NON-FILING MAY RESULT IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY VARYING
FROM 50 TO 300 OF UNPAID TAXES. AS A RESULT, WE AND OUR NON-RESIDENT ENTERPRISES IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY BECOME AT RISK OF BEING SUBJECT
TO TAXATION UNDER ANNOUNCEMENT 7, AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND VALUABLE RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH ANNOUNCEMENT 7 OR TO ESTABLISH THAT
WE AND OUR NON-RESIDENT ENTERPRISES SHOULD NOT BE TAXED UNDER ANNOUNCEMENT 7, FOR ANY RESTRUCTURING OR DISPOSAL OF SHARES OF OUR OFFSHORE
SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRC
LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS OF CHINESE COMPANIES BY FOREIGN INVESTORS, WHICH
COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS IN CHINA. 

FURTHER
TO THE REGULATIONS ON MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF DOMESTIC ENTERPRISES BY FOREIGN INVESTORS, OR THE NEW M A RULES, THE ANTI-MONOPOLY
LAW OF THE PRC, THE RULES OF MINISTRY OF COMMERCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY REVIEW SYSTEM OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF DOMESTIC
ENTERPRISES BY FOREIGN INVESTORS PROMULGATED BY MOFCOM OR THE MOFCOM SECURITY REVIEW RULES, WAS ISSUED IN AUGUST 2011, WHICH ESTABLISHED
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES IN CHINA BY FOREIGN INVESTORS MORE
TIME-CONSUMING AND COMPLEX, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS IN SOME INSTANCES THAT MOFCOM BE NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE OF ANY CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION
IN WHICH A FOREIGN INVESTOR TAKES CONTROL OF A PRC ENTERPRISE, OR THAT THE APPROVAL FROM MOFCOM BE OBTAINED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OVERSEAS
COMPANIES ESTABLISHED OR CONTROLLED BY PRC ENTERPRISES OR RESIDENTS ACQUIRE AFFILIATED DOMESTIC COMPANIES. PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO
REQUIRE CERTAIN MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS TO BE SUBJECT TO MERGER CONTROL REVIEW AND OR SECURITY REVIEW. 

THE
MOFCOM SECURITY REVIEW RULES, EFFECTIVE FROM SEPTEMBER 1, 2011, WHICH IMPLEMENT THE NOTICE OF THE GENERAL OFFICE OF THE STATE COUNCIL
ON ESTABLISHING THE SECURITY REVIEW SYSTEM FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF DOMESTIC ENTERPRISES BY FOREIGN INVESTORS PROMULGATED ON FEBRUARY
3, 2011, FURTHER PROVIDE THAT, WHEN DECIDING WHETHER A SPECIFIC MERGER OR ACQUISITION OF A DOMESTIC ENTERPRISE BY FOREIGN INVESTORS IS
SUBJECT TO THE SECURITY REVIEW BY MOFCOM, THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSTANCE OVER FORM SHOULD BE APPLIED AND FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE PROHIBITED
FROM BYPASSING THE SECURITY REVIEW REQUIREMENT BY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS THROUGH PROXIES, TRUSTS, INDIRECT INVESTMENTS, LEASES, LOANS,
CONTROL THROUGH AGREEMENTS CONTROL OR OFFSHORE TRANSACTIONS. 

FURTHER,
IF THE BUSINESS OF ANY TARGET COMPANY THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY SEEKS TO ACQUIRE FALLS INTO THE SCOPE OF SECURITY REVIEW, THE COMBINED
COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE SUCH COMPANY EITHER BY EQUITY OR ASSET ACQUISITION, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OR THROUGH ANY
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY GROW ITS BUSINESS IN PART BY ACQUIRING OTHER COMPANIES OPERATING IN ITS INDUSTRY. COMPLYING
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT REGULATIONS TO COMPLETE SUCH TRANSACTIONS COULD BE TIME CONSUMING, AND ANY REQUIRED APPROVAL PROCESSES,
INCLUDING APPROVAL FROM MOFCOM, MAY DELAY OR INHIBIT ITS ABILITY TO COMPLETE SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN
OR EXPAND OUR MARKET SHARE. 

IN
ADDITION, SAFE PROMULGATED THE CIRCULAR ON THE SETTLEMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL OF FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES, OR CIRCULAR 19,
ON JUNE 1, 2015. UNDER CIRCULAR 19, REGISTERED CAPITAL OF A FOREIGN-INVESTED COMPANY SETTLED IN RMB CONVERTED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCIES
MAY ONLY BE USED WITHIN THE BUSINESS SCOPE APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY AND THE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PRC MADE
BY THE FOREIGN-INVESTED COMPANY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS ABOUT THE FOREIGN-INVESTED COMPANY S REINVESTMENT
IN THE PRC. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN-INVESTED COMPANIES CANNOT USE SUCH CAPITAL TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, AND CANNOT USE SUCH
CAPITAL TO ISSUE THE ENTRUSTED RMB LOANS (EXCEPT APPROVED IN ITS BUSINESS SCOPE), REPAY THE RMB LOANS BETWEEN THE ENTERPRISES AND THE
ONES WHICH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE THIRD PARTY. CIRCULAR 19 MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY USE THE PROCEEDS
FROM FUTURE FINANCING ACTIVITIES AS THE CHINESE SUBSIDIARIES MAY NOT CONVERT THE FUNDS RECEIVED FROM US IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES INTO RMB,
WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS IN THE PRC. 

SAFE
ISSUED THE CIRCULAR ON REFORMING AND REGULATING POLICIES ON THE CONTROL OVER FOREIGN EXCHANGE SETTLEMENT OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS CIRCULAR
16 ), ON JUNE 9, 2016, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. PURSUANT TO CIRCULAR 16, ENTERPRISES REGISTERED IN THE PRC MAY ALSO
CONVERT THEIR FOREIGN DEBTS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TO RMB ON A SELF-DISCRETIONARY BASIS. CIRCULAR 16 PROVIDES AN INTEGRATED STANDARD FOR
CONVERSION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE UNDER CAPITAL ACCOUNT ITEMS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL AND FOREIGN DEBTS)
ON A SELF-DISCRETIONARY BASIS WHICH APPLIES TO ALL ENTERPRISES REGISTERED IN THE PRC. CIRCULAR 16 REITERATES THE PRINCIPLE THAT RMB CONVERTED
FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED CAPITAL OF A COMPANY MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED FOR PURPOSE BEYOND ITS BUSINESS SCOPE OR
PROHIBITED BY PRC LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHILE SUCH CONVERTED RMB SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED AS LOANS TO ITS NON-AFFILIATED ENTITIES. AS CIRCULAR
16 IS NEWLY ISSUED AND SAFE HAS NOT PROVIDED DETAILED GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO ITS INTERPRETATION OR IMPLEMENTATION, IT IS UNCERTAIN
HOW THESE RULES WILL BE INTERPRETED AND IMPLEMENTED. 

FAILURE
TO COMPLY WITH PRC REGULATIONS REGARDING THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS OR SHARE OPTION PLANS MAY SUBJECT
THE PRC PLAN PARTICIPANTS OR US TO FINES AND OTHER LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS. 

PURSUANT
TO SAFE CIRCULAR 37, PRC RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS IN OVERSEAS NON-PUBLICLY-LISTED COMPANIES MAY SUBMIT APPLICATIONS
TO SAFE OR ITS LOCAL BRANCHES FOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGISTRATION WITH RESPECT TO OFFSHORE SPECIAL PURPOSE COMPANIES. IN THE MEANTIME,
OUR DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PRC CITIZENS OR WHO ARE NON-PRC RESIDENTS RESIDING IN THE PRC FOR A CONTINUOUS
PERIOD OF NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, AND WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED INCENTIVE SHARE AWARDS BY US, MAY FOLLOW THE
NOTICES ON ISSUES CONCERNING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATION FOR DOMESTIC INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF OVERSEAS
PUBLICLY-LISTED COMPANY, OR 2012 SAFE NOTICES, PROMULGATED BY THE SAFE IN 2012. PURSUANT TO THE 2012 SAFE NOTICES, PRC CITIZENS AND NON-PRC
CITIZENS WHO RESIDE IN CHINA FOR A CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR WHO PARTICIPATE IN ANY STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF AN OVERSEAS
PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANY, SUBJECT TO A FEW EXCEPTIONS, ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH SAFE THROUGH A DOMESTIC QUALIFIED AGENT, WHICH COULD
BE THE PRC SUBSIDIARIES OF SUCH OVERSEAS LISTED COMPANY, AND COMPLETE CERTAIN OTHER PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION, AN OVERSEAS ENTRUSTED INSTITUTION
MUST BE RETAINED TO HANDLE MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXERCISE OR SALE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SHARES AND INTERESTS.
OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PRC CITIZENS OR WHO RESIDE IN THE PRC FOR A CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF NOT LESS THAN ONE
YEAR AND WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED OPTIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THESE REGULATIONS. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THESE REGULATIONS WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE
HONG KONG RESIDENTS OR CITIZENS. FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE SAFE REGISTRATIONS MAY SUBJECT THEM TO FINES, AND LEGAL SANCTIONS AND MAY ALSO
LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INTO OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES AND LIMIT OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES ABILITY
TO DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS TO US IF HONG KONG RESIDENTS OR CITIZENS ARE COVERED UNDER THESE PRC REGULATIONS. WE ALSO FACE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES
THAT COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PLANS FOR OUR DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES UNDER PRC LAW. 

39 

THE
SAT HAS ISSUED CERTAIN CIRCULARS CONCERNING EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES. UNDER THESE CIRCULARS, EMPLOYEES WORKING IN
CHINA WHO EXERCISE SHARE OPTIONS OR ARE GRANTED RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO PRC INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER
THESE REGULATIONS WILL BE EXPANDED IN THE FUTURE TO COVER OUR EMPLOYEES IN HONG KONG. OUR HONG KONG SUBSIDIARIES MAY BECOME OBLIGATED
TO FILE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED SHARES WITH RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES AND TO WITHHOLD INDIVIDUAL INCOME
TAXES OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO EXERCISE THEIR SHARE OPTIONS. IF OUR EMPLOYEES FAIL TO PAY OR WE FAIL TO WITHHOLD THEIR INCOME TAXES ACCORDING
TO RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE MAY FACE SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES OR OTHER PRC GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. 

IF
WE BECOME DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO THE RECENT SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY INVOLVING U.S.-LISTED CHINESE COMPANIES, WE MAY HAVE
TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE MATTER WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR REPUTATION AND
COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SHARES, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH MATTER CANNOT BE ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED FAVORABLY. 

U.S.
PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONS IN CHINA HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE
PUBLICITY BY INVESTORS, FINANCIAL COMMENTATORS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE SEC. MUCH OF THE SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE
PUBLICITY HAS CENTERED AROUND FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES, A LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
AND REPORTING, INADEQUATE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES OR A LACK OF ADHERENCE THERETO AND, IN MANY CASES, ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD. AS A
RESULT OF THE SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, THE PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK OF MANY U.S. LISTED CHINESE COMPANIES HAS SHARPLY
DECREASED IN VALUE AND, IN SOME CASES, HAS BECOME VIRTUALLY WORTHLESS. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS
AND SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND ARE CONDUCTING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ALLEGATIONS. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT EFFECT
THIS SECTOR-WIDE SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY WILL HAVE ON OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS. IF WE BECOME THE SUBJECT OF ANY
UNFAVORABLE ALLEGATIONS, WHETHER SUCH ALLEGATIONS ARE PROVEN TO BE TRUE OR UNTRUE, WE MAY HAVE TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE
SUCH ALLEGATIONS AND/OR DEFEND THE COMPANY. THIS SITUATION MAY BE A MAJOR DISTRACTION TO OUR MANAGEMENT. IF SUCH ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT
PROVEN TO BE GROUNDLESS, OUR COMPANY AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY HAMPERED AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK COULD BE RENDERED
WORTHLESS. 

IN
ADDITION, MAJOR ISSUES WITH OTHER U.S. LISTED CHINESE COMPANIES IN THE FUTURE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT,
EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY IS NOT INVOLVED. 

IT
MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR STOCKHOLDERS TO ENFORCE ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN THE UNITED STATES AGAINST US, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE REMEDIES OTHERWISE
AVAILABLE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

COSG IS ORGANIZED UNDER
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEVADA AS A HOLDING COMPANY THAT CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS THROUGH NUMBER OF SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS
OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE, HONG KONG AND THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS. THIS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF
U.S. INVESTORS TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN U.S. COURTS AGAINST THESE ENTITIES, OR TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS ON THE OFFICERS AND
DIRECTORS MANAGING THE FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. 

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF
OUR ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN HONG KONG. MEANWHILE, OUR CURRENT DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE HONG KONG / AUSTRALIAN / NEW ZEALAND RESIDENTS
WITH SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF THEIR ASSETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO EFFECT
SERVICE OF PROCESS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES UPON US OR THESE PERSONS, OR TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OBTAINED IN U.S. COURTS AGAINST US OR THEM,
INCLUDING JUDGMENTS PREDICATED UPON THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE IN THE UNITED
STATES. IT WILL ALSO BE COSTLIER AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR THE INVESTORS TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OR TO ENFORCE
JUDGMENTS OBTAINED FROM THE U.S. COURTS IN THE COURTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS RESIDE. FOR EXAMPLE, TO ENFORCE
A FOREIGN JUDGMENT IN HONG KONG, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO APPLY TO THE HONG KONG HIGH COURT TO ENFORCE A FOREIGN JUDGMENT (THE APPLICATION FOR WHICH YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO ENGAGE A LOCAL COUNSEL TO FACILITATE OR PREPARE THE APPLICATION ALONGSIDE THE VARIOUS SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATIONS
FOR THE APPLICATION. AFTER WHICH, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE STANDARD LITIGATION PROCESS TO SUE ON THE JUDGMENT AS A DEBT.
IN ADDITION, A JUDGMENT OF A UNITED STATES COURT FOR CIVIL LIABILITIES PREDICATED UPON THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES
MAY ALSO NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN OR RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS RESIDE. AS SUCH, YOU
MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OBTAINED IN U.S. COURTS BASED ON THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES
LAWS AGAINST US AND OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. 

FURTHER, INSOFAR AS PRC
FACTOR MAY BE CONCERNED, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THE PRC COURTS WOULD (I) ENTERTAIN ORIGINAL ACTIONS BROUGHT IN THE PRC AGAINST
US OR OUR DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS BASED ON THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES OR (II) RECOGNIZE
OR ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OBTAINED AGAINST US OR OUR DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS BASED ON THE CIVIL LIABILITY
PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. TO THIS END, WE NOTE THAT NONE OF OUR DIRECTORS
OR OFFICERS ARE CHINESE NATIONALS NOR DOES THE COMPANY HOLD ANY ASSETS AND/OR HOST ANY OPERATIONS WITHIN THE PRC. PRC COURTS MAY THEREFORE
COME TO THE VIEW THERE IS NO LOCUS. 

UNDER THE ONE COUNTRY,
TWO SYSTEMS PRINCIPLE, THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (SAR) HAS AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY THAT OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM
THE COURTS IN MAINLAND CHINA. THE COURTS OF HONG KONG HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ALL CASES THAT ARISE WITHIN ITS TERRITORY, INCLUDING CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL CASES, AS WELL AS CASES RELATED TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BASIC LAW. 

WHERE PRC LAW DOES APPLY HOWEVER,
IN ORDER TO ENFORCE A FOREIGN JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE PRC, CERTAIN CRITERIA MUST BE MET AS STIPULATED
BY THE PRC CIVIL PROCEDURE LAW AND OTHER RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (I) THE JUDGMENT
BEING SOUGHT FOR RECOGNITION MUST BE A FINAL AND VALID JUDGMENT OR DECREE ISSUED BY A FOREIGN COURT; (II) THE COURT THAT RENDERED THE
JUDGMENT OR DECREE MUST HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE UNDER THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN LAW; (III) THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOREIGN COURT
MUST HAVE BEEN FAIR AND LAWFUL UNDER THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN LAW, INCLUDING EFFECTIVE SERVICE ON THE DEFENDANT AND GIVING THE DEFENDANT
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD; (IV) THERE MUST BE NO CONFLICTING INTERESTS IN THE CASE; (V) THE REQUESTED COURT MUST NOT BE CONDUCTING AN
ONGOING TRIAL BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES ON THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER OR HAVE ALREADY RENDERED AN EFFECTIVE JUDGMENT, NOR MUST IT HAVE RECOGNIZED
A JUDGMENT RENDERED BY A THIRD COUNTRY IN THE CASE; (VI) THERE MUST BE A TREATY RELATIONSHIP OR RECIPROCITY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
FOR THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS IN CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MATTERS; AND (VII) THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THE JUDGMENT MUST NOT VIOLATE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LAWS OF THE PRC OR THE SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, OR PUBLIC INTERESTS OF
THE PRC. 

40 

AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THERE ARE NO EXISTING TREATIES OR WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THE PRC CIVIL PROCEDURE LAW, A FOREIGN JUDGMENT AGAINST
US, OUR DIRECTORS, OR OFFICERS CANNOT BE ENFORCED BY PRC COURTS IF THE COURT FINDS THAT IT VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF PRC
LAWS OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, OR PUBLIC INTERESTS. THIS RAISES UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A PRC
COURT WOULD ENFORCE A JUDGMENT ISSUED BY A COURT IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO OUR INCORPORATION UNDER
THE LAWS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN CHINA UNDER PRC LAWS. THE
PRC CIVIL PROCEDURE LAW AND RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE A CONNECTION TO THE PRC TO ESTABLISH JURISDICTION, WHICH MAY BE CHALLENGING
FOR U.S. SHAREHOLDERS TO ESTABLISH BASED SOLELY ON THEIR OWNERSHIP OF OUR SHARES. 

RISKS
RELATING TO SECURITIES MARKETS AND INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK 

THERE
IS NOT NOW AND THERE MAY NOT EVER BE AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THESE SECURITIES. 

THERE
CURRENTLY IS NO MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DESCRIBED HEREIN, WE HAVE NO PLANS TO FILE ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT
OR OTHERWISE ATTEMPT TO CREATE A MARKET FOR THE SHARES. EVEN IF AN ACTIVE MARKET DEVELOPS FOR THE SHARES, RULE 144, WHICH PROVIDES FOR
AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS,
A HOLDING PERIOD PRIOR TO THE RESALE (IN LIMITED AMOUNTS) OF SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN A NON-PUBLIC OFFERING WITHOUT HAVING TO SATISFY THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL FULFILL ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE
FUTURE UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT OR DISSEMINATE TO THE PUBLIC ANY CURRENT FINANCIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING US, AS IS REQUIRED BY
RULE 144 AS PART OF THE CONDITIONS OF ITS AVAILABILITY. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH
MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK . 

UNDER
U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LEGISLATION, OUR COMMON STOCK WILL CONSTITUTE PENNY STOCK . PENNY STOCK IS ANY EQUITY SECURITY THAT
HAS A MARKET PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. FOR ANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING A PENNY STOCK, UNLESS EXEMPT,
THE RULES REQUIRE THAT A BROKER OR DEALER APPROVE A POTENTIAL INVESTOR S ACCOUNT FOR TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS, AND THE BROKER OR
DEALER RECEIVE FROM THE INVESTOR A WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION, SETTING FORTH THE IDENTITY AND QUANTITY OF THE PENNY STOCK TO
BE PURCHASED. IN ORDER TO APPROVE AN INVESTOR S ACCOUNT FOR TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS, THE BROKER OR DEALER MUST OBTAIN FINANCIAL
INFORMATION AND INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE OBJECTIVES OF THE PERSON, AND MAKE A REASONABLE DETERMINATION THAT THE TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS
ARE SUITABLE FOR THAT PERSON AND THE PERSON HAS SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL MATTERS TO BE CAPABLE OF EVALUATING
THE RISKS OF TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS. THE BROKER OR DEALER MUST ALSO DELIVER, PRIOR TO ANY TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK, A DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE PREPARED BY THE COMMISSION RELATING TO THE PENNY STOCK MARKET, WHICH, IN HIGHLIGHT FORM SETS FORTH THE BASIS ON WHICH THE BROKER
OR DEALER MADE THE SUITABILITY DETERMINATION. BROKERS MAY BE LESS WILLING TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES SUBJECT TO THE PENNY
STOCK RULES. THIS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO DISPOSE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE
OF OUR STOCK. DISCLOSURE ALSO HAS TO BE MADE ABOUT THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN PENNY STOCKS IN BOTH PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND IN SECONDARY TRADING
AND ABOUT THE COMMISSIONS PAYABLE TO BOTH THE BROKER-DEALER AND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, CURRENT QUOTATIONS FOR THE SECURITIES
AND THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO AN INVESTOR IN CASES OF FRAUD IN PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS. FINALLY, MONTHLY STATEMENTS HAVE
TO BE SENT DISCLOSING RECENT PRICE INFORMATION FOR THE PENNY STOCK HELD IN THE ACCOUNT AND INFORMATION ON THE LIMITED MARKET IN PENNY
STOCKS. 

WE
ARE A CONTROLLED COMPANY SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF LEE YING CHIU HERBERT, OUR DIRECTOR . LEE YING CHIU HERBERT, TOGETHER
WITH OUR OTHER INSIDERS BENEFICIALLY OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR STOCK, AND ACCORDINGLY, HAVE CONTROL OVER STOCKHOLDER MATTERS,
OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT . 

UNDER
NASDAQ STOCK EXCHANGE RULE 5615(C)(1), A CONTROLLED COMPANY IS DEFINED AS A COMPANY OF WHICH MORE THAN 50 OF THE
VOTING POWER FOR THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS IS HELD BY AN INDIVIDUAL, A GROUP OR ANOTHER COMPANY. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT,
LEE YING CHIU HERBERT BENEFICIALLY OWNS 172,190,485 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR APPROXIMATELY 48.05 OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. DR. LEE IS ENTITLED TO AN ADDITIONAL 800,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION
OF MASSIVE TREASURE. AFTER THE ISSUANCE OF THE 800,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, DR. LEE WILL BENEFICIALLY OWN IN EXCESS OF 83.93 
OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, DR. LEE WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE TO: 

ELECT OR DEFEAT THE ELECTION
 OF OUR DIRECTORS; 

AMEND OR PREVENT AMENDMENT
 OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; 

EFFECT OR PREVENT A MERGER,
 SALE OF ASSETS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTION; AND 

AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF ANY
 OTHER MATTER SUBMITTED TO THE STOCKHOLDERS FOR VOTE. 

MOREOVER,
BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP POSITION HELD BY OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, NEW INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECT A CHANGE IN OUR BUSINESS
OR MANAGEMENT, AND THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS WOULD HAVE NO RECOURSE AS A RESULT OF DECISIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, SALES OF
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SHARES HELD BY OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, OR THE PROSPECT OF THESE SALES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF
OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM S STOCK OWNERSHIP MAY DISCOURAGE A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER FROM MAKING A TENDER OFFER OR OTHERWISE
ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN CONTROL OF US, WHICH IN TURN COULD REDUCE OUR STOCK PRICE OR PREVENT OUR STOCKHOLDERS FROM REALIZING A PREMIUM OVER
OUR STOCK PRICE. 

41 

STATE
SECURITIES LAWS MAY LIMIT SECONDARY TRADING, WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE STATES IN WHICH AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH YOU CAN SELL THE SHARES
OFFERED BY THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT. 

SECONDARY
TRADING IN COMMON STOCK SOLD IN THIS OFFERING WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN ANY STATE UNTIL THE COMMON STOCK IS QUALIFIED FOR SALE UNDER THE
APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE STATE OR THERE IS CONFIRMATION THAT AN EXEMPTION, SUCH AS LISTING IN CERTAIN RECOGNIZED SECURITIES
MANUALS, IS AVAILABLE FOR SECONDARY TRADING IN THE STATE. IF WE FAIL TO REGISTER OR QUALIFY, OR TO OBTAIN OR VERIFY AN EXEMPTION FOR
THE SECONDARY TRADING OF, THE COMMON STOCK IN ANY PARTICULAR STATE, THE COMMON STOCK COULD NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD TO, OR PURCHASED BY,
A RESIDENT OF THAT STATE. IN THE EVENT THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STATES REFUSE TO PERMIT SECONDARY TRADING IN OUR COMMON STOCK, THE
LIQUIDITY FOR THE COMMON STOCK COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THUS CAUSING YOU TO REALIZE A LOSS ON YOUR INVESTMENT. 

THE
COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SEEK REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION OF ITS SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THE SUBJECT OF THIS OFFERING IN ANY STATE
OR TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ASIDE FROM A SECONDARY TRADING EXEMPTION, OTHER EXEMPTIONS UNDER STATE LAW AND THE LAWS
OF US TERRITORIES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO PURCHASERS OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SOLD IN THIS OFFERING, 

ANTI-TAKEOVER
EFFECTS OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF NEVADA STATE LAW HINDER A POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF OUR COMPANY. 

THOUGH
NOT NOW, IN THE FUTURE WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO NEVADA S CONTROL SHARE LAW. A CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO NEVADA S CONTROL SHARE LAW IF
IT HAS MORE THAN 200 STOCKHOLDERS, AT LEAST 100 OF WHOM ARE STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AND RESIDENTS OF NEVADA, AND IT DOES BUSINESS IN NEVADA
OR THROUGH AN AFFILIATED CORPORATION. THE LAW FOCUSES ON THE ACQUISITION OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST WHICH MEANS THE OWNERSHIP
OF OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES SUFFICIENT, BUT FOR THE CONTROL SHARE LAW, TO ENABLE THE ACQUIRING PERSON TO EXERCISE THE FOLLOWING PROPORTIONS
OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE CORPORATION IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS: 

(I)
ONE-FIFTH OR MORE BUT LESS THAN ONE-THIRD, (II) ONE-THIRD OR MORE BUT LESS THAN A MAJORITY, OR (III) A MAJORITY OR MORE. THE ABILITY
TO EXERCISE SUCH VOTING POWER MAY BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH OTHERS. 

THE
EFFECT OF THE CONTROL SHARE LAW IS THAT THE ACQUIRING PERSON, AND THOSE ACTING IN ASSOCIATION WITH IT, OBTAINS ONLY SUCH VOTING RIGHTS
IN THE CONTROL SHARES AS ARE CONFERRED BY A RESOLUTION OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE CORPORATION, APPROVED AT A SPECIAL OR ANNUAL MEETING
OF STOCKHOLDERS. THE CONTROL SHARE LAW CONTEMPLATES THAT VOTING RIGHTS WILL BE CONSIDERED ONLY ONCE BY THE OTHER STOCKHOLDERS. THUS,
THERE IS NO AUTHORITY TO STRIP VOTING RIGHTS FROM THE CONTROL SHARES OF AN ACQUIRING PERSON ONCE THOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED. IF
THE STOCKHOLDERS DO NOT GRANT VOTING RIGHTS TO THE CONTROL SHARES ACQUIRED BY AN ACQUIRING PERSON, THOSE SHARES DO NOT BECOME PERMANENT
NON-VOTING SHARES. THE ACQUIRING PERSON IS FREE TO SELL ITS SHARES TO OTHERS. IF THE BUYERS OF THOSE SHARES THEMSELVES DO NOT ACQUIRE
A CONTROLLING INTEREST, THEIR SHARES DO NOT BECOME GOVERNED BY THE CONTROL SHARE LAW. 

IF
CONTROL SHARES ARE ACCORDED FULL VOTING RIGHTS AND THE ACQUIRING PERSON HAS ACQUIRED CONTROL SHARES WITH A MAJORITY OR MORE OF THE VOTING
POWER, ANY STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD, OTHER THAN AN ACQUIRING PERSON, WHO HAS NOT VOTED IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF VOTING RIGHTS IS ENTITLED
TO DEMAND FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH STOCKHOLDER S SHARES. 

IN
ADDITION TO THE CONTROL SHARE LAW, NEVADA HAS A BUSINESS COMBINATION LAW WHICH PROHIBITS CERTAIN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BETWEEN NEVADA
CORPORATIONS AND INTERESTED STOCKHOLDERS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER FIRST BECOMES AN INTERESTED
STOCKHOLDER, UNLESS THE CORPORATION S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES THE COMBINATION IN ADVANCE. FOR PURPOSES OF NEVADA LAW, AN INTERESTED
STOCKHOLDER IS ANY PERSON WHO IS (I) THE BENEFICIAL OWNER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF TEN PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF
THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES OF THE CORPORATION, OR (II) AN AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE OF THE CORPORATION AND AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE THREE
PREVIOUS YEARS WAS THE BENEFICIAL OWNER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF TEN PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING SHARES
OF THE CORPORATION. THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM BUSINESS COMBINATION IS SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO COVER VIRTUALLY ANY KIND OF
TRANSACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER TO USE THE CORPORATION S ASSETS TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR OTHERWISE TO BENEFIT
ITS OWN INTERESTS RATHER THAN THE INTERESTS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS OTHER STOCKHOLDERS. 

THE
EFFECT OF NEVADA S BUSINESS COMBINATION LAW IS TO POTENTIALLY DISCOURAGE PARTIES INTERESTED IN TAKING CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY FROM DOING
SO IF IT CANNOT OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

42 

BECAUSE
WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR SHARES
UNLESS THEY SELL THEM. 

WE
INTEND TO RETAIN ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO FINANCE THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY CASH DIVIDENDS
ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS WE PAY DIVIDENDS, OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR
SHARES UNLESS THEY SELL THEM. STOCKHOLDERS MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO SELL SHARES WHEN DESIRED. BEFORE YOU INVEST IN OUR SECURITIES, YOU SHOULD
BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS RISKS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THESE RISK FACTORS, TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED
IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE OUR SECURITIES. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOP INTO ACTUAL
EVENTS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR
STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND
MAY PREVENT OUR STOCKHOLDERS FROM RESELLING OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PROFIT. 

THE
MARKET PRICES FOR OUR SECURITIES MAY BE VOLATILE AND MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING: 

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE
 BUSINESS MARKETING SERVICES AND DIGITAL ASSETS SERVICES SECTORS OR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE; 

PRICE
 AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OVERALL STOCK MARKET; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS
 OF THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 

ACTUAL
 FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS, AND CONCERNS BY INVESTORS THAT SUCH FLUCTUATIONS MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE; 

DEVIATIONS
 IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS FROM THE ESTIMATES OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR OTHER ANALYST COMMENTS; 

ADDITIONS
 OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL; 

LEGISLATION,
 INCLUDING MEASURES AFFECTING E-COMMERCE OR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; AND

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO
VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE SET FORTH
BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM
RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS. 

WE DEPEND ON OUR
KEY PERSONNEL - OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, SENIOR OFFICERS AND COMPANY MANAGERS. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND THE LOSS OF
SEVERAL OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

DEBT
FINANCING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 1.66 BILLION OF
INDEBTEDNESS (INCLUDING 233.1 MILLION OF VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS, OF WHICH
 152.7 MILLION IS SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS). WE ARE
SUBJECT TO THE RISKS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT FINANCING, INCLUDING THE
FOLLOWING: 

CASH
 FLOW MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET REQUIRED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND
 INTEREST; 

INABILITY
 TO REFINANCE MATURING INDEBTEDNESS ON ENCUMBERED
 PROPERTIES; 

THE
 TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE AS THE TERMS OF EXISTING
 INDEBTEDNESS; 

INABILITY
 TO COMPLY WITH DEBT COVENANTS COULD CAUSE AN ACCELERATION OF THE MATURITY
 DATE; AND 

REPAYING
 DEBT BEFORE THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE COULD RESULT IN PREPAYMENT
 PENALTIES. 

UNCERTAINTY OF
OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE BALLOON PAYMENTS - AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE
HAD APPROXIMATELY 1.66 BILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT, EXCHANGEABLE BONDS AND LINE OF
CREDIT BORROWINGS, MOST OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO BALLOON PAYMENTS (SEE NOTES 8
AND 9 TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE
DETAILS) . WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO
MAKE ALL OF THESE BALLOON PAYMENTS. THESE MORTGAGES, BONDS AND LINES OF CREDIT
BORROWINGS HAVE THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AND BALLOON
PAYMENTS: 

2008-- 125.2
MILLION; 

 2009-- 185.7
MILLION; 

 2010-- 154.8
MILLION; 

 2011-- 166.5
MILLION; 

 2012-- 32.2
MILLION; 

 THEREAFTER-- 993.3
MILLION. 

WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO REFINANCE SUCH MORTGAGE INDEBTEDNESS, BONDS, OR LINES OF
CREDIT. THE PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO THESE MORTGAGES COULD BE FORECLOSED
UPON OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED TO THE LENDER. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO
LOSE INCOME AND ASSET VALUE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REFINANCE THE DEBT
AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES OR ON TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE AS THE TERMS
OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. 

THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S CURRENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERELY
IMPACTED BY THE TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. OUR STRONG BALANCE
SHEET, THE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT BANK
GROUP AND ACCESS TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC SECURED DEBT FINANCING HAVE
INSULATED US FROM THE TURMOIL BEING EXPERIENCED BY MANY OTHER REAL ESTATE
COMPANIES. RECENTLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME EXPANSION IN CREDIT SPREADS
AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC S TIER 4 FINANCING ARE CURRENTLY AT APPROXIMATELY
200 BASIS POINTS OVER THE RELEVANT U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. 

DEBT FINANCING ON
PROPERTIES MAY RESULT IN INSUFFICIENT CASH FLOW - WHERE POSSIBLE, WE
INTEND TO CONTINUE TO USE LEVERAGE TO INCREASE THE RATE OF RETURN ON OUR
INVESTMENTS AND TO PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE COULD NOT
OTHERWISE MAKE. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE CASH FLOW FROM THE PROPERTIES WILL BE
INSUFFICIENT TO MEET BOTH DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE DISTRIBUTION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL
REVENUE CODE. WE MAY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING IN THE FUTURE THROUGH
MORTGAGES ON SOME OR ALL OF THE PROPERTIES. THESE MORTGAGES MAY BE RECOURSE,
NON-RECOURSE, OR CROSS-COLLATERALIZED. 

AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAD 74 OF ITS 123 CONSOLIDATED
APARTMENT COMMUNITIES 

8 

ENCUMBERED
BY DEBT. OF THE 74 COMMUNITIES, 51 ARE SECURED BY DEEDS OF TRUST RELATING SOLELY
TO THOSE PROPERTIES. WITH RESPECT TO THE REMAINING 23 COMMUNITIES,
THERE ARE 5 CROSS-COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGES SECURED BY 8 COMMUNITIES, 7
COMMUNITIES, 3 COMMUNITIES, 3 COMMUNITIES, AND 2 COMMUNITIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE
HOLDERS OF THIS INDEBTEDNESS WILL HAVE CLAIMS AGAINST THESE COMMUNITIES AND, TO
THE EXTENT INDEBTEDNESS IS CROSS-COLLATERALIZED, LENDERS MAY SEEK TO FORECLOSE
UPON COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE NOT THE PRIMARY COLLATERAL FOR THEIR LOAN. THIS MAY
ACCELERATE OTHER INDEBTEDNESS SECURED BY COMMUNITIES. FORECLOSURE OF COMMUNITIES
WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME AND NET ASSET VALUE. 

RISK OF RISING
INTEREST RATES - 
CURRENT INTEREST RATES COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE RAPIDLY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN
HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS. PROLONGED INTEREST
RATE INCREASES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND
DEVELOP PROPERTIES AT ECONOMIC RETURNS ON INVESTMENT AND OUR ABILITY TO
REFINANCE EXISTING BORROWINGS AT ACCEPTABLE RATES. 

AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 220.9 MILLION OF LONG-TERM VARIABLE
RATE INDEBTEDNESS BEARING INTEREST AT FLOATING RATES TIED TO THE RATE OF
SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT REVENUE BONDS (WHICH MATURE AT VARIOUS DATES FROM 2020
THROUGH 2034), 12.2 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS BEARING
INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS 1.25 RELATED TO A PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECT DUE IN 2009,
AND 169.8 MILLION OF VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT. OF
THE 169.8 MILLION OF VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT,
 100.0 MILLION IS BEARING INTEREST AT THE FREDDIE MAC REFERENCE RATE PLUS FROM
0.55 TO 0.59 , 61.0 MILLION IS BEARING INTEREST AT THE UNDERLYING INTEREST
RATE BASED ON A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE TIED TO THE COMPANY S CORPORATE RATINGS
AND IS CURRENTLY AT LIBOR PLUS 0.80 , AND 8.8 MILLION IS BEARING INTEREST AT
THE UNDERLYING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE BANK S PRIME RATE LESS 2.0 .
APPROXIMATELY 152.7 MILLION OF THE LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS IS SUBJECT TO
INTEREST RATE CAP PROTECTION AGREEMENTS, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. THE REMAINING 68.2 MILLION OF LONG-TERM
VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS WAS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY INTEREST RATE CAP PROTECTION
AGREEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES MAY HAVE AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR NET INCOME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

RISK OF LOSSES ON
INTEREST RATE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO
AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, AND
MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. ALTHOUGH THESE AGREEMENTS MAY PARTIALLY PROTECT AGAINST
RISING INTEREST RATES, THEY ALSO MAY REDUCE THE BENEFITS TO US IF INTEREST RATES
DECLINE. IF A HEDGING ARRANGEMENT IS NOT INDEXED TO THE SAME RATE AS THE
INDEBTEDNESS THAT IS HEDGED, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LOSSES TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
RATE GOVERNING THE INDEBTEDNESS AND THE RATE GOVERNING THE HEDGING ARRANGEMENT
CHANGE INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER. FINALLY, NONPERFORMANCE BY THE OTHER PARTY
TO THE HEDGING ARRANGEMENT MAY SUBJECT US TO INCREASED CREDIT RISKS. IN ORDER TO
MINIMIZE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, OUR POLICY IS TO ENTER INTO HEDGING
ARRANGEMENTS ONLY WITH A-RATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 

BOND COMPLIANCE
REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT INCOME FROM CERTAIN PROPERTIES - AT DECEMBER 31,
2007, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 220.9 MILLION OF VARIABLE RATE TAX-EXEMPT FINANCING
RELATING TO THE FOLLOWING APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: INGLENOOK COURT, WANDERING
CREEK, BOULEVARD (TREETOPS), HUNTINGTON BREAKERS, CAMARILLO OAKS, FOUNTAIN PARK,
ANCHOR VILLAGE AND HIDDEN VALLEY (PARKER RANCH). THIS TAX-EXEMPT FINANCING
SUBJECTS THESE PROPERTIES TO CERTAIN DEED RESTRICTIONS AND RESTRICTIVE
COVENANTS. WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS IN THE FUTURE. IN
ADDITION, THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND RULES AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER IMPOSE
VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS, CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS EXCLUDING INTEREST ON
QUALIFIED BOND OBLIGATIONS FROM GROSS INCOME FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ALSO REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 20 OF APARTMENT UNITS BE
MADE AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS WITH GROSS INCOMES THAT DO NOT EXCEED A SPECIFIED
PERCENTAGE, GENERALLY 50 , OF THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR THE APPLICABLE FAMILY SIZE
AS DETERMINED BY THE HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RENTAL RESTRICTIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY
LIMIT INCOME FROM THE TAX-EXEMPT FINANCED PROPERTIES IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO LOWER
RENTAL RATES TO ATTRACT RESIDENTS WHO SATISFY THE MEDIAN INCOME TEST. IF THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP DOES NOT RESERVE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF APARTMENT HOMES
FOR RESIDENTS SATISFYING THESE INCOME REQUIREMENTS, THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF THE
BONDS MAY BE TERMINATED, THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BOND DOCUMENTS MAY BE
ACCELERATED AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL
LIABILITY. 

ADVERSE EFFECT TO
PROPERTY INCOME AND VALUE DUE TO GENERAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT RISKS - 
REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. THE YIELDS
AVAILABLE FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF INCOME
GENERATED AND EXPENSES INCURRED. IF THE PROPERTIES DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT
INCOME TO MEET OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING DEBT SERVICE AND CAPITAL
EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOW AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS
WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INCOME FROM THE PROPERTIES MAY BE FURTHER ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 

THE
 GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE; 

LOCAL
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED, SUCH AS
 OVERSUPPLY OF HOUSING OR A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR RENTAL
 HOUSING; 

THE
 ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE PROPERTIES TO
TENANTS; 

COMPETITION
 FROM OTHER AVAILABLE SPACE; AND 

THE
 OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND
 INSURANCE. 

9 

AS LEASES
ON THE PROPERTIES EXPIRE, TENANTS MAY ENTER INTO NEW LEASES ON TERMS THAT ARE
LESS FAVORABLE TO US. INCOME AND REAL ESTATE VALUES ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS APPLICABLE LAWS (E.G., THE AMERICANS WITH
DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 AND TAX LAWS), INTEREST RATE LEVELS AND THE
AVAILABILITY AND TERMS OF FINANCING. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE
RELATIVELY ILLIQUID AND, THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO VARY OUR PORTFOLIO PROMPTLY
IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS MAY BE QUITE
LIMITED. 

ECONOMIC
ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACT ON OPERATING RESULTS - THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND
THE ECONOMIES OF THE WESTERN STATES IN MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE CAN IMPACT OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. SOME OF THESE MARKETS ARE CONCENTRATED IN HIGH-TECH SECTORS,
WHICH HAVE EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, AND COULD AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. OUR
PROPERTY TYPE AND DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF RISK
MITIGATION. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. ALTHOUGH
WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, IT IS POSSIBLE A
REDUCTION IN RENTAL RATES, OCCUPANCY LEVELS, PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND INCREASES
IN OPERATING COSTS SUCH AS ADVERTISING, TURNOVER AND REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE
EXPENSE COULD OCCUR IN THE EVENT OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. 

DUE TO
THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S CONCENTRATION IN SUPPLY RESTRICTED MARKETS, THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT FROM
INCREASES IN SUPPLY OF UNSOLD SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. 

RISK OF
INFLATION/DEFLATION - SUBSTANTIAL INFLATIONARY OR DEFLATIONARY PRESSURES
COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON RENTAL RATES AND PROPERTY OPERATING
EXPENSES. 

RISKS THAT
ACQUISITIONS WILL FAIL TO MEET EXPECTATIONS - WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO
ACQUIRE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE RISKS THAT ACQUISITIONS WILL
FAIL TO MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME, EXPENSES AND THE
COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS OR REDEVELOPMENT THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ALLOW US TO MARKET
AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE. WE
EXPECT TO FINANCE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER VARIOUS FORMS
OF SECURED OR UNSECURED FINANCING OR THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS
BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR RELATED PARTNERSHIPS OR ADDITIONAL EQUITY BY THE
COMPANY. THE USE OF EQUITY FINANCING, RATHER THAN DEBT, FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
OR ACQUISITIONS COULD DILUTE THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY S EXISTING
STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE FINANCE NEW ACQUISITIONS UNDER EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT,
THERE IS A RISK THAT, UNLESS WE OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE FINANCING, THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE FURTHER LINES OF CREDIT FOR NEW
DEVELOPMENT OR SUCH LINES OF CREDIT MAY BE NOT AVAILABLE ON ADVANTAGEOUS
TERMS. 

RISKS THAT
DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WILL BE DELAYED, NOT COMPLETED, AND/OR
NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RESULTS - WE PURSUE APARTMENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND THESE PROJECTS GENERALLY REQUIRE VARIOUS
GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER APPROVALS, WHICH HAVE NO ASSURANCE OF BEING RECEIVED. OUR
DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES GENERALLY ENTAIL CERTAIN RISKS,
INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

FUNDS
 MAY BE EXPENDED AND MANAGEMENT'S TIME DEVOTED TO PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT BE
 COMPLETED; 

CONSTRUCTION
 COSTS OF A PROJECT MAY EXCEED ORIGINAL ESTIMATES POSSIBLY MAKING THE
 PROJECT ECONOMICALLY UNFEASIBLE; 

PROJECTS
 MAY BE DELAYED DUE TO, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS,
 ENTITLEMENT AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, LABOR SHORTAGES, OR UNFORESEEN
 COMPLICATIONS; 

OCCUPANCY
 RATES AND RENTS AT A COMPLETED PROJECT MAY BE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED;
 AND 

EXPENSES
 AT PROJECTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN
ANTICIPATED. 

THESE
RISKS MAY REDUCE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY S
STOCKHOLDERS. FURTHER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE
GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
REGARDING THESE RISKS, PLEASE SEE ADVERSE EFFECT TO PROPERTY INCOME AND VALUE
DUE TO GENERAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT RISKS. 

THE GEOGRAPHIC
CONCENTRATION OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S PROPERTIES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN
LOCAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING
RESULTS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP GENERATED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF
RENTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, FROM PROPERTIES
CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (LOS ANGELES, ORANGE, SANTA
BARBARA, SAN DIEGO, AND VENTURA COUNTIES), NORTHERN CALIFORNIA (THE SAN
FRANCISCO BAY AREA), AND THE SEATTLE METROPOLITAN AREA. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,
81 OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S PROPERTY REVENUES WERE GENERATED
FROM PROPERTIES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION COULD
PRESENT RISKS IF LOCAL PROPERTY MARKET PERFORMANCE FALLS BELOW EXPECTATIONS. THE
ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THESE MARKETS COULD AFFECT OCCUPANCY, MARKET RENTAL RATES,
AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS IMPACT THE INCOME GENERATED FROM THE PROPERTIES AND
THEIR UNDERLYING ASSET VALUES. THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MAJOR LOCAL EMPLOYERS
ALSO MAY IMPACT THE CASH 

10 

FLOW AND
VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THE PROPERTIES. THIS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PAY
EXPECTED DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

COMPETITION IN
THE APARTMENT COMMUNITY MARKET MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATIONS AND THE RENTAL
DEMAND FOR OUR PROPERTIES - THERE ARE NUMEROUS HOUSING ALTERNATIVES THAT
COMPETE WITH OUR APARTMENT COMMUNITIES IN ATTRACTING RESIDENTS. THESE INCLUDE
OTHER APARTMENT COMMUNITIES AND SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR RENT
IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. THE PROPERTIES ALSO COMPETE
FOR RESIDENTS WITH NEW AND EXISTING HOMES AND CONDOMINIUMS THAT ARE FOR SALE. IF
THE DEMAND FOR OUR PROPERTIES IS REDUCED OR IF COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND/OR
ACQUIRE COMPETING PROPERTIES ON A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, RENTAL RATES MAY
DROP, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ALSO
FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, BUSINESSES AND OTHER
ENTITIES IN THE ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF APARTMENT COMMUNITIES.
SOME OF THE COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE
DO. THIS COMPETITION MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN COSTS AND PRICES OF APARTMENT
COMMUNITIES THAT WE ACQUIRE AND/OR DEVELOP. 

DIVIDEND
REQUIREMENTS AS A RESULT OF PREFERRED STOCK MAY LEAD TO A POSSIBLE INABILITY TO
SUSTAIN DIVIDENDS -
 WE HAVE SERIES F CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK SERIES F
PREFERRED STOCK WITH AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF APPROXIMATELY 25
MILLION OUTSTANDING AND SERIES G CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK SERIES
G PREFERRED STOCK WITH AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF APPROXIMATELY
 149.5 MILLION OUTSTANDING. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER LIMITED
CONDITIONS TO ISSUE SERIES B CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK SERIES B
PREFERRED STOCK WITH AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF 80 MILLION AND
SERIES D CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK WITH
AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF 50 MILLION IN EACH CASE IN EXCHANGE FOR
OUTSTANDING PREFERRED INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE TERMS OF THE
SERIES B, D, F AND G PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN CUMULATIVE PREFERENTIAL
CASH DISTRIBUTIONS PER EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK. 

THESE
TERMS ALSO PROVIDE THAT WHILE SUCH PREFERRED STOCK IS OUTSTANDING, WE CANNOT
AUTHORIZE, DECLARE, OR PAY ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, UNLESS ALL
DISTRIBUTIONS ACCUMULATED ON ALL SHARES OF SUCH PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID
IN FULL. OUR FAILURE TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS ON SUCH PREFERRED STOCK WOULD IMPAIR
OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT LIMITS
OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR PREFERRED STOCK IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY A
FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. 

IF THE
COMPANY WISHES TO ISSUE ANY COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE (INCLUDING UPON THE
EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS), THE FUNDS REQUIRED TO CONTINUE TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS
AT CURRENT LEVELS WILL BE INCREASED. THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO PAY
DIVIDENDS WILL DEPEND LARGELY UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CURRENT PROPERTIES AND
OTHER PROPERTIES THAT MAY BE ACQUIRED OR DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE. 

IF THE
COMPANY CANNOT PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK, THE COMPANY S STATUS AS A REAL
ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST MAY BE JEOPARDIZED. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR
COMMON STOCK IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW. UNDER
THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE A DISTRIBUTION ON
STOCK IF, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO SUCH DISTRIBUTION, EITHER: 

WE
 WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS AS IT BECOMES DUE IN THE USUAL
 COURSE OF BUSINESS; OR 

OUR
 TOTAL ASSETS WOULD BE LESS THAN OUR TOTAL LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE
 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE ON OUR SERIES B, SERIES D, SERIES F, AND SERIES G
 PREFERRED STOCK. 

RESALE OF SHARES
PURSUANT TO OUR EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR THAT ARE ISSUED UPON
CONVERSION OF OUR CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS THE FOLLOWING
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENTS, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE RESALE INTO THE PUBLIC
STOCK OF COMMON STOCK HELD BY STOCKHOLDERS, AS SPECIFIED IN THE REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS: 

A
 REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DECLARED EFFECTIVE IN 2003, WHICH COVERS THE
 RESALE OF CERTAIN SHARES, INCLUDING (I) UP TO 2,270,490 SHARES OF COMMON
 STOCK THAT ARE ISSUABLE UPON EXCHANGE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN
 THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND (II) UP TO 1,473,125 SHARES THAT ARE
 ISSUABLE UPON EXCHANGE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN CERTAIN OTHER
 REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS; 

REGISTRATION
 STATEMENTS, DECLARED EFFECTIVE IN 2006, THAT COVER (I) THE RESALE OF UP TO
 142,076 SHARES ISSUABLE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WATERFORD AND VISTA
 BELVEDERE ACQUISITIONS AND (II) THE RESALE OF SHARES ISSUABLE IN
 CONNECTION WITH THE EXCHANGE RIGHTS OF OUR 3.625 EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR
 NOTES, AS TO WHICH THERE IS A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 225 MILLION
 OUTSTANDING. 

DURING
THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, WE ISSUED, PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT,
5,980,000 SHARES OF 4.875 SERIES G CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK FOR ESTIMATED
GROSS PROCEEDS OF 149.5 MILLION; SUCH SHARES ARE CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO

11 

CERTAIN
CONDITIONS, INTO COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD BE RESOLD INTO THE PUBLIC
MARKET. 

THE
RESALE OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THESE VARIOUS REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS OR THAT ARE ISSUED UPON CONVERSION OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR
SHARES. 

THE EXCHANGE AND
REPURCHASE RIGHTS OF EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES AND SERIES G PREFERRED
STOCK MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK - THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS 225 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.625 EXCHANGEABLE
SENIOR NOTES (THE NOTES OUTSTANDING WHICH MATURE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2025. THE
NOTES ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 1,
2020 OR PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1, 2020 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE NOTES ARE
REDEEMABLE AT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OPTION FOR CASH AT ANY TIME ON OR
AFTER NOVEMBER 4, 2010 AND ARE SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE FOR CASH AT THE OPTION OF
THE HOLDER ON NOVEMBER 1 ST IN THE
YEARS 2010, 2015 AND 2020, OR UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS. THE NOTES
ARE SENIOR UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED OBLIGATIONS OF THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP. 

IN 2006,
THE COMPANY SOLD 5,980,000 SHARES OF 4.875 SERIES G CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK (THE SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF 149.5
MILLION. HOLDERS MAY CONVERT SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK INTO SHARES OF
THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE
CONVERSION RATE WILL INITIALLY BE .1830 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER 25 SHARE
LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF
 136.62 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK (THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO
ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED EVENTS). ON OR AFTER JULY
31, 2011, THE COMPANY MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSE SOME OR ALL OF THE
SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK TO BE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE THEN
PREVAILING CONVERSION RATE. FURTHER, IF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OCCURS,
AS DEFINED IN THE ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY FOR THE SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK, THEN
THE HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE ALL OR PART OF THEIR SERIES G
PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. 

THE
EXCHANGE OF THE NOTES AND/OR SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK FOR COMMON STOCK WOULD
DILUTE STOCKHOLDER OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY, AND SUCH EXCHANGE COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL
THROUGH THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES. IF THE NOTES AND
SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK ARE NOT EXCHANGED, THE REPURCHASE PRICE OF THE NOTES
AND SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK MAY DISCOURAGE OR IMPEDE TRANSACTIONS THAT MIGHT
OTHERWISE BE IN THE INTEREST OF THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, THESE
REPURCHASE RIGHTS MAY BE TRIGGERED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO
CONSERVE ITS CASH RESERVES, IN WHICH EVENT SUCH REPURCHASE MIGHT ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE COMPANY AND ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. 

OUR FUTURE
ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK - IN ORDER TO FINANCE OUR
PROPERTY ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE ISSUED AND SOLD COMMON
STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES. FOR EXAMPLE,
DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SOLD 1,500,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN A PUBLIC
OFFERING FOR PROCEEDS OF 191.8 MILLION, NET OF UNDERWRITER FEES AND
EXPENSES. DURING 2007 AND 2006, PURSUANT TO A CONTROLLED EQUITY
OFFERING PROGRAM THAT THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO WITH CANTOR FITZGERALD CO.,
THE COMPANY ISSUED AND SOLD APPROXIMATELY 170,500 AND 427,700 SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK FOR 21.9 MILLION AND 48.3 MILLION, NET OF FEES AND COMMISSIONS,
RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY MAY IN THE FUTURE SELL FURTHER SHARES OF
COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO A CONTROLLED EQUITY OFFERING PROGRAM WITH CANTOR
FITZGERALD CO. 

IN 2006,
THE COMPANY ISSUED 5,980,000 SHARES OF 4.875 SERIES G CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 149.5
MILLION. IN 2005, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP SOLD 225 MILLION
PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.625 EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES, WHICH ARE EXCHANGEABLE
INTO THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. 

DURING
THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A NEW SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT
WITH THE SEC, ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO SELL AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF EQUITY AND
DEBT SECURITIES AS DEFINED IN THE PROSPECTUS. FUTURE SALES OF COMMON
STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY DILUTE STOCKHOLDER
OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE
COMMON STOCK. 

OUR CHAIRMAN IS
INVOLVED IN OTHER REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - OUR CHAIRMAN, GEORGE M. MARCUS IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE
OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND IS INVOLVED IN OTHER REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES
AND INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MR. MARCUS OWNS
INTERESTS IN VARIOUS OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS. HE IS
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MARCUS MILLICHAP COMPANY, OR TMMC ), WHICH IS A
HOLDING COMPANY FOR CERTAIN REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE AND SERVICES COMPANIES. TMMC
HAS AN INTEREST IN PACIFIC PROPERTY COMPANY, A COMPANY THAT INVESTS IN APARTMENT
COMMUNITIES. 

12 

MR.
MARCUS HAS AGREED NOT TO DIVULGE ANY INFORMATION THAT MAY BE RECEIVED BY HIM IN
HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY TO ANY OF HIS AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND
THAT HE WILL ABSTAIN HIS VOTE ON ANY AND ALL RESOLUTIONS BY THE COMPANY S BOARD
OF DIRECTORS REGARDING ANY PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF AN
APARTMENT COMMUNITY WHERE IT APPEARS THAT THERE MAY BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
WITH ANY OF HIS AFFILIATED COMPANIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS AGREEMENT, MR.
MARCUS AND HIS AFFILIATED ENTITIES MAY POTENTIALLY COMPETE WITH US IN ACQUIRING
AND/OR DEVELOPING APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, WHICH COMPETITION MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO
US. IN ADDITION, DUE TO SUCH POTENTIAL COMPETITION FOR REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENTS, MR. MARCUS AND HIS AFFILIATED ENTITIES MAY HAVE A CONFLICT OF
INTEREST WITH US, WHICH MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY S
STOCKHOLDERS. 

THE INFLUENCE OF
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO
HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK - AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, GEORGE M. MARCUS, THE
CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY OWNED 1,768,773 SHARES
OF COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING SHARES ISSUABLE UPON EXCHANGE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTNERSHIPS AND
ASSUMING EXERCISE OF ALL VESTED OPTIONS). THIS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 7.1 OF
THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MR. MARCUS CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE
MAJORITY CONTROL OVER US. HOWEVER, HE CURRENTLY HAS, AND LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO
HAVE, SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE ACTIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, HIS
INFLUENCE COULD RESULT IN DECISIONS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE INTERESTS OF ALL OUR
STOCKHOLDERS. 

UNDER THE
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE CONSENT OF THE HOLDERS
OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IS GENERALLY REQUIRED FOR ANY AMENDMENT OF THE
AGREEMENT AND FOR CERTAIN EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS. THROUGH THEIR OWNERSHIP OF
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS AND THEIR POSITIONS WITH US, OUR DIRECTORS AND
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING MR. MARCUS, HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE ON US.
CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR INFLUENCE COULD RESULT IN DECISIONS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE
INTERESTS OF ALL STOCKHOLDERS. 

THE VOTING RIGHTS
OF PREFERRED STOCK MAY ALLOW HOLDERS OF PREFERRED STOCK TO IMPEDE ACTIONS THAT
OTHERWISE BENEFIT HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK - IN GENERAL, THE HOLDERS OF
OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK DO NOT HAVE ANY VOTING RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, IF FULL DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT MADE ON ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK
FOR SIX QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS PERIODS, THE HOLDERS OF PREFERRED STOCK WHO HAVE
NOT RECEIVED DISTRIBUTIONS, VOTING TOGETHER AS A SINGLE CLASS, WILL HAVE THE
RIGHT TO ELECT TWO ADDITIONAL DIRECTORS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF
DIRECTORS. 

THESE
VOTING RIGHTS CONTINUE UNTIL ALL DISTRIBUTIONS IN ARREARS AND DISTRIBUTIONS FOR
THE CURRENT QUARTERLY PERIOD ON THE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL. AT
THAT TIME, THE HOLDERS OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ARE DIVESTED OF THESE VOTING
RIGHTS, AND THE TERM AND OFFICE OF THE DIRECTORS SO ELECTED IMMEDIATELY
TERMINATES. WHILE ANY SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK ARE OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY
MAY NOT, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE HOLDERS OF TWO-THIRDS OF THE OUTSTANDING
SHARES OF EACH SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK, EACH VOTING SEPARATELY AS A SINGLE
CLASS: 

AUTHORIZE
 OR CREATE ANY CLASS OR SERIES OF STOCK THAT RANKS SENIOR TO SUCH PREFERRED
 STOCK WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, RIGHTS UPON LIQUIDATION,
 DISSOLUTION OR WINDING-UP OF OUR
BUSINESS; 

AMEND,
 ALTER OR REPEAL THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY S CHARTER OR BYLAWS,
 INCLUDING BY MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION, THAT WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
 AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF SUCH SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK;
 OR 

IN
 THE CASE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK INTO WHICH OUR PREFERRED UNITS ARE
 EXCHANGEABLE, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANOTHER ENTITY OR TRANSFER
 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS TO ANOTHER ENTITY, EXCEPT IF SUCH
 PREFERRED STOCK REMAINS OUTSTANDING WITH THE SURVIVING ENTITY AND HAS THE
 SAME TERMS AND IN CERTAIN OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

THESE
VOTING RIGHTS OF THE PREFERRED STOCK MAY ALLOW HOLDERS OF PREFERRED STOCK TO
IMPEDE OR VETO ACTIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BENEFIT THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON
STOCK. 

THE REDEMPTION
RIGHTS OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED UNITS, SERIES D PREFERRED UNITS, SERIES F
PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO HOLDERS OF
THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK - UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF
ONE OF THE FOLLOWING EVENTS, THE TERMS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S SERIES B
AND D PREFERRED UNITS REQUIRE IT TO REDEEM ALL OF SUCH UNITS AND THE TERMS OF
THE COMPANY S SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK AND THE SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDE
THE HOLDERS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK AND
SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REDEEM ALL OF SUCH
STOCK: 

THE
 COMPANY COMPLETES A GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTION AND ITS COMMON STOCK IS NO
 LONGER REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS
 AMENDED; 

THE
 COMPANY COMPLETES A CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER OR SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL
 OF ITS ASSETS AND THE SURVIVING ENTITY S DEBT SECURITIES DO NOT POSSESS AN
 INVESTMENT GRADE RATING; 

THE
 COMPANY FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT;
OR 

IN
 THE CASE OF SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK, THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK IS NOT
 TRADED ON A MAJOR EXCHANGE. 

THE
AGGREGATE REDEMPTION PRICE OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED UNITS WOULD BE 80 MILLION,
THE AGGREGATE REDEMPTION PRICE OF THE SERIES D PREFERRED UNITS WOULD BE 50
MILLION, THE AGGREGATE REDEMPTION PRICE OF THE SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK

13 

WOULD BE
 25 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE REDEMPTION PRICE OF THE SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK
WOULD BE 149.5 MILLION, PLUS, IN EACH CASE, ANY ACCUMULATED
DISTRIBUTIONS. 

THESE
REDEMPTION RIGHTS MAY DISCOURAGE OR IMPEDE TRANSACTIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE
IN THE INTEREST OF HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, THESE REDEMPTION RIGHTS
MIGHT TRIGGER SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO CONSERVE ITS CASH RESERVES,
IN WHICH EVENT SUCH REDEMPTION MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY AND ITS COMMON
HOLDERS. 

MARYLAND BUSINESS
COMBINATION LAW MAY NOT ALLOW CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS
AFFILIATES TO PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAW - UNDER MARYLAND LAW,
 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BETWEEN A MARYLAND CORPORATION AND AN INTERESTED
STOCKHOLDER OR AN AFFILIATE OF AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER ARE PROHIBITED FOR FIVE
YEARS AFTER THE MOST RECENT DATE ON WHICH THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER BECOMES AN
INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER. THESE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INCLUDE A MERGER,
CONSOLIDATION, SHARE EXCHANGE, OR, IN CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE, AN
ASSET TRANSFER OR ISSUANCE OR RECLASSIFICATION OF EQUITY SECURITIES. AN
INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER IS DEFINED AS ANY PERSON (AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES OF SUCH
PERSON) WHO BENEFICIALLY OWNS TEN PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE
THEN-OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK. THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES A SUPERMAJORITY STOCKHOLDER
VOTE FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS. THIS MEANS THAT THE TRANSACTION MUST BE APPROVED BY
AT LEAST: 

80 
 OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST BY HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES;
 AND 

TWO-THIRDS
 OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST BY HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES
 OTHER THAN SHARES HELD BY THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER WITH WHOM THE
 BUSINESS COMBINATION IS TO BE
EFFECTED. 

THE
STATUTE PERMITS VARIOUS EXEMPTIONS FROM ITS PROVISIONS, INCLUDING BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS THAT ARE EXEMPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT
THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER BECOMES AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER. THESE
VOTING PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY IF THE STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE A MINIMUM PRICE, AS
DEFINED UNDER MARYLAND LAW. AS PERMITTED BY THE STATUTE, THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY IRREVOCABLY HAS ELECTED TO EXEMPT ANY BUSINESS
COMBINATION BY US, GEORGE M. MARCUS, WILLIAM A. MILLICHAP, WHO ARE THE CHAIRMAN
AND A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, RESPECTIVELY, AND TMMC OR ANY ENTITY OWNED OR
CONTROLLED BY MESSRS. MARCUS AND MILLICHAP AND TMMC. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FIVE-YEAR
PROHIBITION AND SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL NOT APPLY TO
ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION BETWEEN US AND MR. MARCUS, MR. MILLICHAP, OR TMMC. AS A
RESULT, WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ENTER INTO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH MESSRS.
MARCUS AND MILLICHAP AND TMMC, WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTE
REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION
LAW. 

ANTI-TAKEOVER
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, CHARTER, BYLAWS,
AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW COULD DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN
CONTROL - WHILE
THE COMPANY IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND
GENERALLY HAS FULL AND EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCRETION IN THE MANAGEMENT
AND CONTROL OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT PLACE LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO ACT WITH
RESPECT TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. SUCH LIMITATIONS COULD DELAY, DEFER OR
PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE
FOR OUR STOCK OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OR THAT
COULD OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. THE
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT IF THE LIMITED PARTNERS OWN AT LEAST 5 OF
THE OUTSTANDING UNITS OF PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE
COMPANY CANNOT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE CONSENT OF A MAJORITY-IN-INTEREST OF
THE LIMITED PARTNERS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, TRANSFER ALL OR ANY PORTION
OF OUR GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO ANOTHER ENTITY.
SUCH LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO ACT MAY RESULT IN OUR BEING
PRECLUDED FROM TAKING ACTION THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES IS IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE LIMITED
PARTNERS HELD OR CONTROLLED APPROXIMATELY 9.1 OF THE OUTSTANDING UNITS OF
PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, ALLOWING SUCH ACTIONS TO BE
BLOCKED BY THE LIMITED PARTNERS. 

THE
COMPANY S CHARTER AUTHORIZES THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
OR PREFERRED STOCK AND THE SETTING OF THE PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND OTHER TERMS OF
SUCH PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE HOLDERS OF THE COMMON STOCK. WE
MAY ESTABLISH ONE OR MORE SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK THAT COULD DELAY DEFER OR
PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL. SUCH A TRANSACTION MIGHT INVOLVE A
PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR STOCK OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOLDERS
OF COMMON STOCK. ALSO, SUCH A CLASS OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD HAVE DIVIDEND,
VOTING OR OTHER RIGHTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INTEREST OF HOLDERS OF
COMMON STOCK. 

THE
COMPANY S CHARTER, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, CONTAINS
OTHER PROVISIONS THAT MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN
CONTROL THAT MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. THE
COMPANY S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN IS DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO PREVENT A
PERSON OR GROUP FROM GAINING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WITHOUT OFFERING A FAIR
PRICE TO ALL OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. THE BYLAWS MAY BE AMENDED BY THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT,
ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY PRESENTLY HAS NO SUCH INTENTION. THE CHARTER CONTAINS
OWNERSHIP PROVISIONS LIMITING THE TRANSFERABILITY AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF
CAPITAL STOCK, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING, DEFERRING OR PREVENTING A
TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN 

14 

CONTROL.
FOR EXAMPLE, SUBJECT TO RECEIVING AN EXEMPTION FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS MAY NOT PURCHASE MORE THAN 6 IN VALUE OF THE STOCK (OTHER
THAN QUALIFIED PENSION TRUSTS WHICH CAN ACQUIRE 9.9 ). THIS MAY DISCOURAGE
TENDER OFFERS THAT MAY BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND LIMIT
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STOCKHOLDERS TO RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK. 

THE
MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATIONS LAW RESTRICTS THE VOTING RIGHTS OF SHARES DEEMED
TO BE CONTROL SHARES. UNDER THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATIONS
LAW, CONTROL SHARES ARE THOSE WHICH, WHEN AGGREGATED WITH ANY OTHER SHARES
HELD BY THE ACQUIRER, ENTITLE THE ACQUIRER TO EXERCISE VOTING POWER WITHIN
SPECIFIED RANGES. ALTHOUGH THE BYLAWS EXEMPT THE COMPANY FROM THE CONTROL SHARE
PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATIONS LAW, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY
AMEND OR ELIMINATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BYLAWS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE.
MOREOVER, ANY SUCH AMENDMENT OR ELIMINATION OF SUCH PROVISION OF THE BYLAWS MAY
RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE CONTROL SHARE PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND
GENERAL CORPORATIONS LAW NOT ONLY TO CONTROL SHARES WHICH MAY BE ACQUIRED IN THE
FUTURE, BUT ALSO TO CONTROL SHARES PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED. IF THE PROVISIONS OF THE
BYLAWS ARE AMENDED OR ELIMINATED, THE CONTROL SHARE PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND
GENERAL CORPORATIONS LAW COULD DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR CHANGE
IN CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR THE STOCK OR OTHERWISE BE IN
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. 

THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP S JOINT VENTURES AND JOINT OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES AND PARTIAL
INTERESTS IN CORPORATIONS AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS COULD LIMIT THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO CONTROL SUCH PROPERTIES AND PARTIAL
INTERESTS - 
INSTEAD OF PURCHASING APARTMENT COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY, WE HAVE INVESTED AND MAY
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN JOINT VENTURES. JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS OFTEN
HAVE SHARED CONTROL OVER THE OPERATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE ASSETS. THEREFORE,
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A JOINT VENTURE PARTNER IN AN INVESTMENT MIGHT BECOME
BANKRUPT, OR HAVE ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT
WITH OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS, OR BE IN A POSITION TO TAKE ACTION
CONTRARY TO OUR INSTRUCTIONS OR REQUESTS, OR OUR POLICIES OR OBJECTIVES.
CONSEQUENTLY, A JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ACTIONS MIGHT SUBJECT PROPERTY OWNED BY
THE JOINT VENTURE TO ADDITIONAL RISK. ALTHOUGH WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT
INFLUENCE OVER ANY JOINT VENTURE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO
TAKE ACTION WITHOUT OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS APPROVAL, OR JOINT VENTURE
PARTNERS COULD TAKE ACTIONS BINDING ON THE JOINT VENTURE WITHOUT OUR
CONSENT. SHOULD A JOINT VENTURE PARTNER BECOME BANKRUPT, WE COULD
BECOME LIABLE FOR SUCH PARTNER S SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE
LIABILITIES. 

FROM TIME
TO TIME, WE, THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, INVEST IN CORPORATIONS, LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN
FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING, DEVELOPING OR MANAGING REAL PROPERTY. IN
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S INTEREST IN A PARTICULAR
ENTITY MAY BE LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING INTERESTS OF THAT
ENTITY. THEREFORE, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO CONTROL THE DAILY
OPERATIONS OF SUCH AN ENTITY MAY BE LIMITED. FURTHERMORE, THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP MAY NOT HAVE THE POWER TO REMOVE A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS (IN THE CASE OF A CORPORATION) OR THE GENERAL PARTNER OR PARTNERS (IN
THE CASE OF A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP) OF SUCH AN ENTITY IN THE EVENT THAT ITS
OPERATIONS CONFLICT WITH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S OBJECTIVES. THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF ITS INTERESTS IN SUCH AN ENTITY. IN
THE EVENT THAT SUCH AN ENTITY BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY
LOSE UP TO ITS ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN AND ANY ADVANCES TO THE ENTITY. WE HAVE, AND
IN THE FUTURE MAY, ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY THE TAX
LIABILITIES OF PARTNERS, WHICH CONTRIBUTE ASSETS INTO JOINT VENTURES OR THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, IN THE EVENT THAT CERTAIN TAXABLE EVENTS, WHICH ARE
WITHIN OUR CONTROL, OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE PLAN TO HOLD THE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS OR
DEFER RECOGNITION OF GAIN ON THEIR SALE PURSUANT TO THE LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE RULES
UNDER SECTION 1031 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO AND IF SUCH TAX LIABILITIES WERE INCURRED THEY CAN
EXPECT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. 

DEDICATED
INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FUND II -
FUND II INVOLVES RISKS TO US SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING: 

OUR
 PARTNERS IN FUND II MIGHT REMOVE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AS THE GENERAL
 PARTNER OF FUND II; 

OUR
 PARTNERS IN FUND II MIGHT BECOME BANKRUPT (IN WHICH EVENT WE MIGHT BECOME
 GENERALLY LIABLE FOR THE LIABILITIES OF FUND
 II); 

OUR
 PARTNERS IN FUND II MIGHT HAVE ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS
 THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR
 GOALS; 

OUR
 PARTNERS IN FUND II MIGHT FAIL TO FUND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AS
 CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED; OR 

OUR
 PARTNERS IN FUND II MIGHT FAIL TO APPROVE DECISIONS REGARDING FUND II THAT
 ARE IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S BEST
 INTEREST. 

WE WILL,
HOWEVER, GENERALLY SEEK TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE OVER FUND II TO PERMIT
IT TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. 

15 

INVESTMENTS IN
MORTGAGES AND OTHER REAL ESTATE SECURITIES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP
MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS. THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP MAY PURCHASE SECURITIES ISSUED BY ENTITIES WHICH OWN REAL ESTATE AND
INVEST IN MORTGAGES OR UNSECURED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THESE MORTGAGES MAY BE FIRST,
SECOND OR THIRD MORTGAGES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE INSURED OR OTHERWISE
GUARANTEED. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING
RISKS: 

THAT
 THE VALUE OF MORTGAGED PROPERTY MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS OWED, CAUSING
 REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES; 

THE
 BORROWER MAY NOT PAY INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE MORTGAGE WHEN DUE, REQUIRING
 US TO FORECLOSE, AND THE AMOUNT RECOVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
 FORECLOSURE MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT
OWED; 

THAT
 INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ON THE MORTGAGES MAY BE LOWER THAN OUR COST OF
 FUNDS; AND 

IN
 THE CASE OF JUNIOR MORTGAGES, THAT FORECLOSURE OF A SENIOR MORTGAGE WOULD
 ELIMINATE THE JUNIOR MORTGAGE. 

IF ANY OF
THE ABOVE WERE TO OCCUR, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE
EXPECTED DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

POSSIBLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS,
ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS, AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL ESTATE IS LIABLE FOR
THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES ON,
IN, TO OR MIGRATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT
REGARD AS TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR OPERATOR KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE
PRESENCE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SUBSTANCES,
OR THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY REMEDIATE SUCH SUBSTANCES, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
OWNER S OR OPERATOR S ABILITY TO SELL OR RENT SUCH PROPERTY OR TO BORROW USING
SUCH PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. PERSONS EXPOSED TO SUCH SUBSTANCES, EITHER THROUGH
SOIL VAPOR OR INGESTION OF THE SUBSTANCES MAY CLAIM PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGES.
PERSONS WHO ARRANGE FOR THE DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC
SUBSTANCES OR WASTES ALSO MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION
OF SUCH SUBSTANCES AT THE DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT FACILITY TO WHICH SUCH
SUBSTANCES OR WASTES WERE SENT, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH FACILITY IS OWNED OR
OPERATED BY SUCH PERSON. CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR RELEASE
OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING MATERIALS ACMS INTO THE AIR, AND THIRD PARTIES MAY
SEEK RECOVERY FROM OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF REAL PROPERTIES FOR PERSONAL INJURY
ASSOCIATED WITH ACMS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE OWNERSHIP (DIRECT OR INDIRECT),
OPERATION, MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF REAL PROPERTIES, THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP COULD BE CONSIDERED AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF SUCH PROPERTIES OR AS
HAVING ARRANGED FOR THE DISPOSAL OR TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES
AND, THEREFORE, MAY BE POTENTIALLY LIABLE FOR REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION COSTS, AS
WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL FINES AND COSTS RELATED TO
INJURIES OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY. 

INVESTMENTS
IN REAL PROPERTY CREATE A POTENTIAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ON THE PART OF
THE OWNER OF SUCH REAL PROPERTY. WE CARRY CERTAIN LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR
THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK. WE HAVE CONDUCTED ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES WHICH
REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION AT CERTAIN PROPERTIES. SUCH
CONTAMINATION AT CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MIGRATED
ON-SITE FROM ADJACENT INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. THE FORMER INDUSTRIAL
USERS OF THE PROPERTIES WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION. THE
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES NOTED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED ADJACENT TO ANY
POSSIBLE DOWN GRADIENT FROM SITES WITH KNOWN GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION, THE
LATERAL LIMITS OF WHICH MAY EXTEND ONTO SUCH PROPERTIES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL
STUDIES ALSO NOTED THAT AT CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES, CONTAMINATION EXISTED
BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF UNDERGROUND FUEL STORAGE TANKS, WHICH HAVE BEEN
REMOVED. IN GENERAL, IN CONNECTION WITH THE OWNERSHIP, OPERATION, FINANCING,
MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF REAL PROPERTIES, WE MAY BE POTENTIALLY LIABLE FOR
REMOVAL OR CLEAN-UP COSTS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL FINES AND COSTS RELATED TO
INJURIES TO PERSONS AND PROPERTY. 

RECENTLY
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF LAWSUITS AGAINST OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF
APARTMENT COMMUNITIES ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE
PRESENCE OF MOLD IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. SOME OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE
RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS. THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN SUED FOR MOLD RELATED MATTERS AND HAS SETTLED
SOME, BUT NOT ALL, SUCH MATTERS, WHICH MATTERS REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND
PENDING. INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE REACTED TO MOLD RELATED
LIABILITY AWARDS BY EXCLUDING MOLD RELATED CLAIMS FROM STANDARD POLICIES AND
PRICING MOLD ENDORSEMENTS AT PROHIBITIVELY HIGH RATES. THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP HAS, HOWEVER, PURCHASED POLLUTION LIABILITY INSURANCE, WHICH
INCLUDES LIMITED COVERAGE FOR MOLD, ALTHOUGH THE INSURANCE MAY NOT COVER ALL
PENDING OR FUTURE MOLD CLAIMS. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS ADOPTED
PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MANAGE THE EXISTENCE OF MOLD IN ITS PROPERTIES AS WELL AS
GUIDELINES FOR PROMPTLY ADDRESSING AND RESOLVING REPORTS OF MOLD TO MINIMIZE ANY
IMPACT MOLD MIGHT HAVE ON RESIDENTS OR THE PROPERTY. THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL NOT BE SUED IN THE FUTURE FOR MOLD
RELATED MATTERS AND CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH
CURRENT OR FUTURE MOLD RELATED MATTERS WILL NOT BE SUBSTANTIAL. THE
COSTS OF CARRYING INSURANCE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL MOLD RELATED CLAIMS MAY ALSO BE
SUBSTANTIAL.

CALIFORNIA
HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PROPOSITION 65 REQUIRING THAT
 CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNINGS BE GIVEN TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO
CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE
TOXICITY, INCLUDING TOBACCO SMOKE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOUGHT TO COMPLY WITH
PROPOSITION 65 REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY LITIGATION RELATING TO PROPOSITION 65. 

METHANE
GAS IS A NATURALLY-OCCURRING GAS THAT IS COMMONLY FOUND BELOW THE SURFACE IN
SEVERAL AREAS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL AREAS. 
METHANE IS A NON-TOXIC GAS, BUT CAN BE IGNITABLE IN CONFINED SPACES. 
ALTHOUGH NATURALLY-OCCURRING, METHANE GAS IS NOT REGULATED AT THE STATE OR
FEDERAL LEVEL, SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, HAVE
IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS THAT NEW BUILDINGS INSTALL DETECTION SYSTEMS IN AREAS WHERE
METHANE GAS IS KNOWN TO BE LOCATED. 

METHANE
GAS IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS FORMER
MUNICIPAL WASTE LANDFILLS. RADON IS ALSO A NATURALLY-OCCURRING GAS
THAT IS FOUND BELOW THE SURFACE. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COSTS RELATED TO ITS
COMPLIANCE WITH METHANE GAS RELATED REQUIREMENTS OR LITIGATION COSTS RELATED TO
METHANE OR RADON GAS. 

THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS ALMOST NO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS FROM THIRD
PARTIES FOR POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP COSTS AT ITS PROPERTIES. THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS NO WAY OF DETERMINING AT THIS TIME THE MAGNITUDE OF
ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO WHICH IT MAY BE SUBJECT ARISING OUT OF UNKNOWN
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR VIOLATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTIES FORMERLY
OWNED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT EXISTING
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE PROPERTIES REVEAL ALL
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, THAT ANY PRIOR OWNER OR OPERATOR OF A PROPERTY DID
NOT CREATE ANY MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION NOT KNOWN TO THE OPERATING
PARTNERSHIP, OR THAT A MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION DOES NOT EXIST AS TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE PROPERTIES. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS LIMITED INSURANCE
COVERAGE FOR THE TYPES OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES DESCRIBED
ABOVE. 

GENERAL UNINSURED
LOSSES - THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CARRIES COMPREHENSIVE LIABILITY, FIRE,
EXTENDED COVERAGE AND RENTAL LOSS INSURANCE FOR EACH OF THE PROPERTIES. THERE
ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN TYPES OF EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES, SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE,
LOSSES FOR TERRORISM OR EARTHQUAKE, FOR WHICH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP DOES NOT
HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN
AREAS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY. IN JANUARY 2007, THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANCELED ITS THEN EXISTING EARTHQUAKE POLICY AND
ESTABLISHED A WHOLLY OWNED INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, PACIFIC WESTERN INSURANCE LLC PWI ). THROUGH PWI, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IS SELF-INSURED AS IT
RELATES TO EARTHQUAKE RELATED LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF JANUARY
2008, PWI PROVIDES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST 5.0
MILLION OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S PROPERTY LEVEL INSURANCE CLAIMS PER
INCIDENT. 

ALTHOUGH
THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY CARRY INSURANCE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES ASSOCIATED
WITH ITS PROPERTIES, EMPLOYEES, RESIDENTS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS,
IT MAY STILL INCUR LOSSES DUE TO UNINSURED RISKS, DEDUCTIBLES, CO-PAYMENTS OR
LOSSES IN EXCESS OF APPLICABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THOSE LOSSES MAY BE
MATERIAL. IN THE EVENT OF A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS, INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO COVER THE FULL CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF REPLACEMENT COST OF THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S LOST INVESTMENT. INFLATION, CHANGES IN
BUILDING CODES AND ORDINANCES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS
MIGHT ALSO AFFECT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO REPLACE OR RENOVATE AN
APARTMENT COMMUNITY AFTER IT HAS BEEN DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. 

CHANGES IN REAL
ESTATE TAX AND OTHER LAWS - GENERALLY WE DO NOT DIRECTLY PASS THROUGH
COSTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE TAX LAWS TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY
TENANTS. WE ALSO DO NOT GENERALLY PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN INCOME, SERVICE OR
OTHER TAXES, TO TENANTS UNDER LEASES. THESE COSTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUNDS
FROM OPERATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS.
SIMILARLY, COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN (I) LAWS INCREASING THE POTENTIAL
LIABILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS EXISTING ON PROPERTIES OR THE
RESTRICTIONS ON DISCHARGES OR OTHER CONDITIONS OR (II) RENT CONTROL OR RENT
STABILIZATION LAWS OR OTHER LAWS REGULATING HOUSING MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
UNANTICIPATED DECREASE IN REVENUE OR INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES, WHICH WOULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO
STOCKHOLDERS. 

CHANGES IN
FINANCING POLICY; NO LIMITATION ON DEBT WE HAVE ADOPTED A POLICY OF
MAINTAINING A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-MARKET-CAPITALIZATION RATIO OF LESS THAN 50 . THE
CALCULATION OF DEBT-TO-TOTAL-MARKET-CAPITALIZATION IS AS FOLLOWS: TOTAL
INDEBTEDNESS DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS PLUS TOTAL EQUITY MARKET
CAPITALIZATION. AS USED IN THIS CALCULATION, TOTAL EQUITY MARKET
CAPITALIZATION IS EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES
OF COMMON STOCK (BASED ON THE GREATER OF CURRENT MARKET PRICE OR THE GROSS
PROCEEDS PER SHARE FROM PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES PLUS ANY
UNDISTRIBUTED NET CASH FLOW), ASSUMING THE CONVERSION OF ALL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND THE GROSS
PROCEEDS OF THE PREFERRED UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. BASED ON THIS CALCULATION
(INCLUDING THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE AND EXCLUDING UNDISTRIBUTED NET CASH FLOW),
OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-MARKET-CAPITALIZATION RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 35.7 AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2007. 

17 

OUR
ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS DO NOT LIMIT THE AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE OF INDEBTEDNESS
THAT MAY BE INCURRED. ACCORDINGLY, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY COULD
CHANGE CURRENT POLICIES AND THE POLICIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP REGARDING
INDEBTEDNESS. IF WE CHANGED THESE POLICIES, WE COULD INCUR MORE DEBT, RESULTING
IN AN INCREASED RISK OF DEFAULT ON OUR OBLIGATIONS AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND AN INCREASE IN DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUCH
INCREASED DEBT COULD EXCEED THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO
CERTAIN TAX RISKS - THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED
TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY S
QUALIFICATION AS A REIT REQUIRES IT TO SATISFY NUMEROUS REQUIREMENTS (SOME ON AN
ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY BASIS) ESTABLISHED UNDER HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE PROVISIONS FOR WHICH THERE ARE ONLY LIMITED JUDICIAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS, AND INVOLVES THE DETERMINATION OF VARIOUS
FACTUAL MATTERS AND CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE COMPANY S CONTROL.
ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY INTENDS THAT ITS CURRENT ORGANIZATION AND METHOD OF
OPERATION ENABLE IT TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT IT
SO QUALIFIES OR THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO REMAIN SO QUALIFIED IN THE FUTURE.
FUTURE LEGISLATION, NEW REGULATIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OR COURT
DECISIONS (ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT) COULD ADVERSELY THE
COMPANY S ABILITY TO QUALIFY AS A REIT OR ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS STOCKHOLDERS. IF
IT FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT
TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX (INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX) ON
ITS TAXABLE INCOME AT CORPORATE RATES, AND WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DEDUCT
DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS IN COMPUTING ITS TAXABLE INCOME. THE COMPANY
MAY ALSO BE DISQUALIFIED FROM TREATMENT AS A REIT FOR THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS
FOLLOWING THE YEAR IN WHICH IT FAILED TO QUALIFY. THE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY
WOULD REDUCE ITS NET EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT OR DISTRIBUTION TO
STOCKHOLDERS, AND IT WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. EVEN IF THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, IT WILL
CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ON ITS INCOME
AND PROPERTY. 

THE
COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED SEVERAL TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES. DESPITE THE COMPANY S
QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, ITS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES MUST PAY U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX ON THEIR TAXABLE INCOME. WHILE THE COMPANY WILL ATTEMPT TO ENSURE
THAT ITS DEALING WITH ITS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT
ITS REIT QUALIFICATION, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL
SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THAT RESULT. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO A
100 PENALTY TAX, OR ITS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE DENIED
DEDUCTIONS, TO THE EXTENT ITS DEALINGS WITH ITS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES ARE
NOT DEEMED TO BE ARM S LENGTH IN NATURE. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN
THAT THE COMPANY S DEALINGS WITH ITS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE ARM S
LENGTH IN NATURE. 

FROM TIME
TO TIME, WE MAY TRANSFER OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF SOME OF OUR PROPERTIES. UNDER
THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, ANY GAIN RESULTING FROM TRANSFERS OF PROPERTIES THAT
WE HOLD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE
OF BUSINESS WOULD BE TREATED AS INCOME FROM A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION SUBJECT TO
A 100 PENALTY TAX. SINCE WE ACQUIRE PROPERTIES FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, WE DO
NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR OCCASIONAL TRANSFERS OR DISPOSALS OF PROPERTY ARE
PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER, WHETHER PROPERTY IS HELD FOR INVESTMENT
PURPOSES IS A QUESTION OF FACT THAT DEPENDS ON ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE MAY CONTEND
THAT CERTAIN TRANSFERS OR DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES BY US ARE PROHIBITED
TRANSACTIONS. IF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WERE TO ARGUE SUCCESSFULLY THAT A
TRANSFER OR DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY CONSTITUTED A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION, THEN
THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A 100 PENALTY TAX ON ANY GAIN ALLOCABLE TO
THE COMPANY FROM THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION AND THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO RETAIN
FUTURE GAINS ON REAL PROPERTY SALES MAY BE JEOPARDIZED. INCOME FROM A
PROHIBITED TRANSACTION MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO SATISFY
THE INCOME TESTS FOR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THEREFORE, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL
BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE INCOME TESTS FOR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.

LACK
OF PROFITABLE OPERATING HISTORY 

THE
COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF PROFITABLE OPERATION. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE
THAT THE COMPANY WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE. THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE
PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, WHETHER THE COMPANY: 

HAS
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES AND
MARKETING EFFORTS; 

 HAS
FUNDS FOR THE CONTINUOUS UPGRADING OF ITS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES;

ACHIEVES
THE PROJECTED SALES REVENUES; 

 CONTROLS
THE COMPANY S OPERATING EXPENSES; 

 CONTINUES
TO ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS; AND 

WITHSTANDS COMPETITION IN THE COMPANY S MARKETPLACE.

COMPETITION 

 THE
COMPANY S COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING AND MAY BE WELL CAPITALIZED AND
FINANCIALLY STRONGER THAN DESTINATION TELEVISION. OUR COMPETITORS COULD
REPRODUCE THE COMPANY S BUSINESS MODEL WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY. 

THE
COMPANY S ACTIVITIES MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WHICH MAY NOT BE
OBTAINABLE. 

THE COMPANY HAD LIMITED CASH
DEPOSITS. BASED ON THE COMPANY S EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE PERFORMANCE, THE
COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE RESOURCES AND EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CREDIT
FACILITIES, TO BE INADEQUATE TO MEET THE COMPANY S ANTICIPATED CASH AND WORKING
CAPITAL NEEDS AT LEAST THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, EXPECTS
TO BE ABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL TO FUND THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS, CURRENT AND
FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT IN NEW PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY MAY
ALSO NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS BY WAY OF ONE OR MORE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. UNLESS THE COMPANY S
RESULTS IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO
OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR ANY PURPOSE IF AND WHEN THE COMPANY NEEDS IT. 

THE
COMPANY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE COMPANY S SENIOR MANAGEMENT WHO MAY BE DIFFICULT
TO REPLACE. 

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE
COMPANY S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ON THE SKILLS,
EXPERIENCE AND EFFORTS OF ITS CHAIRMAN, CEO, AND OTHER KEY EXECUTIVES. ANY OF
THESE EXECUTIVES WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. WHILE ALL OF THEM HAVE
INCENTIVES TO REMAIN WITH THE COMPANY, THEY ARE NOT BOUND BY EMPLOYMENT
CONTRACTS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT EITHER OF THEM WILL NOT ELECT TO
TERMINATE THEIR SERVICES TO US AT ANY TIME. 

INCREASING
THE COMPANY S BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR
THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES
THAT THERE IS A MARKET FOR ITS PLANNED INCREASE IN THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS
CHOICE OF PRODUCT OR TECHNOLOGY OR THAT CONSUMER DEMAND WILL INCREASE AS THE
COMPANY ANTICIPATES. 

THE
COMPANY MAY BE EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT COSTS OF DEFENSE AND DAMAGES IN
LITIGATION STEMMING FROM CURRENT UNRESOLVED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDERTAKEN IN THE
FUTURE BY AND AGAINST THE COMPANY. 

THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT
OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO SIGNIFICANT
EXPOSURE IN COSTS AND DAMAGES. 

THE
COMPANY S ABILITY TO OPERATE AND COMPETE EFFECTIVELY REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY
HIRES AND RETAIN SKILLED MARKETING AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE BEEN IN
SHORT SUPPLY FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAY BE UNAVAILABLE TO US WHEN THE COMPANY
NEEDS THEM. 

THE COMPANY S BUSINESS
REQUIRES US TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY ATTRACT, TRAIN, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN
HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES, PARTICULARLY MARKETING AND OTHER SENIOR MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY S FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE HIGHLY TRAINED
PERSONNEL WHO ARE INTEGRAL TO THE COMPANY S SALES, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
PROCESSES MAY LIMIT THE RATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY CAN GENERATE SALES. THE
COMPANY S INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE INDIVIDUALS THE COMPANY NEEDS
COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS AND ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE
PROFITABILITY. 

THE
COMPANY MAY SUFFER FROM A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND CONTINUITY OF ITS ONGOING
OPERATIONS MIGHT BE AFFECTED. 

THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO
IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLANS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION THAT WILL AFFECT THE CONTINUITY OF ITS OPERATIONS. WHILE THE
COMPANY MAY TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT ITSELF, THERE COULD BE
INTERRUPTIONS FROM COMPUTER VIRUSES, SERVER ATTACKS, NETWORK OR PRODUCTION
FAILURES AND OTHER POTENTIAL INTERRUPTIONS THAT WOULD BE BEYOND THE COMPANY S
REASONABLE CONTROL. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY S EFFORTS WILL
PREVENT ALL SUCH INTERRUPTIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING EVENTS MAY RESULT IN AN
INTERRUPTION OF SERVICES AND A BREACH OF THE COMPANY S OBLIGATIONS TO ITS
CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY. 

10 

MACRO-ECONOMIC
FACTORS MAY IMPEDE BUSINESS, ACCESS TO FINANCE OR MAY INCREASE THE COST OF
FINANCE OR OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS OF THE COMPANY. 

CHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES
AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS, INTEREST
RATE FLUCTUATIONS, OR INFLATION CHANGES, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE
COMPANY TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR ITS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS OR INCREASE THE
COST OF OBTAINING FINANCING. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY IS DELAYED IN
ATTAINING ITS PROJECTIONS, BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND
LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATINGS AGENCIES WHICH ARE
BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT
METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. DECREASE IN THESE RATIOS
OR DEBT RATINGS WOULD INCREASE THE COMPANY S COST OF BORROWINGS AND MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING. 

THERE
IS A LIMITATION ON THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS LIABILITY. 

THE ARTICLES OF THE COMPANY
LIMIT THE PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY
DUTY AND THE COMPANY PROVIDES AN INDEMNITY FOR EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES TO ANY
PERSON WHO IS THREATENED OR MADE A PARTY TO ANY LEGAL ACTION BY REASON OF THE
FACT THAT THE PERSON IS OR WAS A DIRECTOR OR OFFICER OF THE COMPANY UNLESS THE
ACTION OF PROVEN TO THAT THE PERSON WAS LIABLE TO BE NEGLIGENT OR MISCONDUCT IN
THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY TO THE COMPANY. 

THE LOSS OF OUR KEY
OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS MAY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO THE CONTINUED VIABILITY
OF THE COMPANY . 

THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS
DEPEND ON THE EFFORTS OF KEY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND THE LOSS OF THEIR
SERVICES MAY IRREPARABLY HARM THE COMPANY IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO OVERCOME ANY SUCH LOSS IN MANAGEMENT. 

INVESTORS
MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS
PLAN . 

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FACE
SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES, AND DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE IT IS A
DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY. THE COMPANY WAS FORMED IN 1961. THE COMPANY HAS NO
DEMONSTRABLE OPERATIONS RECORD OF SUBSTANCE UPON WHICH YOU CAN EVALUATE THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. THE COMPANY PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN
LIGHT OF THE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY
ENCOUNTERED BY COMPANIES IN THEIR EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY
CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCOMPLISHING ITS OBJECTIVES. 

AS OF THE DATE OF THIS
PROSPECTUS, THE COMPANY HAS HAD ONLY LIMITED STARTUP OPERATIONS AND HAS
GENERATED VERY SMALL REVENUES. CONSIDERING THESE FACTS, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A
GOING CONCERN IN THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INCLUDED IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, OF WHICH THIS PROSPECTUS IS A PART. IN
ADDITION, THE COMPANY S LACK OF OPERATING CAPITAL COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE
VALUE OF ITS COMMON SHARES AND COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR ENTIRE
INVESTMENT. 

BECAUSE OF OUR NEW
BUSINESS MODEL, WE HAVE NOT PROVEN OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFIT, AND ANY
INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IS RISKY . 

WE HAVE VERY LITTLE
MEANINGFUL OPERATING HISTORY SO IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO EVALUATE AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. WE HAVE NOT SOLD ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO DATE. OUR
AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A
GOING CONCERN. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE. SINCE WE
HAVE NOT PROVEN THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF PROFITABLE OPERATIONS, YOU WILL BE
FURNISHING VENTURE CAPITAL TO US AND WILL BEAR THE RISK OF COMPLETE LOSS OF
YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL. 

WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN
MONITORING NEW TRENDS. 

OUR NET REVENUE MIGHT
DECREASE WITH TIME. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO
IDENTIFY AND MONITOR TRENDS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MARKETS. TO ESTABLISH
MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF A NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE WILL DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES
TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND SALES AND MARKETING. WE WILL INCUR
SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN DEVELOPING, COMMISSIONING AND SELLING NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH
OFTEN SIGNIFICANTLY PRECEDES MEANINGFUL REVENUES FROM ITS SALE. CONSEQUENTLY,
NEW BUSINESS CAN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND INVESTMENT TO ACHIEVE
PROFITABILITY. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS OR OTHER SERVICES WILL BE
SUCCESSFUL OR PROFITABLE. 

11 

WE
MAY FACE DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCT RISKS. 

OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS
DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS. ANY DISRUPTION IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR FUTURE CUSTOMERS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 

WE MAY FACE CLAIMS OF
INFRINGEMENT ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 

OTHER PARTIES MAY ASSERT
CLAIMS OF OWNERSHIP OR INFRINGEMENT OR ASSERT A RIGHT TO PAYMENT WITH RESPECT
TO THE EXPLOITATION OF CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AGAINST US. IN MANY
CASES, THE RIGHTS OWNED OR BEING ACQUIRED BY US ARE LIMITED IN SCOPE, DO NOT
EXTEND TO EXPLOITATION IN ALL PRESENT OR FUTURE USES OR IN PERPETUITY. WE
CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, OUR
ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE, MAINTAIN OR ENFORCE THESE RIGHTS MAY BE DIFFICULT. THE
INABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE OR DIFFICULTY IN DEMONSTRATING OUR OWNERSHIP OR
LICENSE RIGHTS IN THESE TECHNOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
GENERATE REVENUE FROM OR USE OF THESE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 

IF
OUR OPERATING COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATES, IT MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE
OPERATIONS . 

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ACCURATELY
ESTIMATED OUR NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NEED
TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT, HIRE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, AND FURTHER
DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS VENTURES, OR THAT OUR OPERATING COSTS WILL BE HIGHER THAN
ESTIMATED. IF THIS HAPPENS, IT MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND
WE WOULD NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE INTEND TO ESTABLISH OUR INITIAL
CLIENT BASE VIA EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS THAT OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS HAVE
ESTABLISHED IN PAST BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS. SHOULD THESE RELATIONSHIPS NOT
GENERATE THE ANTICIPATED VOLUME OF BUSINESS, ANY UNANTICIPATED COSTS WOULD
DIMINISH OUR WORKING CAPITAL. 

COMPETITORS
WITH MORE RESOURCES MAY FORCE US OUT OF BUSINESS . 

COMPETITION IN OUR SECTORS OF
BUSINESS COME FROM A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING QUALITY, TIMELY
COMMISSIONING OF NEW PROJECTS, PRODUCT POSITIONING, PRICING AND BRAND NAME
RECOGNITION. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS FOR OUR BUSINESS MAY DO THIS BETTER
THAN WE CAN. EACH OF THESE COMPETITORS HAS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL
RESOURCES THAN WE DO. NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY ALSO PRESENT SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITION. WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN COMPETING WITH THESE COMPETITORS, WHICH
MAY MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WHICH MAY BE
UNAVAILABLE . 

THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED
CAPITAL RESOURCES. UNLESS THE COMPANY BEGINS TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO
FINANCE OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN, THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE LIQUIDITY AND
SOLVENCY PROBLEMS. SUCH LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY PROBLEMS MAY FORCE THE COMPANY
TO CEASE OPERATIONS IF ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

THE STATEMENTS IN
THIS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS TO THIS FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION, THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION AND OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS FORM 10-K INCLUDE
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND INVOLVE
UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS GIVE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE
EVENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY OR OUR OUTLOOK. YOU CAN IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THE FACT THEY DO NOT RELATE TO HISTORICAL
OR CURRENT FACTS AND BY THE USE OF WORDS SUCH AS BELIEVE, EXPECT, ESTIMATE, ANTICIPATE, 
 WILL BE, SHOULD, PLAN, PROJECT, INTEND, COULD 
AND SIMILAR WORDS OR EXPRESSIONS. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ON KNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ANY
OR ALL OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, AND WE CAN MAKE NO GUARANTEES ABOUT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.
SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE OR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY
DIFFER FROM PAST RESULTS AND/OR THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. 

11 

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION
TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU SHOULD,
HOWEVER, CONSULT ANY SUBSEQUENT DISCLOSURES WE MAKE IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC ON FORM 10-Q OR FORM 8-K. 

THE FOLLOWING IS A
CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO
THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE,
WE BELIEVE COULD MAKE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DESCRIBED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS AND, AS A RESULT, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION
OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING
CONCERN 

OUR
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR HAS NOTED IN THEIR AUDIT REPORT CONCERNING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015
AND 2014, THAT WE HAVE INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND
HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY 7.6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT
OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE HAVE INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM
OPERATIONS IN 2015 AND 2014 . WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY 7.6
MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 20 15 . THESE CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS
TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. 

IF OUR BRANDS DO NOT ACHIEVE MORE WIDESPREAD
CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR GROWTH MAY BE LIMITED. 

ALTHOUGH OUR BRANDS
HAVE ACHIEVED ACCEPTANCE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, MOST OF OUR BRANDS ARE EARLY IN THEIR GROWTH CYCLE AND HAVE NOT ACHIEVED EXTENSIVE
NATIONAL BRAND RECOGNITION. ALSO, BRANDS WE MAY DEVELOP AND/OR ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE ESTABLISHED EXTENSIVE
BRAND RECOGNITION. ACCORDINGLY, IF CONSUMERS DO NOT ACCEPT OUR BRANDS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PENETRATE OUR MARKETS AND OUR GROWTH
MAY BE LIMITED. 

WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL,
WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. OUR INABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL, AS NEEDED, ON BENEFICIAL
TERMS OR AT ALL COULD RESTRICT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND SEVERELY LIMIT OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE HAVE LIMITED CAPITAL
COMPARED TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND FROM A LOCAL/REGIONAL COMPANY
TO A NATIONAL COMPANY, OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE CAPITAL ARE PRESENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT
LEVEL OF OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL REQUIRE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 3.5 MILLION TO
EXPAND AND MARKET OUR BUSINESS TO BECOME A NATIONWIDE DISTRIBUTOR. OF THIS AMOUNT, WE REQUIRE 1.5 MILLION FOR WORKING CAPITAL
AND TO INCREASE INVENTORY TO ALLOW FOR NATIONWIDE DISTRIBUTION, 0.6 MILLION TO MAKE OUR NEW FACILITY FULLY OPERATIONAL TO SUPPORT
PRODUCTION OF UP TO ONE MILLION CASES PER YEAR, AND 1.0 MILLION FOR SALES AND MARKETING TO FACILITATE NATIONWIDE DISTRIBUTION.
WE PLAN TO IMPROVE OUR CASH POSITION BY FOCUSING ON INCREASING SALES, IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND ACCESSING A COMBINATION OF CAPITAL
SOURCES INCLUDING DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCINGS. FAILURE TO SECURE THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL RESULT IN A LESS AGGRESSIVE GROWTH
PLAN AND COULD ALSO RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS. THIS MAY LIMIT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH, INCLUDING
OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP EXISTING BRANDS, SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INVENTORY LEVELS, FUND POTENTIAL
ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BRANDS, PENETRATE NEW MARKETS, ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS AND ENTER INTO NEW DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS. IF WE
HAVE NOT GENERATED SUFFICIENT CASH FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL NEEDS, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS
THROUGH PRIVATE OR PUBLIC EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCING. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US
ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH MAY BE LIMITED AS WE MAY NEED TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY TO SLOW
THE RATE OF, OR ELIMINATE, OUR EXPANSION OR REDUCE OR CURTAIL OUR OPERATIONS. ALSO, ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCING WE UNDERTAKE COULD
IMPOSE COVENANTS UPON US THAT RESTRICT OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY, AND, IF WE ISSUE EQUITY SECURITIES TO RAISE CAPITAL OUR EXISTING
SHAREHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION AND THE NEW SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR
COMMON STOCK. 

12 

WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 
AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK
LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. 

WE ARE AN EMERGING
GROWTH COMPANY, AS DEFINED IN THE JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT OF 2012, AND WE MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS
FROM VARIOUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NOT BEING REQUIRED
TO COMPLY WITH THE AUDITOR ATTESTATION REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, REDUCED DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS REGARDING
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS AND PROXY STATEMENTS, AND EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOLDING A NONBINDING
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ANY GOLDEN PARACHUTE PAYMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. WE
CANNOT PREDICT IF INVESTORS WILL FIND OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE WE WILL RELY ON THESE EXEMPTIONS. IF SOME INVESTORS
FIND OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE AS A RESULT, THERE MAY BE A LESS ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR STOCK
PRICE MAY BE MORE VOLATILE. 

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS.
FAILURE TO OBTAIN SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR LOSS OF OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE SALES,
INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LOSE CREDIBILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE. 

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED
NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS FOR THE SOURCING OF ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THESE SUPPLIERS CONSIST OF THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS IN THE
U.S. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS. THE TERMINATION OF OUR AGREEMENTS/RELATIONSHIPS OR
AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IF OUR SUPPLIERS INCREASE THEIR
PRICES, WE MAY NOT HAVE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO COVER ALL OR
EVEN A PORTION OF THE INCREASED COSTS. ALSO, OUR SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO PERFORM SATISFACTORILY OR HANDLE INCREASED ORDERS,
DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS OF PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS OR THE LOSS OF OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS, ESPECIALLY OUR KEY SUPPLIERS, COULD CAUSE
US TO FAIL TO MEET ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, LOSE SALES, INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND/OR EXPOSE US TO PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES. IN
TURN, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE CREDIBILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE AND DAMAGE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, ULTIMATELY LEADING
TO A DECLINE IN OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE THESE CONTRACTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS
OR FIND SUITABLE ALTERNATIVES, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 

13 

WE DEPEND ON OUR INDEPENDENT WHOLESALE
DISTRIBUTORS TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE OR INABILITY OF EVEN A FEW OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO ADEQUATELY DISTRIBUTE OUR
PRODUCTS WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIES COULD HARM OUR SALES AND RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE REQUIRED BY
LAW TO USE STATE LICENSED DISTRIBUTORS OR, IN 18 STATES KNOWN AS CONTROL STATES, STATE-OWNED AGENCIES PERFORMING
THIS FUNCTION, TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL OUTLETS, INCLUDING LIQUOR STORES, BARS, RESTAURANTS AND NATIONAL CHAINS IN THE U.S.
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS FOR OUR BRANDS WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS; HOWEVER, FAILURE TO MAINTAIN
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SALES AND GROWTH. WE CURRENTLY ARE AUTHORIZED TO DISTRIBUTE
OUR PRODUCTS IN FIVE CONTROL STATES OREGON, PENNSYLVANIA, IDAHO, VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND, AND ARE ACTIVELY DISTRIBUTING IN
ALL OF THESE STATES EXCEPT IDAHO. OVER THE PAST DECADE THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING CONSOLIDATION, BOTH INTRASTATE AND INTERSTATE,
AMONG DISTRIBUTORS. AS A RESULT, MANY STATES NOW HAVE ONLY TWO OR THREE SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTORS. ALSO, THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTRIBUTORS
THAT NOW CONTROL DISTRIBUTION FOR SEVERAL STATES. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, SALES TO ONE CUSTOMER (OREGON
LIQUOR CONTROL COMMISSION) ACCOUNTED FOR 32 AND 40 OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN
GOOD RELATIONS WITH A DISTRIBUTOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD IN SOME INSTANCES BE FROZEN OUT OF ONE OR MORE MARKETS ENTIRELY. THE ULTIMATE
SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR DISTRIBUTORS ABILITY AND DESIRE TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO
OUR DESIRED U.S. TARGET MARKETS, AS WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON THEM FOR PRODUCT PLACEMENT AND RETAIL STORE PENETRATION. IN ADDITION,
ALL OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS ALSO DISTRIBUTE COMPETITIVE BRANDS AND PRODUCT LINES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR U.S. ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTORS
WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS, COMMIT SUFFICIENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO PROMOTE AND MARKET OUR BRANDS AND PRODUCT LINES
OR THAT THEY CAN OR WILL SELL THEM TO OUR DESIRED OR TARGETED MARKETS. IF THEY DO NOT, OUR SALES WILL BE HARMED, RESULTING IN
A DECLINE IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY IF WE CANNOT SECURE AND MAINTAIN LISTINGS IN THE CONTROL STATES. 

IN THE CONTROL STATES,
THE STATE LIQUOR COMMISSIONS ACT IN PLACE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND DECIDE WHICH PRODUCTS ARE TO BE PURCHASED AND OFFERED FOR SALE IN
THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES. WE CURRENTLY ARE AUTHORIZED TO TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS IN FIVE CONTROL STATES OREGON, PENNSYLVANIA,
IDAHO, VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND AND ARE ACTIVELY DISTRIBUTING IN ALL OF THESE STATES EXCEPT IDAHO. PRODUCTS SELECTED FOR LISTING
MUST GENERALLY REACH CERTAIN VOLUMES AND/OR PROFIT LEVELS TO MAINTAIN THEIR LISTINGS. PRODUCTS ARE SELECTED FOR PURCHASE AND SALE
THROUGH LISTING PROCEDURES WHICH ARE GENERALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO NEW PRODUCTS ONLY AT PERIODICALLY SCHEDULED LISTING INTERVIEWS.
PRODUCTS NOT SELECTED FOR LISTINGS CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED BY CONSUMERS IN THE APPLICABLE CONTROL STATE THROUGH SPECIAL ORDERS,
IF AT ALL. IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT LISTINGS IN THE CONTROL STATES, OR SECURE AND MAINTAIN LISTINGS
IN THOSE STATES FOR ANY ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS WE MAY ACQUIRE, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

WE MUST MAINTAIN A RELATIVELY LARGE
INVENTORY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT CUSTOMER DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS, AND IF THIS INVENTORY IS LOST DUE TO THEFT, FIRE OR OTHER
DAMAGE OR BECOMES OBSOLETE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 

WE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIVELY
LARGE INVENTORIES TO MEET CUSTOMER DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE ARE ALWAYS AT RISK OF LOSS OF THAT INVENTORY DUE
TO THEFT, FIRE OR OTHER DAMAGE, AND ANY SUCH LOSS, WHETHER INSURED AGAINST OR NOT, COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO MEET OUR ORDERS AND
HARM OUR SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS. ALSO, OUR INVENTORY MAY BECOME OBSOLETE AS WE INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, CEASE TO PRODUCE OLD
PRODUCTS OR MODIFY THE DESIGN OF OUR PRODUCTS PACKAGING, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

14 

EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE
SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR WWOD PROMISSORY NOTE OR PURSUANT TO ADDITIONAL FINANCINGS. 

THE CONVERSION PRICE
ON OUR WWOD HOLDINGS CONVERTIBLE NOTE IS EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (I) THE FIXED CONVERSION PRICE (CURRENTLY 0.15) OR (II) 65 OF
THE LOWEST TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK DURING THE 5 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO CONVERSION. THE ISSUANCE AND SALE
OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO WWOD HOLDINGS FOR CONVERSIONS, MAY HAVE A DILUTIVE
IMPACT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER SIMILAR FINANCINGS WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE A DILUTIVE IMPACT
ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, OUR NET INCOME PER SHARE COULD DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK COULD DECLINE. IN ADDITION, THE LOWER OUR STOCK PRICE IS AT THE TIME WWOD HOLDINGS CONVERTS ITS PROMISSORY NOTES, THE MORE
SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WE WILL HAVE TO ISSUE TO WWOD HOLDINGS IN ORDER TO REPAY OUR NOTE WITH THEM. IF OUR STOCK PRICE DECREASES,
THEN OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS WOULD EXPERIENCE GREATER DILUTION FOR ANY GIVEN DOLLAR AMOUNT RAISED THROUGH THE OFFERING. 

THE PERCEIVED RISK
OF DILUTION MAY CAUSE OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, WHICH MAY CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MOREOVER,
THE PERCEIVED RISK OF DILUTION AND THE RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR STOCK PRICE COULD ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO ENGAGE IN SHORT
SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OFFERED FOR SALE, MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF SHORT SELLING COULD FURTHER
CONTRIBUTE TO PROGRESSIVE PRICE DECLINES IN OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WWOD HOLDINGS MAY PAY LESS THAN THE
THEN-PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. 

WWOD HOLDINGS CAN
CONVERT ANY OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER SUCH NOTE AT A PRICE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (I) THE FIXED CONVERSION PRICE
(CURRENTLY 0.15) OR (II) 65 OF THE LOWEST TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK DURING THE 5 TRADING DAYS PRIOR
TO CONVERSION. 

WWOD HOLDINGS COULD
HAVE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SELL OUR SHARES IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIVING THE SHARES (IF ALLOWED UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW)
TO REALIZE THE PROFIT BETWEEN THE DISCOUNTED PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE. IF WWOD HOLDINGS WERE TO SELL OUR SHARES, THE PRICE OF
OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECREASE. IF OUR STOCK PRICE DECREASES, WWOD HOLDINGS COULD HAVE A FURTHER INCENTIVE TO SELL SUCH SHARES.
ACCORDINGLY, THE POTENTIAL DISCOUNTED SALES PRICE IN THE WWOD HOLDINGS NOTE MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. 

OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTE WITH WWOD HOLDINGS
CONTAINS NUMEROUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT MANAGEMENT S DISCRETION TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. 

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE
FUNDS FROM WWOD HOLDINGS, WE AGREED TO CERTAIN COVENANTS THAT PLACE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY
TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, TO CREATE LIENS OR OTHER ENCUMBRANCES, TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS AND INVESTMENTS, AND TO SELL
OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ASSETS AND MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES. 

15 

IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT IS DECLARED
UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH WWOD HOLDINGS, WE COULD LOSE POSSESSION OF OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

IN CONNECTION WITH
OUR FINANCING WITH WWOD HOLDINGS, WE ENTERED INTO A SECURITY AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH WE GRANTED WWOD HOLDINGS A SECURITY INTEREST
IN OUR INVENTORY. ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH WWOD HOLDINGS COULD TRIGGER AN ACCELERATION OF THE RELATED DEBT.
IF WE WERE UNABLE TO REPAY THE DEBT UPON ANY SUCH ACCELERATION, OUR LENDERS COULD SEEK TO FORECLOSE ON OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR
INVENTORY, IN AN EFFORT TO SEEK REPAYMENT UNDER THE LOANS. IF OUR LENDERS WERE SUCCESSFUL, WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT
OUR BUSINESS AS IT IS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED AND OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES AND FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR RESPECTIVE
TRADEMARKS AND TRADE SECRETS COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND DECREASE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND PORTFOLIO. 

OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS
DEPEND IN PART ON OUR, ABILITY TO DEVELOP FAVORABLE CONSUMER RECOGNITION OF OUR BRANDS AND TRADEMARKS. ALTHOUGH WE APPLY FOR REGISTRATION
OF OUR BRANDS AND TRADEMARKS, THEY COULD BE IMITATED IN WAYS THAT WE CANNOT PREVENT. ALSO, WE RELY ON TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY
KNOW-HOW, CONCEPTS AND FORMULAS. OUR METHODS OF PROTECTING THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE. MOREOVER, WE MAY FACE CLAIMS
OF MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH OUR USE OF THIS INFORMATION. DEFENDING
THESE CLAIMS MAY BE COSTLY AND, IF UNSUCCESSFUL, MAY PREVENT US FROM CONTINUING TO USE THIS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE
AND RESULT IN A JUDGMENT OR MONETARY DAMAGES BEING LEVIED AGAINST US. WE DO NOT MAINTAIN NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS WITH ALL OF
OUR KEY PERSONNEL OR WITH SOME OF OUR KEY SUPPLIERS. IF COMPETITORS INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN ACCESS TO OUR TRADE
SECRETS, PROPRIETARY KNOW-HOW OR RECIPES, THE APPEAL, AND THUS THE VALUE, OF OUR BRAND PORTFOLIO COULD BE REDUCED, NEGATIVELY
IMPACTING OUR SALES AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. 

A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PROCESSES, ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT
ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE RELY ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERNET SITES, DATA HOSTING AND PROCESSING FACILITIES AND TOOLS, HARDWARE
(INCLUDING LAPTOPS AND MOBILE DEVICES), SOFTWARE AND TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS AND PLATFORMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED, HOSTED,
PROVIDED AND/OR USED BY THIRD-PARTIES OR THEIR VENDORS, TO ASSIST US IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS. THE VARIOUS USES OF THESE
IT SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, AND SERVICES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HOSTING OUR INTERNAL NETWORK AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS; ORDERING
AND MANAGING MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS; SUPPLY/DEMAND PLANNING; PRODUCTION; SHIPPING PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERS; HOSTING OUR BRANDED
WEBSITES AND MARKETING PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS; COLLECTING AND STORING CUSTOMER, CONSUMER, EMPLOYEE, INVESTOR, AND OTHER DATA; PROCESSING
TRANSACTIONS; SUMMARIZING AND REPORTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; HOSTING, PROCESSING, AND SHARING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY RESEARCH,
BUSINESS PLANS, AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION; COMPLYING WITH REGULATORY, LEGAL OR TAX REQUIREMENTS; PROVIDING DATA SECURITY; AND
HANDLING OTHER PROCESSES NECESSARY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS. 

INCREASED IT SECURITY
THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED CYBER CRIME POSE A POTENTIAL RISK TO THE SECURITY OF OUR IT SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, AND SERVICES, AS
WELL AS THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY, AND INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA. IF THE IT SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE RELY
UPON FAIL TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, OR IF WE SUFFER A LOSS OR DISCLOSURE OF BUSINESS OR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION, DUE TO ANY NUMBER
OF CAUSES, RANGING FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS TO POWER OUTAGES TO SECURITY BREACHES, AND OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY
ADDRESS THESE FAILURES ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OPERATIONS AND REPUTATIONAL, COMPETITIVE
AND/OR BUSINESS HARM, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, SUCH EVENTS
COULD RESULT IN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND WE MAY SUFFER FINANCIAL AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE
BECAUSE OF LOST OR MISAPPROPRIATED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BELONGING TO US OR TO OUR PARTNERS, OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS
OR CONSUMERS. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, WE COULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO REMEDY THE
DAMAGE CAUSED BY A SECURITY BREACH OR TO REPAIR OR REPLACE NETWORKS AND IT SYSTEMS. 

16 

OUR FAILURE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN KEY
EXECUTIVE OR EMPLOYEE TALENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS
UPON THE EFFORTS AND ABILITIES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, AND A HIGH-QUALITY EMPLOYEE BASE, AS WELL AS
OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, MOTIVATE, REWARD, AND RETAIN THEM. WE DO NOT MAINTAIN AND DO NOT INTEND TO OBTAIN KEY MAN INSURANCE ON
THE LIFE OF ANY EXECUTIVE OR EMPLOYEE. DIFFICULTIES IN HIRING OR RETAINING KEY EXECUTIVE OR EMPLOYEE TALENT, OR THE UNEXPECTED
LOSS OF EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE COULD EXPERIENCE BUSINESS
DISRUPTION AND/OR INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, REDUCTIONS IN WORKFORCE, OR OTHER COST-CUTTING MEASURES. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY 

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND TRENDS. 

CONSUMER PREFERENCES
MAY SHIFT DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL TRENDS, PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES, PRODUCT INNOVATIONS,
CHANGES IN VACATION OR LEISURE ACTIVITY PATTERNS AND A DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY REDUCE CONSUMERS WILLINGNESS
TO PURCHASE DISTILLED SPIRITS OR CAUSE A SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES TOWARD BEER, WINE OR NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. OUR SUCCESS
DEPENDS IN PART ON FULFILLING AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS AND ANTICIPATING CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES
WITH SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT INNOVATIONS. 

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN
OUR INDUSTRY AND MANY FACTORS MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPETING SUCCESSFULLY. 

WE COMPETE ON THE
BASIS OF PRODUCT TASTE AND QUALITY, BRAND IMAGE, PRICE, SERVICE AND ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES. THE
GLOBAL SPIRITS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS DOMINATED BY SEVERAL LARGE, WELL-FUNDED INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES. IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT OUR COMPETITORS MAY EITHER RESPOND TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS OR CONSUMER TRENDS MORE RAPIDLY OR EFFECTIVELY OR RESORT TO PRICE
COMPETITION TO SUSTAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. 

ADVERSE PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT ALCOHOL
COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 

ANTI-ALCOHOL GROUPS
HAVE, IN THE PAST, ADVOCATED SUCCESSFULLY FOR MORE STRINGENT LABELING REQUIREMENTS, HIGHER TAXES AND OTHER REGULATIONS DESIGNED
TO DISCOURAGE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND/OR CHANGES
IN CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS OF THE RELATIVE HEALTHFULNESS OR SAFETY OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL COULD DECREASE SALES AND CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL
AND THUS THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THIS COULD, IN TURN, SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE BOTH OUR REVENUES AND OUR REVENUE GROWTH, CAUSING
A DECLINE IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

17 

CLASS ACTION OR OTHER LITIGATION RELATING
TO ALCOHOL ABUSE OR THE MISUSE OF ALCOHOL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR INDUSTRY FACES
THE POSSIBILITY OF CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR LITIGATION ALLEGING THAT THE CONTINUED EXCESSIVE USE OR ABUSE OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL HAS
CAUSED DEATH OR SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT GOVERNMENTS COULD ASSERT THAT THE USE OF ALCOHOL HAS SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASED GOVERNMENT FUNDED HEALTH CARE COSTS. LITIGATION OR ASSERTIONS OF THIS TYPE HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED COMPANIES IN THE
TOBACCO INDUSTRY, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE, AS WELL AS OUR SUPPLIERS, COULD BE NAMED IN LITIGATION OF THIS TYPE. 

ALSO, LAWSUITS HAVE
BEEN BROUGHT IN A NUMBER OF STATES ALLEGING THAT BEVERAGE ALCOHOL MANUFACTURERS AND MARKETERS HAVE IMPROPERLY TARGETED UNDERAGE
CONSUMERS IN THEIR ADVERTISING. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADVERTISEMENTS, MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS
VIOLATE THE CONSUMER PROTECTION OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES STATUTES IN EACH OF THESE STATES AND SEEK REPAYMENT OF THE FAMILY
FUNDS EXPENDED BY THE UNDERAGE CONSUMERS. WHILE WE HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED IN THESE LAWSUITS, WE COULD BE NAMED IN SIMILAR LAWSUITS
IN THE FUTURE. ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER LITIGATION ASSERTED AGAINST US COULD BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING TO DEFEND AGAINST,
DEPLETING OUR CASH AND DIVERTING OUR PERSONNEL RESOURCES AND, IF THE PLAINTIFFS IN SUCH ACTIONS WERE TO PREVAIL, OUR BUSINESS
COULD BE HARMED SIGNIFICANTLY. 

REGULATORY DECISIONS AND LEGAL, REGULATORY
AND TAX CHANGES COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCE OUR MARGINS. 

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT
TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION. THIS MAY INCLUDE REGULATIONS REGARDING PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND
LABELING OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL PRODUCTS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND TO MAINTAIN VARIOUS PERMITS AND LICENSES.
WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO CONDUCT BUSINESS ONLY WITH HOLDERS OF LICENSES TO IMPORT, WAREHOUSE, TRANSPORT, DISTRIBUTE AND SELL BEVERAGE
ALCOHOL PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR INDUSTRY WILL NOT CHANGE
OR BECOME MORE STRINGENT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT
WHEN AND TO WHAT EXTENT LIABILITY MAY ARISE. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO INCREASING PUBLIC CONCERN OVER ALCOHOL-RELATED SOCIETAL PROBLEMS,
INCLUDING DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED, UNDERAGE DRINKING, ALCOHOLISM AND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES FROM THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL, VARIOUS
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT MAY SEEK TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITS ON ADVERTISING OR OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES PROMOTING
BEVERAGE ALCOHOL PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE CURRENT OR FUTURE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY
AND PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN MONETARY PENALTIES, SUSPENSION OR EVEN REVOCATION OF OUR LICENSES AND PERMITS. COSTS OF COMPLIANCE
WITH CHANGES IN REGULATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, AS WE COULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE OUR PRICES
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH COULD LOWER THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND REDUCE OUR SALES AND PROFIT POTENTIAL. 

ALSO, THE DISTRIBUTION
OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL PRODUCTS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE TAXATION (AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT LEVELS), AND BEVERAGE
ALCOHOL PRODUCTS THEMSELVES ARE THE SUBJECT OF NATIONAL IMPORT AND EXCISE DUTIES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AN INCREASE
IN TAXATION OR IN IMPORT OR EXCISE DUTIES COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR SALES REVENUE AND MARGINS, BOTH THROUGH THE REDUCTION
OF OVERALL CONSUMPTION AND BY ENCOURAGING CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO LOWER-TAXED CATEGORIES OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL. 

18 

WE COULD FACE PRODUCT LIABILITY OR
OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES THAT INCREASE OUR COSTS OF OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR REPUTATION. 

ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN
LIABILITY INSURANCE AND WILL ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CONTRACTUALLY OUR LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OUR PRODUCTS, THESE MEASURES
MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR US TO SUCCESSFULLY AVOID OR LIMIT LIABILITY. OUR PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO
 1 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE AND 5 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE AND OUR GENERAL LIABILITY UMBRELLA POLICY IS CAPPED AT 15 MILLION.
FURTHER, ANY CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE COVERAGE WE HAVE FROM PARTIES SUPPLYING OUR PRODUCTS IS LIMITED, AS A PRACTICAL
MATTER, TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY AND THE INSURED LIMITS OF ANY INSURANCE PROVIDED BY THESE SUPPLIERS.
IN ANY EVENT, EXTENSIVE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS COULD BE COSTLY TO DEFEND AND/OR COSTLY TO RESOLVE AND COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION. 

CONTAMINATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR
COUNTERFEIT OR CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS COULD HARM THE IMAGE AND INTEGRITY OF, OR DECREASE CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR, OUR BRANDS
AND DECREASE OUR SALES. 

THE SUCCESS OF OUR
BRANDS DEPENDS UPON THE POSITIVE IMAGE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE OF THEM. CONTAMINATION, WHETHER ARISING ACCIDENTALLY OR THROUGH DELIBERATE
THIRD-PARTY ACTION, OR OTHER EVENTS THAT HARM THE INTEGRITY OR CONSUMER SUPPORT FOR OUR BRANDS, COULD AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR
PRODUCTS. CONTAMINANTS IN RAW MATERIALS PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES AND USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR DEFECTS IN
THE DISTILLATION AND FERMENTATION PROCESSES COULD LEAD TO LOW BEVERAGE QUALITY AS WELL AS ILLNESS AMONG, OR INJURY TO, CONSUMERS
OF OUR PRODUCTS AND COULD RESULT IN REDUCED SALES OF THE AFFECTED BRAND OR ALL OF OUR BRANDS. ALSO, TO THE EXTENT THAT THIRD PARTIES
SELL PRODUCTS THAT ARE EITHER COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR BRANDS OR BRANDS THAT LOOK LIKE OUR BRANDS, CONSUMERS OF OUR BRANDS
COULD CONFUSE OUR PRODUCTS WITH PRODUCTS THAT THEY CONSIDER INFERIOR. THIS COULD CAUSE THEM TO REFRAIN FROM PURCHASING OUR BRANDS
IN THE FUTURE AND IN TURN COULD IMPAIR OUR BRAND EQUITY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OPERATIONS. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES 

OUR SERIES A PREFERRED IS NEWLY ISSUED
AND DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET. HOLDERS OF SERIES A PREFERRED MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES OF SERIES
A PREFERRED IF THEY NEED MONEY. 

THE SHARES OF SERIES
A PREFERRED STOCK ARE A NEW ISSUE OF SECURITIES WITH NO ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET. WE DO NOT PLAN TO REGISTER OUR SERIES A PREFERRED
FOR TRADING ON ANY EXCHANGE. AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR THE SHARES MAY NOT DEVELOP, OR, IF IT DEVELOPS, MAY NOT LAST, IN WHICH
CASE STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY SELLING THEIR SHARES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO OR THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED
MAY DECLINE. 

THERE IS A LIMITED TRADING MARKET FOR
OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR COMMON STOCK IS
TRADED ON THE OTC MARKETS (QB MARKETPLACE TIER) UNDER THE SYMBOL ESDI. DURING THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED APRIL 5, 2016,
THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS APPROXIMATELY 44,350 SHARES. THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED TRADING ACTIVITY
IN OUR STOCK RECENTLY, AND WHEN IT HAS TRADED, THE PRICE HAS FLUCTUATED WIDELY. WE CONSIDER OUR COMMON STOCK TO BE THINLY
TRADED AND ANY LAST REPORTED SALE PRICES MAY NOT BE A TRUE MARKET-BASED VALUATION OF THE COMMON STOCK. A CONSISTENTLY ACTIVE
TRADING MARKET FOR OUR STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE. STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY SELLING THEIR SHARES
IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE ILLIQUID MARKET AND LIMITED PUBLIC FLOAT FOR OUR STOCK. STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY
SELLING THEIR SHARES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE ILLIQUID MARKET AND LIMITED PUBLIC FLOAT FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 

19 

OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED TO BE
A PENNY STOCK AND, AS SUCH, THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE FURTHER LIMITED BY CERTAIN SEC RULES APPLICABLE
TO PENNY STOCKS. 

AS LONG AS THE PRICE
OF OUR COMMON STOCK REMAINS BELOW 5.00 PER SHARE OR WE HAVE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS OF 2,000,000 OR LESS, OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
ARE LIKELY TO BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PENNY STOCK RULES PROMULGATED BY THE SEC. THOSE RULES IMPOSE CERTAIN SALES PRACTICE
REQUIREMENTS ON BROKERS WHO SELL PENNY STOCK TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS AND ACCREDITED INVESTORS (GENERALLY INSTITUTIONS
WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF 5,000,000 OR INDIVIDUALS WITH NET WORTH IN EXCESS OF 1,000,000). FOR TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THE PENNY
STOCK RULES, THE BROKER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL SUITABILITY DETERMINATION FOR THE PURCHASER AND RECEIVE THE PURCHASER S WRITTEN
CONSENT TO THE TRANSACTION PRIOR TO THE SALE. FURTHERMORE, THE PENNY STOCK RULES GENERALLY REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT BROKERS
ENGAGED IN SECONDARY TRADING OF PENNY STOCKS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH WRITTEN DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS, MONTHLY STATEMENTS OF THE MARKET
VALUE OF PENNY STOCKS, DISCLOSURE OF THE BID AND ASKED PRICES AND DISCLOSURE OF THE COMPENSATION TO THE BROKERAGE FIRM AND DISCLOSURE
OF THE SALES PERSON WORKING FOR THE BROKERAGE FIRM. THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BROKERS TO SELL OUR
SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND LIMIT THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR SECURITIES. 

TRANSFERS OF OUR SECURITIES MAY BE
RESTRICTED BY VIRTUE OF STATE SECURITIES BLUE SKY LAWS WHICH PROHIBIT TRADING ABSENT COMPLIANCE WITH INDIVIDUAL
STATE LAWS. THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL SHARES IN THOSE STATES. 

TRANSFERS OF OUR
COMMON STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED UNDER THE SECURITIES OR SECURITIES REGULATIONS LAWS PROMULGATED BY VARIOUS STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS,
COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BLUE SKY LAWS. ABSENT COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH INDIVIDUAL STATE LAWS, OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT
BE TRADED IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS. BECAUSE THE SECURITIES REGISTERED HEREUNDER HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED FOR RESALE UNDER THE BLUE
SKY LAWS OF ANY STATE, THE HOLDERS OF SUCH SHARES AND PERSONS WHO DESIRE TO PURCHASE THEM SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT
STATE BLUE SKY LAW RESTRICTIONS UPON THE ABILITY OF INVESTORS TO SELL THE SECURITIES AND OF PURCHASERS TO PURCHASE THE SECURITIES.
THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT THE SECONDARY TRADING OF OUR COMMON STOCK. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR
OUR SECURITIES TO BE A LIMITED ONE. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS
ON OUR SERIES A PREFERRED. MOREOVER, WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PAID DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK INTO WHICH OUR SERIES A PREFERRED
AND WARRANTS ARE CONVERTIBLE AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE DOING SO IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

WE HAVE NOT PAID ANY
CASH DIVIDENDS TO DATE AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE ON OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE TERMS
OF OUR SEPTEMBER 2015 CONVERTIBLE NOTE WITH WWOD HOLDINGS PROHIBIT US FROM PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT
LENDER CONSENT. 

THE SHARES OF THE
SERIES A PREFERRED ARE ENTITLED TO DIVIDENDS AT A RATE OF 8 PER ANNUM, CUMULATIVE, AND PAYABLE EITHER IN CASH OR IN KIND 
IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, AT THE COMPANY S OPTION, PROVIDED THAT DIVIDENDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH ONLY FOLLOWING THE FISCAL
YEAR IN WHICH WE HAVE NET INCOME OF AT LEAST 500,000, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE
THEREFOR. 

20 

OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS COLLECTIVELY
OWN A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, AND AS LONG AS THEY DO, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF
STOCKHOLDER VOTING. 

OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS,
ARE COLLECTIVELY THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF APPROXIMATELY 58 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND HAVE VOTING POWER
OF APPROXIMATELY 52 OF ALL VOTES ON MATTERS TO BE PRESENTED TO STOCKHOLDERS AS OF APRIL 12, 2016. ACCORDINGLY, OFFICERS AND
DIRECTORS AS A GROUP, MAY BE ABLE TO CONTROL US AND DIRECT OUR AFFAIRS AND BUSINESS, INCLUDING ANY DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT
TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL, FUTURE ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES, DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK AND
THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. 

WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL
SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT ASKING FOR STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, WHICH COULD CAUSE YOUR INVESTMENT
TO BE DILUTED. 

OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
AUTHORIZES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE UP TO 900,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND UP TO 100,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED
STOCK. WE HAVE DESIGNATED 3,000 SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED AS SERIES A PREFERRED AND HAVE 9,997,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK AVAILABLE
FOR FUTURE DESIGNATION AND ISSUANCE. THE POWER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR WARRANTS
OR OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK IS GENERALLY NOT SUBJECT TO STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. ACCORDINGLY,
ANY ADDITIONAL ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR PREFERRED STOCK THAT MAY BE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON STOCK, MAY HAVE THE EFFECT
OF DILUTING YOUR INVESTMENT. 

BY ISSUING PREFERRED STOCK, WE MAY
BE ABLE TO DELAY, DEFER, OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL. SERIES A PREFERRED HAVE SIGNIFICANT VOTING RIGHTS ON MATTERS PRESENTED
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS FOR A VOTE, INCLUDING ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. 

OUR
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION PERMITS US TO ISSUE, WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS, A TOTAL OF 100,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED
STOCK. WE HAVE DESIGNATED 3,000 SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED AS SERIES A PREFERRED AND HAVE 9,997,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK
AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE DESIGNATION AND ISSUANCE. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CAN DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES,
PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS GRANTED TO, OR IMPOSED UPON, THE SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK AND TO FIX THE NUMBER OF SHARES CONSTITUTING
ANY SERIES AND THE DESIGNATION OF SUCH SERIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, IN DETERMINING THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES
AND PRIVILEGES TO BE GRANTED WHEN THE PREFERRED STOCK IS ISSUED, MAY INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING, DEFERRING
OR PREVENTING A CHANGE IN CONTROL, DISCOURAGING BIDS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE, OR THAT ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF AND THE VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

ON ALL MATTERS SUBMITTED
TO A VOTE OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING ANY MEETINGS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ELECTING MEMBERS TO OUR BOARD OF
DIRECTORS, THE HOLDERS OF OUR SERIES A PREFERRED AS A CLASS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN AGGREGATE NUMBER OF VOTES EQUAL TO THE
PRODUCT OF (X) THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST WHOLE NUMBER) INTO WHICH THE TOTAL SHARES OF SERIES
A PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THE FINAL CLOSING DATE ARE CONVERTIBLE ON THE FINAL CLOSING DATE MULTIPLIED BY (Y) 2.5 (THE TOTAL
SERIES A VOTES ), WITH EACH HOLDER OF SERIES A PREFERRED ENTITLED TO VOTE ITS PRO RATA PORTION OF THE TOTAL SERIES
A VOTES. OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION DO NOT PROVIDE FOR CUMULATIVE VOTING WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. BASED ON
THE 880 SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED OUTSTANDING ON APRIL 12, 2016, OUR SERIES A PREFERRED WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 24 OF
OUR VOTING SECURITIES AND SHOULD ALL 3,000 SHARES OF DESIGNATED SERIES A PREFERRED BE ISSUED, SUCH HOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO ELECT
A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

21 

IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT ON OUR
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTC MARKETPLACE WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR
SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. 

COMPANIES QUOTED ON
THE OTC MARKETPLACE MUST BE CURRENT IN THEIR REPORTS UNDER SECTION 13, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PRICE QUOTATION PRIVILEGES ON THE
OTC MARKETPLACE. IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT ON OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTC MARKETPLACE. AS
A RESULT, THE MARKET LIQUIDITY FOR OUR SECURITIES COULD BE SEVERELY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS
TO SELL OUR SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE
UNABLE TO GET RE-QUOTED ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR COMPANY. 

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE
WITH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE LAWS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD. 

THE
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AS WELL AS RELATED NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE SEC AND THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING
OVERSIGHT BOARD, REQUIRE CHANGES IN THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES.
THESE NEW LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 RELATING TO INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING SECTION 404 ), WILL MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COMPANY'S LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE
COSTS AND MAKE SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME-CONSUMING, BURDENSOME AND EXPENSIVE. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, OUR ABILITY TO REMEDIATE ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESSES THAT WE MAY IDENTIFY DURING OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM,
OR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS, CAUSE US TO FAIL TO MEET OUR REPORTING
OBLIGATIONS OR RESULT IN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
RESULTS OF THE PERIODIC MANAGEMENT EVALUATIONS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND, IN THE CASE OF A FAILURE TO REMEDIATE ANY MATERIAL
WEAKNESSES THAT WE MAY IDENTIFY, WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ANNUAL AUDITOR ATTESTATION REPORTS REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. INADEQUATE INTERNAL
CONTROLS COULD ALSO CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT
ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING WERE DETERMINED TO BE INEFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND WE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN OUR COMPANY AND, AS A RESULT,
THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WE ARE REQUIRED, PURSUANT
TO SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, TO FURNISH A REPORT BY MANAGEMENT ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDES DISCLOSURE OF ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED BY OUR MANAGEMENT
IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. 

COMPLYING WITH SECTION
404 REQUIRES A RIGOROUS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AS WELL AS ADEQUATE TIME AND RESOURCES. AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPING, IMPROVING AND EXPANDING
OUR CORE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR SALES, ENGINEERING, SUPPLY CHAIN AND
MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT TIME AND SUPPORT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OUR INTERNAL
CONTROL EVALUATION, TESTING AND ANY REQUIRED REMEDIATION IN A TIMELY FASHION. FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE IDENTIFIED
MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS SUCH WE WERE UNABLE TO ASSERT THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
ARE EFFECTIVE. THIS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS,
WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

22 

THE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A PUBLIC
COMPANY MAY STRAIN OUR RESOURCES, DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED BOARD
MEMBERS. 

AS A PUBLIC COMPANY,
WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE WOULD NOT INCUR AS A PRIVATE COMPANY, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED
WITH PUBLIC COMPANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AS AMENDED,
THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND RELATED RULES IMPLEMENTED OR TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE SEC AND
THE NYSE AMEX. THE EXPENSES INCURRED BY PUBLIC COMPANIES GENERALLY FOR REPORTING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PURPOSES HAVE BEEN INCREASING.
WE EXPECT THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO INCREASE OUR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND TO MAKE SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME-CONSUMING
AND COSTLY, ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THESE COSTS WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
COULD ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO OBTAIN CERTAIN TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY
INSURANCE, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO ACCEPT REDUCED POLICY LIMITS AND COVERAGE OR INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER COSTS TO OBTAIN THE
SAME OR SIMILAR COVERAGE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED
PERSONS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OUR BOARD COMMITTEES OR AS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S
ATTENTION. FURTHERMORE, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO DELISTING OF OUR
COMMON STOCK, FINES, SANCTIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY ACTION AND POTENTIALLY CIVIL LITIGATION. 

SUBSTANTIAL SALES OF OUR STOCK MAY
IMPACT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

FUTURE SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES THAT WE MAY ISSUE UPON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK OR SECURITIES
CONVERTIBLE INTO OR EXERCISABLE FOR COMMON STOCK, THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE REDUCED AND THE PRICE OF
OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FALL. 

OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE. 

THE TRADING PRICE
OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS. THE STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER
OF EVENTS AND FACTORS, SUCH AS QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS, THE OPERATING AND STOCK PERFORMANCE OF OTHER COMPANIES
THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM AS COMPARABLE AND NEWS REPORTS RELATING TO TRENDS IN THE MARKETPLACE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT
VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY ARISE DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS: 

OUR
 DEVELOPING BUSINESS; 

RELATIVELY
 LOW PRICE PER SHARE; 

RELATIVELY
 LOW PUBLIC FLOAT; 

23 

VARIATIONS
 IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS; 

GENERAL
 TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS; 

THE
 NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK; AND 

THE
 INTEREST OF SECURITIES DEALERS IN MAINTAINING A MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 

AS LONG AS THERE IS
ONLY A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, THE SALE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT ANY PARTICULAR
TIME COULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AT THE MARKET PRICES PREVAILING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SUCH SHARES ARE OFFERED, AND COULD CAUSE
A SEVERE DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN CONNECTION
WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF QUOTES AND ORDER INFORMATION ON THE OTC MARKETS. 

TRADES AND QUOTATIONS
ON THE OTC MARKETS INVOLVE A MANUAL PROCESS AND THE MARKET INFORMATION FOR SUCH SECURITIES CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. IN ADDITION,
QUOTE INFORMATION, OR EVEN FIRM QUOTES, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. THE MANUAL EXECUTION PROCESS MAY DELAY ORDER PROCESSING AND INTERVENING
PRICE FLUCTUATIONS MAY RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF A LIMIT ORDER TO EXECUTE OR THE EXECUTION OF A MARKET ORDER AT A SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT PRICE. EXECUTION OF TRADES, EXECUTION REPORTING AND THE DELIVERY OF LEGAL TRADE CONFIRMATION MAY BE DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY.
CONSEQUENTLY, ONE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTIMUM TRADING PRICES. 

THERE ARE DELAYS IN ORDER COMMUNICATION
ON THE OTC MARKETS. 

ELECTRONIC PROCESSING
OF ORDERS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SECURITIES TRADED ON THE OTC MARKETPLACE AND HIGH ORDER VOLUME AND COMMUNICATION RISKS MAY PREVENT
OR DELAY THE EXECUTION OF ONE'S OTC MARKETPLACE TRADING ORDERS. THIS LACK OF AUTOMATED ORDER PROCESSING MAY AFFECT THE TIMELINESS
OF ORDER EXECUTION REPORTING AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FIRM QUOTES FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. HEAVY MARKET VOLUME MAY LEAD
TO A DELAY IN THE PROCESSING OF OTC MARKETPLACE SECURITY ORDERS FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, DUE TO THE MANUAL NATURE OF THE
MARKET. CONSEQUENTLY, ONE MAY NOT ABLE TO SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTIMUM TRADING PRICES. 

THERE IS A RISK OF MARKET FRAUD ON
THE OTC MARKETPLACE. 

OTC MARKETPLACE SECURITIES
ARE FREQUENT TARGETS OF FRAUD OR MARKET MANIPULATION. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENERALLY LOW PRICE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE OTC
MARKETPLACE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES ARE LESS STRINGENT THAN FOR LISTED OR NASDAQ TRADED SECURITIES, AND NO
EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED. DEALERS MAY DOMINATE THE MARKET AND SET PRICES THAT ARE NOT BASED ON COMPETITIVE FORCES. INDIVIDUALS
OR GROUPS MAY CREATE FRAUDULENT MARKETS AND CONTROL THE SUDDEN, SHARP INCREASE OF PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME AND THE EQUALLY SUDDEN
COLLAPSE OF THE MARKET PRICE FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

24 

THERE IS A LIMITATION IN CONNECTION
WITH THE EDITING AND CANCELING OF ORDERS ON THE OTC MARKETS. 

ORDERS FOR OTC MARKETS
SECURITIES MAY BE CANCELED OR EDITED LIKE ORDERS FOR OTHER SECURITIES. ALL REQUESTS TO CHANGE OR CANCEL AN ORDER MUST BE SUBMITTED
TO, RECEIVED AND PROCESSED BY THE OTC MARKETS. DUE TO THE MANUAL ORDER PROCESSING INVOLVED IN HANDLING OTC MARKETS TRADES, ORDER
PROCESSING AND REPORTING MAY BE DELAYED, AND ONE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL OR EDIT ONE'S ORDER. CONSEQUENTLY, ONE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SELL ITS SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTIMUM TRADING PRICES. 

INCREASED DEALER COMPENSATION COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. 

THE DEALER'S SPREAD
(THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BID AND ASK PRICES) MAY BE LARGE AND MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO THE SELLER OF SHARES OF OUR
COMMON STOCK ON THE OTC MARKETS IF THE STOCK MUST BE SOLD IMMEDIATELY. FURTHER, PURCHASERS OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY INCUR
AN IMMEDIATE PAPER LOSS DUE TO THE PRICE SPREAD. MOREOVER, DEALERS TRADING ON THE OTC MARKETS MAY NOT HAVE A BID PRICE
FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OTC MARKETS. DUE TO THE FOREGOING, DEMAND FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OTC MARKETS
MAY BE DECREASED OR ELIMINATED.

THE
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT. THIS REPORT
CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE
RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,
THE FOLLOWING: 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

WE
NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS AND FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING COULD LEAD TO THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING
FAILURE OF OUR COMPANY. 

WE
BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED AND MEET
OUR OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE, AS WELL PAY OUTSTANDING LOANS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY DUE AND PAYABLE. OUR CURRENTLY EXISTING CASH
RESOURCES FROM SALES WILL HOWEVER ENABLE US TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, SO LONG
AS WE DO NOT SETTLE ANY OF OUR LOANS THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE DURING THE PERIOD. UNLESS WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS OR GENERATE
FEES ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS, WHETHER THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SECURITIES, LICENSING FEES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OTHERWISE, WE
WILL BE REQUIRED TO SCALE BACK OPERATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY CONSEQUENTLY HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS
ENTIRELY. WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING, WE ALSO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS,
RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND DEVELOP NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS. AT THE PRESENT TIME, WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS FOR ANY FINANCING,
AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CAPITAL WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY
OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS AND WHEN NEEDED, AND WE MAY HAVE TO ACCEPT TERMS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 
ANY FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE FUNDING WILL DELAY OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND COULD LEAD TO ABANDONMENT
OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS PREVENT US FROM RESPONDING TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF UNANTICIPATED ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS OWED TO SUPPLIERS AND PROFESSIONAL
SERVICE PROVIDERS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 WE OWED APPROXIMATELY 2,185,000 ON OUTSTANDING NOTES THAT WE ISSUED. WE CURRENTLY
DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL RESOURCES FROM WHICH TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS. 

ANY
ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE DILUTIVE TO STOCKHOLDERS, AND DEBT AND CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUITY FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE, MAY
INVOLVE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OR OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD LIMIT HOW WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS. 

EVEN
IF WE RAISE FUNDS TO ADDRESS OUR IMMEDIATE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING
IN THE FUTURE TO RESPOND TO INCREASED EXPENSES OR SHORTFALLS IN ANTICIPATED REVENUES, ACCELERATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT,
RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, DEVELOP NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS, OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF UNANTICIPATED ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.
IN ADDITION, THE DETERIORATION IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT BEGAN IN 2008 AND CONTINUED INTO 2014 FURTHER COMPLICATES
OUR CAPITAL RAISING EFFORTS. 

THESE
CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN AND MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED. THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO
THE RECOVERABILITY OF REPORTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. 

WE
HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FUTURE. 

OUR
ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS APPROXIMATELY 22.3 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014. WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING LOSSES TO CONTINUE AS WE
CONTINUE TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND ENHANCE OUR TECHNOLOGY OFFERING, TO COMPLETE PROTOTYPING FOR PROOF-OF-CONCEPT,
OBTAIN REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS AS REQUIRED, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND FINANCE CAPABILITIES AND
CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE CASH FLOW IN THE SHORT-TERM UNTIL LICENSING REVENUES
BECOME AVAILABLE THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY S TECHNOLOGY VIA CLIENT CORPORATIONS FOR COMMERCIALIZATION AND
DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY. 

9 

WE
DO NOT HAVE A LONG OPERATING HISTORY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. 

SPO
LTD. COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN 1998. WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST PRODUCT INTO THE MARKETPLACE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004. ACCORDINGLY,
THERE IS LIMITED HISTORICAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REVENUE TRENDS AND OPERATIONS UPON WHICH INVESTORS CAN EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS.
OUR PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, EXPENSES, UNCERTAINTIES AND DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY ENTRANTS
INTO THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASING INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RELATIVE FAILURE RATES. 

THE
SALE OF OUR PULSEOX PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN
NECESSARY CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS. 

THE
DESIGN, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE
AND RIGOROUS REGULATION BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). IN ORDER FOR US TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES,
WE MUST OBTAIN CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL FROM THE FDA WHICH CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND UNCERTAIN AND CAN CAUSE LENGTHY DELAYS BEFORE WE
CAN BEGIN SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT BE SURE: 

THAT WE, OR ANY
 COLLABORATIVE PARTNER, WILL MAKE TIMELY FILINGS WITH THE FDA; 

THAT THE FDA WILL
 ACT FAVORABLY OR QUICKLY ON THESE SUBMISSIONS; 

THAT WE WILL NOT
 BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR PERFORM ADDITIONAL CLINICAL STUDIES; 

THAT WE WOULD
 NOT BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION FOR PRE-MARKET APPROVAL, RATHER THAN A 510(K) PRE-MARKET NOTIFICATION SUBMISSION
 AS DESCRIBED BELOW; OR 

THAT OTHER SIGNIFICANT
 DIFFICULTIES AND COSTS WILL NOT BE ENCOUNTERED TO OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL. 

THE
FDA MAY IMPOSE STRICT LABELING OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A CONDITION OF ITS CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL, ANY OF WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR
ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS. FURTHER, IF WE WISH TO MODIFY A PRODUCT AFTER FDA CLEARANCE OF A PRE-MARKET NOTIFICATION OR APPROVAL
OF A PRE-MARKET APPROVAL APPLICATION, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INDICATIONS OR OTHER MODIFICATIONS THAT COULD AFFECT SAFETY AND EFFICACY,
ADDITIONAL CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS WILL BE REQUIRED FROM THE FDA. ANY REQUEST BY THE FDA FOR ADDITIONAL DATA, OR ANY REQUIREMENT
BY THE FDA THAT WE CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL STUDIES OR SUBMIT TO THE MORE RIGOROUS AND LENGTHIER PRE-MARKET APPROVAL PROCESS,
COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN BRINGING OUR PRODUCTS TO MARKET AND SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND OTHER EXPENDITURES.
SIMILARLY, ANY LABELING OR OTHER CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FDA ON THE MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HINDER OUR
ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THE ABOVE ACTIONS BY THE FDA COULD DELAY OR PREVENT ALTOGETHER OUR ABILITY
TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS. FURTHER, THERE MAY BE NEW FDA POLICIES OR CHANGES IN FDA POLICIES THAT COULD BE ADVERSE
TO US. 

OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION, WHICH COULD DELAY OR PREVENT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN
JURISDICTIONS. 

IN
ORDER FOR US TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS, WE AND OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND AGENTS
MUST OBTAIN REQUIRED REGULATORY REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS. WE MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS REGARDING SAFETY,
EFFICACY AND QUALITY IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED REGULATORY REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS,
OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OBTAINING OR MAINTAINING ANY REGULATORY REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS WE
RECEIVE. DELAYS IN OBTAINING ANY REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS REQUIRED TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, FAILURE TO RECEIVE THESE
REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS, OR FUTURE LOSS OF PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED REGISTRATIONS OR APPROVALS WOULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SELL
OUR PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY BODIES HAVE ADOPTED VARIOUS REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRODUCT
STANDARDS, PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS, LABELING REQUIREMENTS, IMPORT RESTRICTIONS, TARIFF REGULATIONS, DUTIES AND TAX
REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. 

10 

EVEN
IF WE OBTAIN CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL TO SELL OUR PULSEOX MEDICAL PRODUCT LINE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS
THAT COULD LEAD TO THE RESTRICTION, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF OUR CLEARANCE. 

WE
ARE REQUIRED TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE FDA REGULATIONS AND ISO STANDARDS REGARDING GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE, WHICH INCLUDE TESTING,
CONTROL, AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PULSEOX PRODUCT LINE. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR REGULATIONS IN FOREIGN
COUNTRIES. ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED
IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH PERIODIC INSPECTIONS BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND IN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS
BY COMPARABLE NOTIFIED BODY FOR CE MARKING AND ISO STANDARDS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT
IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WARNING LETTERS, FINES, INJUNCTIONS, CIVIL PENALTIES, RECALL OR SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS, TOTAL OR PARTIAL
SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION, FAILURE TO OBTAIN PREMARKET CLEARANCE OR PREMARKET APPROVAL FOR DEVICES, WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVALS PREVIOUSLY
OBTAINED, AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THE RESTRICTION, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF REGULATORY APPROVALS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE TO
COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WOULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS. 

OUR
SUCCESS LARGELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND PROTECT THE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ON WHICH WE BASE OUR PRODUCTS. 

OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE
PATENT PROCESS, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO LICENSE FROM OTHERS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS.
IF ANY OF OUR PATENTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR OUR RIGHT OR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS
WAS TO BE LIMITED, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

THE
DEFENSE OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IS COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING AND THEIR OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, OUR LIMITED FINANCIAL
RESOURCES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEFEND OUR GRANTED PATENTS, IF CHALLENGED. AN ADVERSE DETERMINATION IN LITIGATION COULD SUBJECT
US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES, REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, OR RESTRICT OR PREVENT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS
IN CERTAIN MARKETS. ALTHOUGH PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES ARE OFTEN SETTLED THROUGH LICENSING OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS,
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND COULD INCLUDE ONGOING ROYALTIES. FURTHERMORE, THE NECESSARY LICENSES
MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL. THUS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IF THIRD PARTY PATENTS COVER ANY ASPECT
OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES, THEN WE MAY LACK FREEDOM TO OPERATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

AS
OF APRIL 2015, WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED TWELVE UNITED STATES PATENTS. ONE OR MORE OF THE PATENTS FOR OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE PRODUCTS,
MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR WE MAY OTHERWISE BE UNABLE TO RELY ON THESE PATENTS. THESE RISKS
ARE ALSO PRESENT FOR THE PROCESS WE USE OR WILL USE FOR MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHOM
HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES, MAY APPLY FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS THAT
PREVENT, LIMIT OR INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO MAKE, USE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS, EITHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN INTERNATIONAL
MARKETS. 

THE
MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE LITIGATION REGARDING PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE MAY INSTITUTE INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. THE DEFENSE AND
PROSECUTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS ARE BOTH COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. MOREOVER, WE MAY NEED TO LITIGATE TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, TO PROTECT OUR
TRADE SECRETS OR KNOW-HOW, OR TO DETERMINE THE ENFORCEABILITY, SCOPE AND VALIDITY OF THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. ANY
LITIGATION OR INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING US MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL AND OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES AND
MAY REQUIRE SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO DEVOTE ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR TIME TO THE PROCEEDINGS. AN ADVERSE
DETERMINATION IN THE PROCEEDINGS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, REQUIRE US TO SEEK LICENSES
FROM THIRD PARTIES OR PREVENT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS IN SOME OR ALL MARKETS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH A SATISFACTORY
SETTLEMENT OF ANY DISPUTE BY LICENSING NECESSARY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. EVEN IF WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT, THE
SETTLEMENT PROCESS MAY BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT MAY REQUIRE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL
ROYALTIES. AN ADVERSE DETERMINATION IN A JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING OR THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN A NECESSARY LICENSE
COULD PREVENT US FROM MANUFACTURING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. 

11 

IN
ADDITION TO PATENTS, WE RELY ON TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY KNOW-HOW, WHICH WE SEEK TO PROTECT, IN PART, THROUGH CONFIDENTIALITY
AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AGREEMENTS. THE OTHER PARTIES TO THESE AGREEMENTS MAY BREACH THESE PROVISIONS, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH. ADDITIONALLY, OUR TRADE SECRETS COULD OTHERWISE BECOME KNOWN TO OR BE INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED
BY COMPETITORS. 

OUR
PRODUCTS USE NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES OR APPLY TECHNOLOGIES IN MORE INNOVATIVE WAYS THAN OTHER COMPETING MEDICAL DEVICES AND ARE OR
WILL BE NEW TO THE MARKET; ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING WIDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR OPERATIONS
AND GROWTH WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR
TECHNOLOGY OFFERING IS BASED ON NEW METHODS OF REFLECTIVE PULSE OXIMETRY. IF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY DO NOT ACHIEVE
SIGNIFICANT MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OUR ROYALTIES FROM SALES WILL BE LIMITED AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY SUFFER. TO DATE, FEW INDEPENDENT
STUDIES REGARDING OUR TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. THE LACK OF INDEPENDENT STUDIES LIMITS THE ABILITY OF POTENTIAL OEM/LICENSING
PARTNERS TO COMPARE PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY WITHIN TO CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTS. 

OUR
LIMITED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE MAKES OUR REVENUE UNCERTAIN. 

WE
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OUR OXIMETRY TECHNOLOGY OFFERING. WE HAVE RELATIVELY LIMITED EXPERIENCE
IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AND ONLY HAVE ONE INTERNAL PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE TASKS. IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE OUR TECHNOLOGY OFFERING, WE MUST PARTNER WITH CLIENT CORPORATIONS FOR COMMERCIALIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF
PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REACH AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENT CORPORATIONS FOR COMMERCIALIZATION
AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED AND
WELL-FUNDED MARKETING AND SALES OPERATIONS. IF WE ENTER INTO A MARKETING ARRANGEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY, ANY REVENUES WE WOULD
RECEIVE WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THIS THIRD PARTY, AND WE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A SALES COMMISSION OR SIMILAR COMPENSATION
TO THIS PARTY. THE EFFORTS OF THESE THIRD PARTIES FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY WITHIN MAY
NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

BECAUSE
WE OPERATE IN AN INDUSTRY WITH SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT LIABILITY RISK, AND WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY INSURED AGAINST THIS RISK, WE
MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS AGAINST OUR PRODUCTS. 

MEDICAL
PRODUCTS ENTAIL SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE LIMITED PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE
BEYOND THAT PROVIDED BY OUR GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM ANY LIABILITIES,
INCLUDING ANY ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS, WE MIGHT INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TESTING, MANUFACTURE
AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM OR SERIES OF CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US THAT RESULT IN AN ADVERSE
JUDGMENT AGAINST OR SETTLEMENT BY US IN EXCESS OF ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR REPUTATION.
IN ADDITION, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE IS EXPENSIVE AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. 

THE
AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS VIA OUR LICENSEE IS UNCERTAIN, WHICH MAY LIMIT CONSUMER USE AND THE
MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 

IN
THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, SALES OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS ARE DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS OF THESE PRODUCTS
TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR COST FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS.
ANY INABILITY OF PATIENTS, HOSPITALS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER USERS OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR THE POLICIES OF
PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REGARDING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE PRODUCTS, COULD LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS. WE ARE
UNABLE TO PREDICT WHAT CHANGES WILL BE MADE IN THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODS USED BY THIRD-PARTY HEALTH CARE PAYORS. MOREOVER, THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING THE PRICES CHARGED FOR MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND SOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE GRADUALLY
ADOPTING A MANAGED CARE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE PROVIDERS CONTRACT TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR A FIXED COST
PER PERSON. PATIENTS, HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY BY THE
ATTENDANT COST SAVINGS AND CLINICAL BENEFITS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE DERIVED FROM THE USE OF SUCH PRODUCTS, AND THEREFORE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. 

12 

REIMBURSEMENT
AND HEALTH CARE PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BY COUNTRY AND INCLUDE BOTH GOVERNMENT SPONSORED HEALTH
CARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE. OUR LICENSEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN APPROVALS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THESE INTERNATIONAL THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL. ANY FAILURE TO RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT
ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH APPROVALS ARE SOUGHT. 

OUR
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS CONTROL OVER KEY DECISION MAKING AS A RESULT OF HIS CONTROL OF A MAJORITY OF OUR VOTING STOCK. 

MICHAEL
BRAUNOLD, OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, IS ABLE TO EXERCISE VOTING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING
POWER OF OUR OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK AND THEREFORE HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF MATTERS SUBMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
FOR APPROVAL, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND ANY MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS.
THIS CONCENTRATED CONTROL COULD DELAY, DEFER, OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY
ALL OF OUR ASSETS THAT OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS SUPPORT, OR CONVERSELY THIS CONCENTRATED CONTROL COULD RESULT IN THE CONSUMMATION
OF SUCH A TRANSACTION THAT OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS DO NOT SUPPORT. THIS CONCENTRATED CONTROL COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE A POTENTIAL
INVESTOR FROM ACQUIRING OUR COMMON STOCK DUE TO THE LIMITED VOTING POWER OF SUCH STOCK RELATIVE TO THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK,
 0.01 PAR VALUE PER SHARE HELD BY MR. BRAUNOLD, AND MIGHT HARM THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS A BOARD MEMBER AND OFFICER,
MR. BRAUNOLD OWES A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND MUST ACT IN GOOD FAITH IN A MANNER HE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. AS A STOCKHOLDER, EVEN A CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER, MR. BRAUNOLD IS ENTITLED TO
VOTE HIS SHARES IN HIS OWN INTERESTS, WHICH MAY NOT ALWAYS BE IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY. 

THERE
IS NO ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND NONE MAY DEVELOP OR BE SUSTAINED. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKET (PINK SHEETS) UNDER THE SYMBOL SPOM . THE OTC MARKET (PINK SHEETS)
IS A CENTRALIZED QUOTATION SERVICE THAT COLLECTS AND PUBLISHES MARKET MAKER QUOTES IN REAL TIME. BECAUSE OUR STOCK DOES NOT TRADE
ON A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE THIS MAY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

THERE
HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED TRADING ACTIVITY IN OUR COMMON STOCK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A MORE ACTIVE OR ESTABLISHED
TRADING MARKET WILL COMMENCE IN OUR SECURITIES. FURTHER, IN THE EVENT THAT AN ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET COMMENCES, THERE CAN
BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF ANY MARKET PRICE OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, WHETHER ANY TRADING MARKET WILL PROVIDE
LIQUIDITY TO INVESTORS, OR WHETHER ANY TRADING MARKET WILL BE SUSTAINED. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT OUR STOCK MAY BE
ILLIQUID. 

FUTURE
SALES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER DILUTIVE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 

AS
OF APRIL 14, 2015, WE HAD 100 MILLION AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH 7,039,679 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED
AND OUTSTANDING AS OF SUCH DATE. AN ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED 14,825,748 SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UPON EXERCISE OR CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING
OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. MANY OF THE THOSE OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES CONTAIN PROVISIONS
THAT REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF INCREASED NUMBERS OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OR CONVERSION IN THE EVENT OF STOCK SPLITS,
REDEMPTIONS, MERGERS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SUCH EVENT OR THE EXERCISE OR CONVERSION OF ANY OF THE OPTIONS,
WARRANTS OR CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD DILUTE THE INTEREST IN OUR COMPANY REPRESENTED BY EACH SHARE OF COMMON
STOCK AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY, WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION OR VOTE OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, TO ISSUE ALL OR ANY PART OF THE SHARES
OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE AND NEITHER ISSUED NOR RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE. ADDITIONALLY, WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL
FUNDS TO CONTINUE TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND MAINTAIN OUR OPERATIONS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED AND TO REALIZE OUR BUSINESS PLAN.
SUCH STOCK ISSUANCES MAY BE MADE AT A PRICE THAT REFLECTS A DISCOUNT FROM THE THEN-CURRENT TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
IN ORDER TO RAISE CAPITAL THAT WE NEED AT TODAY'S STOCK PRICES, WE WOULD LIKELY NEED TO ISSUE SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE
INTO OR EXERCISABLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

13 

THE
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF OUR SECURITIES OR THE OUTSTANDING SHARES ARE SALEABLE WITHOUT RESTRICTION.
ANY OF THESE ISSUANCES WILL DILUTE THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH WILL HAVE THE EFFECT
OF REDUCING THEIR INFLUENCE ON MATTERS ON WHICH OUR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE, AND MIGHT DILUTE THE BOOK VALUE AND MARKET VALUE OF OUR
COMMON STOCK. OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DILUTION UPON THE EXERCISE OF CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING OR SUBSEQUENTLY GRANTED
OPTIONS OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. 

THERE
IS A VERY LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR STOCK. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL LIKELY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN RESPONSE TO
THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL: 

VARIATIONS IN
 OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE IDENTIFIED IN THIS RISK
 FACTORS SECTION; 

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL
 ESTIMATES OF OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS
 BY US OF COMMENCEMENT OF, CHANGES TO, OR CANCELLATION OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT
 VENTURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS; 

ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES
 OF KEY PERSONNEL; 

STOCK MARKET PRICE
 AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCONSISTENT TRADING VOLUME LEVELS OF OUR STOCK; 

COMMENCEMENT OF
 OR INVOLVEMENT IN LITIGATION; AND 

ANNOUNCEMENTS
 BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS 

IN
ADDITION, THE EQUITY MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED VOLATILITY THAT HAS PARTICULARLY AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
ISSUED BY HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND THAT OFTEN HAS BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THOSE COMPANIES.
THESE BROAD MARKET FLUCTUATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

ADDITIONAL
BURDENS IMPOSED UPON BROKER-DEALERS BY THE APPLICATION OF THE PENNY STOCK RULES TO OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LIMIT THE
MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 

BROKER-DEALER
PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS ARE REGULATED BY CERTAIN PENNY STOCK RULES ADOPTED BY THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. PENNY STOCKS GENERALLY ARE EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 (OTHER THAN SECURITIES
REGISTERED ON CERTAIN NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES OR QUOTED ON THE NASDAQ SYSTEM, PROVIDED THAT CURRENT PRICES AND VOLUME INFORMATION
WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS IN SUCH SECURITIES ARE PROVIDED BY THE EXCHANGE OR SYSTEM). IF OUR COMMON STOCK CONTINUES TO BE OFFERED
AT A MARKET PRICE LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE, AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY EXEMPTION FROM THE PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS, OUR COMMON
STOCK WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO THESE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO LOW-PRICED STOCKS. 

THE
PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE A BROKER-DEALER, PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THE RULES, TO DELIVER
A STANDARDIZED RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT PENNY STOCKS AND THE RISKS IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET.
THE BROKER-DEALER ALSO MUST PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH CURRENT BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS FOR THE PENNY STOCK, THE COMPENSATION OF
THE BROKER-DEALER AND ITS SALESPERSON IN THE TRANSACTION, AND MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS SHOWING THE MARKET VALUE OF EACH PENNY
STOCK HELD IN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION, THE PENNY STOCK RULES GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY
STOCK THE BROKER-DEALER MAKE A SPECIAL WRITTEN DETERMINATION THAT THE PENNY STOCK IS A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE PURCHASER AND
RECEIVE THE PURCHASER'S WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION. THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN REDUCING THE LEVEL
OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN SECURITIES THAT BECOME SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES. 

14 

THE ADDITIONAL
BURDENS IMPOSED UPON BROKER-DEALERS BY THESE PENNY STOCK REQUIREMENTS MAY DISCOURAGE BROKER-DEALERS FROM EFFECTING TRANSACTIONS
IN THE COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD SEVERELY LIMIT THE MARKET LIQUIDITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO SELL
OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. 

OUR
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RIGHT TO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE RIGHTS
OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
BOARD OF DIRECTORS CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO DESIGNATE AND AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK, IN ONE OR MORE SERIES,
WITH SUCH VOTING, DIVIDEND AND OTHER RIGHTS AS OUR DIRECTORS MAY DETERMINE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CAN DESIGNATE NEW SERIES OF
PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY THE RIGHTS OF ANY HOLDERS OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
DILUTION OF THE EQUITY OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND THEIR VOTING POWER IF WE ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK
WITH VOTING RIGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE A
MAJORITY OF OUR OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OPERATIONS IN ISRAEL 

WE
DEPEND ON OUTSOURCED RESEARCH AND DEVLOPMENT FACILITIES IN ISRAEL AND ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY EVENT THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
THEIR CONDITION. 

ALL
OF OUR CURRENT OUTSOURCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL. FIRE, NATURAL DISASTER OR
ANY OTHER CAUSE OF MATERIAL DISRUPTION IN OUR OPERATION IN THIS LOCATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS
INDUSTRY, WE MUST RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS. DAMAGE TO FACILITIES IN ISRAEL COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DELAYS IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND, THEREFORE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE PARTICULAR
RISKS RELATING TO OUR LOCATION IN ISRAEL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. 

WE
MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. 

A
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR EXPENSES, PRIMARILY LABOR EXPENSES AND CERTAIN SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, ARE DENOMINATED IN NEW ISRAELI SHEKELS
 NIS . AS A RESULT, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES WITH THE US DOLLAR, OUR
PRIMARY REPORTING CURRENCY. THE RECENT VOLATILITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY MARKETS HAS BEEN EQUALLY REFLECTED AGAINST NIS
AND THIS MAY CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. OWING TO THE LACK OF CASH FLOW RESOURCES AND FINANCING, WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO
HEDGE AGAINST CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. 

THE
TRANSFER AND USE OF SOME OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PRODUCTION IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS WE RECEIVED
FROM THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP SUCH TECHNOLOGY. SUCH LIMITATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. 

OUR
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OXIMETRY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY FINANCED THROUGH GRANTS
FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SCIENTIST OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL (THE CHIEF SCIENTIST ). WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CHIEF SCIENTIST GRANTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRODUCTS DEVELOPED WITH THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THESE GRANTS
MAY NOT BE MANUFACTURED, NOR MAY THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS EMBODIED IN OUR PRODUCTS BE TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL WITHOUT APPROPRIATE
GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS AND/OR FINES. 

THESE
RESTRICTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THE SALE OR EXPORT FROM ISRAEL OF OUR PRODUCTS DEVELOPED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. THESE RESTRICTIONS
COULD LIMIT OR PREVENT OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. 

15 

DETERIORATION
OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SECURITY CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. 

ANY
MAJOR HOSTILITIES INVOLVING ISRAEL, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE PREVAILING REGIONAL SECURITY SITUATION OR THE INTERRUPTION OR
CURTAILMENT OF TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS PRESENT TRADING PARTNERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. SINCE
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN 1948, A NUMBER OF ARMED CONFLICTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS
AND A STATE OF HOSTILITY, VARYING IN DEGREE AND INTENSITY, HAS LED TO SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FOR ISRAEL. BEGINNING IN
SEPTEMBER 2000, THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP AND SECURITY SITUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY
AND CONTINUES TO BE MARKED BY ONGOING VIOLENCE, ALSO VARYING IN ITS DEGREE OF SEVERITY. DURING THE SUMMER OF 2006, ISRAEL WAS
ENGAGED IN AN ARMED CONFLICT WITH HEZBOLLAH, A LEBANESE ISLAMIST SHIITE MILITIA GROUP AND POLITICAL PARTY; AND DURING THE WINTER
OF 2008-2009, ISRAEL WAS ENGAGED IN AN ARMED CONFLICT WITH HAMAS, A MILITIA GROUP AND POLITICAL PARTY OPERATING IN THE GAZA STRIP.
THESE CONFLICTS INVOLVED MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST CIVILIAN TARGETS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF. TO DATE, THESE MATTERS HAVE NOT HAD ANY
MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT DO SO IN THE FUTURE. 

IN
ADDITION, CIVIL UNREST, OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY VIOLENCE, HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REGION. PROTESTORS HAVE DEMANDED ECONOMIC AND
POLITICAL REFORMS, AND TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REGIME CHANGES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. CIVIL UNREST COULD CONTINUE TO SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE REGION OR GROW IN INTENSITY, LEADING TO REGIME CHANGES RESULTING IN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO THE US, CIVIL
WARS, OR REGIONAL CONFLICT. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN RISING INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS OVER IRAN, WHICH WAS CENSURED BY THE
UNITED NATIONS OVER SUSPICIONS THAT IT IS TRYING TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE CONSIDERED ACTIONS RANGING
FROM ECONOMIC SANCTIONS TO PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES ON SUSPECTED NUCLEAR SITES, AND IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE THREATENED RETALIATION BY,
AMONG OTHER ACTIONS, CLOSING THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ, THROUGH WHICH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE GLOBAL CRUDE OIL SUPPLY IS TRANSPORTED. 

PROLONGED
AND/OR WIDESPREAD REGIONAL CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST COULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING RESULTS, AMONG OTHERS: 

CAPITAL MARKET
 REASSESSMENT OF RISK AND SUBSEQUENT REDEPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL TO MORE STABLE AREAS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN
 FINANCING FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; 

SECURITY CONCERNS
 IN ISRAEL, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR PERSONNEL OR SUPPLIES TO ENTER OR EXIT THE COUNTRY; 

SECURITY CONCERNS
 LEADING TO EVACUATION OF OUR PERSONNEL; 

INABILITY OF OUR

RISK
 FACTORS 

WE FACE A NUMBER OF SUBSTANTIAL RISKS. OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STOCK PRICE COULD BE
 MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THE
 FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
 OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON
 FORM 10-K, 
 INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL
 FINANCING 

WE
 HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, AND WE MAY NOT GENERATE
 REVENUE OR ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. 

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY
 DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY, ALONE OR WITH COLLABORATORS, TO COMPLETE
 SUCCESSFULLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, CONDUCT
 PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS, OBTAIN THE NECESSARY
 REGULATORY APPROVALS AND MANUFACTURE AND MARKET THE RESULTING
 PRODUCTS. WE HAVE HAD NO PRODUCT REVENUE TO DATE. WE HAVE
 EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE WE BEGAN OPERATIONS IN 2001.
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF
 APPROXIMATELY 10.5 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL
 OPERATING LOSSES AND EXPECT CUMULATIVE LOSSES TO INCREASE AS OUR
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL, CLINICAL, MANUFACTURING
 AND MARKETING EFFORTS EXPAND.

OUR
 BUSINESS WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED FUNDING. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE
 ADEQUATE FUNDING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR
 OPERATIONS. 

TO DATE, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE
 PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THROUGH GOVERNMENT
 GRANTS. WE WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FINANCING AT
 VARIOUS INTERVALS FOR OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FOR CLINICAL
 TRIALS, FOR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT, FOR PURSUIT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS
 AND FOR ESTABLISHING OR CONTRACTING OUT MANUFACTURING, MARKETING
 AND SALES FUNCTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH ADDITIONAL
 FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL.
 IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING THAT IS
 REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AT CURRENT
 LEVELS OR AT LEVELS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY
 BE REQUIRED TO DELAY CLINICAL STUDIES, CURTAIL OPERATIONS OR
 OBTAIN FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE
 US TO RELINQUISH RIGHTS TO SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR POTENTIAL
 MARKETS.

RISKS
 RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCT
 CANDIDATES AND DEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTIES 

OUR
 PRODUCTS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND ARE UNPROVEN. THESE
 PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

IN ORDER TO BECOME PROFITABLE, WE MUST GENERATE REVENUE THROUGH
 SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, HOWEVER OUR PRODUCTS ARE IN VARYING
 STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. OUR PRODUCTS HAVE NOT BEEN
 PROVEN IN HUMAN RESEARCH TRIALS AND HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED BY
 ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY FOR SALE. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY
 DEVELOP AND PROVE OUR PRODUCTS, AND IF WE DO NOT DEVELOP OTHER
 SOURCES OF REVENUE, WE WILL NOT BECOME PROFITABLE AND AT SOME
 POINT WE WOULD DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS.

WE
 HAVE SOLD NO PRODUCTS OR GENERATED ANY REVENUES AND WE DO NOT
 ANTICIPATE ANY SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO BE GENERATED IN THE
 FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

WE HAVE CONDUCTED PRE-CLINICAL TRIALS AND ARE CONDUCTING
 CLINICAL TRIALS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR SEVERAL MORE
 YEARS BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR TECHNOLOGY. THERE
 CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL EVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT
 REVENUES.

WHETHER
 WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WILL BE DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON THE
 LEADERSHIP PROVIDED BY OUR MANAGEMENT. IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE
 SERVICES OF ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, OUR BUSINESS AND
 OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WILL BE DEPENDENT, IN
 PART, UPON THE LEADERSHIP PROVIDED BY OUR OFFICERS, PARTICULARLY
 OUR CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF
 OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AND OUR PRIMARY SCIENTIST, DR. HARRIET ROBINSON. THE LOSS
 OF THE SERVICES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT
 OUR OPERATIONS.

REGULATORY
 AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR
 OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

IN ORDER TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE MUST COMPLY
 WITH EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC REGULATION. IN ORDER
 TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROVAL FROM THE FDA
 IS REQUIRED. THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS IS EXPENSIVE AND
 TIME-CONSUMING. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE
 APPROVED BY THE FDA. EVEN IF THEY ARE APPROVED, WE CANNOT
 PREDICT THE TIME FRAME FOR APPROVAL. FOREIGN REGULATORY
 REQUIREMENTS DIFFER FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND MAY,
 IN SOME CASES, BE MORE STRINGENT OR DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THAN FDA
 APPROVAL. AS WITH THE FDA, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF OR WHEN WE MAY
 OBTAIN THESE REGULATORY APPROVALS. IF WE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT
 OUR PRODUCTS CAN BE USED SAFELY AND SUCCESSFULLY IN A BROAD
 SEGMENT OF THE PATIENT POPULATION ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, OUR
 PRODUCTS WOULD LIKELY BE DENIED APPROVAL BY THE FDA AND THE
 REGULATORY AGENCIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.

WE
 WILL FACE INTENSE COMPETITION AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
 THAT COULD RESULT IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THE PRODUCTS
 WE WILL BE COMMERCIALIZING OR DEVELOPING. 

THE MARKET FOR VACCINES THAT PROTECT AGAINST HIV/AIDS IS
 INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT
 TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. WE WILL HAVE NUMEROUS COMPETITORS IN THE
 UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, LARGE
 COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN US. THESE
 COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE
 EFFECTIVE OR LESS COSTLY THAN ANY OF OUR FUTURE PRODUCTS OR THAT
 COULD RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT
 MOST OF THESE COMPETITORS TO HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESOURCES
 THAN US. IN ADDITION, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO
 EXPERIENCE CONSOLIDATION, RESULTING IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF
 LARGER, MORE DIVERSIFIED COMPANIES THAN US. AMONG OTHER THINGS,
 THESE COMPANIES CAN SPREAD THEIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
 OVER MUCH BROADER REVENUE BASES THAN WE CAN AND CAN INFLUENCE
 CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR BUYING DECISIONS.

OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE AMONG PHYSICIANS,
 PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE PAYORS AND THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO
 COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY INCLUDE:

THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF OUR VACCINES;

THE TIME AND SCOPE OF REGULATORY APPROVAL;

REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS;

THE PRICE AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS; AND

PATENT PROTECTION.

OUR
 PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE BASED ON NEW TECHNOLOGY AND,
 CONSEQUENTLY, ARE INHERENTLY RISKY. CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY
 AND EFFICACY OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD LIMIT OUR FUTURE
 SUCCESS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF FAILURE INHERENT IN THE
 DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES BASED ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
 THESE RISKS INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRODUCTS WE CREATE
 WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE, THAT OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES WILL BE
 UNSAFE OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY
 APPROVALS OR THAT OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES WILL BE HARD TO
 MANUFACTURE ON A LARGE SCALE OR WILL BE UNECONOMICAL TO MARKET.

MANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAUSE MULTIPLE POTENTIAL
 COMPLICATIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS, NOT ALL OF WHICH CAN BE
 PREDICTED WITH ACCURACY AND MANY OF WHICH MAY VARY FROM PATIENT
 TO PATIENT. LONG TERM
 FOLLOW-UP 
 DATA MAY REVEAL ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR
 PRODUCTS. THE RESPONSES OF POTENTIAL PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS TO
 INFORMATION ABOUT COMPLICATIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE
 MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH IN TURN WOULD
 MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

BECAUSE
 WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL OBTAIN REGULATORY
 APPROVAL TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, WE CANNOT
 PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY FUTURE REVENUE FROM THESE PRODUCT
 CANDIDATES. 

WE CANNOT COMMERCIALIZE ANY OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES UNTIL THE
 APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
 THE APPLICATIONS FOR THE PRODUCT CANDIDATES. THE REGULATORY
 AGENCIES MAY NOT COMPLETE THEIR REVIEW PROCESSES IN A TIMELY
 MANNER AND WE MAY NOT OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR ANY PRODUCT
 CANDIDATE WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS DEVELOP. SATISFACTION OF
 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TYPICALLY TAKES MANY YEARS, IF APPROVAL
 IS OBTAINED AT ALL, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE, COMPLEXITY AND
 NOVELTY OF THE PRODUCT AND REQUIRES THE EXPENDITURE OF
 SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES. REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESSES OUTSIDE THE
 UNITED STATES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
 FDA APPROVAL PROCESS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS OR
 REJECTIONS BASED UPON ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION FROM
 FUTURE LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR CHANGES IN FDA
 POLICY DURING THE PERIOD OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS
 AND FDA REGULATORY REVIEW. THE FDA HAS SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION IN
 THE APPROVAL PROCESS AND MAY REFUSE TO ACCEPT ANY APPLICATION OR
 MAY DECIDE THAT OUR DATA IS INSUFFICIENT FOR APPROVAL AND
 REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL, CLINICAL OR OTHER STUDIES. IN
 ADDITION, VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DATA OBTAINED FROM
 PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTING COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT
 REGULATORY APPROVAL OF A PRODUCT CANDIDATE.

WE MAY
 EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS THAT COULD ADVERSELY
 AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUR COMMERCIAL
 PROSPECTS. 

WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER PLANNED CLINICAL TRIALS WILL BEGIN ON
 TIME OR WHETHER WE WILL COMPLETE ANY OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS ON
 SCHEDULE OR AT ALL. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WILL INCREASE IF
 WE HAVE DELAYS IN TESTING OR APPROVALS OR IF WE NEED TO PERFORM
 MORE OR LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS THAN PLANNED. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS
 MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE COMMERCIAL
 PROSPECTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND DELAY OUR ABILITY TO BECOME
 PROFITABLE.

WE RELY HEAVILY ON THE HVTN, INDEPENDENT CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS,
 AND OTHER THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION
 OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, BUT DO NOT CONTROL MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR
 ACTIVITIES. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT EACH OF OUR
 CLINICAL TRIALS IS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL
 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND PROTOCOLS FOR THE TRIAL. MOREOVER, THE
 FDA REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH STANDARDS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO
 AS GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, FOR CONDUCTING AND RECORDING AND
 REPORTING THE RESULTS OF CLINICAL TRIALS TO ASSURE THAT DATA AND
 REPORTED RESULTS ARE CREDIBLE AND ACCURATE AND THAT THE RIGHTS,
 INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL PARTICIPANTS ARE
 PROTECTED. OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL
 DOES NOT RELIEVE US OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS.
 THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT COMPLETE ACTIVITIES ON SCHEDULE, OR MAY
 NOT CONDUCT OUR CLINICAL TRIALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY
 REQUIREMENTS OR OUR STATED PROTOCOLS. THE FAILURE OF THESE THIRD
 PARTIES TO CARRY OUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS COULD DELAY OR PREVENT
 THE DEVELOPMENT, APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT
 CANDIDATES.

UNSUCCESSFUL
 OR DELAYED REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE
 COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD INCREASE OUR FUTURE
 DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR IMPAIR OUR FUTURE SALES. 

NONE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE
 FDA FOR SALES IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. TO
 EXPLOIT THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES, WE ARE
 CONDUCTING AND PLANNING TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PRE-CLINICAL
 STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS. THIS PROCESS IS EXPENSIVE AND CAN
 REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. FAILURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY
 STAGE OF TESTING, EVEN IF THE RESULTS ARE FAVORABLE. FAILURE TO
 ADEQUATELY DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN CLINICAL TRIALS
 WOULD PREVENT REGULATORY APPROVAL AND RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO
 COMMERCIALIZE OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ANY SUCH FAILURE MAY SEVERELY
 HARM OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY APPROVALS WE OBTAIN MAY NOT
 COVER ALL OF THE CLINICAL INDICATIONS FOR WHICH APPROVAL IS
 SOUGHT, OR MAY CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IN THE FORM OF
 NARROW INDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS OR CONTRAINDICATIONS
 WITH RESPECT TO CONDITIONS OF USE, OR IN THE FORM OF ONEROUS
 RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS, RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION, OR
 POST-APPROVAL STUDY REQUIREMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

STATE
 PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
 MAY EXPOSE US TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL ACTION BY STATE
 GOVERNMENTS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. 

IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, VERMONT,
 MAINE, MINNESOTA, NEW MEXICO AND WEST VIRGINIA, HAVE ENACTED
 LEGISLATION REQUIRING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH
 MARKETING COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND FILE PERIODIC REPORTS ON
 SALES, MARKETING, PRICING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. SIMILAR
 LEGISLATION IS BEING CONSIDERED IN OTHER STATES. MANY OF THESE
 REQUIREMENTS ARE NEW AND UNCERTAIN, AND AVAILABLE GUIDANCE IS
 LIMITED. UNLESS WE ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, WE
 COULD FACE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND FINES AND OTHER PENALTIES AND
 COULD RECEIVE ADVERSE PUBLICITY, ALL OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR
 BUSINESS.

WE MAY
 BE SUBJECT TO NEW FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATION TO SUBMIT
 INFORMATION ON OUR OPEN AND COMPLETED CLINICAL TRIALS TO PUBLIC
 REGISTRIES AND DATABASES. 

IN 1997, A PUBLIC REGISTRY OF OPEN CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING
 DRUGS INTENDED TO TREAT SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR
 CONDITIONS WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE FOOD AND DRUG
 ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION ACT, OR THE FDMA, IN ORDER TO
 PROMOTE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO THESE CLINICAL TRIALS.
 UNDER THE FDMA, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER TRIAL
 SPONSORS ARE REQUIRED TO POST THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF THESE
 TRIALS, AS WELL AS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, LOCATION AND
 CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE TRIALS. SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
 THIS REGISTRY, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DEBATE FOCUSED
 ON BROADENING THE TYPES OF TRIALS INCLUDED IN THIS OR OTHER
 REGISTRIES, AS WELL AS PROVIDING FOR PUBLIC ACCESS TO CLINICAL
 TRIAL RESULTS. A VOLUNTARY COALITION OF MEDICAL JOURNAL EDITORS
 HAS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION TO PUBLISH RESULTS ONLY FROM THOSE
 TRIALS THAT HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH A NO-COST, PUBLICLY
 ACCESSIBLE DATABASE, SUCH AS WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV. FEDERAL
 LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FALL OF 2004 TO EXPAND
 WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND TO REQUIRE THE INCLUSION OF STUDY
 RESULTS IN THIS REGISTRY. THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND
 MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA HAS ALSO ISSUED VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLES
 FOR ITS MEMBERS TO MAKE RESULTS FROM CERTAIN CLINICAL STUDIES
 PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND HAS ESTABLISHED A WEBSITE FOR THIS
 PURPOSE. OTHER GROUPS HAVE ADOPTED OR ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR
 PROPOSALS FOR CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION AND THE POSTING OF
 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY CLINICAL
 TRIAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS COULD EXPOSE US TO NEGATIVE
 PUBLICITY, FINES AND OTHER PENALTIES, ALL OF WHICH COULD
 MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE
 WILL FACE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT AND
 HEALTH CARE REFORM. 

IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MARKETS, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL
 DEPEND IN PART ON THE AVAILABILITY OF REIMBURSEMENT FROM
 THIRD-PARTY PAYORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
 AUTHORITIES, PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS, HEALTH MAINTENANCE
 ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE-RELATED ORGANIZATIONS.
 REIMBURSEMENT BY SUCH PAYORS IS PRESENTLY UNDERGOING REFORM AND
 THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME HOW THIS WILL
 AFFECT SALES OF CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.

MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS
 GOVERN DRUG COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS IN THE UNITED
 STATES. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES ALL PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO
 REBATE A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR REVENUE ARISING FROM
 MEDICAID-REIMBURSED DRUG SALES TO INDIVIDUAL STATES. GENERIC
 DRUG MANUFACTURERS AGREEMENTS WITH FEDERAL AND STATE
 GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE THAT THE MANUFACTURER WILL REMIT TO EACH
 STATE MEDICAID AGENCY, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, 11 OF THE AVERAGE
 MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR GENERIC PRODUCTS MARKETED AND SOLD UNDER
 ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS COVERED BY THE STATE S
 MEDICAID PROGRAM. FOR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE MARKETED
 AND SOLD UNDER NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS, MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED
 TO REBATE THE GREATER OF (A) 15.1 OF THE AVERAGE
 MANUFACTURER PRICE OR (B) THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
 AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE AND THE LOWEST MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR
 PRODUCTS SOLD DURING A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND
 FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO PROPOSE AND PASS NEW
 LEGISLATION, RULES AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO CONTAIN OR REDUCE
 THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. EXISTING REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE
 PRICE OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER MEDICAL PRODUCTS MAY ALSO
 CHANGE BEFORE ANY PRODUCTS ARE APPROVED FOR MARKETING. COST
 CONTROL INITIATIVES COULD DECREASE THE PRICE THAT WE RECEIVE FOR
 ANY PRODUCT DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THIRD-PARTY
 PAYORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING THE PRICE AND
 COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND
 LITIGATION HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL
 COMPANIES IN RELATION TO THESE ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, SOME
 UNCERTAINTY MAY EXIST AS TO THE REIMBURSEMENT STATUS

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OF NEWLY APPROVED INJECTABLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. OUR
 PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED COST EFFECTIVE OR ADEQUATE
 THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO ENABLE US TO
 MAINTAIN PRICE LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO REALIZE AN ADEQUATE RETURN
 ON OUR INVESTMENT.

WE MAY
 NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING COLLABORATIONS FOR PRODUCT
 CANDIDATES WE MAY SEEK TO COMMERCIALIZE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY
 AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE
 PRODUCTS. 

WE EXPECT TO SEEK COLLABORATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND
 COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN THE FUTURE. THE
 TIMING AND TERMS OF ANY COLLABORATION WILL DEPEND ON THE
 EVALUATION BY PROSPECTIVE COLLABORATORS OF THE TRIAL RESULTS AND
 OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR VACCINE S SAFETY AND EFFICACY PROFILE.
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH SUITABLE COLLABORATORS
 FOR ANY PRODUCT CANDIDATE, WE WOULD BE FORCED TO FUND THE ENTIRE
 DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF SUCH PRODUCT CANDIDATES,
 AND WE MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. IF RESOURCE
 CONSTRAINTS REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO A COLLABORATION EARLY IN
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT CANDIDATE, WE MAY BE FORCED TO
 ACCEPT A MORE LIMITED SHARE OF ANY REVENUES THIS PRODUCT MAY
 EVENTUALLY GENERATE. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN SEEKING
 APPROPRIATE COLLABORATORS. MOREOVER, THESE COLLABORATION
 ARRANGEMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING TO NEGOTIATE AND
 DOCUMENT. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH
 COLLABORATIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ANY PRODUCT
 CANDIDATE. EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING
 COLLABORATIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE FULFILLMENT BY
 COLLABORATORS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS OR OUR EXPECTATIONS.

WE MAY
 BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND LAWSUITS OR PAY DAMAGES FOR PRODUCT
 LIABILITY CLAIMS. 

PRODUCT LIABILITY IS A MAJOR RISK IN TESTING AND MARKETING
 BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. WE MAY FACE
 SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY EXPOSURE IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS
 AND FOR PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL AFTER REGULATORY APPROVAL. WE
 CARRY PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE SUCH
 POLICIES. PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERITS,
 COULD EXCEED POLICY LIMITS, DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION,
 AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR
 PRODUCTS.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

OTHER
 COMPANIES MAY CLAIM THAT WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT
 EXPENSES OR PREVENT US FROM SELLING PRODUCTS. 

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE
 WITHOUT INFRINGING THE PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD
 PARTIES. THE MANUFACTURE, USE AND SALE OF NEW PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN
 SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PATENT RIGHTS LITIGATION IN THE
 PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THESE LAWSUITS GENERALLY RELATE TO THE
 VALIDITY AND INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF
 THIRD PARTIES. INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION IS PREVALENT WITH RESPECT
 TO GENERIC VERSIONS OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE PATENT COVERING
 THE BRAND NAME PRODUCT IS EXPIRING, PARTICULARLY SINCE MANY
 COMPANIES WHICH MARKET GENERIC PRODUCTS FOCUS THEIR DEVELOPMENT
 EFFORTS ON PRODUCTS WITH EXPIRING PATENTS. OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL
 COMPANIES, BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH
 INSTITUTIONS MAY HAVE FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
 GRANTED PATENTS THAT COVER ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR
 LICENSORS PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR OTHER
 TECHNOLOGIES.

FUTURE OR EXISTING PATENTS ISSUED TO THIRD PARTIES MAY CONTAIN
 PATENT CLAIMS THAT CONFLICT WITH OUR PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT TO BE
 SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY
 COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND THIRD PARTIES COULD ASSERT INFRINGEMENT
 CLAIMS AGAINST US IN THE FUTURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CURRENT
 PRODUCTS OR WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS THAT WE MAY DEVELOP OR
 LICENSE. LITIGATION OR INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS COULD FORCE US
 TO:

STOP OR DELAY SELLING, MANUFACTURING OR USING PRODUCTS THAT
 INCORPORATE OR ARE MADE USING THE CHALLENGED INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY;

PAY DAMAGES; OR

ENTER INTO LICENSING OR ROYALTY AGREEMENTS THAT MAY NOT BE
 AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ANY LITIGATION OR INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
 OUTCOME, WOULD LIKELY DELAY THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, BE
 COSTLY AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ATTENTION OF OUR KEY
 MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL.

ANY
 INABILITY TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE UNITED
 STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO
 MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS. 

WE WILL RELY ON TRADE SECRETS, UNPATENTED PROPRIETARY KNOW-HOW,
 CONTINUING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND, IN SOME CASES, PATENT
 PROTECTION TO PRESERVE A COMPETITIVE POSITION. OUR PATENTS AND
 LICENSED PATENT RIGHTS MAY BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, INFRINGED
 OR CIRCUMVENTED, AND THE RIGHTS GRANTED IN THOSE PATENTS MAY NOT
 PROVIDE PROPRIETARY PROTECTION OR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO US.
 WE AND OUR LICENSORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP PATENTABLE
 PRODUCTS. EVEN IF PATENT CLAIMS ARE ALLOWED, THE CLAIMS MAY NOT
 ISSUE, OR IN THE EVENT OF ISSUANCE, MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
 PROTECT THE TECHNOLOGY OWNED BY OR LICENSED TO US. IF PATENTS
 CONTAINING COMPETITIVE OR CONFLICTING CLAIMS ARE ISSUED TO THIRD
 PARTIES, WE MAY BE PREVENTED FROM COMMERCIALIZING THE PRODUCTS
 COVERED BY SUCH PATENTS, OR MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN OR DEVELOP
 ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, OTHER PARTIES MAY DUPLICATE,
 DESIGN AROUND OR INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SIMILAR OR ALTERNATIVE
 TECHNOLOGIES.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THIRD PARTIES FROM INFRINGING OR
 USING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE PARTIES FROM WHOM WE
 MAY LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT
 THIRD PARTIES FROM INFRINGING OR USING THE LICENSED INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY. WE GENERALLY WILL ATTEMPT TO CONTROL AND LIMIT ACCESS
 TO, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF, OUR PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION AND OTHER
 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. DESPITE EFFORTS TO PROTECT THIS
 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, HOWEVER, UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY
 OBTAIN AND USE INFORMATION THAT WE MAY REGARD AS PROPRIETARY.
 OTHER PARTIES MAY INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SIMILAR KNOW-HOW OR MAY
 EVEN OBTAIN ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES.

THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES DO NOT PROTECT PROPRIETARY
 INFORMATION TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES,
 AND MANY COMPANIES HAVE ENCOUNTERED SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND
 COSTS IN PROTECTING THEIR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN THESE
 FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE AND THE COURTS HAVE
 NOT ESTABLISHED A CONSISTENT POLICY REGARDING THE BREADTH OF
 CLAIMS ALLOWED IN PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS. THE ALLOWANCE OF
 BROADER CLAIMS MAY INCREASE THE INCIDENCE AND COST OF PATENT
 INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND THE RISK OF INFRINGEMENT
 LITIGATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ALLOWANCE OF NARROWER CLAIMS
 MAY LIMIT THE VALUE OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

WE MAY
 EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY
 AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE
 TO BE, VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS IN
 RESPONSE TO MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING,
 SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL:

THE INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR SHARES BY A
 LIMITED NUMBER OF AFFILIATED SHAREHOLDERS FOLLOWING THE MERGER
 MAY LIMIT INTEREST IN OUR SECURITIES;

VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS FROM THE EXPECTATIONS
 OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS;

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS OR
 SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS;

GENERAL TECHNOLOGICAL, MARKET OR ECONOMIC TRENDS;

INVESTOR PERCEPTION OF THE INDUSTRY OR OUR PROSPECTS;

INVESTORS ENTERING INTO SHORT SALE CONTRACTS;

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
 INDUSTRY; AND

ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL.

 RISK FACTORS THE FOLLOWING ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS
THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS OR EVENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE.
UNFORESEEN RISKS COULD ARISE AND PROBLEMS OR ISSUES THAT WE NOW VIEW AS MINOR COULD BECOME MORE SIGNIFICANT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD
BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OR GIVE ANY ASSURANCE THAT ANY ACTIONS TAKEN TO REDUCE KNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WILL BE EFFECTIVE. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE CURRENT GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 OUR OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON LEVELS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND
CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH HAVE RECENTLY DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MAY REMAIN DEPRESSED, OR BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETERIORATION. ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY INFLUENCE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS INCLUDE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT
CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS LEADING TO REDUCED 
 
 11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

LEVELS OF INVESTMENT, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING PRIORITIES, THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ACCESS
TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRIAL OR CONSUMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THE RECENT
DISTRESS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS RESULTED IN REDUCED LIQUIDITY AND A TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MARKETS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE SEVERAL POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS, INCLUDING THE INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN
CREDIT TO FINANCE PURCHASES OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS, THE INSOLVENCY OF CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES AND BAD DEBTS, AND THE INSOLVENCY OF KEY SUPPLIERS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION DELAYS. WE INVEST OUR CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENTS IN INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT MARKET DISTRESS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKET ILLIQUIDITY. OUR PRIMARY MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND UNPREDICTABLE OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR THERMAL IMAGING SYSTEMS IN A
VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND GOVERNMENT MARKETS. IN THE PAST, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THESE MARKETS HAS FLUCTUATED DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: 

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY; 

THE TIMING, NUMBER AND SIZE OF ORDERS FROM, AND SHIPMENTS TO, OUR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE RELATIVE MIX OF THOSE ORDERS; 

VARIATIONS IN THE VOLUME OF ORDERS FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR PRODUCT LINE IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER; 

THE SIZE AND TIMING OF NEW CONTRACT AWARDS; 

THE TIMING OF THE RELEASE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS FOR PROCUREMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS; AND 

THE TIMING OF ORDERS AND SHIPMENTS WITHIN A GIVEN FISCAL QUARTER, AS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES ARE FREQUENTLY CONCENTRATED IN THE LAST WEEK OR DAYS OF A
FISCAL QUARTER. SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY THE INCREASE IN SALES WE GENERALLY
EXPERIENCE EVERY YEAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, RESULT FROM: 

THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF CONTRACTING BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS; 

THE FREQUENT REQUIREMENT OF INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS TO TAKE DELIVERY OF EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO JANUARY DUE TO FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS; AND 

THE TENDENCY OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES TO FULLY UTILIZE ANNUAL CAPITAL BUDGETS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. WE DEPEND ON THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS WE DERIVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS OR SUBCONTRACTS WITH UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION
IN THE PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY THESE AGENCIES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, APPROXIMATELY 41 PERCENT, 39 PERCENT AND 32 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR REVENUES WERE
DERIVED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM CONTRACTS WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES. RECENTLY, A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN LARGER INDEFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY IDIQ CONTRACTS. THE FUNDING OF
CONTRACTS AWARDED TO US DEPENDS ON THE OVERALL UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION PROCESS, WHICH IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, AT ITS DISCRETION, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MAY CHANGE ITS SPENDING PRIORITIES AND/OR TERMINATE,
REDUCE OR MODIFY CONTRACTS. AS A UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PROCUREMENT RULES AND REGULATIONS
 GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS MUST COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO ROUTINE AUDITS AND
INVESTIGATIONS BY UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE 
 
 12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

RULES AND REGULATIONS, THE RESULTS COULD INCLUDE: REDUCTIONS IN THE VALUE OF CONTRACTS; CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS OR TERMINATION; THE ASSESSMENT OF PENALTIES
AND FINES; AND/OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR PERMANENTLY. OUR FUTURE
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND ENTER INTO NEW MARKETS THE THERMAL IMAGING INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ENHANCEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS.
OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ANTICIPATE CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, REDUCE COSTS AND OTHERWISE RETAIN OR ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR FUTURE RESULTS
FROM OPERATIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS TO IMPROVE OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY, REDUCE COSTS, AND DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS. IF WE
FAIL TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE
SUCCESSFUL OR THAT CUSTOMERS WILL ACCEPT ANY OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS. WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX GLOBAL
ORGANIZATION AS THE COMPANY HAS GROWN, THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE COMPANY S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS HAVE ALSO INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY.
WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS HAVE GROWN TO ACCOMMODATE THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF NUMEROUS PRODUCT LINES ACROSS EACH OF OUR THREE DIVISIONS IN A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT TIME AND EFFORT IS
REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE INCREASED COMPLEXITY OF THE BUSINESS. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE GLOBAL OPERATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE
MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS AT VARIOUS FACILITIES AS DESCRIBED IN

1A. RISK FACTORS 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS 

IN
ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT, THE FOLLOWING RISKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS
AND PROSPECTS: 

BECAUSE
WE HAVE NOMINAL ASSETS AND MINIMAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE CONSIDERED A SHELL COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS IS DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE. 

BECAUSE
WE HAVE NOMINAL OPERATIONS AND MINIMAL ASSETS, WE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERED A SHELL COMPANY, THE SECURITIES PREVIOUSLY SOLD IN PAST OFFERINGS
CAN ONLY BE RESOLD THROUGH REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT ); SECTION
4(1) OF THE SECURITIES ACT, IF AVAILABLE, FOR NON-AFFILIATES; OR BY MEETING THE CONDITIONS OF RULE 144(I) OF THE SECURITIES ACT. 

TO
ELIMINATE OUR STATUS AS A SHELL COMPANY, WE ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING NEW CLIENTS THEREBY PRODUCING REVENUE AND ASSETS. THIS MAY BE
ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH OUR OWN INITIATIVES AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES. SINCE INCEPTION, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN ORGANIZATIONAL
EFFORTS AND IN PURSUING CLIENTS. 

AS
THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY A SHELL COMPANY WITH NOMINAL ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE
AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY MAY HAVE MINIMAL OPERATIONS OR REVENUES OR EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. WE CURRENTLY
DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR REVENUE. WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL SUSTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT CORRESPONDING REVENUES.
THIS MAY RESULT IN OUR INCURRING A NET OPERATING LOSS THAT WILL INCREASE CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL WE CAN GENERATE REVENUES. THERE IS
NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN A SUITABLE BUSINESS OPERATION. 

WE
ARE NOT CURRENTLY PROFITABLE AND MAY NOT BECOME PROFITABLE. 

AT
SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, WE HAD 450 IN CASH ON HAND AND A DEFICIT ACCUMULATED DURING THE COMPANY S DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF 45,973
AND HAS NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES TO DATE. IN THEIR REPORT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL
REPORT, OUR AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE HAVE
INCURRED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR FORMATION AND EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORESEEABLE
FUTURE, AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND
MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL
YEARS AND ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EXPENSES WILL INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE
CASH FLOW FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS WE FUND OUR OPERATING LOSSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. AS A RESULT, WE WILL NEED TO GENERATE
SIGNIFICANT REVENUES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE THESE REVENUES OR ACHIEVE
PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. OUR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK. 

SUBJECT
TO NEGOTIATION, OUR FEES MAY BE PAID IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK OF OUR CLIENTS. 

IN
CERTAIN SITUATIONS, WE MAY NEGOTIATE WITH OUR CLIENTS TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION OF PAYMENT OWED TO US FOR SERVICES RENDERED
IN THE FORM OF EQUITY IN THAT CLIENT S COMPANY. SUCH DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE BY OUR SOLE OFFICER, VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS.
WHILE WE GENERALLY PREFER TO RECEIVE CASH COMPENSATION, OUR OFFICER MAY BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN SITUATIONS REQUIRE THE RECEIPT OF
RESTRICTED EQUITY AS COMPENSATION. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RECEIVING RESTRICTED EQUITY COMPENSATION INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED
TO, 1) PROBLEMS OF LIQUIDITY WHERE NO MARKET EXISTS FOR SUCH EQUITY AND THEREFORE THE COMPANY CANNOT SELL SUCH EQUITY AND REALIZE
CASH; 2) THE CLIENT GOES OUT OF BUSINESS AND SUCH EQUITY IS RENDERED WORTHLESS; 3) THE EQUITY IS SOLD FOR LESS THAN THE VALUE
OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY US TO THE CLIENT. 

WE
BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO RECEIVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF EQUITY IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE ASSOCIATED RISKS INVOLVED WITH SUCH FORM
OF PAYMENT. HOWEVER, ANY LOSS WE EXPERIENCE RELATED TO EQUITY COMPENSATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO BECOME
PROFITABLE, AND IN THE LONG TERM, TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. 

WE
ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS AND DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW ENTERPRISES. 

WE
HAVE A LIMITED HISTORY UPON WHICH AN EVALUATION OF OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE CAN BE MADE. OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS ARE
SUBJECT TO ALL BUSINESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW ENTERPRISES. THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE
PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATIONS, AND DELAYS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXPANSION OF A BUSINESS
OPERATION IN AN EMERGING INDUSTRY, AND THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, AND A CORRESPONDING CUSTOMER BASE.
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL EVER OPERATE PROFITABLY. 

WE
ARE A CONSULTING COMPANY AND WHILE OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN, ATTRACT HIGHLY TALENTED PERSONNEL
AND DEVELOP A MARKET FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR PLAN OF OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING NEEDS OF TARGET CLIENTELE,
MARKET CONDITIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS OUT OF OUR CONTROL. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, THE PURCHASE OF THE SHARES SHOULD
ONLY BE MADE BY PERSONS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. 

10 

VIRGINIA
K. SOURLIS, THE SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, CURRENTLY IS A FULLTIME ATTORNEY DEVOTING APPROXIMATELY 40 HOURS A WEEK
TO OUTSIDE MATTERS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HER INABILITY TO PROPERLY MANAGE COMPANY AFFAIRS, RESULTING IN OUR REMAINING A START-UP
COMPANY WITH NO REVENUES OR PROFITS. 

OUR
BUSINESS PLAN DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE HIRING OF ANY ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES UNTIL REVENUE WILL SUPPORT THE EXPENSE, WHICH IS ESTIMATED
TO BE THE THIRD QUARTER OF OPERATIONS. UNTIL THAT TIME, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, OFFERING
AND SELLING OF THE SHARES, AND FULFILLING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF A PUBLIC COMPANY ALL FALL UPON VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS, WHO
HAS LIMITED TIME TO MANAGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY. WE HAVE NOT FORMULATED A PLAN TO RESOLVE ANY POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST
WITH HER OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN THE EVENT SHE IS UNABLE TO FULFILL ANY ASPECT OF HER DUTIES TO THE COMPANY WE MAY EXPERIENCE
A SHORTFALL OR COMPLETE LACK OF REVENUE RESULTING IN LITTLE OR NO PROFITS AND EVENTUAL CLOSURE OF THE BUSINESS. 

WE
ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE SERVICES OF VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS, OUR SOLE OFFICER AND SOLE DIRECTOR. 

OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS AND ABILITIES OF VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS, OUR SOLE OFFICER AND SOLE DIRECTOR. MS. VIRGINIA IS A LICENSED
ATTORNEY AND MANAGING PARTNER OF THE SOURLIS LAW FIRM, A BOUTIQUE LAW FIRM SPECIALIZING IN CORPORATE AND SECURITIES LAW, LOCATED
IN RED BANK, NEW JERSEY. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF MS. SOURLIS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. OUR SUCCESS ALSO
DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL REQUIRED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. THERE CAN BE
NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE EFFORTS. IN ADDITION, VIRGINIA SOURLIS PROVIDES US OFFICE SPACE IN HER PROFESSIONAL
BUSINESS OFFICE FREE OF CHARGE. OUR LOSS OF HER SERVICES WOULD REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE OFFICE SPACE FOR WHICH WE COULD
EXPECT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LEASE FEES. FURTHERMORE, MS. SOURLIS LAW FIRM IS REPRESENTING THE COMPANY FREE OF CHARGE. SHOULD
WE LOSE MS. SOURLIS AS AN OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY START TO INCUR LEGAL FEES WHICH COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. 

THERE
IS A PENDING SEC MATTER INVOLVING VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON
FEBRUARY 10, 2011, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AMENDED ITS COMPLAINT IN SEC V. GREENSTONE HOLDINGS, INC., ET AL.,
10 CIV. 1302 (S.D.N.Y.), TO ADD AS A DEFENDANT VIRGINIA K. SOURLIS, OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING
OFFICER. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT MS. SOURLIS VIOLATED SECTIONS 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES
ACT AND SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER
AND AIDED AND ABETTED DEFENDANT GREENSTONE S VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 10(B) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER.
THE SEC IS SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FINANCIAL PENALTIES, DISGORGEMENT, AND A PENNY STOCK BAR FROM MS. SOURLIS. 

ON
NOVEMBER 20, 2012, THE COURT GRANTED PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ON LIABILITY ONLY) AGAINST MS. SOURLIS FOR AIDING AND ABETTING
THE DEFENDANTS 10B VIOLATION; HOWEVER, MS. SOURLIS INTENDS TO FILE AN APPEAL AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE. AT THE HEARING,
THE COURT ALSO DENIED THE SEC S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT REGARDING ITS 10B PRIMARY LIABILITY CLAIM AGAINST MS. SOURLIS.
THE COURT ALSO RESERVED DECISION ON THE SEC S NON-FRAUD CLAIM THAT MS. SOURLIS VIOLATED SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT;
BUT RATHER ASKED FOR FURTHER BRIEFING REGARDING THE SEC S AIDING AND ABETTING CLAIM UNDER SECTION 5. 

ON
THE BASIS OF THE COURT S NOVEMBER 20 LIABILITY HOLDING, THE SEC INTENDS TO SEEK FROM THE COURT AGAINST MS. SOURLIS INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF, FINANCIAL PENALTIES, DISGORGEMENT, AND A PENNY STOCK BAR. IN THE EVENT THE COMMISSION PREVAILS IN ITS CHARGES AGAINST
MS. SOURLIS AND SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTS MS. SOURLIS FROM DERIVING INCOME FROM PRACTICING SECURITIES LAW FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME,
OUR COMPANY S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DUE TO THE FACT THAT MS. SOURLIS CURRENTLY HAS
A VERBAL NON-BINDING AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. ALSO, IF THE SEC PREVAILS,
IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO ATTRACT INVESTORS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT MS. SOURLIS IS THE SOLE DIRECTOR AND OFFICER (PRESIDENT,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) OF THE COMPANY AND THE VERY NATURE OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE CONSULTING SERVICES
TO START-UP COMPANIES AND PUBLIC COMPANIES ON VARIOUS MATTERS, FROM ENTITY FORMATION AND FINANCING STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT FOR FILING
FINRA S FORM 211 AND COMPLYING WITH SEC REGULATIONS. IF THE SEC PREVAILS AND PREVENT MS. SOURLIS FROM PRACTICING SECURITIES
LAW FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME, IT WOULD IN EFFECT PUT THE COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS UNLESS THE COMPANY CAN RETAIN NEW QUALIFIED
EMPLOYEES, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO. 

AS
OUR BUSINESS GROWS, WE WILL NEED TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES WHICH WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO. 

IN
ORDER TO GROW AND IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WE WOULD NEED TO ADD MANAGERIAL TALENT TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ADDING SUCH MANAGERIAL TALENT. 

OUR
BUSINESS REFERRALS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CLIENTS. 

MUCH
OF OUR SERVICES TO CLIENTS INVOLVE REFERRING CLIENTS TO OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. REFERRALS MADE BY OUR COMPANY TO
CLIENTS MAY INVOLVE CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE COMPANY, MS. SOURLIS INDIVIDUALLY, MS. SOURLIS LAW FIRM,
AND THE CLIENT. WE WILL MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT ALL KNOWN AND POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE DISCLOSED TO EACH CLIENT
UPON MAKING SUCH REFERRAL AND, IF NOT WAIVED BY THE CLIENT, CEASE WORKING WITH THE CLIENT IN ONE OR MORE CAPACITIES. 

11 

FAILURE
ON OUR PART TO IDENTIFY AND PROPERLY NOTIFY A CLIENT OF ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST COULD RESULT IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,
HARM TO OUR REPUTATION AND GOODWILL, AND GENERALLY COULD HAVE AN OVERALL MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR
ABILITY TO BECOME PROFITABLE AND CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WILL BE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, EMPLOY AND RETAIN HIGHLY
SKILLED INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS. 

THE
NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES THAT WE EMPLOY SKILLED PERSONS , TO PERFORM HIGHLY SKILLED AND SPECIALIZED TASKS
FOR OUR CLIENTELE. WE DEFINE SKILLED PERSONS AS PROFESSIONALS WITH DEFINED SKILL SETS INCLUDING AUDITING, CORPORATE
ACCOUNTING, BOOKKEEPING, PUBLIC COMPANY COMPLIANCE REPORTING, FINANCE, BUSINESS WRITING, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. 

WHILE
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL SKILLED PERSONS THAT WE PLAN ON CONTACTING FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH OUR COMPANY, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS
ANNUAL REPORT, WE HAVE NOT CONTACTED NOR HAVE WE ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY SKILLED PERSONS, AS WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE
FUNDS TO RETAIN THEM. 

OUR
FAILURE TO RETAIN SUCH PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO OFFER SERVICES TO CLIENTELE, AND COULD
POTENTIALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUCH PERSONS, THERE IS
NO GUARANTEE THAT SKILLED PERSONS WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WILLING TO WORK FOR US IN THE FUTURE, NOR IS THERE ANY GUARANTEE THAT
WE COULD AFFORD TO RETAIN THEM IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE AT A FUTURE TIME. 

WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPETITORS. 

SAVVY
BUSINESS SUPPORT, INC. HAS MANY POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN THE BUSINESS SUPPORT INDUSTRY. WE WILL COMPETE, IN OUR CURRENT AND PROPOSED
BUSINESSES, WITH OTHER COMPANIES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE FAR GREATER MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE THAN WE DO.
WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PENETRATE OUR INTENDED MARKET AND BE ABLE TO COMPETE PROFITABLY, IF AT ALL. IN ADDITION
TO ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS, THERE IS EASE OF MARKET ENTRY FOR OTHER COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO COMPETE WITH US. EFFECTIVE COMPETITION
COULD RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS, REDUCED MARGINS OR HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS AND CHANCES FOR SUCCESS. COMPETITION IS LIKELY TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AS NEW COMPANIES ENTER THE MARKET AND CURRENT
COMPETITORS EXPAND THEIR SERVICES. MANY OF THESE POTENTIAL COMPETITORS ARE LIKELY TO ENJOY SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES,
INCLUDING: LARGER STAFFS, GREATER NAME RECOGNITION, LARGER CUSTOMER BASES AND SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, TECHNICAL
AND OTHER RESOURCES. TO BE COMPETITIVE, WE MUST RESPOND PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO THE CHALLENGES OF FINANCIAL CHANGE, EVOLVING
STANDARDS AND COMPETITORS INNOVATIONS BY CONTINUING TO ENHANCE OUR SERVICES AND SALES AND MARKETING CHANNELS. ANY PRICING
PRESSURES, REDUCED MARGINS OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE RESULTING FROM INCREASED COMPETITION, OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY,
COULD FATALLY DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS AND CHANCES FOR SUCCESS. 

WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY. 

WE
MUST CONTINUALLY IMPLEMENT AND IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, OPERATIONS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND QUALITY CONTROLS ON
A TIMELY BASIS, AS WELL AS EXPAND, TRAIN, MOTIVATE AND MANAGE OUR WORK FORCE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKET SEGMENT. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE ESTABLISH AND MANAGE A COMPETENT,
DEDICATED WORK FORCE AND EMPLOY ADDITIONAL KEY EMPLOYEES IN CORPORATE MANAGEMENT, PRODUCT DESIGN, CLIENT SERVICE AND SALES. WE
CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PERSONNEL, SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE
OPERATIONS. IF WE FAIL TO IMPLEMENT AND IMPROVE THESE OPERATIONS, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL, ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING
RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

IF
WE DO NOT CONTINUALLY UPDATE OUR SERVICES, THEY MAY BECOME OBSOLETE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES. 

WE
CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH ADVANCES OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL NOT BECOME OBSOLETE. WE CANNOT ASSURE
YOU THAT COMPETITORS WILL NOT DEVELOP RELATED OR SIMILAR SERVICES AND OFFER THEM BEFORE WE DO, OR DO SO MORE SUCCESSFULLY, OR
THAT THEY WILL NOT DEVELOP SERVICES AND PRODUCTS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANY THAT WE HAVE OR ARE DEVELOPING. IF THAT HAPPENS, OUR
BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE
HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST LAWSUITS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. 

WE
ARE A NEVADA CORPORATION. NEVADA LAW PERMITS THE INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUCCESSFULLY
DEFENDING AGAINST A CLAIM. NEVADA LAW ALSO AUTHORIZES NEVADA CORPORATIONS TO INDEMNIFY THEIR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST EXPENSES
AND LIABILITIES INCURRED BECAUSE OF THEIR BEING OR HAVING BEEN AN OFFICER OR DIRECTOR. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDE FOR
THIS INDEMNIFICATION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 

WE
CURRENTLY DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE FOUND LIABLE FOR DAMAGE OR OTHER LOSSES, WE WOULD INCUR
SUBSTANTIAL AND PROTRACTED LOSSES IN PAYING ANY SUCH CLAIMS OR JUDGMENTS. WE HAVE NOT MAINTAINED LIABILITY INSURANCE IN THE PAST,
BUT INTEND TO ACQUIRE SUCH COVERAGE IMMEDIATELY UPON RESOURCES BECOMING AVAILABLE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN SECURE SUCH
COVERAGE OR THAT ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE WOULD PROTECT US FROM ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS CLAIMS FILED AGAINST IT. 

12 

IF
WE ENGAGE IN ANY ACQUISITION, WE WILL INCUR A VARIETY OF COSTS AND MAY NEVER REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION. 

WE
MAY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE A STRATEGIC
FIT WITH OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN IDENTIFYING ACQUISITION TARGETS, AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING AND INTEGRATING
ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS INTO OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING ANY ACQUIRED
BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICE OR PRODUCT MAY RESULT IN UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES AND MAY DIVERT SIGNIFICANT
MANAGEMENT ATTENTION FROM OUR ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, WE WILL INCUR A VARIETY OF COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH AN
ACQUISITION AND MAY NEVER REALIZE OUR ANTICIPATED BENEFITS. 

WE
MAY ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT PRESENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 

THE
COMPANY S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME WHICH MAY NOT BE EQUIVALENT
TO SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ARISES WHENEVER A PERSON HAS AN INTEREST
ON BOTH SIDES OF A TRANSACTION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL TAKE PRUDENT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY
AND ANY OFFICER OR DIRECTOR IS FAIR, REASONABLE, AND NO MORE THAN THE AMOUNT IT WOULD OTHERWISE PAY TO A THIRD PARTY IN AN ARMS -LENGTH 
TRANSACTION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY TRANSACTION WILL MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IN EVERY INSTANCE. 

RISKS
RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK 

THERE
IS NO ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 

ON
MAY 31, 2011, THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK WAS CLEARED FOR TRADING ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL SVYB .
THERE EXISTS ONLY A VERY LIMITED TRADING MARKET FOR THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK WITH LIMITED OR NO VOLUME AND THUS THE COMPANY
CANNOT ACCURATELY OBTAIN AN ACCURATE BID OR ASK PRICE FOR A SHARE OF ITS COMMON STOCK. ANY INVESTOR WHO PURCHASES THE COMPANY S
COMMON STOCK IS NOT LIKELY TO FIND ANY LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR THE COMMON STOCK AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY LIQUID
TRADING MARKET WILL EVER DEVELOP, OR IF DEVELOPED, BE MAINTAINED. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, INVESTORS
MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES THEY PURCHASE. 

ANY
TRADING MARKET THAT MAY DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK WILL MOST LIKELY BE VERY VOLATILE; AND NUMEROUS FACTORS BEYOND
OUR CONTROL MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE MARKET. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS DEEMED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES ADOPTED UNDER SECTION 15(G) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE PENNY
STOCK RULES GENERALLY APPLY TO COMPANIES WHOSE COMMON STOCK IS NOT LISTED ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET OR OTHER NATIONAL
SECURITIES EXCHANGE AND TRADES AT LESS THAN 4.00 PER SHARE, OTHER THAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE HAD AVERAGE REVENUE OF AT LEAST 6,000,000
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OR THAT HAVE TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF AT LEAST 5,000,000 2,000,000 IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN OPERATING
FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS). THESE RULES REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT BROKERS WHO TRADE PENNY STOCK TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED
CUSTOMERS COMPLETE CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION, MAKE SUITABILITY INQUIRIES OF INVESTORS AND PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CERTAIN INFORMATION
CONCERNING TRADING IN THE SECURITY, INCLUDING A RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND QUOTE INFORMATION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. MANY
BROKERS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TRADE PENNY STOCKS BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENNY STOCK RULES AND, AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER
OF BROKER-DEALERS WILLING TO ACT AS MARKET MAKERS IN SUCH SECURITIES IS LIMITED. IF WE REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES
FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET, IF ANY, FOR OUR SECURITIES AND INVESTORS WILL FIND
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DISPOSE OF OUR SECURITIES. 

WE
HAVE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL
MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
OR OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, PREVENT
FRAUD OR FILE OUR PERIODIC REPORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH MAY CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION AND MAY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE. 

WE
ARE SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT ),
AND THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT ). THE EXCHANGE ACT REQUIRES THAT WE FILE ANNUAL, QUARTERLY
AND CURRENT REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PROXY STATEMENT, AND OTHER INFORMATION. THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WE ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 (THE 2012
FORM 10-K ), WE HAVE DISCLOSED THAT OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER CONCLUDED
THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS ANNUAL REPORT WERE NOT EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING
THAT MATERIAL INFORMATION WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED,
SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SEC S RULES AND FORMS. ALSO, IN THIS 2012 FORM 10-K, WE
DISCLOSED THAT THERE WERE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2012. A MATERIAL
WEAKNESS IS A DEFICIENCY, OR A COMBINATION OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING SUCH THAT THERE
IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF OUR ANNUAL OR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED OR
DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. TO DATE, NONE OF THE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
HAVE BEEN CORRECTED NOR HAVE WE CHANGED OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. WE WILL NEED
TO HIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND OTHER FINANCIAL PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES. AS A RESULT, WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES. FURTHERMORE,
THE NEED TO ESTABLISH THE CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE DEMANDED OF A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM IMPLEMENTING
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WHICH COULD PREVENT US FROM IMPROVING OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE MEASURES
WE TAKE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. IF WE FAIL TO TIMELY ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY
OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS OR HELP PREVENT FRAUD.
OUR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD PREVENT US FROM FILING OUR PERIODIC
REPORTS ON A TIMELY BASIS WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
HARM OUR BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

13 

THE
PRICE OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE MAY BE VOLATILE. 

IF
A MARKET EVER DEVELOPS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL LIKELY
BE VOLATILE AND COULD FLUCTUATE WIDELY IN PRICE IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING:
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL; SALES
OF OUR COMMON STOCK; OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS
PLAN; OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS; LOSS OF ANY STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP; INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS; ECONOMIC AND OTHER EXTERNAL
FACTORS; AND PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WITH NO
REVENUES TO DATE, YOU MAY CONSIDER ANY ONE OF THESE FACTORS TO BE MATERIAL. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE WIDELY AS A RESULT OF
ANY OF THE ABOVE. IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES MARKETS HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS
THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR COMPANIES. THESE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS MAY ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR

AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF WE ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK IN THE FUTURE THAT HAS PREFERENCE OVER OUR COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO THE
PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS OR UPON OUR LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP, OR IF WE ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WITH VOTING RIGHTS THAT
DILUTE THE VOTING POWER OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATED TO CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS FOR THE STATUS OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HORSESHOE BALTIMORE CASINO. 
 CEOC NOTES 
 CGP LLC OWNS 1.1 BILLION OF AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CEOC NOTES. THE CEOC NOTES HAVE FIXED CASH-PAY INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 5.625 TO 6.50 AND MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2015 TO 2017. THE INDENTURES GOVERNING THE CEOC NOTES LIMIT CEOC S (AND MOST OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ABILITY TO (I) CREATE LIENS ON CERTAIN ASSETS TO SECURE DEBT, (II) ENGAGE IN SALE AND LEASE-BACK TRANSACTIONS AND (III) CONSOLIDATE, MERGE, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS. 
 IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS, THE AGGREGATE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS ISSUED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 21.1 MILLION WAS RESTORED TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH A RETURN OF ALL 10.75 PAID-IN KIND SENIOR NOTES AND CERTAIN 5.75 SENIOR NOTES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY CEOC FROM CGP LLC TO CEC. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ("IP") IS PART OF CIE S OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND WE REGARD OUR IP TO BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS. WHILE THE CIE BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT OR COMBINATION OF PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS. CIE FILES APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE BELIEVE FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. 
 CIE'S IP INCLUDES THE WSOP , SLOTOMANIA , PLAYTIKA AND BINGO BLITZ BRANDS AND ASSOCIATED TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, LOGOS, SOFTWARE CODE, AUDIO-VISUAL ELEMENTS, GRAPHICS, ORIGINAL MUSIC, STORY LINES, INTERFACES, TECHNOLOGY AND TRADE SECRETS THAT CIE USES TO DEVELOP AND OFFER GAMES ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS. CIE SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE USE OF COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER IP RIGHTS. CIE FILES APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAINS COPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE IT BELIEVES FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. CIE ALSO SEEKS TO MAINTAIN ITS TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. 
 CIE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OWNS 120 TRADEMARKS REGISTERED WITH THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, INCLUDING THE WORLD SERIES OF POKER , WSOP , SLOTOMANIA , PLAYTIKA AND BINGO BLITZ TRADEMARKS, FOR A VARIETY OF GOODS AND SERVICES. CIE ALSO OWNS ONE OR MORE REGISTERED TRADEMARKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY, INCLUDING THE WORLD SERIES OF POKER , WSOP , WORLD SERIES OF POKER EUROPE , SLOTOMANIA AND PLAYTIKA TRADEMARKS. 
 CIE HAS ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS PENDING IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND IS CONTINUALLY ADDING NEW FILINGS AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. CIE HAS NOT APPLIED FOR PATENTS OR THE REGISTRATION OF ALL OF ITS COPYRIGHTS OR TRADEMARKS, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS FOR WHICH IT HAS APPLIED. DESPITE EFFORTS TO PROTECT THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, PARTIES MAY INFRINGE CIE'S PATENTS AND USE INFORMATION THAT THEY REGARD AS PROPRIETARY AND THEIR RIGHTS MAY BE INVALIDATED OR UNENFORCEABLE. THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES DO NOT PROTECT PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO AS GREAT AN EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OTHERS MAY BE ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 PHW LAS VEGAS, LLC IS PARTY TO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH PLANET HOLLYWOOD RESORTS INTERNATIONAL, LLC AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD MEMORABILIA, INC. (TOGETHER, THE "PH LICENSORS"), WHICH ARE AFFILIATES OF ROBERT EARL, THE ORIGINAL FOUNDER OF THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BRAND. THE LICENSING AGREEMENT GRANTS TO PHW LAS VEGAS, LLC RIGHTS TO USE CERTAIN TRADEMARKS, DOMAIN NAMES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TO DISPLAY AND EXHIBIT CERTAIN MEMORABILIA OWNED BY THE PH LICENSORS. THE INITIAL TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS 35 YEARS AND THE PARTIES MAY BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT EXTEND THE TERM FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE TERMS OF TEN YEARS EACH. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WAS ASSIGNED TO PHWLV AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 
 CAC AND CGP LLC ARE PARTIES TO A MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CEOC IN WHICH, AMONG OTHER TERMS, CAC, CGP LLC AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO USE THE CAESARS TRADEMARK FOR CORPORATE IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS CAC AND CGP LLC ELECT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT, UPON MUTUAL WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE PARTIES, UPON CONSUMMATION OF EITHER THE CALL RIGHT OR THE LIQUIDATION RIGHT, OR AT THE ELECTION OF THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN UNCURED DEFAULT.

COMPETITION 
 INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
 THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING. MOREOVER, THE CASINO-THEMED GAME SEGMENT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES SECTORS DUE TO THE ATTRACTIVE UNDERLYING QUALITIES OF THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HIGH AVERAGE REVENUE PER USER (AS DEFINED BELOW), FAMILIAR GAME MECHANICS AND LONGER THAN AVERAGE GAME LIFE SPANS. CGP LLC FACES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN ALL ASPECTS OF THIS BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY, CIE COMPETES FOR THE LEISURE TIME, ATTENTION AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING OF ITS PLAYERS WITH OTHER SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES DEVELOPERS ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE QUALITY OF PLAYER EXPERIENCE, BRAND AWARENESS, REPUTATION AND ACCESS TO DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. 
 WE BELIEVE CIE COMPETES FAVORABLY IN ALL OF THESE AREAS. HOWEVER, OTHER DEVELOPERS OF SOCIAL AND MOBILE CASINO-THEMED GAMES COULD DEVELOP MORE COMPELLING CONTENT THAT COMPETES WITH CIE'S GAMES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT CIE'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PLAYERS AND THEIR ENTERTAINMENT TIME. THESE COMPETITORS, INCLUDING COMPANIES ABOUT WHOM CIE MAY NOT BE CURRENTLY AWARE, MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS, ACCESS TO A LARGE USER BASE AND THEIR NETWORK EFFECTS TO GROW RAPIDLY. 
 CIE S COMPETITORS INCLUDE: 
 
 GAME DEVELOPERS FOR FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS: CIE FACES COMPETITION FROM A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS WHO DEVELOP SOCIAL GAMES FOR USE ON FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS. THESE COMPETITORS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND/OR GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, GREATER NAME RECOGNITION AND HAVE LONGER OPERATING HISTORIES, MAY CREATE SIMILAR GAMES TO REACH CIE'S PLAYERS. SOME OF THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE ZYNGA (THE MAKER OF ZYNGA POKER), KING (THE MAKER OF CANDYCRUSH SAGA), IGT (THE MAKER OF DOUBLEDOWN CASINO), WMS (THE MAKER OF JACKPOT PARTY CASINO) AND BASH GAMING (THE MAKER OF BINGO BASH, WHO RECENTLY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO BE ACQUIRED BY GSN GAMES). BECAUSE CIE S GAMES ARE FREE TO PLAY, CIE COMPETES PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PLAYER EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN PRICE. CIE COULD FACE ADDITIONAL COMPETITION IF LARGE COMPANIES WITH A SIGNIFICANT ONLINE PRESENCE, SUCH AS GOOGLE, MICROSOFT OR FACEBOOK, CHOOSE TO ENTER OR EXPAND IN THE CASINO-THEMED SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES SEGMENT. 
 
 GAME DEVELOPERS FOR MOBILE: THE MOBILE GAMES SECTOR IS CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, RAPIDLY EMERGING MOBILE PLATFORMS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW MOBILE APPLICATION STOREFRONTS. SOME OF CIE'S COMPETITORS IN THE MOBILE GAMES MARKET INCLUDE ELECTRONIC ARTS, GAMELOFT INC., GLU MOBILE AND ZYNGA. 
 
 REGULATED ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING: IN NEVADA, CIE COMPETES WITH ULTIMATE GAMING (PROVIDER OF ULTIMATEPOKER.COM AND SOUTH POINT HOTEL CASINO (PROVIDER OF REALGAMING.COM ). IN NEW JERSEY, CIE COMPETES WITH A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, BORGATA, TRUMP, GOLDEN NUGGET, TROPICANA, 888, BWIN.PARTY, GAMESYS AND BETFAIR. CIE MAY ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM SOME OR ALL OF THESE COMPETITORS AND OTHER COMPETITORS IN OTHER U.S. JURISDICTIONS THAT LEGALIZE ONLINE POKER OR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS IN ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 POKER TOURNAMENTS: THE WSOP COMPETES WITH SEVERAL POKER TOURNAMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA-PACIFIC. SOME OF THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE THE WORLD POKER TOUR (OWNED BY BWIN.PARTY) AND POKERSTARS EUROPEAN POKER TOUR. 
 
 GAME DEVELOPERS FOR CONSOLES AND OTHER PLATFORMS: CIE'S PLAYERS ALSO PLAY OTHER GAMES ON PCS AND CONSOLES, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE SOCIAL FEATURES THAT COMPETE WITH CIE S SOCIAL GAMES AND HAVE COMMUNITY FUNCTIONS WHERE PLAYERS CAN COMPETE AGAINST AND PLAY WITH OTHER GAMERS. SOME OF THE COMPETITORS WHO DEVELOP THESE GAMES INCLUDE ACTIVISION, INC., ELECTRONIC ARTS AND MICROSOFT. 
 
 OTHER FORMS OF MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT: CIE COMPETES MORE BROADLY FOR THE LEISURE TIME AND ATTENTION OF ITS PLAYERS WITH PROVIDERS OF OTHER FORMS OF INTERNET AND MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT, INCLUDING SOCIAL NETWORKING, ONLINE CASUAL ENTERTAINMENT AND MUSIC. TO THE EXTENT EXISTING OR POTENTIAL PLAYERS CHOOSE TO READ, WATCH OR LISTEN TO ONLINE CONTENT OR STREAMING VIDEO OR RADIO, THESE CONTENT SERVICES POSE A COMPETITIVE THREAT. 
 CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS - PLANET HOLLYWOOD 
 THE LAS VEGAS HOTEL/CASINO INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. HOTELS ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP COMPETE WITH OTHER HOTELS ON AND OFF THE LAS VEGAS STRIP, INCLUDING HOTELS IN DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL LARGE PROJECTS IN LAS VEGAS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO OPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE SUCH AS SLS LAS VEGAS, A 1,600 ROOM HOTEL AND CASINO, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN FALL 2014, AND THE GENTING GROUP HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DEVELOP A 3,500 ROOM HOTEL AND 175,000 SQUARE FOOT CASINO CALLED RESORTS WORLD LAS VEGAS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN 2016; BOTH OF WHICH ARE ON THE NORTHERN END OF THE STRIP NEAR CIRCUS CIRCUS. WHEN OPENED, THESE HOTEL/CASINOS MAY TARGET THE SAME CUSTOMERS AS PLANET HOLLYWOOD DOES. PLANET HOLLYWOOD ALSO COMPETES WITH CASINOS LOCATED ON NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL LANDS. THE PROLIFERATION OF GAMING IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER AREAS LOCATED 
 13 

IN THE SAME REGION AS PLANET HOLLYWOOD COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANET HOLLYWOOD'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD ALSO COMPETES, TO SOME EXTENT, WITH OTHER HOTEL/CASINO FACILITIES IN NEVADA AND ATLANTIC CITY, HOTEL/CASINO AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER FORMS OF GAMING ON BOTH A LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL, INCLUDING STATE LOTTERIES, ON-AND OFF-TRACK WAGERING AND CARD PARLORS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN STATES RECENTLY HAVE LEGALIZED, AND OTHERS MAY LEGALIZE, CASINO GAMING IN SPECIFIC AREAS. THE CONTINUED PROLIFERATION OF GAMING VENUES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANET HOLLYWOOD S BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR, THE LEGALIZATION OF CASINO GAMING IN OR NEAR MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS FROM WHICH PLANET HOLLYWOOD TRADITIONALLY ATTRACTS CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS. 
 THE EXPANSION OF LEGALIZED GAMING INTO NEW JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WILL ALSO INCREASE COMPETITION. 
 SEASONALITY 
 WE BELIEVE THAT CIE'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SOME DEGREE OF SEASONALITY BASED ON THE PLAYING HABITS OF CIE'S PLAYERS. WHILE THE GROWTH IN CIE'S BUSINESS TO DATE HAS LARGELY MUTED THE IMPACT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS HAVE ON ITS BUSINESS, AS THE GROWTH OF CIE S BUSINESS STABILIZES, IT MAY BE THAT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS BECOME MORE EVIDENT ACROSS CIE'S BUSINESS. 
 WE BELIEVE THAT THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SEASONALITY BASED ON THE WEATHER IN LAS VEGAS AND THE TRAVEL HABITS OF VISITORS. FOR INSTANCE, THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED BY PLANET HOLLYWOOD IS GENERALLY LOWER DURING THE SUMMER. 
 SEASONALITY MAY CAUSE CGP LLC'S WORKING CAPITAL CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS TO VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON THE VARIABILITY IN THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF SALES. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE FORECASTING MORE DIFFICULT AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO MANAGE WORKING CAPITAL AND TO PREDICT FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, CAC AND CGP LLC DID NOT HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES. AS DECEMBER 31, 2013, CIE HAD 634 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES, OF WHOM 518 WERE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, CANADA, THE UKRAINE AND BELARUS. PLANET HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES AS ITS OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED BY PHW MANAGER, LLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF CEOC. 
 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION 
 THE GAMING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR LICENSES AND PAY GAMING TAXES TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. OUR GAMING FACILITIES AND ONLINE REAL MONEY PLATFORMS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION UNDER THE LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS OF THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE GAMING FACILITY OR ONLINE REAL MONEY PLATFORM IS LOCATED. THESE LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS GENERALLY CONCERN THE RESPONSIBILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND CHARACTER OF THE OWNERS, MANAGERS, AND PERSONS WITH FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN THE GAMING OPERATIONS. VIOLATIONS OF LAWS IN ONE JURISDICTION COULD RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT IS CONTAINED IN EXHIBIT 99.2 TO THIS FORM 10-K. 
 OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IN ADDITION TO GAMING REGULATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS CONCERNING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, SMOKING, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, EMPLOYEES, CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, TAXATION, ZONING AND BUILDING CODES, CONSTRUCTION, LAND USE, AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING. WE ALSO DEAL WITH SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH IN OUR OPERATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REPORTING AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD CHANGE OR COULD BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE, OR NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD BE ENACTED. MATERIAL CHANGES, NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR MATERIAL DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATIONS BY COURTS OR GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 RISKS RELATED TO CGP LLC'S CONTINUED DEPENDENCE ON CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT 
 CAC AND CGP LLC ARE DEPENDENT ON CEOC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PROVIDE CORPORATE SERVICES, BACK-OFFICE SUPPORT AND BUSINESS ADVISORY SERVICES THROUGH THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT. CAC AND CGP LLC CANNOT OPERATE WITHOUT THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUBSIDIARIES OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE CGP LLC MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED. 
 PURSUANT TO THE CGP LLC MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT, CEOC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE CORPORATE SERVICES, BACK-OFFICE SUPPORT AND BUSINESS ADVISORY SERVICES TO CAC AND CGP LLC. NEITHER CAC NOR CGP LLC HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES AND CAC AND CGP LLC HAVE A VERY SHORT HISTORY OF OPERATING CASINOS AND ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT. THEREFORE, THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF CAC AND CGP LLC ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, THE SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, AND CAC AND CGP LLC CANNOT OPERATE WITHOUT THESE SERVICES. IF THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, DETERIORATES, OR IF THE TERMS UNDER WHICH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES CHANGE IN A MANNER THAT IS ADVERSE TO CGP LLC, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CAC AND CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IN ADDITION, IF THE CGP LLC MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT WERE TO BE TERMINATED, OR IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, WERE TO SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY OR OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, BECOMING INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING SUPPORT AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES (OR UNABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES AT AGREED UPON LEVELS) TO CAC OR CGP LLC OR CEASE OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER, CAC AND/OR CGP LLC WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE PROVIDED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CAC AND CGP LLC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. ANY FAILURE BY CAC OR CGP LLC TO OBTAIN THE OPERATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, AND PARTICULARLY ANY FAILURE BY CGP LLC TO OBTAIN CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S EXPERTISE IN OPERATING CASINOS OR MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THE TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM, WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CAC AND/OR CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER APPROVALS, WHICH MAY BE DELAYED OR WHICH MAY NOT BE RECEIVED. IN ADDITION, WE WILL NOT CONTROL SUCH SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, AND THE INTERESTS OF OUR CO-INVESTORS MAY NOT ALIGN WITH OUR INTERESTS. 
 IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1. BUSINESS, WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A NEW SERVICES JOINT VENTURE SERVICES, LLC ), THE PURPOSE OF WHICH INCLUDES THE COMMON MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED BY CEOC. CEOC AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT RESORT PROPERTIES, LLC CERP ), EACH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CEC, AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF CGP WILL BE EQUAL INVESTORS IN SERVICES, LLC, AND, UPON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICES, LLC, SUBSIDIARIES OF CGP WILL RELY ON SERVICES, LLC TO PROVIDE THEM WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSES AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AMONG OTHER SERVICES. WE AND CGP WILL NOT CONTROL SERVICES, LLC, AND IN THE EVENT THAT OUR INTERESTS DO NOT ALIGN WITH THOSE OF CEOC OR CERP, THE INTERESTS OF CEOC OR CERP MAY BE MET BEFORE OURS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICES, LLC S CONTEMPLATED ACTIVITIES IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER APPROVALS, WHICH MAY BE DELAYED OR WHICH WE MAY NOT RECEIVE. 
 CGP LLC IS DEPENDENT ON THE EXPERTISE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT, WHO MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY INVESTED IN CGP LLC'S SUCCESS, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC AND/OR CAC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CGP LLC RELIES A GREAT DEAL ON THE EXPERTISE AND GUIDANCE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT WHO DO NOT RECEIVE DIRECT COMPENSATION FROM CGP LLC. AS A RESULT, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT MAY DEVOTE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS TIME TO THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF CGP LLC THAN WERE THEY TO BE EMPLOYED BY CGP LLC. SENIOR MANAGEMENT THAT IS NOT INVESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC AND/OR CAC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY KEY PERSONNEL FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS OF CGP LLC. 
 THE LEADERSHIP OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MR. GARY LOVEMAN, AND OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, HAS BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S SUCCESS. THE ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED TO CGP LLC DEPEND ON THESE KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF MR. LOVEMAN OR OTHER EXTENDED OR PERMANENT LOSS OF HIS SERVICES, OR ANY NEGATIVE MARKET OR INDUSTRY PERCEPTION WITH RESPECT TO HIM OR ARISING FROM HIS LOSS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE CASINO AND ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF 
 15 

SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC. CGP LLC IS NOT PROTECTED BY KEY MAN INSURANCE OR SIMILAR LIFE INSURANCE COVERING MEMBERS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT, NOR DOES CGP LLC HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENTS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
 A DEFAULT BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ON CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IS A HIGHLY LEVERAGED COMPANY AND HAS PLEDGED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND THE ASSETS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AS COLLATERAL UNDER CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE TRADEMARKS FOR WHICH CIE HAS LICENSED THE RIGHT TO USE, INCLUDING "CAESARS," "TOTAL REWARDS" AND "HARRAH'S." THE STOCK OF CEOC IS ALSO PLEDGED TO SECURE THESE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES WERE TO DEFAULT ON THESE OBLIGATIONS, ITS LENDERS COULD EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER CGP LLC'S BUSINESS. CGP LLC IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF SERVICES FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, CEOC, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, PURSUANT TO THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT AND CIE'S SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT. IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, THEIR FILING MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC S ASSETS AND OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, ITS LENDERS OR THEIR SUCCESSORS MAY ELECT TO REJECT THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT AS AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DEFAULT, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S LENDERS ALSO MAY SEEK TO REJECT CIE'S CROSS MARKETING AND TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IN CONNECTION WITH A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING AND, AS A RESULT, CIE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE LICENSES TO USE CERTAIN TRADEMARKS OWNED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE RESULT OF THIS INFLUENCE AND ANY RELATED DISRUPTION IN CGP LLC'S BUSINESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE VALUE OF THE CEOC NOTES HELD BY CGP LLC WOULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ON CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND SUCH IMPAIRMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IS A HIGHLY LEVERAGED COMPANY AND HAS SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS FOR INTEREST PAYMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS DUE TO ITS INDEBTEDNESS. IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CEOC IS UNABLE TO PAY THE INTEREST WHEN DUE UNDER THEIR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS ON THEIR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE VALUE OF THE CEOC NOTES HELD BY CGP LLC WOULD BE IMPAIRED. BECAUSE THE CEOC NOTES CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VALUE OF CGP LLC, AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE VALUE OF THE CEOC NOTES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 CGP LLC HAS AN OBLIGATION TO GIVE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR ANY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, BUT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT HAS NO OBLIGATION TO GIVE ANY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CGP LLC. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY KEEP ALL POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITSELF. CGP LLC WOULD NEED TO RELY ON A SEPARATE PARTY TO PURSUE ANY OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL AND ASSISTANCE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. 
 CGP LLC IS REQUIRED TO FIRST PROVIDE ANY POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT TO BE CONSIDERED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPRISED OF DISINTERESTED DIRECTORS. CGP LLC CAN ONLY PROCEED WITH SUCH INVESTMENT OR OPPORTUNITY TO THE EXTENT SUCH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE DECLINES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ITSELF OR CEOC. SEE ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE . IF THE COMMITTEE PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CGP LLC, WE EXPECT THAT CGP LLC WILL RETAIN A 50 INTEREST IN THE MANAGEMENT FEE TO BE RECEIVED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED. HOWEVER, BECAUSE EACH OPPORTUNITY WILL BE NEGOTIATED AS A SEPARATE TRANSACTION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT CGP LLC AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL SHARE EQUALLY (OR THAT CGP LLC WILL SHARE AT ALL) IN THE MANAGEMENT FEE. IF THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CGP LLC, THE COMMITTEE CAN ALSO DECIDE TO KEEP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL EVER PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CGP LLC. 
 ALTHOUGH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF EACH OF THE SPONSORS ARE ON THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND CAC, THE CERTIFICATES OF INCORPORATION OF BOTH COMPANIES PROVIDE THAT NEITHER THE SPONSORS NOR DIRECTORS HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO PRESENT ANY CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CAC. ACCORDINGLY, THE SPONSORS MAY PURSUE GAMING, ENTERTAINMENT OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CAC AND HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PRESENT SUCH OPPORTUNITY TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CAC; HOWEVER, IF ANY CHOOSE TO PRESENT SUCH OPPORTUNITY TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CAC, THEN SUCH OPPORTUNITY MUST FOLLOW THE RIGHTS OF FIRST OFFER. 
 IF THE COMMITTEE DECLINES AN OPPORTUNITY ALTOGETHER AND CGP LLC PURSUES THE OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, CGP LLC WILL BE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY SERVICES FROM A THIRD-PARTY. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT CGP LLC WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A THIRD-PARTY TO PURSUE AN OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN, OR OF LESS QUALITY THAN, THOSE THAT ARE PROVIDED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, AND AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE OPPORTUNITY. 
 CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S INTERESTS MAY CONFLICT WITH CGP LLC S INTERESTS. 
 THE INTERESTS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COULD CONFLICT WITH CGP LLC'S INTERESTS. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IS IN A CASINO AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS SIMILAR TO CGP LLC AND MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE, PURSUE FOR ITSELF ACQUISITIONS THAT 
 16 

WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, IN WHICH CASE, AND AS A RESULT, THOSE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US. WITHOUT ACCESS TO ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, CGP LLC WILL BE LIMITED IN GROWING ITS BUSINESS. 
 THE SUCCESS OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON ITS CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN CAESARS' TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM. IF CIE, AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD ARE, AND HORSESHOE BALTIMORE AND THE PROPERTIES TO BE ACQUIRED WILL BE, UNABLE TO ACCESS THE TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM DATABASE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS. 
 THE SUCCESS OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO DIRECT TARGETED MARKETING EFFORTS TO IMPORTANT CASINO AND HOSPITALITY CUSTOMERS. THE ABILITY OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESS TO UNDERTAKE THOSE MARKETING EFFORTS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON ITS CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM OWNED AND MAINTAINED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND FOLLOWING ITS IMPLEMENTATION, LICENSED TO SERVICES LLC. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROGRAM, CIE AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD CAN, AND HORSESHOE BALTIMORE AND THE PROPERTIES TO BE ACQUIRED WILL BE ABLE TO, DEVELOP INFORMATION WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO TRACK CASINO PLAY AND AWARD COMPLIMENTARIES AND OTHER PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. COMPLIMENTARIES AND OTHER SIMILAR REWARDS ARE CUSTOMARILY OFFERED BY CASINO AND GAMING FACILITIES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ARE IMPORTANT INCENTIVES TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. IF CIE, PLANET HOLLYWOOD, HORSESHOE BALTIMORE AND THE PROPERTIES ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM DATABASE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS. 
 CIE LICENSES ITS RIGHT TO USE AND SUBLICENSE VARIOUS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. ACCORDINGLY, IF A THIRD-PARTY SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGES CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS AFFILIATES' OWNERSHIP OF, OR RIGHT TO USE, THE CAESARS-RELATED MARKS OR IF CIE IS UNABLE TO STOP UNAUTHORIZED USE OF SUCH MARKS, OR IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS AFFILIATES USE SUCH MARKS IN A WAY THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE VALUE OF SUCH MARKS, CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE HARMED. 
 CIE HAS LICENSED THE RIGHT TO USE CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS OWNED OR USED BY VARIOUS AFFILIATES OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INCLUDING CAESARS WORLD, INC., CAESARS LICENSE COMPANY, LLC AND CEOC. THESE LICENSED TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, "CAESARS," "HARRAH S" AND "TOTAL REWARDS." SEE ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE . CIE'S RIGHTS TO USE THESE TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS ARE AMONG ITS MOST VALUABLE ASSETS. 
 IF THE EXISTING LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WERE TERMINATED AND CIE FAILS TO ENTER INTO NEW ARRANGEMENTS IN RESPECT OF THESE MARKS, CIE COULD LOSE ITS RIGHTS TO USE THESE MARKS AND THE CORRESPONDING DOMAIN NAMES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. IF A THIRD-PARTY SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGES CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS AFFILIATES OWNERSHIP OF, OR RIGHT TO USE, THESE MARKS (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS AFFILIATES FAILURE TO FILE FOR PROTECTION OF SUCH MARKS), SUCH A CHALLENGE COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, IF ANY OF THE ENTITIES FROM WHOM CIE LICENSES THE RIGHT TO USE SUCH MARKS ENTERS INTO A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING, ITS RIGHTS TO USE SOME OR ALL OF SUCH MARKS COULD BE TERMINATED, WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IN ADDITION, THESE TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS ARE USED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS AFFILIATES AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. ANY NEGATIVE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE MARKS BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS AFFILIATES MAY BE OUT OF CGP LLC'S CONTROL, AND MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE "CAESARS", "HARRAH S" OR "TOTAL REWARDS" BRANDS, WHICH COULD HARM CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 CIE MAY BE RELIANT ON CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT TO OBTAIN ONLINE GAMING LICENSES IN MANY COMMERCIAL JURISDICTIONS AND IF THE AFFILIATION IS TERMINATED, OR COSTS TO MAINTAIN SUCH AFFILIATION EXCEED REVENUE GENERATED FROM SUCH AFFILIATION, IT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS. 
 NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ENACTED LAWS THAT REQUIRE ONLINE CASINOS TO ALSO HAVE A LICENSE TO OPERATE A BRICK-AND-MORTAR CASINO, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN AFFILIATE. IF, LIKE NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY, OTHER U.S. JURISDICTIONS ENACT LEGISLATION LEGALIZING REAL MONEY CASINO GAMING SUBJECT TO THIS BRICK-AND-MORTAR REQUIREMENT, CIE MAY BE UNABLE TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS IF CIE DOES NOT HAVE OR IS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH AN AFFILIATION WITH A BRICK-AND-MORTAR CASINO IN SUCH JURISDICTION. IF CIE IS ABLE TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE OF CIE'S AFFILIATION WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, CIE WILL BE RELIANT ON CONTINUING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SUCH AFFILIATION. IF CIE'S AFFILIATION WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IS TERMINATED OR THE COSTS TO MAINTAIN SUCH AFFILIATION EXCEED REVENUE GENERATED FROM ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING, IT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS. 
 A BANKRUPTCY COURT MAY CONCLUDE THAT EACH OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION CONSTITUTES A FINANCING RATHER THAN A TRUE SALE AND AS A RESULT WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER ASSETS SOLD OR CONTRIBUTED TO CGP LLC TO THE SAME EXTENT AS WE DO NOW. 
 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES REPORTED A NET LOSS OF 2,939.8 MILLION AND 1,502.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND CEOC AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SEPARATELY REPORTED A 
 17 

NET LOSS OF 2,871.2 MILLION AND 1,701.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS CEOC AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT NET LOSSES DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. IN A BANKRUPTCY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT SOLD OR CONTRIBUTED ASSETS TO CGP LLC, INCLUDING CEOC, THE COURT MAY CONCLUDE THAT EACH OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION CONSTITUTES A DISGUISED FINANCING RATHER THAN A TRUE SALE. IN SUCH CASE, THE COURT WOULD DEEM CGP LLC'S ASSETS AS BELONGING TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, AND CONSIDER US TO BE A LENDER TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO THE EXTENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE CGP LLC PAID FOR THOSE ASSETS. WHILE WE SHOULD HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE AMOUNTS PAID TO THEM FOR THE ASSETS, WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER THE ASSETS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS WE DO NOW. MOREOVER, IF OUR CLAIM AGAINST CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS CONSIDERED A FINANCING, NO GUARANTY EXISTS THAT OUR CLAIM WILL BE DEEMED A SECURED CLAIM ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY RIGHT OF REPAYMENT FROM THE ASSETS, RATHER THAN A GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIM AGAINST CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE THAT SHARES PRO RATA WITH OTHER CREDITORS IN ANY RECOVERY FROM THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. FINALLY, A RISK EXISTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM MIGHT BE PRIMED IN FAVOR OF A DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING, OR THAT THE COURT MIGHT EQUITABLY SUBORDINATE OUR CLAIM TO THOSE OF OTHER CREDITORS, RECHARACTERIZE THE CLAIM AS EQUITY OR OTHERWISE NOT ALLOW THE CLAIM (INCLUDING ON EQUITABLE GROUNDS). 
 A BANKRUPTCY COURT MAY SUBSTANTIVELY CONSOLIDATE THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATES OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS DEBTOR SUBSIDIARIES WITH CGP LLC, WHICH WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLOW THE CREDITORS OF THE BANKRUPT ENTITIES TO SATISFY THEIR CLAIMS FROM THE COMBINED ASSETS OF THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING CGP LLC. 
 EVEN THOUGH CGP LLC HAS CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY REMOTE FEATURES THAT RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY RELIEF, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL NOT DIRECT CGP LLC'S OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES' SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR A SUBSIDIARY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR SUCH SUBSIDIARY EVEN IF CGP LLC OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT THEMSELVES FILE A BANKRUPTCY PETITION. CGP LLC'S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES' SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN THEIR BANKRUPTCY CASES WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLOW THE CREDITORS OF THE BANKRUPT ENTITIES TO SATISFY THEIR CLAIMS FROM THE COMBINED ASSETS OF THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING CGP LLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THIS MAY DILUTE THE VALUE OF DISTRIBUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR RECOVERY TO CGP LLC'S CREDITORS, AND MAY PREVENT RECOVERY BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF ANY VALUE AT ALL IF THE COMBINED CREDITOR CLAIMS EXCEED THE COMBINED VALUE OF THE ENTITIES. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BANKRUPTCIES MAY SUBJECT OUR ASSETS AND OPERATIONS TO THE AUTOMATIC STAY, AND MAY IMPAIR CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY, AS WELL AS OTHERWISE RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS AND CAPACITY TO FUNCTION AS A STANDALONE ENTERPRISE. 
 A CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CEOC BANKRUPTCY FILING MIGHT TRIGGER AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, AND EXPOSE OUR AND CGP LLC'S CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY. 
 IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CEOC, FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY RELIEF, IT MAY RESULT IN AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF SERVICES, LLC. FOR EXAMPLE, A TRUSTEE OR EXAMINER MAY BE APPOINTED IN THE CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT BANKRUPTCY CASE WITH THE POWER TO INVESTIGATE THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION AND DETERMINE, WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, WHETHER SUCH TRANSACTIONS OVERALL, AND THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS (INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF SERVICES LLC), WERE FAIR AND EQUITABLE AND OTHERWISE BENEFICIAL TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ANY BANKRUPT SUBSIDIARY. ADDITIONALLY, ANY COMMITTEES APPOINTED IN SUCH BANKRUPTCY CASE COULD CONDUCT A SIMILAR INVESTIGATION. ANY SUCH INVESTIGATIONS MAY IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND EXPENSE ON US AND CGP LLC, AND MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT FROM ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT STAKEHOLDERS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING ANY COMMITTEE APPOINTED IN SUCH BANKRUPTCY CASES, WOULD RE-EVALUATE ALL OF OUR AND CGP LLC'S CONTRACTUAL AND BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND WITH SERVICES, LLC. THIS MAY RESULT IN MATERIALLY ALTERED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY BE ECONOMICALLY UNFAVORABLE TO INVESTORS IN CAC, AND MAY DIVERT SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. 
 WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LITIGATION THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO RETURN THE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, OR THEIR VALUE, TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. 
 CREDITORS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAY SUE US AND/OR CGP LLC UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW IN AN EFFORT TO RECOVER, FOR THEIR BENEFIT, THE ASSETS WE ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION AS FRAUDULENT TRANSFERS. AS A GENERAL MATTER, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAW ALLOWS A CREDITOR TO RECOVER ASSETS, OR THEIR VALUE, FROM AN INITIAL OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE IF THE DEBTOR CONVEYED THE ASSETS WITH AN ACTUAL INTENT TO HINDER, DELAY OR DEFRAUD ITS CREDITORS, OR IF THE TRANSFER WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD. A CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD EXISTS EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ACTUAL INTENT TO DEFRAUD CREDITORS. THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF A CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD ARE A TRANSFER, MADE WHILE A DEBTOR WAS INSOLVENT OR THAT RENDERED A DEBTOR INSOLVENT, FOR LESS THAN REASONABLY EQUIVALENT VALUE OR FAIR CONSIDERATION OR THAT LEFT THE DEBTOR WITH LESS THAN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL WITH WHICH TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS. A COURT MAY "COLLAPSE" THE COMPONENT STEPS OF THE RESTRUCTURING INTO A SINGLE SET OF INTEGRATED TRANSACTIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESTRUCTURING OVERALL EFFECTED A FRAUDULENT TRANSFER. IF WE AND/OR CGP LLC ARE SUBJECT TO A FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWSUIT, WE MAY HAVE TO RETURN THE ASSETS OR THEIR VALUE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR BE FORCED TO PAY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS THEREFOR. 
 18 

SERVICES, LLC MAY BE SUBJECT TO FRAUDULENT TRANSFER OR OTHER LITIGATION THAT MAY RESULT IN ITS UNWINDING, OR ITS LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH CEOC MAY OTHERWISE BE RESCINDED OR TERMINATED. 
 CREDITORS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, CEOC AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES MAY COMMENCE AN ACTION AGAINST SERVICES, LLC UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW IN AN EFFORT TO RESCIND, AVOID OR OTHERWISE TERMINATE, FOR THEIR BENEFIT, THE LICENSING AGREEMENTS CEOC ENTERED INTO WITH SERVICES, LLC. ALTERNATIVELY, IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, CEOC OR THEIR SUBSIDIARIES FILE BANKRUPTCY, THEY MAY REJECT THEIR LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH SERVICES, LLC. IF SERVICES, LLC CAN NO LONGER ENFORCE SUCH LICENSING AGREEMENTS, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM UNDER ITS LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH CGP LLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CGP LLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOTAL REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM AND MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SUCH AS THE CAESARS TRADEMARK, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CAC AND CGP LLC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND ON MATERIAL CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, THE CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT OF WHICH MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A BANKRUPTCY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR, UPON ITS FORMATION, SERVICES, LLC. 
 A DEBTOR OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE MAY EXERCISE CERTAIN RIGHTS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS AND ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROTECTION OF THE STATUTORY AUTOMATIC STAY WHICH ARISES BY OPERATION OF SECTION 362 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE UPON THE COMMENCEMENT OF A BANKRUPTCY CASE WOULD PROHIBIT US FROM TERMINATING A CONTRACT WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ANY OF ITS DEBTOR SUBSIDIARIES, AND UPON ITS FORMATION, A BANKRUPTCY OF SERVICES, LLC. THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ALSO INVALIDATES CLAUSES THAT PERMIT THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AUTOMATICALLY UPON THE FILING BY ONE OF THE PARTIES OF A BANKRUPTCY PETITION OR WHICH ARE CONDITIONED ON A PARTY S INSOLVENCY. MEANWHILE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, WE WOULD ORDINARILY BE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE PERFORMING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENT. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO OBTAIN RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY AND TO ENFORCE RIGHTS TO PAYMENTS OR TERMINATE AGREEMENTS CAN BE TIME CONSUMING, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN AS TO OUTCOME. 
 IN ADDITION, UNDER SECTION 365 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, A DEBTOR MAY DECIDE WHETHER TO ASSUME OR REJECT AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT, THE MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS FOR PLANET HOLLYWOOD, HORSESHOE BALTIMORE AND THE PROPERTIES TO BE ACQUIRED, THE SHARED SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH CIE OR THE CGP OPERATING AGREEMENT, OR UPON ITS FORMATION, ANY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH SERVICES, LLC. ASSUMPTION OF A CONTRACT WOULD PERMIT THE DEBTOR TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMED CONTRACT; PROVIDED THAT THE DEBTOR (I) IMMEDIATELY CURES ALL EXISTING DEFAULTS THEREUNDER OR PROVIDES ADEQUATE ASSURANCE THAT SUCH DEFAULTS WILL BE PROMPTLY CURED, (II) COMPENSATES THE NON-DEBTOR PARTY FOR ANY ACTUAL MONETARY LOSS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE DEBTOR S DEFAULT OR PROVIDES ADEQUATE ASSURANCE THAT SUCH COMPENSATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING AND (III) PROVIDES THE NON-DEBTOR PARTY WITH ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS A GENERAL MATTER, A BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVES A DEBTOR S ASSUMPTION OF A CONTRACT AS LONG AS ASSUMPTION APPEARS TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE DEBTOR'S ESTATE, THE DEBTOR IS ABLE TO PERFORM AND IT IS A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION TO ASSUME THE CONTRACT. SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL AND SATISFACTION OF THE "BUSINESS JUDGMENT" RULE, A DEBTOR IN CHAPTER 11 MAY REJECT AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT, AND REJECTION OF AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT IN A CHAPTER 7 CASE MAY OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY BY OPERATION OF LAW. IF A DEBTOR REJECTS AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT, THE NON-DEBTOR PARTY TO THE CONTRACT GENERALLY HAS AN UNSECURED CLAIM AGAINST THE DEBTOR S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE REJECTION. ON REQUEST OF ANY PARTY TO SUCH CONTRACT, A BANKRUPTCY COURT MAY ORDER THE DEBTOR TO DETERMINE WITHIN A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME WHETHER TO ASSUME OR REJECT AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT. 
 FURTHER, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS DEBTORS, OR UPON ITS FORMATION, SERVICES, LLC, AS A DEBTOR, MAY SEEK BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL TO ASSUME MATERIAL CONTRACTS, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS, THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT OR OTHER VALUABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS UNDER SECTION 365 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND MAY ALSO SEEK TO ASSIGN SUCH AGREEMENT TO A THIRD-PARTY. A DEBTOR MAY ALSO SEEK TO REJECT SUCH CONTRACTS. IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR AN APPLICABLE DEBTOR SUBSIDIARY, OR UPON ITS FORMATION, SERVICES, LLC REJECTS THE CGP MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WE MAY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE PROVIDED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR UPON ITS FORMATION, SERVICES, LLC, WITH THE RESULT THAT WE MAY LACK SUFFICIENT SUPPORT TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS, AND MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE CERTAIN LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SUCH AS CERTAIN TRADEMARKS. 
 IN ADDITION, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, AS A DEBTOR, MAY ATTEMPT TO REJECT THE CGP OPERATING AGREEMENT AS AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT. THIS MIGHT AFFECT OUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE, AND OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RIGHTS. IT MAY ALSO RELIEVE CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT FROM PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CGP LLC'S LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT, INCLUDING HONORING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LIQUIDATION RIGHT AND CALL RIGHT DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE . 
 CLAIMS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CGP LLC AGAINST CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN A CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT BANKRUPTCY MIGHT BE EQUITABLY SUBORDINATED OR DISALLOWED. 
 BANKRUPTCY LAW ALLOWS THE COURT TO EQUITABLY SUBORDINATE CLAIMS TO THOSE OF OTHER CREDITORS OR EQUITY HOLDERS BASED ON INEQUITABLE CONDUCT. A BANKRUPTCY COURT MAY ALSO RECHARACTERIZE A CLAIM FOR DEBT AS EQUITY, OR NOT ALLOW A CLAIM FOR OTHER REASONS INCLUDING ON EQUITABLE GROUNDS. CLAIMS OF INSIDERS, INCLUDING STOCKHOLDERS, ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND A COURT MAY FIND INEQUITABLE CONDUCT IN THE FORM OF OVERREACHING OR SELF-DEALING TRANSACTIONS. IF A CLAIM IS SUBORDINATED TO THOSE OF OTHER 
 19 

CREDITORS OR EQUITY HOLDERS, OR RECHARACTERIZED AS EQUITY, THE CLAIM WILL LIKELY RECEIVE NO DISTRIBUTION FROM THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATE UNLESS THE ESTATE HAS ENOUGH ASSETS TO SATISFY THE NON-SUBORDINATED CREDITORS IN FULL; A CLAIM THAT IS DISALLOWED WOULD NOT SHARE IN RECOVERIES FROM THE ESTATE TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH DISALLOWANCE. THE EQUITABLY SUBORDINATED OR DISALLOWED CLAIM NEED NOT NECESSARILY RELATE TO THE INEQUITABLE CONDUCT. THEREFORE, A DAMAGES CLAIM ARISING FROM THE REJECTION OF AN EXECUTORY CONTRACT MAY BE SUBORDINATED OR DISALLOWED BASED ON CONDUCT WHOLLY UNRELATED TO THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP ITSELF. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, SHOULD A COURT DETERMINE THAT THEY ARE TRIGGERED IN A BANKRUPTCY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, CLAIMS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CGP LLC, INCLUDING CLAIMS BASED ON NOTES ISSUED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR CEOC OR GUARANTEES BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, MAY NOT SHARE RATABLY WITH CLAIMS FROM OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS OR MAY BE DISALLOWED. 
 THE SEC'S INVESTIGATION OF A RETIRED DELOITTE PARTNER WHO WAS FORMERLY THE ADVISORY PARTNER ON DELOITTE'S AUDIT ENGAGEMENT FOR CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT DELOITTE WAS NOT INDEPENDENT OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD ALSO AFFECT DELOITTE'S INDEPENDENCE AS IT RELATES TO CAC AND CGP LLC, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CAC ' S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW AND CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS. 
 DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP ("DELOITTE") IS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR BOTH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND CAC AND THEIR AUDITS REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CAC, CGP LLC AND PREDECESSOR GROWTH PARTNERS, INCLUDED WITHIN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND ITS EXHIBITS. IN APRIL 2013, DELOITTE ADVISED CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT THAT A RETIRED DELOITTE PARTNER WHO WAS FORMERLY THE ADVISORY PARTNER ON DELOITTE S AUDIT ENGAGEMENT FOR CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT DURING MOST OF 2009 (A PERIOD NOT COVERED IN THIS FILING) IS THE SUBJECT OF A FORMAL INVESTIGATION BY THE SEC. DURING 2009, THIS INDIVIDUAL ENGAGED IN GAMING ACTIVITIES AT A CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CASINO. DELOITTE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THESE GAMING ACTIVITIES AND THIS INDIVIDUAL S ROLE AS ADVISORY PARTNER AND REPORTED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ITS CONCLUSION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL S ACTIVITIES DID NOT AT ANY TIME IMPAIR DELOITTE'S INDEPENDENCE, BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE SEC'S INDEPENDENCE RULES AND FURTHERMORE HE HAD NO SUBSTANTIVE ROLE IN ANY AUDIT OR REVIEW CONCERNING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. AFTER CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CONDUCTED ITS OWN INDEPENDENT REVIEW WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THE CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AUDIT COMMITTEE, IN EARLY MAY 2013, ACCEPTED DELOITTE'S REPORT AND CONCURRED WITH DELOITTE'S CONCLUSION THAT DELOITTE'S INDEPENDENCE WAS AND IS NOT IMPAIRED. 
 IF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WERE TO DETERMINE THAT DELOITTE WAS NOT INDEPENDENT OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND, AS A RESULT, CAC AND CGP LLC, SUCH DETERMINATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S AND CAC S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CAC S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 RISKS RELATED TO CAESARS GROWTH PARTNERS, LLC'S BUSINESS 
 CGP LLC MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF CURRENT OR POTENTIAL FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. 
 ON MARCH 1, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WHEREBY CGP LLC (OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS DESIGNATED DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES) AGREED TO ACQUIRE FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CERTAIN OF ITS PROPERTIES AND RELATED ASSETS AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED FURTHER IN PART I, ITEM 1 ASSET SALE TRANSACTION. T HE CONSUMMATION OF THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OF GAMING APPROVALS, ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS AND RECEIPT OF THIRD-PARTY CONSENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION BY CAC IS SUBJECT TO CAC'S RECEIPT OF FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, AND NO REVERSE BREAK-UP FEE APPLIES. CGP LLC OR CAC MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY APPROVALS OR OTHERWISE SATISFY THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO CONSUMMATE THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL. THE CONDITIONS TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION COULD PREVENT OR DELAY THE COMPLETION OF THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION OR COULD RESULT IN THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION BEING CONSUMMATED ON TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. FURTHER, THERE ARE INCREMENTAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT AND THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED THEREUNDER, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 
 
 THE DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION FROM OUR ONGOING BUSINESS CONCERNS: 
 
 THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY BE INSTITUTED AGAINST US AND/OR OTHERS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS; AND 
 
 THE AMOUNTS OF THE COSTS, FEES, EXPENSES AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, WHETHER OR NOT CONSUMMATED. 
 CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON ITS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE BUSINESSES OF SUCH ACQUIRED COMPANIES WITH ITS BUSINESS. THE COMBINATION OF TWO INDEPENDENT COMPANIES IS A COMPLEX, COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS. THIS PROCESS MAY DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF EITHER OR BOTH OF THE COMPANIES, AND MAY NOT RESULT IN THE FULL BENEFITS EXPECTED. THE DIFFICULTIES OF COMBINING THE OPERATIONS OF TWO COMPANIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS: 
 
 COORDINATING MARKETING FUNCTIONS; 
 
 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES; 
 20 

UNANTICIPATED ISSUES IN INTEGRATING INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER SYSTEMS; 
 
 UNANTICIPATED INCOMPATIBILITY OF PURCHASING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATION METHODS; 
 
 RETAINING KEY EMPLOYEES; 
 
 CONSOLIDATING CORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURES; 
 
 THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM ONGOING BUSINESS CONCERNS; 
 
 COORDINATING GEOGRAPHICALLY SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS; AND 
 
 OBTAINING ALL NECESSARY GAMING REGULATORY APPROVALS. 
 FOR INSTANCE, CIE HAS BEEN HIGHLY RELIANT ON ITS ACQUISITION OF PLAYTIKA LTD. ("PLAYTIKA") AND OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING BUFFALO STUDIOS, TO GENERATE REVENUES. CGP LLC MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF FUTURE CIE ACQUISITIONS, IF ANY, AND MAY NOT CONTINUE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE BUFFALO STUDIOS ACQUISITION, DUE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE DIFFICULTIES LISTED ABOVE OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE OPERATIONS OF TWO OR MORE COMPANIES. IF CGP LLC IS UNABLE TO REALIZE IN WHOLE OR IN PART THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED FOR ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CGP LLC MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH, AND THIS CAPITAL MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. 
 CGP LLC INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS GROWTH AND MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS CHALLENGES, INCLUDING THE NEED TO CONSUMMATE THE ASSET SALE TRANSACTION, EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, DEVELOP NEW GAMES AND FEATURES OR ENHANCE CIE S EXISTING GAMES, IMPROVE ITS OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE OR ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGIES. ACCORDINGLY, CAC AND CGP LLC MAY NEED TO ENGAGE IN EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IF CAC RAISES ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH FUTURE ISSUANCES OF EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT DILUTION, AND ANY NEW EQUITY SECURITIES WE ISSUE COULD HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. ANY DEBT FINANCING WE OR CGP LLC SECURE IN THE FUTURE COULD INVOLVE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS RELATING TO CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL MATTERS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. CAC AND CGP LLC ARE NEWLY FORMED ENTITIES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. FOR INSTANCE, THE LACK OF OPERATING HISTORY AND RELATIONSHIP WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY IMPEDE CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO RAISE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE COULD PURSUE A FUTURE OFFERING OF SECURITIES AT AN APPROPRIATE PRICE TO RAISE THE NECESSARY FINANCING. IF CAC AND CGP LLC ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING OR FINANCING ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO THEM WHEN THEY REQUIRE IT, THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS CHALLENGES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CAC AND CGP LLC DO NOT HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE DEBT AND MAY HIGHLY LEVERAGE THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES. 
 CAC AND CGP LLC ARE NEWLY FORMED COMPANIES WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT FINANCING AND/OR ALTER THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURES. SHOULD CAC OR CGP LLC SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGE THEMSELVES, CAC OR CGP LLC WILL BE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE INTEREST PAYMENT EXPENSES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. FURTHER, ONCE CAC HAS A HIGHLY LEVERAGED CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CGP LLC MAY LOSE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES IT HAS AGAINST COMPETITORS THAT HAVE SIMILAR CAPITAL STRUCTURES THAT MAKES PURSUING NEW, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE, OPPORTUNITIES MORE CHALLENGING. 
 OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE RESULTS. 
 THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K HAS BEEN PREPARED USING ASSUMPTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE. HOWEVER, SUCH HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT WHAT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS A STAND-ALONE ENTITY SEPARATE FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, THE HISTORICAL INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF WHAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. 
 CGP LLC'S BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS WHICH COULD RESULT IN VOLATILITY OR HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 CGP LLC'S BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SOME DEGREE OF SEASONALITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF CIE, IT MAY EXPERIENCE SEASONALITY BASED ON THE PLAYING HABITS OF ITS PLAYERS. AS THE GROWTH OF CIE'S BUSINESS STABILIZES, THE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS MAY BECOME MORE EVIDENT. IN THE CASE OF PLANET HOLLYWOOD, WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY DETER OR PREVENT CUSTOMERS FROM REACHING PLANET HOLLYWOOD'S FACILITY OR UNDERTAKING DAY TRIPS. SUCH CONDITIONS WOULD PARTICULARLY AFFECT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE TRAVELING LONGER DISTANCES TO VISIT PLANET HOLLYWOOD. WE BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER VISITS TO PLANET HOLLYWOOD WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE 
 21 

SEASON, WITH WINTER MONTHS EXPERIENCING LOWER TURNOUT. SEASONALITY MAY CAUSE CIE AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD'S WORKING CAPITAL CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS TO VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON THE VARIABILITY IN THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF SALES. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE FORECASTING MORE DIFFICULT AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CIE AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE WORKING CAPITAL AND TO PREDICT FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY IN OPERATING CGP LLC'S BUSINESSES SEPARATELY FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, AND MANAGING THAT PROCESS EFFECTIVELY COULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MANAGEMENT S TIME. 
 THE SEPARATION FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COULD CAUSE AN INTERRUPTION OF, OR LOSS OF MOMENTUM IN, THE OPERATION OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF TIME TO THE SEPARATION, WHICH WILL DECREASE THE TIME THEY WILL HAVE TO MANAGE THEIR ORDINARY RESPONSIBILITIES. IF MANAGEMENT IS NOT ABLE TO MANAGE THE SEPARATION EFFECTIVELY, OR IF ANY SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE INTERRUPTED AS A RESULT OF THE SEPARATION, CGP LLC'S BUSINESSES AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER. 
 CGP LLC MAY BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT IT EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE FROM THE SEPARATION OF ITS OPERATIONS FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. 
 AS A COMPANY WITH OPERATIONS SEPARATE FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT CGP LLC WILL BENEFIT FROM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLOWING ITS BUSINESSES TO BETTER FOCUS THEIR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES ON THEIR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES AND BE BETTER POSITIONED TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO PURSUE APPROPRIATE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND EXECUTE STRATEGIC PLANS BEST SUITED TO THEIR BUSINESS IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. WE BELIEVE THE SEPARATION WILL ALLOW THE MANAGEMENT OF CIE AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CORPORATE STRATEGIES AND POLICIES THAT ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS, ALLOWING THEM TO MORE EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND ALLOWING THE CREATION OF EFFECTIVE INCENTIVES FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY TIED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, CGP LLC MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE EXPECT IT TO ACHIEVE AS A COMPANY WITH OPERATIONS SEPARATE FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE TIME WE EXPECT, IF AT ALL. 
 WE WILL BE ALLOCATED TAXABLE INCOME FROM CGP LLC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE RECEIVE CORRESPONDING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CGP LLC TO PAY OUR TAX LIABILITY. 
 BECAUSE CGP LLC IS A PARTNERSHIP FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, WE WILL BE ALLOCATED TAXABLE INCOME FROM CGP LLC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CGP OPERATING AGREEMENT. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON SUCH INCOME AT THE CURRENT U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CGP LLC MAKES CORRESPONDING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO US TO PAY OUR TAX LIABILITY. THE CGP OPERATING AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR QUARTERLY CASH TAX DISTRIBUTIONS (OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH A LIQUIDATION OR CERTAIN PARTIAL LIQUIDATIONS) TO BE MADE TO US AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH TAX DISTRIBUTIONS (OR OTHER CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CGP LLC) WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR US TO PAY OUR TAX LIABILITIES. 
 THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CGP LLC OR THAT CGP LLC WILL OBTAIN A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT OTHER THAN THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE. 
 CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES DEPENDS ON PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT LEGALIZES GAMBLING IN NEW MARKETS AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT NOT EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. ALTHOUGH IN THE PAST FEW YEARS A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION PERMITTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF GAMING FACILITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT SUCH TREND WILL CONTINUE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LEGISLATURES AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT WILL TURN AGAINST PERMITTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF GAMING FACILITIES. SHOULD THE STATES PASS NO ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION FOR ISSUING LICENSES OR PERMITTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF GAMING FACILITIES, CGP LLC WILL BE UNABLE TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW MARKETS. MOREOVER, EVEN IF NEW MARKETS OPEN UP, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND/OR CGP LLC WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE BID PROCESS FOR ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES; THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT CGP LLC WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THOSE NEW MARKETS. FURTHER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL NOT EXERCISE ITS RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, THEREBY DEPRIVING CGP LLC OF ACCESS TO ANY POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. SEE ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE . 
 THE BONDS OF CEOC AND OTHER FIXED RATE SECURITIES WE HOLD ARE SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND WOULD DECREASE IN VALUE IF THE INTEREST RATE INCREASES. 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, CGP LLC HOLDS APPROXIMATELY 1.1 BILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CEOC NOTES WITH FIXED RATES OF INTEREST. FIXED RATE SECURITIES ARE SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE, THE FIXED RATE SECURITIES HELD BY CGP LLC WILL DECREASE IN VALUE. CURRENTLY, MARKET INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN AT RECORD LOW RATES. ACCORDINGLY, AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES FROM CURRENT LEVELS COULD CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE FIXED RATE SECURITIES TO DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

CGP LLC AND CAC ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND TAXATION POLICIES, THE ENFORCEMENT OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CGP LLC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 CGP LLC AND CAC ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GAMING REGULATIONS AND POLITICAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE CGP LLC OPERATES HAVE BROAD POWERS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSING OF CASINO OPERATIONS AND MAY REVOKE, SUSPEND, CONDITION OR LIMIT THE GAMING OR OTHER LICENSES OF CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES OR DEVELOPMENTS, IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND TAKE OTHER ACTIONS, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ONE OR MORE JURISDICTIONS MAY REQUIRE CGP LLC OR CAC TO OBTAIN NEW LICENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS OR DUE TO FUTURE CHANGES IN REGULATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE MISSOURI GAMING COMMISSION IS REQUIRING THAT CAC OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTIONS EVEN THOUGH CGP LLC DOES NOT OPERATE IN MISSOURI. THE FAILURE OF CAC TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FROM THE MISSOURI GAMING COMMISSION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S GAMING LICENSE IN MISSOURI. IF OTHER JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE CGP LLC OR CAC TO OBTAIN NEW LICENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS OR DUE TO FUTURE CHANGES IN REGULATION, AND CGP LLC OR CAC IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE LICENSES, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 AS A RESULT OF CIE HOLDING AN ONLINE GAMING LICENSE, ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GAMING LAWS AND LAWS IN NEVADA. WE ALSO EXPECT CIE TO BE SUBJECT TO THESE OR SIMILAR LAWS AS CIE SEEKS LICENSES FOR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, CIE HAS OBTAINED A LICENSE IN NEVADA AS AN "OPERATOR OF AN INTERACTIVE GAMING SYSTEM" AND OBTAINED REGULATORY APPROVAL TO LAUNCH ONLINE POKER IN NEVADA IN 2013 IN A FIELD TRIAL MODE WITH FINAL APPROVAL OF THE PRODUCT EXPECTED ON MARCH 20, 2014. IN ADDITION, CIE OBTAINED A CASINO LICENSE IN NEW JERSEY IN NOVEMBER 2013 TO OPERATE INTERNET GAMING IN NEW JERSEY. AMONG THESE LAWS ARE VARIOUS "SUITABILITY" REQUIREMENTS WHICH COULD LIMIT CIE'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES, MAKE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND OTHERWISE FREELY CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS. THE RESULTS OF SUCH RESTRICTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN EACH JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES WITHIN EACH JURISDICTION REVIEW OUR COMPLIANCE WITH GAMING LAWS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GAMING COMPLIANCE ISSUES IN ONE JURISDICTION MAY LEAD TO REVIEWS AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT EVENTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ROLE WITH THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF A CASINO GAMING FACILITY BY STERLING SUFFOLK RACECOURSE, LLC STERLING SUFFOLK ), OWNER OF SUFFOLK DOWNS RACECOURSE IN EAST BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, HAVE RESULTED IN REVIEWS IN SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARISING OUT OF A REPORT ISSUED TO THE MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT BUREAU FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION (THE BUREAU IN OCTOBER 2013. THAT REPORT RAISED CERTAIN ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN EVALUATING OUR SUITABILITY AS A QUALIFIER IN MASSACHUSETTS AND MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD NOT MET OUR BURDEN BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH OUR SUITABILITY. ALTHOUGH WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE DIRECTOR S RECOMMENDATION, WE WITHDREW OUR APPLICATION AS A QUALIFIER IN MASSACHUSETTS AT THE REQUEST OF STERLING SUFFOLK. NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES WERE FOUND UNSUITABLE BY ANY LICENSING AUTHORITY, BUT OTHER GAMING REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ASKED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE REPORT FROM THE BUREAU, AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT EXISTING OR FUTURE JURISDICTIONS WOULD NOT RAISE SIMILAR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SUITABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE BUREAU S REPORT, OR WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT SUCH ISSUES WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT US OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 FROM TIME TO TIME, INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED LEGISLATION OR REFERENDUMS, SUCH AS BANS ON SMOKING IN CASINOS AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENT AND DINING FACILITIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE OPERATIONS OF CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTY. FOR EXAMPLE, MARYLAND LAW PROHIBITS SMOKING AT THE HORSESHOE BALTIMORE. THE LIKELIHOOD OR OUTCOME OF SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS AND REFERENDUMS IN THE FUTURE CANNOT BE PREDICTED, THOUGH ANY SMOKING BAN WOULD BE EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT CGP LLC'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 
 THE CASINO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF TAX REVENUES TO THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH CASINOS OPERATE. FROM TIME TO TIME, VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AND OFFICIALS HAVE PROPOSED CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, OR IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH LAWS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN TAX RATES, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE INDUSTRY. IF ADOPTED, SUCH CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 ACTS OF TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER AND POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY CONDITIONS MAY IMPEDE CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO OPERATE OR HARM ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF WAR OR HOSTILITY HAVE CREATED MANY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE CUSTOMERS OF PLANET HOLLYWOOD USE AIR TRAVEL. AS A RESULT OF TERRORIST ACTS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL WAS SEVERELY DISRUPTED, WHICH RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER VISITS TO LAS VEGAS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISRUPTIONS IN AIR OR OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AS A RESULT OF ANY FURTHER TERRORIST ACT, SECURITY ALERTS OR WAR, UPRISINGS, OR HOSTILITIES IN PLACES SUCH AS IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, OR OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, SEVERE OR INCLEMENT WEATHER AFFECTING THE ABILITY OF PLANET HOLLYWOOD'S CUSTOMERS TO TRAVEL CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 23 

POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY CONDITIONS MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS BY IMPEDING ITS OPERATIONS OR PLAYER DEMAND. IN PARTICULAR, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL OF PLAYTIKA, A SUBSIDIARY OF CIE AND THE OPERATOR OF SLOTOMANIA , ARE LOCATED IN ISRAEL, A COUNTRY LOCATED IN A PARTICULARLY VOLATILE REGION. CIE ALSO HAS APPROXIMATELY 300 EMPLOYEES IN UKRAINE, A COUNTRY CURRENTLY FACING POLITICAL UNREST. ANY HOSTILITIES, OR ANY FUTURE ARMED CONFLICTS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY OR VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR FURTHER DISRUPTIONS IN UKRAINE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 ANY VIOLATION OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT OR OTHER SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON US. 
 CGP LLC IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH EXPOSES CGP LLC TO COMPLEX FOREIGN AND U.S. REGULATIONS INHERENT IN ENGAGING IN A CROSS-BORDER BUSINESS AND IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH CGP LLC AND ITS BUSINESSES TRANSACTS BUSINESS. CGP LLC IS SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE FCPA AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT U.S. COMPANIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES FROM OFFERING, PROMISING, AUTHORIZING OR MAKING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS. VIOLATIONS OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT ("FCPA") AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS MAY RESULT IN SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL SANCTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER PENALTIES AND THE SEC AND U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE INCREASED THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE FCPA. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS THAT CGP LLC HAS IMPLEMENTED TO DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN PROHIBITING OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FROM VIOLATING OR CIRCUMVENTING OUR POLICIES AND THE LAW. IF THE EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, PLANET HOLLYWOOD, HORSESHOE BALTIMORE AND CIE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR COMPANY POLICIES GOVERNING ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, CGP LLC MAY FACE INVESTIGATIONS, PROSECUTIONS AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS WHICH COULD RESULT IN CIVIL PENALTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. ANY DETERMINATION THAT WE HAVE VIOLATED ANY ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S FINANCIAL CONDITION. COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO CGP LLC'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCREASE CGP LLC'S COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. CGP LLC AND ITS BUSINESSES ALSO DEAL WITH SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH IN ITS OPERATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REPORTING AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS. ANY VIOLATION OF ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS ("AML") OR REGULATIONS, ON WHICH IN RECENT YEARS, GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY FOCUSED, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE GAMING INDUSTRY, BY ANY OF OUR RESORTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE, A MAJOR GAMING COMPANY RECENTLY SETTLED A U.S. ATTORNEY INVESTIGATION INTO ITS AML PRACTICES. ON OCTOBER 11, 2013, A SUBSIDIARY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY ("FINCEN"), STATING THAT FINCEN IS INVESTIGATING DESERT PALACE, INC. (THE OWNER OF CAESARS PALACE) FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT ("BSA") BASED ON A BSA EXAMINATION OF CAESARS PALACE PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ASSESS A CIVIL PENALTY AND/OR TAKE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST CAESARS PALACE. ADDITIONALLY, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT A FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION RELATED TO THESE MATTERS IS ON-GOING. WE INTEND TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH BOTH THE FINCEN AND GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS. BASED ON PROCEEDINGS TO DATE, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS, IF ANY. 
 RISKS RELATED TO CGP LLC S INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS 
 ONE GAME HAS HISTORICALLY GENERATED THE MAJORITY OF CIE'S REVENUE, AND CIE MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH AND ENHANCE GAMES THAT ATTRACT AND RETAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN ORDER TO GROW ITS REVENUE AND SUSTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION. 
 HISTORICALLY, CIE HAS DEPENDED ON ONE GAME FOR THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUE AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS DEPENDENCY WILL LIKELY CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY, SLOTOMANIA ACCOUNTED FOR 64 OF CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE ONLINE GAME REVENUE FOR 2013 AND 61 OF CIE'S TOTAL REVENUE FOR 2013. CIE'S GROWTH DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE INTEREST IN ITS KEY ESTABLISHED GAME, SLOTOMANIA , BY CONTINUALLY ENHANCING THE GAME. ADDITIONALLY, CIE MUST LAUNCH NEW GAMES THAT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT POPULARITY. EACH OF CIE'S GAMES REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ENGINEERING, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH AND SUSTAIN VIA REGULAR UPGRADES AND EXPANSIONS, AND SUCH COSTS ON AVERAGE HAVE INCREASED AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. CIE'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH, SUSTAIN AND EXPAND GAMES AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN PLAYERS LARGELY DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO: 
 
 ANTICIPATE AND EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING PLAYER INTERESTS AND PREFERENCES; 
 
 ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING ANY FUTURE LEGALIZATION OF ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS; 
 
 ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE TALENTED GAME DESIGNERS, PRODUCT MANAGERS AND ENGINEERS; 
 
 DEVELOP, SUSTAIN AND EXPAND GAMES THAT ARE FUN, INTERESTING AND COMPELLING TO PLAY; 
 
 EFFECTIVELY MARKET NEW GAMES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO CIE'S EXISTING PLAYERS AND NEW PLAYERS; 
 
 MINIMIZE LAUNCH DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS ON NEW GAMES AND GAME EXPANSIONS; 
 24 

MINIMIZE DOWNTIME AND OTHER TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES; AND 
 
 ACQUIRE HIGH QUALITY ASSETS, PERSONNEL AND COMPANIES. 
 IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONSISTENTLY ANTICIPATE PLAYER DEMAND ON A LARGE SCALE, PARTICULARLY AS CIE DEVELOPS NEW GAMES IN NEW MARKETS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND MOBILE PLATFORMS. IF CIE DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH AND SUSTAIN GAMES THAT ATTRACT AND RETAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PLAYERS AND EXTEND THE LIFE OF CIE'S EXISTING GAMES, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IF CIE'S TOP GAME, SLOTOMANIA, DOES NOT MAINTAIN ITS POPULARITY, CIE S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE HARMED. 
 IN ADDITION TO CREATING NEW GAMES THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PLAYERS, CIE MUST EXTEND THE LIFE OF ITS EXISTING GAMES, IN PARTICULAR ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL GAME, SLOTOMANIA . FOR A GAME TO REMAIN POPULAR, CIE MUST ROUTINELY ENHANCE, EXPAND AND/OR UPGRADE THE GAME WITH NEW FEATURES AND CONTENT THAT PLAYERS FIND ATTRACTIVE. SUCH ENHANCEMENT REQUIRES THE INVESTMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, INTEGRATION INTO NEW PLATFORMS, INTRODUCTION OF NEW LANGUAGES, EXPANSION INTO NEW JURISDICTIONS AND OFTEN PRESENTS NEW MARKETING AND OTHER CHALLENGES. CIE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ENHANCE, EXPAND OR UPGRADE CIE'S CURRENT LIBRARY OF GAMES. ANY DECREASE IN THE POPULARITY OF CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, OR ANY OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO CIE'S MOST POPULAR GAME, SLOTOMANIA , COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CIE RELIES ON A SMALL PORTION OF ITS TOTAL PLAYERS FOR NEARLY ALL OF ITS REVENUE FROM SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES AND IF CIE FAILS TO GROW OR SUSTAIN ITS PLAYER BASE, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 CONSISTENT WITH THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES BUSINESS MODEL, ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF CIE S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES PLAYERS PAY FOR VIRTUAL GOODS. DURING 2013, CIE S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES BUSINESS HAD APPROXIMATELY 203 THOUSAND AVERAGE MONTHLY UNIQUE PAYERS, OR 1.4 OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CIE'S AVERAGE MONTHLY UNIQUE USERS ON ITS SOCIAL AND MOBILE PLATFORMS. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN AND INCREASE CIE'S REVENUE LEVELS, CIE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS THAT ARE PAYERS. TO RETAIN PLAYERS, CIE MUST DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES SO THAT THE GAMES THEY PLAY RETAIN THEIR INTEREST AND ATTRACT THEM TO CIE'S OTHER GAMES. IF CIE FAILS TO GROW OR SUSTAIN ITS PLAYER BASE, OR IF THE RATES AT WHICH CIE ATTRACTS AND RETAIN PLAYERS DECLINES OR IF THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REVENUE CIE RECEIVES FROM ITS PLAYERS DECLINES, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY IS RAPIDLY GROWING AND CHANGING, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE CIE'S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. 
 SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, FROM WHICH CGP LLC AND PREDECESSOR GROWTH PARTNERS DERIVED 95.6 OF THE REVENUE FOR THE INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS FOR 2013, IS A RAPIDLY GROWING AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRIES AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF CIE'S GAMES ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. CIE'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND CIE'S CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS: 
 
 THE OCCURRENCE AND MANNER OF LEGALIZATION OF ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UNITED STATES BEYOND NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY; 
 
 CONTINUED WORLDWIDE GROWTH IN THE ADOPTION AND USE OF FACEBOOK, OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MOBILE PLATFORMS; 
 
 CHANGING RULES AND REQUIREMENTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS, LIKE FACEBOOK AND MOBILE PLATFORMS, LIKE ANDROID AND APPLE IOS; 
 
 CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS AND PUBLIC TASTES AND PREFERENCES; 
 
 CHANGING LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES; 
 
 THE AVAILABILITY AND POPULARITY OF OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT; 
 
 THE WORLDWIDE GROWTH OF PERSONAL COMPUTER, BROADBAND INTERNET AND MOBILE DEVICE USERS, AND THE RATE OF ANY SUCH GROWTH; AND 
 
 GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ADVERSELY AFFECTING DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING. 
 CIE'S ABILITY TO PLAN FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY ITS ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO RELATIVELY RAPID CHANGES IN THE TASTES AND PREFERENCES OF ITS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL PLAYERS. NEW AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENTERTAINMENT MAY INCREASE IN POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES. A DECLINE IN THE POPULARITY OF SOCIAL OR MOBILE GAMES IN GENERAL, OR CIE'S GAMES IN PARTICULAR, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 25 

CIE HAS A NEW BUSINESS MODEL AND A SHORT OPERATING HISTORY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE ITS PROSPECTS AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT IT WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 
 CIE'S BUSINESS WAS FORMED IN MAY 2009, AND CIE'S BUSINESS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PLAYTIKA IN 2011. CONSEQUENTLY, CIE HAS A SHORT OPERATING HISTORY AND A NEW BUSINESS MODEL, BOTH OF WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS ITS FUTURE PROSPECTS. TODAY, CIE S BUSINESS MODEL IS LARGELY BASED ON OFFERING GAMES THAT ARE FREE TO PLAY ON SOCIAL AND MOBILE PLATFORMS, REGULATED ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UK AND ITS WSOP SPONSORSHIP AND LICENSING BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT CIE'S BUSINESS MODEL TO EVOLVE AS OTHER STATES LEGALIZE ONLINE POKER OR ONLINE GAMBLING. MOREOVER, TO DATE, CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES BUSINESS ONLY EARNS REVENUE FROM A SMALL PORTION OF ITS PLAYERS. IN ADDITION, CIE'S EXPERIENCE IN THE COMPLEX BUSINESS OF ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IS LIMITED. CIE'S FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS BECAUSE IT HAS DERIVED THE MAJORITY OF ITS HISTORICAL REVENUE FROM ITS ACQUISITION OF PLAYTIKA IN 2011. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CIE'S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS IN LIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES IT FACES, ANY ONE, OR THE COMBINATION, OF WHICH COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND INTENSE COMPETITION THAT CHARACTERIZES THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY HAS LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND WE EXPECT MORE COMPANIES TO ENTER THE SECTOR AND A WIDER RANGE OF SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES TO BE INTRODUCED. THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. CIE'S COMPETITORS THAT DEVELOP SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES VARY IN SIZE AND INCLUDE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES SUCH AS ZYNGA INC. ("ZYNGA"), GLU MOBILE, INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY ("IGT') AND ELECTRONIC ARTS AND PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES SUCH AS MIDASPLAYER.COM LIMITED (OPERATORS OF KING.COM ). IN ADDITION, ONLINE GAME DEVELOPERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, SUCH AS TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED IN ASIA, AND HIGH-PROFILE COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT ONLINE PRESENCES THAT TO DATE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, SUCH AS AMAZON.COM, INC., APPLE INC., FACEBOOK, GOOGLE INC. ("GOOGLE"), MICROSOFT AND YAHOO! INC., MAY DECIDE TO DEVELOP SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL GAMES, MAY BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THEIR OWN HIGHLY RECOGNIZED BRANDS AND ASSETS INTO THEIR GAMES, HAVE A MORE DIVERSIFIED SET OF REVENUE SOURCES THAN CIE CURRENTLY DOES AND MAY BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY IMPACT THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY. AS CIE CONTINUES TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING GAMES FOR SOCIAL AND MOBILE PLATFORMS, CIE WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM ESTABLISHED COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE FAR GREATER EXPERIENCE THAN CIE, INCLUDING ZYNGA AND ELECTRONIC ARTS. MOREOVER, THERE EXISTS IN THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY A SIGNIFICANT "FIRST MOVER" ADVANTAGE. CIE'S ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR STYLE OF GAME MAY BE PREMISED ON INTRODUCING A GAME IN THAT STYLE BEFORE CIE'S COMPETITORS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT CIE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR THAT CIE WILL BE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING OR FURTHER INCREASING ITS CURRENT MARKET SHARE. CIE'S FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN ITS VARIOUS MARKETS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 IF CIE FAILS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS GROWTH, CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED. 
 CIE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE RAPID GROWTH IN ITS HEADCOUNT AND OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON ITS MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 56 OF CIE'S EMPLOYEES HAD BEEN WITH CIE FOR LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND APPROXIMATELY 88 FOR LESS THAN TWO YEARS. MOREOVER, A NUMBER OF THE INDIVIDUALS CIE RELIES ON FOR ITS OPERATIONS ARE CONSULTANTS, NOT FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES ON CIE'S PAYROLL. AS CIE CONTINUES TO GROW, IT MUST EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY, HIRE, INTEGRATE, DEVELOP AND MOTIVATE A LARGE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. IF CIE FAILS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS HIRING NEEDS AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ITS NEW HIRES, CIE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE LAUNCHING NEW GAMES AND ENHANCE EXISTING GAMES COULD SUFFER. 
 TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE GROWTH OF CIE'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, IT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE SPENDING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPROVE ITS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ITS OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AND ITS REPORTING SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 
 
 MONITORING AND UPDATING CIE'S TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN HIGH PERFORMANCE AND MINIMIZE DOWN TIME; 
 
 ENHANCING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT CIE'S EMPLOYEES AND OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD ARE WELL-COORDINATED AND CAN EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER; AND 
 
 APPROPRIATELY DOCUMENTING CIE'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES. 
 IF CIE FAILS TO SUCCESSFULLY DO THESE THINGS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 26 

CIE'S GROWTH PROSPECTS WILL SUFFER IF IT IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL GAMES FOR NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS. 
 WE EXPECT CIE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS SOCIAL ONLINE AND MOBILE GAMES ON NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS, AND ITS LIMITED EXPERIENCE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER CIE WILL SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING SUCH GAMES THAT APPEAL TO PLAYERS OR ADVERTISERS ON SUCH NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS. THE UNCERTAINTIES CIE FACES INCLUDE: 
 
 ITS EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING SOCIAL GAMES FOR USE PRIMARILY ON FACEBOOK AND APPLE IOS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT FOR DEVELOPING GAMES FOR NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS; 
 
 MANY NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS ARE LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE CIE HAS NO OR LIMITED OPERATING EXPERIENCE; 
 
 NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORMS MAY REQUIRE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS TO ADAPT CIE'S GAMES THAN ITS CURRENT PLATFORMS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE; 
 
 CIE HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS, NEW AND EMERGING PLATFORM PROVIDERS AND OTHER PARTNERS WHOSE COOPERATION CIE MAY NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL; AND 
 
 CIE WILL NEED TO MOVE BEYOND PAYMENT METHODS PROVIDED BY SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SUCCESSFULLY ALLOW FOR A VARIETY OF PAYMENT METHODS AND SYSTEMS BASED ON NEW MOBILE PLATFORMS, GEOGRAPHIES AND OTHER FACTORS. 
 THESE AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER CIE WILL SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY VIABLE GAMES FOR NEW AND EMERGING SOCIAL AND MOBILE PLATFORMS. IF CIE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IF CIE IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK, APPLE AND/OR GOOGLE, OR IF FACEBOOK, APPLE OR GOOGLE WERE TO CHANGE THEIR RESPECTIVE TERMS OF SERVICE IN WAYS UNFAVORABLE TO CIE, CIE'S BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. 
 FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS AND ANDROID ARE SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, PROMOTION AND PAYMENT PLATFORMS FOR CIE'S GAMES. IN 2013, CIE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 97 OF ITS SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES REVENUE AND 88 OF ITS SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES USERS THROUGH THE FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS AND ANDROID PLATFORMS AND WE EXPECT CIE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CIE IS SUBJECT TO FACEBOOK'S, APPLE'S AND GOOGLE'S RESPECTIVE STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, WHICH GOVERN THE PROMOTION, DISTRIBUTION AND OPERATION OF GAMES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS ON THE FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS AND ANDROID PLATFORMS. 
 CIE HAS BENEFITED FROM FACEBOOK'S, APPLE'S AND GOOGLE'S STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION AND LARGE USER BASES. IF FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS AND/OR GOOGLE LOSES ITS MARKET POSITION OR OTHERWISE FALLS OUT OF FAVOR WITH INTERNET USERS, CIE WOULD NEED TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS FOR MARKETING, PROMOTING AND DISTRIBUTING CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, WHICH WOULD CONSUME SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, FACEBOOK, APPLE AND GOOGLE EACH HAVE BROAD DISCRETION TO CHANGE THEIR RESPECTIVE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OTHER POLICIES, WITHOUT CIE'S CONSENT AND WITHOUT NOTICE, WITH RESPECT TO CIE AND OTHER DEVELOPERS, AND THOSE CHANGES MAY BE UNFAVORABLE TO CIE. FACEBOOK, APPLE AND/OR GOOGLE MAY ALSO CHANGE THEIR RESPECTIVE FEE STRUCTURES, ADD FEES ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS AND ANDROID PLATFORMS, CHANGE HOW THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE USERS IS MADE AVAILABLE TO APPLICATION DEVELOPERS ON THE FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS OR ANDROID PLATFORMS, RESTRICT HOW FACEBOOK, APPLE IOS OR ANDROID USERS CAN SHARE INFORMATION WITH FRIENDS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE PLATFORMS, RESTRICT OR DISCONTINUE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES, DISCONTINUE OR LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PLATFORMS BY CIE AND OTHER GAME DEVELOPERS OR DEVELOP THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS WERE TO MATERIALIZE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY PERSONNEL AT CIE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS. 
 THE LEADERSHIP OF CIE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MITCH GARBER, AND OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAS BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF ITS SUCCESS. THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF MITCH GARBER OR OTHER EXTENDED OR PERMANENT LOSS OF HIS SERVICES, OR ANY NEGATIVE MARKET OR INDUSTRY PERCEPTION WITH RESPECT TO HIM OR ARISING FROM HIS LOSS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC S, BUSINESS. CIE'S OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ROBERT ANTOKOL, CO-FOUNDER OF PLAYTIKA, HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES INDUSTRY AND HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO CIE'S GROWTH AND SUCCESS. THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. CIE IS NOT PROTECTED BY KEY MAN OR SIMILAR LIFE INSURANCE COVERING MEMBERS OF ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT. CIE HAS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, BUT THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY GIVEN EXECUTIVE WILL REMAIN WITH CIE. 
 IF CIE IS UNABLE TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND ITS BUSINESSES. 
 CIE'S SUCCESS AND ABILITY TO GROW ARE DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON ITS ABILITY TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF TALENTED PEOPLE, WITH THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE SKILLS NEEDED TO SERVE AND EXPAND ITS BUSINESS. SUCH EMPLOYEES, PARTICULARLY GAME DESIGNERS, PRODUCT MANAGERS AND ENGINEERS, ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND CIE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IDENTIFYING, HIRING, 
 27 

TRAINING, INTEGRATING AND RETAINING THESE EMPLOYEES. THESE EFFORTS PLACE SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON CIE'S RESOURCES. HISTORICALLY, CIE HAS HIRED A NUMBER OF KEY PERSONNEL THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS OUR ACQUISITION OF PLAYTIKA, AND AS COMPETITION WITH OTHER SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES COMPANIES INCREASES, CIE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN CONTINUING THIS PRACTICE. THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO MEET PARTICULAR DEMANDS OR THE LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CIE'S EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS IMPORTANT FOR CIE'S GROWTH, AND AS CIE EXPANDS INTERNATIONALLY IT FACES ADDITIONAL BUSINESS, POLITICAL, REGULATORY, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS, ANY OF WHICH COULD INCREASE ITS COSTS AND HINDER ITS GROWTH. 
 CONTINUING TO EXPAND CIE'S BUSINESS TO ATTRACT PLAYERS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF CIE'S BUSINESS STRATEGY. AN IMPORTANT PART OF TARGETING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS DEVELOPING OFFERINGS THAT HAVE LOCALIZED CONTENT AND ARE CUSTOMIZED FOR THE PLAYERS IN THOSE MARKETS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL OFFICES AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIOS, AND INCREASING CIE'S FOREIGN LANGUAGE STRATEGIC OFFERINGS. CIE'S ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS AND TO ATTRACT TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND PLAYERS IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES OF SUPPORTING A RAPIDLY GROWING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, CULTURES, CUSTOMS, LEGAL SYSTEMS, ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE SYSTEMS, REGULATORY SYSTEMS AND COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURES. EXPANDING CIE'S INTERNATIONAL FOCUS MAY SUBJECT IT TO RISKS THAT IT HAS NOT FACED BEFORE OR INCREASE RISKS THAT CIE CURRENTLY FACES, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH: 
 
 RECRUITING AND RETAINING TALENTED AND CAPABLE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES; 
 
 CHALLENGES CAUSED BY DISTANCE, LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES; 
 
 DEVELOPING AND CUSTOMIZING GAMES AND OTHER OFFERINGS THAT APPEAL TO THE TASTES AND PREFERENCES OF PLAYERS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS; 
 
 COMPETITION FROM LOCAL GAME MAKERS WITH SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE IN THOSE MARKETS AND WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF LOCAL PLAYER PREFERENCES; 
 
 PROTECTING AND ENFORCING CIE'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; 
 
 NEGOTIATING AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL DISTRIBUTION PLATFORMS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL TO CIE AND PROTECTIVE OF ITS RIGHTS; 
 
 THE INABILITY TO EXTEND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN CIE'S BRAND, CONTENT OR TECHNOLOGY INTO NEW JURISDICTIONS; 
 
 IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS FOR VIRTUAL GOODS IN A MANNER THAT COMPLIES WITH LOCAL LAWS AND PRACTICES AND PROTECTS CIE FROM FRAUD; 
 
 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING PRIVACY LAWS AND LAWS RELATING TO CONTENT; 
 
 COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COMPLIANCE WITH THE FCPA; 
 
 CREDIT RISK AND HIGHER LEVELS OF PAYMENT FRAUD; 
 
 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS; 
 
 PROTECTIONIST LAWS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL BUSINESSES IN SOME COUNTRIES; 
 
 FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO PAY VALUE ADDED TAX, OR VAT, IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS; 
 
 FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR U.S. TAX RESTRICTIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PREVENT CIE FROM REPATRIATING INCOME EARNED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; AND 
 
 POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY. 
 ENTERING NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS CAN BE EXPENSIVE, CIE'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET IS UNCERTAIN AND THE DISTRACTION OF CIE'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM COULD MEAN THAT IT IS UNABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES. IF CIE IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE VALUE OF CIE'S VIRTUAL GOODS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON HOW CIE MANAGES THE ECONOMIES IN ITS GAMES. IF CIE FAILS TO MANAGE ITS GAME ECONOMIES PROPERLY, ITS BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. 
 PLAYERS FROM WHOM CIE DERIVES REVENUE PURCHASE VIRTUAL GOODS IN CIE'S GAMES BECAUSE OF THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THESE GOODS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE EASE OF SECURING AN EQUIVALENT GOOD VIA NON-PAID MEANS WITHIN THE GAME. THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THESE VIRTUAL GOODS CAN BE IMPACTED BY VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT CIE TAKES IN THE GAMES, INCLUDING OFFERING 
 28 

DISCOUNTS FOR VIRTUAL GOODS, GIVING AWAY VIRTUAL GOODS IN PROMOTIONS OR PROVIDING EASIER NON-PAID MEANS TO SECURE THESE GOODS. IF CIE FAILS TO MANAGE ITS VIRTUAL ECONOMIES PROPERLY, PLAYERS MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO PURCHASE VIRTUAL GOODS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 THE PROLIFERATION OF HACKING, SECURITY BREACHES, COMPUTER MALWARE, "CHEATING" PROGRAMS AND SCAM OFFERS THAT SEEK TO EXPLOIT CIE'S GAMES AND PLAYERS AFFECTS THE GAME-PLAYING EXPERIENCE AND MAY LEAD PLAYERS TO STOP PLAYING CIE'S GAMES. 
 SECURITY BREACHES, COMPUTER MALWARE AND COMPUTER HACKING ATTACKS HAVE BECOME MORE PREVALENT IN CIE'S INDUSTRY AND MAY OCCUR ON ITS SYSTEMS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF CIE S PROMINENCE IN THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAME INDUSTRY, CIE'S AFFILIATION WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST GAMING ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND BECAUSE OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE BRANDS CIE USES IN ITS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CAESARS , WSOP , SLOTOMANIA AND BINGO BLITZ , WE BELIEVE CIE IS A PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR HACKERS. THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT HARM MAY EXACTLY RESULT FROM ANY SPECIFIC INTERRUPTION OR BREACH, ANY FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CIE'S NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS PLAYERS MAY HARM CIE'S REPUTATION AND ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING PLAYERS AND ATTRACT NEW PLAYERS. CIE IS PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO THESE RISKS IN ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING BUSINESS WHERE PLAYERS PLACE AN ESPECIALLY HIGH VALUE ON THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF CIE'S GAMES. ANY SECURITY BREACH CAUSED BY HACKING, WHICH INVOLVES EFFORTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO INFORMATION OR SYSTEMS, OR TO CAUSE INTENTIONAL MALFUNCTIONS OR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE OR OTHER COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, AND THE INADVERTENT TRANSMISSION OF COMPUTER VIRUSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES HAVE DEVELOPED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, "CHEATING" PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ENABLE PLAYERS TO EXPLOIT CIE'S GAMES, PLAY THEM IN AN AUTOMATED WAY OR OBTAIN UNFAIR ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER PLAYERS WHO DO PLAY FAIRLY, INCLUDING THROUGH THE UNAUTHORIZED SALE OF CIE S VIRTUAL GOODS. THESE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES HARM THE EXPERIENCE OF PLAYERS WHO PLAY FAIRLY AND MAY DISRUPT THE REAL MONEY OPERATIONS AND VIRTUAL ECONOMIES OF CIE'S GAMES. CIE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DISCOVER AND DISABLE THESE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES, BUT IF CIE IS UNABLE TO DO SO QUICKLY ITS OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED, ITS REPUTATION DAMAGED AND PLAYERS MAY STOP PLAYING ITS GAMES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOST REVENUE FROM PAYING PLAYERS, INCREASED COST OF DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGICAL MEASURES TO COMBAT THESE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES, LEGAL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF CIE'S REAL MONEY GAMING CREDITS, VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND INCREASED CUSTOMER SERVICE COSTS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO DISSATISFIED PLAYERS. 
 CIE IS SUBJECT TO PAYMENT-RELATED RISKS, SUCH AS RISK OF FRAUDULENT USE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, WHICH COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON CIE'S BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO UNUSUALLY LARGE OR FREQUENT CHARGEBACKS FROM CUSTOMERS. 
 CIE ACCEPTS PAYMENTS USING A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING PAYPAL, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS. AS CIE CONTINUES TO INTRODUCE NEW PAYMENT OPTIONS TO ITS PLAYERS, CIE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. CIE ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF FRAUDULENT USE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, OR OTHER PAYMENT OPTIONS. FOR CERTAIN PAYMENT METHODS, INCLUDING CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, CIE PAYS INTERCHANGE AND OTHER FEES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OVER TIME AND, THEREFORE, RAISE OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCE PROFITABILITY. CIE RELIES ON THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES AND IT COULD DISRUPT CIE S BUSINESS IF THESE COMPANIES BECOME UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO CIE. CIE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RULES AND REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS, WHICH COULD CHANGE OR BE REINTERPRETED TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR CIE TO COMPLY. IF CIE FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES OR REQUIREMENTS, CIE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND HIGHER TRANSACTION FEES AND LOSE ITS ABILITY TO ACCEPT PAYPAL, CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR OTHER PAYMENTS FROM CONSUMERS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE MERCHANT CATEGORY CODE ASSIGNED TO CIE BY THE CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING BUSINESS, CIE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF DECLINED TRANSACTIONS WHICH COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY DEPOSITED. 
 CHARGEBACKS OCCUR WHEN CUSTOMERS SEEK TO VOID CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. CARDHOLDERS ARE INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO REVERSE CARD TRANSACTIONS ONLY IF THERE HAS BEEN UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE CARD OR THE SERVICES CONTRACTED FOR HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. IN CIE S BUSINESS, PLAYERS OCCASIONALLY SEEK TO REVERSE THEIR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING LOSSES OR PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL GOODS THROUGH CHARGEBACKS. ALTHOUGH CIE PLACES GREAT EMPHASIS ON CONTROL PROCEDURES TO PROTECT FROM CHARGEBACKS, THESE CONTROL PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT CIE FROM ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ITS BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO UNUSUALLY LARGE OR FREQUENT CHARGEBACKS. 
 PROGRAMMING ERRORS OR FLAWS IN CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, OR ON ITS REGULATED ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WEBSITES, COULD HARM CIE'S REPUTATION OR DECREASE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF CIE'S GAMES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CIE S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, AND ITS REGULATED ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WEBSITES, MAY CONTAIN ERRORS, BUGS, FLAWS OR CORRUPTED DATA, AND THESE DEFECTS MAY ONLY BECOME APPARENT AFTER THEIR LAUNCH, PARTICULARLY AS CIE LAUNCHES NEW GAMES AND RAPIDLY RELEASES NEW FEATURES TO EXISTING GAMES UNDER TIGHT TIME CONSTRAINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF CIE'S PLAYERS HAVE A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH ITS GAMES, THEY MAY BE LESS INCLINED TO CONTINUE OR RESUME PLAYING CIE'S GAMES OR RECOMMEND ITS GAMES TO OTHER POTENTIAL PLAYERS. UNDETECTED PROGRAMMING ERRORS, GAME DEFECTS AND DATA CORRUPTION CAN DISRUPT CIE'S OPERATIONS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GAME EXPERIENCE OF CIE'S PLAYERS BY ALLOWING PLAYERS TO GAIN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE, HARM CIE S REPUTATION, CAUSE 
 29 

CIE'S PLAYERS TO STOP PLAYING ITS GAMES, DIVERT CIE'S RESOURCES AND DELAY MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF CIE'S GAMES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES MAY RESTRICT ACCESS TO FACEBOOK, CIE'S WEBSITES OR THE INTERNET GENERALLY, WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE LOSS OR SLOWER GROWTH OF CIE'S PLAYER BASE. 
 CIE'S ONLINE PLAYERS NEED TO ACCESS THE INTERNET TO PLAY CIE'S GAMES. COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES COULD BLOCK ACCESS TO THE INTERNET GENERALLY OR THE PARTICULAR PLATFORM ON WHICH A PLAYER WISHES TO PLAY CIE'S GAMES (E.G., FACEBOOK) FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS SUCH AS SECURITY OR CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS OR REGULATORY REASONS, OR THEY MAY ADOPT POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM ACCESSING FACEBOOK, CIE'S WEBSITE, CIE'S ONLINE GAMING WEBSITES OR OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS FOR WORK RELATED EFFICIENCY REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE S REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS BLOCKED ACCESS TO FACEBOOK IN CHINA AND, ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, PROCTOR GAMBLE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A POLICY RESTRICTING EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT WEBSITES. IF COMPANIES OR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES BLOCK OR LIMIT ACCESS TO FACEBOOK, CIE'S WEBSITE, CIE'S ONLINE GAMING WEBSITES OR OTHERWISE ADOPT POLICIES RESTRICTING PLAYERS FROM PLAYING CIE'S GAMES, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 EVOLVING REGULATIONS CONCERNING DATA PRIVACY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATION AND DIFFERENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH COULD PREVENT CIE FROM PROVIDING ITS CURRENT GAMES TO ITS PLAYERS OR REQUIRE CIE TO MODIFY ITS GAMES, THEREBY HARMING ITS BUSINESS. 
 THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PRIVACY ISSUES WORLDWIDE IS CURRENTLY IN FLUX AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. PRACTICES REGARDING THE COLLECTION, USE, STORAGE, TRANSMISSION AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY COMPANIES OPERATING OVER THE INTERNET AND MOBILE PLATFORMS HAVE RECENTLY COME UNDER INCREASED PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS REVIEWING THE NEED FOR GREATER REGULATION FOR THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ON THE INTERNET, INCLUDING REGULATION AIMED AT RESTRICTING CERTAIN TARGETED ADVERTISING PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IN THE PROCESS OF PROPOSING REFORMS TO ITS EXISTING DATA PROTECTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A GREATER COMPLIANCE BURDEN FOR COMPANIES WITH USERS IN EUROPE. VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND CONSUMER AGENCIES HAVE ALSO CALLED FOR NEW REGULATION AND CHANGES IN INDUSTRY PRACTICES. 
 CIE'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE AND EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED, INTERPRETED OR IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH CIE'S CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THAT REQUIRE CHANGES TO THESE PRACTICES, THE DESIGN OF CIE'S WEBSITE, GAMES, FEATURES OR ITS PRIVACY POLICY. IN PARTICULAR, THE SUCCESS OF CIE'S BUSINESS HAS BEEN, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE, DRIVEN BY CIE'S ABILITY TO RESPONSIBLY USE THE DATA THAT CIE'S PLAYERS SHARE WITH IT. THEREFORE, CIE'S BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR INDUSTRY PRACTICES REGARDING THE USE OR DISCLOSURE OF DATA CIE'S PLAYERS CHOOSE TO SHARE WITH IT, OR REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONSENT OF CONSUMERS FOR SUCH USE AND DISCLOSURE IS OBTAINED. SUCH CHANGES MAY REQUIRE CIE TO MODIFY ITS GAMES AND FEATURES, POSSIBLY IN A MATERIAL MANNER, AND MAY LIMIT CIE'S ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW GAMES AND FEATURES THAT MAKE USE OF THE DATA THAT CIE'S PLAYERS VOLUNTARILY SHARE WITH IT. 
 CIE'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS, MANY OF WHICH ARE UNSETTLED AND STILL DEVELOPING AND WHICH COULD SUBJECT CIE TO CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE HARM ITS BUSINESS. 
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A NUMBER OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE ADOPTED OR CONSTRUED TO APPLY TO CIE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE THAT COULD RESTRICT THE SOCIAL AND MOBILE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING PLAYER PRIVACY, ADVERTISING, TAXATION, CONTENT SUITABILITY, COPYRIGHT, DISTRIBUTION AND ANTITRUST. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE MAY DEEM CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES TO BE GAMBLING OR MARKETING GAMBLING TO UNDERAGE PERSONS AND THEREFORE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND VIRTUAL GOODS MAY PROMPT CALLS FOR MORE STRINGENT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THAT MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON COMPANIES SUCH AS CIE CONDUCTING BUSINESS THROUGH THE INTERNET AND MOBILE DEVICES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT SCRUTINY AND REGULATION OF CIE'S INDUSTRY WILL INCREASE AND THAT CIE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE LEGAL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SUCH REGULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, EXISTING LAWS OR NEW LAWS REGARDING THE REGULATION OF CURRENCY AND BANKING INSTITUTIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED TO COVER REAL MONEY GAMING CREDITS, VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL GOODS. IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR CIE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SEEK LICENSES, AUTHORIZATIONS OR APPROVALS FROM RELEVANT REGULATORS, THE GRANTING OF WHICH MAY BE DEPENDENT ON CIE MEETING CERTAIN CAPITAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND CIE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT, ALL OF WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CIE S OPERATING COSTS. CHANGES IN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE IMPOSITION OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE REGARDING THESE ACTIVITIES MAY LESSEN THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL OR MOBILE GAMES OR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING SERVICES AND IMPAIR CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 ANY FAILURE TO PROTECT CIE'S TRADEMARKS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF CIE'S BRAND NAMES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS. 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS PART OF CIE S OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY AND CIE REGARDS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF ITS SUCCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, CIE OWNS AND MANAGES THE WSOP TOURNAMENTS AND CIRCUIT, AND 
 30 

CIE LICENSES OR SUBLICENSES TRADEMARKS FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES RELATED TO THIS BRAND. CIE ALSO OWNS THE SLOTOMANIA BRAND. CIE SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADE SECRET LAWS. CIE FILES APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAINS COPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE CIE BELIEVES FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. CIE ALSO SEEKS TO MAINTAIN ITS TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. DESPITE CIE'S EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, PARTIES MAY INFRINGE ITS COPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS AND USE INFORMATION THAT CIE REGARDS AS PROPRIETARY AND CIE S RIGHTS MAY BE INVALIDATED OR UNENFORCEABLE. IN ADDITION, PARTIES MAY CHALLENGE CIE'S COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES DO NOT PROTECT PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO AS GREAT AN EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. MONITORING THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF CIE'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. LITIGATION MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENFORCE CIE'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY AND SCOPE OF THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. LITIGATION OF THIS TYPE COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF CIE'S RESOURCES. THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR REPRODUCTION OF CIE'S TRADEMARKS COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF ITS BRAND AND ITS MARKET ACCEPTANCE, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OR GOODWILL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IN THE FUTURE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CIE WILL FACE ALLEGATIONS THAT IT HAS INFRINGED THE TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING FROM ITS COMPETITORS, NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES AND FORMER EMPLOYERS OF ITS PERSONNEL. PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION MAY BE PROTRACTED AND EXPENSIVE, AND THE RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AS THE RESULT OF ANY COURT JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT, CIE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO CANCEL THE LAUNCH OF A NEW GAME, STOP OFFERING CERTAIN FEATURES, PAY ROYALTIES OR SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT COSTS, PURCHASE LICENSES OR MODIFY ITS GAMES AND FEATURES WHILE IT DEVELOPS SUBSTITUTES. 
 THE LEAHY-SMITH AMERICA INVENTS ACT (THE "LEAHY-SMITH ACT"), WAS ADOPTED IN SEPTEMBER 2011. THE LEAHY-SMITH ACT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO UNITED STATES PATENT LAW, INCLUDING PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT THE WAY PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL BE PROSECUTED AND MAY ALSO AFFECT PATENT LITIGATION. THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES TO GOVERN ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEAHY-SMITH ACT, AND MANY OF THE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO PATENT LAW ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAHY-SMITH ACT DID NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL UP TO 18 MONTHS AFTER ITS ENACTMENT. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT, IF ANY, IMPACT THE LEAHY-SMITH ACT WILL HAVE ON THE OPERATION OF CIE'S BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THE LEAHY-SMITH ACT AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION COULD INCREASE THE UNCERTAINTIES AND COSTS SURROUNDING THE PROSECUTION OF CIE'S PATENT APPLICATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE OF ITS ISSUED PATENTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS. 
 CIE'S BUSINESS STRATEGY IS PREMISED, IN PART, ON THE LEGALIZATION OF ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ABILITY TO PREDICT AND CAPITALIZE ON ANY SUCH LEGALIZATION. 
 IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, MISSISSIPPI, HAWAII, MASSACHUSETTS, IOWA, ILLINOIS, WASHINGTON D.C. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE CONSIDERED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LEGALIZE ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING. TO DATE, ONLY NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ENACTED SUCH LEGISLATION. IF A LARGE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL STATES OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FAIL TO ENACT ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING LEGISLATION OR CIE IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY LICENSES TO OPERATE ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WEBSITES IN UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH GAMES ARE LEGALIZED, CIE'S FUTURE GROWTH COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED AS CIE WOULD BE LIMITED TO OFFERING ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING TO PLAYERS IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHERE LEGAL. IN ADDITION, STATES OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY LEGALIZE ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN A MANNER THAT IS UNFAVORABLE TO CIE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE CONSIDERING DRAFT LAWS THAT REQUIRE ONLINE CASINOS TO ALSO HAVE A LICENSE TO OPERATE A BRICK-AND-MORTAR CASINO, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN AFFILIATE. IF, LIKE NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY, U.S. JURISDICTIONS ENACT LEGISLATION LEGALIZING REAL MONEY CASINO GAMING SUBJECT TO THIS BRICK-AND-MORTAR REQUIREMENT, CIE MAY BE UNABLE TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS IF CIE IS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH AN AFFILIATION WITH A BRICK-AND-MORTAR CASINO IN SUCH JURISDICTION. IF, HOWEVER, LEGISLATION IS ENACTED LEGALIZING REAL MONEY CASINO GAMING WITHOUT THIS REQUIREMENT, CIE WOULD LOSE ITS ADVANTAGE OVER SOME OF ITS POTENTIAL COMPETITORS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN AFFILIATE WITH A BRICK-AND-MORTAR CASINO OPERATION. THE LOSS OF THIS OR OTHER SIMILAR ADVANTAGES CIE RECEIVES AS AN AFFILIATE OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COULD MATERIALLY IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO GROW ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. 
 THERE ALSO EXISTS IN THE ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING INDUSTRY A SIGNIFICANT "FIRST MOVER" ADVANTAGE. CIE'S ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN RESPECT OF A PARTICULAR STYLE OF ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THE UNITED STATES MAY BE PREMISED ON INTRODUCING A STYLE OF GAMING BEFORE ITS COMPETITORS. CIE'S FAILURE TO DO SO COULD MATERIALLY IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO GROW ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. 
 IN ADDITION TO THE RISK THAT ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WILL BE LEGALIZED IN A MANNER UNFAVORABLE TO CIE, CIE MAY FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT WHEN ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WILL BE LEGALIZED IN SIGNIFICANT JURISDICTIONS. THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN EACH U.S. STATE AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS UNIQUE AND CAPABLE OF RAPID, OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE CHANGE. IF CIE FAILS TO ACCURATELY FORECAST WHEN AND HOW, IF AT ALL, ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING WILL BE LEGALIZED IN ADDITIONAL U.S. JURISDICTIONS, SUCH FAILURE COULD IMPAIR CIE'S READINESS TO INTRODUCE ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OFFERINGS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 31 

NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY ARE THE ONLY U.S. JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE AFFIRMATIVELY LEGALIZED ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING AND ARE SMALL JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY NOT YIELD SIGNIFICANT REVENUE. 
 NEVADA, DELAWARE AND NEW JERSEY ARE THE ONLY U.S. JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION LEGALIZING ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING. BOTH NEVADA AND DELAWARE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL JURISDICTIONS IN TERMS OF POPULATION COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES AND THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FOR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, AND AS A RESULT, CIE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS. 
 INDIVIDUALS MAY SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE IT IS ILLEGAL. IF CIE IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN BLOCKING SUCH INDIVIDUALS, CIE MAY SUFFER LEGAL PENALTIES OR AN IMPAIRMENT OF ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN GENERAL. 
 INDIVIDUALS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IS ILLEGAL MAY NONETHELESS SEEK TO ENGAGE CIE'S ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OFFERINGS. WHILE CIE WILL TAKE STEPS TO BLOCK ACCESS BY INDIVIDUALS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, THOSE STEPS MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL. IN THE EVENT THAT INDIVIDUALS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IS ILLEGAL ENGAGE CIE'S ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OFFERINGS, CIE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, REGULATORY PENALTIES, THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR FUTURE LICENSES NECESSARY TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OR OTHER LEGAL LIABILITIES, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GAMBLING LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE GAMING INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO MAINTAIN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IF CIE IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN BLOCKING ACCESS TO ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OFFERINGS BY INDIVIDUALS IN A JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH OFFERINGS ARE ILLEGAL, CIE COULD LOSE OR BE PREVENTED FROM OBTAINING A LICENSE NECESSARY TO OFFER ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING IN A JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH OFFERINGS ARE LEGAL AND CGP LLC'S OTHER GAMING LICENSES MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 
 SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATION OR PROHIBITION IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD INCREASE CIE'S COMPLIANCE COSTS OR LIMIT THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH CIE IS ABLE TO OFFER SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES. 
 CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY SEEK TO REGULATE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE UK GAMBLING COMMISSION PUBLICLY INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER WHETHER TO REGULATE SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES IN THE FUTURE AFTER CONSIDERING THE ISSUES OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. UNDER RECENT PROPOSED LEGISLATION IN AUSTRALIA, CERTAIN ONLINE SOCIAL GAMES WITH A PAID-FOR ELEMENT WOULD FALL UNDER THE INTERACTIVE GAMBLING ACT, AND BY BEING CONSIDERED GAMBLING WOULD BE AT RISK OF OUTRIGHT BAN. THUS FAR, IN CONSIDERING WHETHER REGULATION OR RESTRICTION IS NECESSARY, MOST JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE GAMES AND WHETHER THEY CONSTITUTE GAMBLING UNDER THEIR LAWS OR OTHERWISE REQUIRE REGULATION TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER. IF THE UK, AUSTRALIA, OR ANOTHER JURISDICTION IMPORTANT TO CIE'S SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES BUSINESS REGULATES OR RESTRICTS THE BUSINESS, IT COULD HAVE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON HOW WE MARKET OUR PRODUCT, ON THE COST OF ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATION OR, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE REGULATION, CIE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PROVIDING SOCIAL AND MOBILE GAMES, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CIE IS DEPENDENT ON A SMALL NUMBER OF THIRD PARTIES FOR ITS ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING PLATFORMS. 
 CIE CONTRACTS WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, MAINTAIN AND OPERATE ITS SOFTWARE PLATFORMS FOR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING, INCLUDING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH 888 AND AMAYA. IN ADDITION, CIE ENTERS INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND PAYS LICENSE FEES FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, LAUNCH, MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF CIE'S REAL MONEY GAMING SERVICES. IF, IN THE FUTURE, THESE THIRD PARTIES CHOOSE NOT TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES OR LICENSES TO CIE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO IT, CIE WILL HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SECURING COMPARABLE SERVICES OR LICENSES, WHICH MAY BE ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE AS THE CURRENT TERMS. WITH RESPECT TO CIE'S PLATFORMS FOR ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING, THE TERMINATION OF THESE SERVICES OR LICENSES BY ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD DELAY THE LAUNCH OF CIE'S REAL MONEY ONLINE POKER OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IF SUCH OPERATIONS ARE LEGALIZED. FOR EXAMPLE, IF CIE'S AGREEMENT WITH 888 RELATED TO ONLINE GAMING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE TO BE BREACHED, CIE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER ONLINE POKER IN NEVADA AND/OR NEW JERSEY. THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 RECENT CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS, THE ENACTMENT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION IMPLEMENTING CHANGES IN THE U.S. TAXATION OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, A CHANGE IN THE APPLICATION OF THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OR THE ADOPTION OF OTHER TAX REFORM POLICIES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT CIE'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 RECENT CHANGES TO U.S. TAX LAWS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF TAXPAYERS TO CLAIM AND UTILIZE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND THE DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN TAX DEDUCTIONS UNTIL EARNINGS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO U.S. TAX LAWS THAT MAY BE ENACTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPACT THE TAX TREATMENT OF CIE S FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS INDICATING THAT IT HAS MADE INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM A PRIORITY, AND KEY MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS HAVE CONDUCTED HEARINGS AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION IN THE PAST THAT ADDRESSES SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL TAX ISSUES. DUE TO THE LARGE AND EXPANDING SCALE OF CIE'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ANY CHANGES IN THE U.S. TAXATION OF SUCH ACTIVITIES MAY INCREASE CIE'S WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HARM CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, FINANCIAL POSITION AND 
 32 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, ANY INCREASE OR CHANGES IN TAXES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE CIE HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL, COULD HARM CIE'S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 MOREOVER, CIE'S CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THE MANNER IN WHICH CIE DEVELOPS AND USES ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE TRANSFER PRICING OF ITS INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE CIE WORLDWIDE TAX EFFICIENCIES. THE APPLICATION OF THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, TO CIE S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION AND DEPENDS ON CIE S ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH ITS CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS. THE TAXING AUTHORITIES OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH CIE OPERATES MAY CHALLENGE CIE S METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY OR INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING CIE S TRANSFER PRICING, OR DETERMINE THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH CIE OPERATES ITS BUSINESS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH CIE REPORTS ITS INCOME TO THE JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD INCREASE CIE S WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HARM ITS, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 CIE IS NO LONGER A MEMBER OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ' S CONSOLIDATED GROUP FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, WHICH WILL TRIGGER INTERCOMPANY GAINS BETWEEN CIE AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR OTHER MEMBERS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ' S CONSOLIDATED GROUP. CIE COULD BE LIABLE FOR TAXES OWED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE DATE CIE BECAME DECONSOLIDATED INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERCOMPANY GAINS. 
 FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE RIGHTS OFFERING, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT NO LONGER OWNS 80 OR MORE OF THE COMMON STOCK OF CIE, AND THEREFORE, UNDER U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, CIE CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S CONSOLIDATED GROUP FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE TRIGGERING OF DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY GAINS BETWEEN CIE AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR OTHER MEMBERS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S CONSOLIDATED GROUP RESULTED IN THE REALIZATION OF A GAIN FOR CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE WSOP ASSETS THAT CIE ACQUIRED FROM CEOC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. 
 AFTER ITS DECONSOLIDATION FROM CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S CONSOLIDATED GROUP, CIE IS THE PARENT OF A NEW CONSOLIDATED GROUP FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT BETWEEN CIE AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT (THE "TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT"), HOWEVER, CIE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT IN RESPECT OF TAXES OWED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE DATE CIE BECAME DECONSOLIDATED. IN ADDITION, UNDER U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, EACH MEMBER OF A CONSOLIDATED GROUP IS LIABLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP S ENTIRE TAX OBLIGATION. THEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THAT CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, OR OTHER MEMBERS OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S CONSOLIDATED GROUP, FAIL TO MAKE ANY U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERIODS DURING WHICH CIE WAS A MEMBER OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S CONSOLIDATED GROUP, CIE COULD BE LIABLE FOR THE SHORTFALL. SIMILAR PRINCIPLES MAY APPLY FOR FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES WHERE CIE FILED COMBINED, CONSOLIDATED OR UNITARY RETURNS WITH CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. 
 RISKS RELATED TO CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS 
 CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING RESULTING FROM DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY, THE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FINANCING. 
 CHANGES IN DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES ARE DRIVEN BY FACTORS BEYOND CGP LLC'S CONTROL, SUCH AS PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; HIGH ENERGY, FUEL AND OTHER COMMODITY COSTS; THE COST OF TRAVEL; THE POTENTIAL FOR BANK FAILURES; A SOFT JOB MARKET; AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED DECREASE IN DISPOSABLE CONSUMER INCOME AND WEALTH; FEARS OF RECESSION AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER GLOBAL EVENTS. CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY SUCH CHANGES BECAUSE PLANET HOLLYWOOD OFFERS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE WILL OFFER, A HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY SET OF ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND AMENITIES. IF DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING DECLINES, THEN CGP LLC'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. 
 THE CONTINUING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE LOCAL, REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL MARKETS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED CGP LLC AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT CGP LLC IN THE FUTURE. DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC CONTRACTION, CGP LLC'S REVENUES MAY DECREASE WHILE SOME OF ITS COSTS REMAIN FIXED OR EVEN INCREASE, RESULTING IN DECREASED EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, CGP LLC MAY ALSO BE UNABLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS TO OFFSET ANY DECREASE IN REVENUES. EVEN AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING IN CGP LLC'S GAMING OPERATIONS AND RELATED FACILITIES, AS CONSUMERS SPEND LESS IN ANTICIPATION OF A POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. 
 THEORETICAL WIN RATES FOR CGP LLC'S CASINO OPERATIONS DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. 
 THE GAMING INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN ELEMENT OF CHANCE. ACCORDINGLY, PLANET HOLLYWOOD EMPLOYS, AND THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE WILL EMPLOY, THEORETICAL WIN RATES TO ESTIMATE WHAT A CERTAIN TYPE OF GAME, ON AVERAGE, WILL WIN OR LOSE IN THE LONG RUN. IN ADDITION TO THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE, THEORETICAL WIN RATES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE SPREAD OF TABLE LIMITS AND FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND CGP LLC'S CONTROL, SUCH AS A PLAYER S SKILL AND EXPERIENCE AND BEHAVIOR, THE MIX OF GAMES PLAYED, THE FINANCIAL 
 33 

RESOURCES OF PLAYERS, THE VOLUME OF BETS PLACED AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME PLAYERS SPEND GAMBLING. AS A RESULT OF THE VARIABILITY IN THESE FACTORS, THE ACTUAL WIN RATES AT THE CASINO MAY DIFFER FROM THE THEORETICAL WIN RATES AND COULD RESULT IN THE WINNINGS OF CGP LLC'S GAMING CUSTOMERS EXCEEDING THOSE ANTICIPATED. THE VARIABILITY OF THESE FACTORS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ACTUAL WIN RATES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 CGP LLC'S CASINO OPERATIONS EXTEND CREDIT TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT GAMING RECEIVABLES FROM ITS CREDIT PLAYERS. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD CONDUCTS, AND HORSESHOE BALTIMORE IS EXPECTED TO CONDUCT, ITS GAMING ACTIVITIES ON A CREDIT BASIS AS WELL AS A CASH BASIS, WHICH CREDIT IS UNSECURED. TABLE GAMES PLAYERS TYPICALLY ARE EXTENDED MORE CREDIT THAN SLOT PLAYERS, AND HIGH STAKES PLAYERS ARE TYPICALLY EXTENDED MORE CREDIT THAN PATRONS WHO TEND TO WAGER LOWER AMOUNTS. HIGH-END GAMING IS MORE VOLATILE THAN OTHER FORMS OF GAMING, AND VARIANCES IN WIN-LOSS RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGH-END GAMING MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD EXTENDS CREDIT TO THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE LEVEL OF PLAY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES WARRANT, IN THE OPINION OF PLANET HOLLYWOOD S MANAGEMENT, AN EXTENSION OF CREDIT. THESE RECEIVABLES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IF DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. 
 WE FACE THE RISK OF FRAUD AND CHEATING. 
 CASINO GAMING CUSTOMERS MAY ATTEMPT OR COMMIT FRAUD OR CHEAT IN ORDER TO INCREASE WINNINGS. ACTS OF FRAUD OR CHEATING COULD INVOLVE THE USE OF COUNTERFEIT CHIPS OR OTHER TACTICS, POSSIBLY IN COLLUSION WITH THE EMPLOYEES OF CGP LLC'S CASINOS. INTERNAL ACTS OF CHEATING COULD ALSO BE CONDUCTED BY EMPLOYEES THROUGH COLLUSION WITH DEALERS, SURVEILLANCE STAFF, FLOOR MANAGERS OR OTHER CASINO OR GAMING AREA STAFF. FAILURE TO DISCOVER SUCH ACTS OR SCHEMES IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD RESULT IN LOSSES IN GAMING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY RELATED TO SUCH SCHEMES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S REPUTATION, POTENTIALLY CAUSING A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLCS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE AGAINST OUR COMPETITORS, OUR PROFITS WILL DECLINE. 
 THE GAMING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CGP LLC'S COMPETITORS VARY CONSIDERABLY IN SIZE, QUALITY OF FACILITIES, NUMBER OF OPERATIONS, BRAND IDENTITIES, MARKETING AND GROWTH STRATEGIES, FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CAPABILITIES, AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. CGP LLC ALSO COMPETES WITH OTHER NON-GAMING RESORTS AND VACATION AREAS, AND WITH VARIOUS OTHER ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES. COMPETITORS IN EACH MARKET THAT WE PARTICIPATE MAY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, OR OTHER RESOURCES THAN CGP LLC DO, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT ENGAGE IN AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTION TO COMPETE WITH CGP LLC. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE CGP LLC IS CURRENTLY ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE, WE CANNOT ENSURE THAT CGP LLC WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO OR THAT THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING OR FURTHER INCREASING THEIR CURRENT MARKET SHARE. CGP LLC'S FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THEIR VARIOUS MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOW. 
 IN RECENT YEARS, MANY CASINO OPERATORS HAVE BEEN REINVESTING IN EXISTING MARKETS TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS OR TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, THEREBY INCREASING COMPETITION IN THOSE MARKETS. AS COMPANIES HAVE COMPLETED NEW EXPANSION PROJECTS, SUPPLY HAS TYPICALLY GROWN AT A FASTER PACE THAN DEMAND IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING LAS VEGAS, CGP LLC'S LARGEST MARKET, AND COMPETITION HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, CITYCENTER, A LARGE DEVELOPMENT OF RESORTS AND RESIDENCES, OPENED IN DECEMBER 2009, SLS LAS VEGAS, A 1,600 ROOM HOTEL AND CASINO, IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN FALL 2014 ON THE NORTHERN END OF THE STRIP NEAR CIRCUS CIRCUS, AND THE GENTING GROUP HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DEVELOP A 3,500 ROOM HOTEL AND 175,000 SQUARE FOOT CASINO CALLED RESORTS WORLD LAS VEGAS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN 2016 ON THE NORTHERN END OF THE STRIP NEAR CIRCUS CIRCUS. ALSO, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING TRENDS, LAS VEGAS OPERATORS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THEIR NON-GAMING OFFERINGS, INCLUDING UPGRADES TO HOTEL ROOMS, NEW FOOD AND BEVERAGE OFFERINGS, AND NEW ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS. MGM HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR THE PARK, WHICH INCLUDES A NEW RETAIL AND DINING DEVELOPMENT ON THE LAND BETWEEN NEW YORK-NEW YORK AND MONTE CARLO, A RENOVATION OF THE STRIP-FRONT FACADES OF BOTH RESORTS AND A NEW 20,000 SEAT INDOOR ARENA FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS OPERATED BY AEG. CONSTRUCTION OF THE PARK IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE IN 2014, WITH THE ARENA EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE IN 2016. ADDITIONALLY, SKYVUE, A PROPOSED 500-FOOT OBSERVATION WHEEL, HAS BEEN IN CONSTRUCTION SINCE 2012. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN PROPOSALS FOR OTHER LARGE SCALE NON-GAMING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN LAS VEGAS BY VARIOUS OTHER DEVELOPERS, INCLUDING OTHER ARENAS, OBSERVATION WHEELS AND A ROLLER COASTER, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO DETAILS AS TO WHEN OR IF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE COMPLETE. THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING CASINO ENTERTAINMENT PROPERTIES, THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES AND THE AGGRESSIVE MARKETING STRATEGIES OF MANY OF CGP LLC'S COMPETITORS HAVE INCREASED COMPETITION IN MANY MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND THIS INTENSE COMPETITION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT CGP LLC'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 
 IN ADDITION, IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION, EXISTING CASINO RESORTS PROVIDE A NUMBER OF GAMING OPTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS, THEREBY CREATING SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FOR HORSESHOE BALTIMORE. THE CASINO RESORTS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER ON THE BASIS OF OVERALL ATMOSPHERE, RANGE OF AMENITIES, LEVEL OF SERVICE, PRICE, LOCATION, ENTERTAINMENT OFFERED AND SIZE. 
 34 

FURTHER, THE CASINO RESORT THAT WILL OPEN WITH THE SIXTH LICENSE IN PRINCE GEORGE S COUNTY GRANTED BY THE STATE OF MARYLAND MAY DRAW ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS AWAY FROM HORSESHOE BALTIMORE. IF HORSESHOE BALTIMORE IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH OTHER REGIONAL CASINO RESORTS OR KEEP CUSTOMERS, THIS INABILITY MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT HORSESHOE BALTIMORE S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. 
 CGP LLC'S CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. 
 THE CASINO PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENTS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES WHICH GOVERN ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS THAT MAY HAVE ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS, SUCH AS EMISSIONS TO AIR, DISCHARGES TO STREAMS AND RIVERS AND RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS HANDLING AND DISPOSAL FROM MUNICIPAL/NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE, AND WHICH ALSO APPLY TO CURRENT AND PREVIOUS OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF REAL ESTATE GENERALLY. FEDERAL EXAMPLES OF THESE LAWS INCLUDE THE CLEAN AIR ACT, THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION RECOVERY ACT, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT AND THE OIL POLLUTION ACT OF 1990. CERTAIN OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS MAY IMPOSE CLEANUP RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR OPERATOR KNEW OF OR CAUSED PARTICULAR CONTAMINATION OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. SHOULD UNKNOWN CONTAMINATION BE DISCOVERED ON CGP LLC'S PROPERTY, OR SHOULD A RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OCCUR ON CGP LLC'S PROPERTY, CGP LLC COULD BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP THE CONTAMINATION AND COULD ALSO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR THIRD PARTIES FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY OR INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTAMINATION OR RELEASE, WHICH MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. MOREOVER, SUCH CONTAMINATION MAY ALSO IMPAIR CGP LLC'S ABILITY TO USE THE AFFECTED PROPERTY. SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE JOINT AND SEVERAL IN NATURE, REGARDLESS OF FAULT, AND COULD AFFECT CGP LLC EVEN IF SUCH PROPERTY IS VACATED. THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND AN INABILITY TO USE THE PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 CGP LLC'S INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL POSSIBLE LOSSES IT COULD SUFFER, AND, IN THE FUTURE, ITS INSURANCE COSTS MAY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY OR IT MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD OR HORSESHOE BALTIMORE MAY SUFFER DAMAGE TO ITS PROPERTY CAUSED BY A CASUALTY LOSS (SUCH AS FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS AND ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM) THAT COULD SEVERELY DISRUPT ITS BUSINESS OR SUBJECT IT TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE INJURED OR HARMED. ALTHOUGH CGP LLC MAINTAINS INSURANCE (INCLUDING PROPERTY, CASUALTY, TERRORISM AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE), THAT INSURANCE MAY BE INADEQUATE OR UNAVAILABLE TO COVER ALL OF THE RISKS TO WHICH ITS BUSINESS AND ASSETS MAY BE EXPOSED. SHOULD AN UNINSURED LOSS OR LOSS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON CGP LLC S OPERATIONS AND REVENUES. 
 CGP LLC RENEWS ITS INSURANCE POLICIES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE COST OF COVERAGE BECOMES TOO HIGH, CGP LLC MAY NEED TO REDUCE ITS POLICY LIMITS OR AGREE TO CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS FROM ITS COVERAGE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE PREMIUMS TO AN ACCEPTABLE AMOUNT. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HOMELAND SECURITY CONCERNS, OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR ANY CHANGE IN THE CURRENT U.S. STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT INSURANCE CARRIERS OFFER COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND RESULT IN INCREASED PREMIUMS ON AVAILABLE COVERAGE (WHICH MAY CAUSE CGP LLC TO ELECT TO REDUCE ITS POLICY LIMITS) AND ADDITIONAL EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE. AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL FUTURE ADVERSE CHANGES, IN THE FUTURE CGP LLC MAY ELECT TO NOT, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO, OBTAIN ANY COVERAGE FOR LOSSES DUE TO ACTS OF TERRORISM. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD LICENSES THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BRAND FROM AFFILIATES OF ROBERT EARL AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BRAND WOULD NOT BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS USE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. 
 AFFILIATES OF ROBERT EARL LICENSE CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATING TO THE OPERATION OF THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD RESORT AND CASINO TO PLANET HOLLYWOOD. THE LICENSE INCLUDES CERTAIN NAMES AND TRADEMARKS AND THE RIGHT TO DISPLAY CERTAIN MEMORABILIA ON THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD PREMISES. PLANET HOLLYWOOD HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND FINANCING TO ESTABLISH ITS BRAND AS A HOLLYWOOD-THEMED ENTERTAINMENT AND NON-GAMING DESTINATION. THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION, OR MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS, OF THIS LICENSE MAY HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANET HOLLYWOOD S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND OPERATIONS RESULTS. 
 IN ADDITION, THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BRAND IS USED BY AFFILIATES OF ROBERT EARL IN HOLLYWOOD-THEMED RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. ANY NEGATIVE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD BRAND WITH THESE RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS MAY BE OUT OF CGP LLC'S CONTROL, AND MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE BRAND S IMAGE FOR THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD CASINO, WHICH COULD HARM PLANET HOLLYWOOD S, THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE SUCCESS OF THIRD PARTIES ADJACENT TO PLANET HOLLYWOOD ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND ANY DETERIORATION TO THEIR SUCCESS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATIONS. 
 PLANET HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT OWN THE BUSINESSES AND AMENITIES ADJACENT TO ITS PROPERTY SUCH AS THE MIRACLE MILE SHOPS AND THE HOTEL TOWER AND TIMESHARE FACILITY OPERATED BY HILTON GRAND VACATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE ADJACENT THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES AND AMENITIES STIMULATE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC THROUGH THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD COMPLEX, INCLUDING THE CASINO, WHICH IS PLANET HOLLYWOOD S LARGEST GENERATOR OF REVENUE. ANY DECREASE IN THE POPULARITY OF, OR THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS VISITING, THESE ADJACENT 
 35 

BUSINESSES AND AMENITIES MAY LEAD TO A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN THE TRAFFIC THROUGH PLANET HOLLYWOOD COMPLEX, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT PLANET HOLLYWOOD S, AND THEREFORE CGP LLC'S, BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HORSESHOE BALTIMORE CASINO, INCLUDING A DELAY IN CONSTRUCTION AND ULTIMATELY THE OPENING OF THE CASINO AND POSSIBLE ABANDONMENT OF THE PROJECT. 
 WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE HORSESHOE BALTIMORE CASINO. A WAS FILED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, MARYLAND ON FEBRUARY 20, 2013 CHALLENGING THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT S ("MDE") APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO A CLEANUP PLAN, KNOWN AS A RESPONSE ACTION PLAN ("RAP"), TO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION AT THE CASINO PROPERTY (THE "RAP LITIGATION"). THE RAP LITIGATION SEEKS TO VACATE THE EXISTING RAP FOR THE SITE WHICH IS REQUIRED AS PART OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN MDE S VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAM ("VCP"). THIS CASE WAS DISMISSED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY ON NOVEMBER 6, 2013 AND AN APPEAL WAS NOTED ON DECEMBER 6, 2013. THE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A CITIZEN SUIT ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2013 IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DIVISION OF MARYLAND UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT ("RCRA"), ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF RCRA AND THE EXISTENCE OF CONDITIONS WHICH CREATE AN IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. A THIRD COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 1, 2013 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DIVISION OF MARYLAND. THIS ACTION ASSERTS CLAIMS SIMILAR TO THOSE ALLEGED IN THE STATE COURT ACTION AND OTHER FEDERAL CAUSES OF ACTION INCLUDING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS CIVIL RIGHTS AND ATTEMPTS TO HALT CONSTRUCTION BASED ON ALLEGED DEFECTS IN THE RAP. FINALLY, COMPLAINTS WERE FILED ON MAY 20, 2013 AND JULY 23, 2013 RESPECTIVELY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURT AGAINST THE CITY OF BALTIMORE ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF WATER POLLUTION CONTROL LAWS DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION PRESENT AT THE PROPERTY. THESE COMPLAINTS WERE DISMISSED ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2013 AND JANUARY 7, 2014, RESPECTIVELY. 
 CHALLENGES TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS ISSUED BY THE MDE WERE THREATENED BUT NEVER FILED. CHALLENGES TO CONSTRUCTION AND ZONING APPROVALS AND PERMITS ISSUED BY THE CITY OF BALTIMORE WERE FILED BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. 
 NONE OF THE APPROVALS OR PERMITS WE OBTAINED HAVE BEEN RESCINDED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FORM 10-K. THE TIME FOR CHALLENGING MDE S APPROVAL OF CBAC S MODIFIED FLOODPLAIN PERMIT EXPIRED WITHOUT A CHALLENGE BEING FILED. NO RIGHTS OF APPEAL ARE PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PERMITS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY MDE TO CBAC. ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES TO BALTIMORE CITY GRADING PERMITS AND ZONING APPROVALS WERE FILED AND RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR BY THE CITY. NO APPEAL WAS FILED WITH REGARD TO THE GRADING PERMITS AND THE APPEAL PERIOD HAS LAPSED. THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF MUNICIPAL ZONING APPEALS TO GRANT VARIANCES FOR THE SITE WAS APPEALED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY BY SEPARATE PARTIES ON JUNE 20 AND 24, 2013. THE CIRCUIT COURT DISMISSED THOSE APPEALS ON OCTOBER 11, 2013 AND THE CHALLENGERS DID NOT APPEAL THE CIRCUIT COURT'S DECISION. 
 DEVELOPING THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE WITH OTHER EQUITY PARTNERS ADDS ADDITIONAL RISK THAT MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 CGP LLC INDIRECTLY HOLDS APPROXIMATELY 51.8 INTEREST IN THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE. WHILE CGP LLC CAN INFLUENCE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE THROUGH ITS EQUITY OWNERSHIP, CGP LLC WILL RELY ON THE OTHER EQUITY PARTNERS FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE OTHER EQUITY PARTNERS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING, OR ANY FUNDING AT ALL. THE FAILURE OF OTHER EQUITY PARTNERS IN THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FUNDING MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CGP LLC'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CVPR SALE, CGP LLC'S EQUITY CONTRIBUTION AND INDIRECT OWNERSHIP IN THE MARYLAND JOINT VENTURE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 41.4 . SEE NOTE 19 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS CONTAINED IN THE CGP LLC AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN EXHIBIT 99.1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK 
 CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT'S CALL RIGHT ON OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY RESULT IN YOU BEING FORCED TO SELL OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AT A DISADVANTAGEOUS TIME AND WILL CAUSE YOU TO OWN STOCK OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. THIS CALL RIGHT MAY NOT OCCUR AT ALL DUE TO THE DISCRETION OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT OR THE INABILITY OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT TO MEET THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO EXERCISE SUCH RIGHT. 
 AFTER OCTOBER 21, 2016, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL HAVE THE RIGHT, WHICH IT MAY ASSIGN TO ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR TO ANY TRANSFEREE OF ALL NON-VOTING UNITS OF CGP LLC HELD BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, TO ACQUIRE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE VOTING UNITS OF CGP LLC (OR, AT OUR OPTION, SHARES OF CAC S CLASS A COMMON STOCK) NOT OTHERWISE OWNED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AT SUCH TIME. AS A RESULT, YOU MAY BE FORCED TO SELL YOUR SHARES OF CAC S CLASS A COMMON STOCK ON LITTLE NOTICE AND AT A VALUE THAT MAY CAUSE YOU TO REALIZE A LOSS. THE EXERCISE OF THIS RIGHT BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL RESULT IN YOU RECEIVING CONSIDERATION ENTIRELY OR PARTLY IN THE FORM OF STOCK OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH MAY BE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IF THE EXCHANGE IS NOT A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION, YOU MAY RECOGNIZE GAIN OR LOSS FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES ON SUCH EXCHANGE DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT YOU RECEIVE IN SUCH EXCHANGE AND THE ADJUSTED TAX BASIS OF YOUR SHARES OF CAC S CLASS A COMMON STOCK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE STOCK OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT WILL MAINTAIN ITS VALUE FROM THE TIME OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S 
 36 

EXERCISE OF THE CALL RIGHT OR BE PART OF AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET. AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU MAY BE FORCED TO DISPOSE OF THE STOCK OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AT A GREAT LOSS. 
 IN ADDITION, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY EXERCISE THE CALL RIGHT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY DECIDE TO NOT EXERCISE THE CALL RIGHT FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER. MOREOVER, IF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, IT WILL BE UNABLE TO EXERCISE THE CALL RIGHT. THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING OF THE EXERCISE OF THE CALL RIGHT, IF AT ALL, BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TRADING VALUE OF OUR STOCK. SEE ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE . 
 CGP LLC IS REQUIRED TO BE LIQUIDATED ON APRIL 21, 2022, WHICH MAY RESULT IN YOU RECEIVING LESS THAN THE FULL VALUE OF YOUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 FOLLOWING OCTOBER 21, 2018 AND UNTIL APRIL 21, 2022, OUR BOARD WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE A LIQUIDATION OF CGP LLC, INCLUDING THE SALE OR WINDING UP OF CGP LLC OR OTHER MONETIZATION OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS. ON APRIL 21, 2022 (UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND CAC), IF OUR BOARD HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXERCISED ITS LIQUIDATION RIGHT, CGP LLC SHALL, AND OUR BOARD SHALL CAUSE CGP LLC TO, EFFECT A LIQUIDATION. BECAUSE THE LIQUIDATION WILL OCCUR ON A SET SCHEDULE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REGULATIONS OR MARKET FACTORS AT THE TIME OF LIQUIDATION MAY IMPEDE THE ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE THE ASSETS OF CGP LLC. IF CGP LLC IS UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE PORTIONS OF ITS ASSETS, PROCEEDS FROM THE LIQUIDATION WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. MOREOVER, THE FORCED LIQUIDATION DOES NOT PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF CGP LLC S ASSETS IN A SALE BY WAITING FOR AN ADVANTAGEOUS TIME. IN ADDITION, CAC S ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE GAIN (IF ANY) ON THE LIQUIDATION OF THE ASSETS OF CGP LLC WILL GENERALLY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT THE REGULAR CORPORATE RATE. AS A RESULT, YOU MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN THE FULL VALUE OF YOUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK SHOULD LIQUIDATION OCCUR ON APRIL 21, 2022. 
 AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP. 
 PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE RIGHTS OFFERING AND OUR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET ON NOVEMBER 19, 2013, THERE HAD NOT BEEN A PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH INVESTOR INTEREST IN US WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET OR HOW LIQUID THAT MARKET MIGHT BECOME. THE SPONSORS OWN APPROXIMATELY 66.3 OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND WHILE THE SHARES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE, CURRENTLY SUCH SHARES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC MARKET. AS A RESULT, OUR SHARES MAY BE LESS LIQUID THAN THE SHARES OF OTHER NEWLY PUBLIC COMPANIES OR OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES GENERALLY AND THERE MAY BE IMBALANCES BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR OUR SHARES. AS A RESULT OUR SHARE PRICE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VALUE OF OUR EXPECTED PERFORMANCE. IF AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET DOES NOT DEVELOP, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT YOU BUY. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AT PRICES EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE PRICE YOU PAID. 
 FUTURE SALES OR THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY DEPRESS THE PRICE OF SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 FUTURE SALES OR THE AVAILABILITY FOR SALE OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 
 ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE UNDER RULE 144 OR RULE 701 OF THE SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT TO VOLUME LIMITATIONS, APPLICABLE HOLDING PERIOD REQUIREMENTS AND THE LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO CERTAIN OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SIZE OF FUTURE ISSUANCES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES OR THE EFFECT, IF ANY, THAT FUTURE ISSUANCES AND SALES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES, INCLUDING FUTURE SALES BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, WILL HAVE ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION), OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH SALES COULD OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 THE PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 
 THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE TRADING VOLUME OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PRICE VARIATIONS TO OCCUR. VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY PREVENT YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR YOUR SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK. THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING: 
 
 OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS; 
 
 OUR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL EARNINGS OR THOSE OF OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY; 
 37 

CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CGP LLC'S BUSINESSES; 
 
 THE PUBLIC'S REACTION TO OUR PRESS RELEASES, OTHER PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS AND FILINGS WITH THE SEC; 
 
 CHANGES IN EARNINGS ESTIMATES OR RECOMMENDATIONS BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS WHO TRACK OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK; 
 
 MARKET AND INDUSTRY PERCEPTION OF OUR SUCCESS, OR LACK THEREOF, IN PURSUING OUR GROWTH STRATEGY; 
 
 STRATEGIC ACTIONS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS OR RESTRUCTURINGS; 
 
 CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION, INCLUDING GAMING TAXES; 
 
 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, POLICIES, GUIDANCE, INTERPRETATIONS OR PRINCIPLES; 
 
 ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF KEY PERSONNEL; 
 
 THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR SHARES THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED; 
 
 CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE; 
 
 INCREASES IN MARKET INTERESTS RATES THAT WOULD DECREASE THE VALUE OF CGP LLC'S FIXED-RATE SECURITIES; 
 
 CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE OF, OR A RESTRUCTURING OF, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT; 
 
 SALES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK BY US OR AFFILIATES OF THE SPONSORS; 
 
 THE EXPIRATION OF CONTRACTUAL LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS; AND 
 
 CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES OR FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, ACTS OF WAR AND RESPONSES TO SUCH EVENTS. 
 IN ADDITION, IN RECENT YEARS, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS. THIS VOLATILITY HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY MANY COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMPANIES IN THE GAMING, LODGING, HOSPITALITY AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES. THE CHANGES FREQUENTLY APPEAR TO OCCUR WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE AFFECTED COMPANIES. HENCE, THE PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK COULD FLUCTUATE BASED UPON FACTORS THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO WITH US, AND THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR SHARE PRICE. 
 HAMLET HOLDINGS CONTROLS US AND THEIR INTERESTS MAY CONFLICT WITH OR DIFFER FROM YOUR INTERESTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. 
 HAMLET HOLDINGS BENEFICIALLY OWNS APPROXIMATELY 66.3 OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. HAMLET HOLDINGS HAS THE POWER TO CONTROL OUR BOARD. MOREOVER, HAMLET HOLDINGS HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON ANY TRANSACTION THAT REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD OR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS MERGERS AND THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, HAMLET HOLDINGS, THE MEMBERS OF WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THREE INDIVIDUALS AFFILIATED WITH APOLLO AND TWO INDIVIDUALS AFFILIATED WITH TPG, AS OF THE DATE HEREOF BENEFICIALLY OWN APPROXIMATELY 63.9 OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT S COMMON STOCK AND CONTROLS CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT. AS A RESULT, EVEN THOUGH AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY MAKE DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CGP LLC, HAMLET HOLDINGS IS IN A POSITION TO EXERT A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BOTH OF CAC AND CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT AND THE DIRECTION OF THEIR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. 
 THE INTERESTS OF HAMLET HOLDINGS AND THE SPONSORS COULD CONFLICT WITH OR DIFFER FROM THE INTERESTS OF HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. AFFILIATES OF THE SPONSORS ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING OR ADVISING ON INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THEY HOLD, AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE ACQUIRE INTERESTS IN OR PROVIDE ADVICE TO BUSINESSES THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COMPETE WITH CERTAIN PORTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS OR ARE SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS OF OURS OR MAY PURSUE ACQUISITIONS THAT MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS, IN WHICH CASE AND, AS A RESULT, THOSE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US. 
 THE CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP HELD BY HAMLET HOLDINGS COULD DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF US OR IMPEDE A MERGER, TAKEOVER OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION WHICH ANOTHER STOCKHOLDER MAY OTHERWISE VIEW FAVORABLY. IN ADDITION, A SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK IN THE FUTURE BY HAMLET HOLDINGS COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. SO LONG AS HAMLET HOLDINGS CONTINUES TO BENEFICIALLY OWN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, HAMLET HOLDINGS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO STRONGLY INFLUENCE OR EFFECTIVELY CONTROL OUR DECISIONS. 
 OUR STOCKHOLDERS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND IF A STOCKHOLDER IS FOUND UNSUITABLE BY THE GAMING AUTHORITY, THAT STOCKHOLDER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFICIALLY OWN OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AND WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REDEEM THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK OF SUCH DISQUALIFIED HOLDER. 
 IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, GAMING LAWS CAN REQUIRE ANY OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO FILE AN APPLICATION, BE INVESTIGATED AND QUALIFY OR HAVE HIS, HER OR ITS SUITABILITY DETERMINED BY GAMING AUTHORITIES. GAMING AUTHORITIES HAVE VERY BROAD DISCRETION IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN APPLICANT SHOULD BE DEEMED SUITABLE. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, THE 
 38 

GAMING REGULATORS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DENY ANY APPLICATION OR LIMIT, CONDITION, RESTRICT, REVOKE OR SUSPEND ANY LICENSE, REGISTRATION, FINDING OF SUITABILITY OR APPROVAL, OR FINE ANY PERSON LICENSED, REGISTERED OR FOUND SUITABLE OR APPROVED, FOR ANY CAUSE DEEMED REASONABLE BY THE GAMING AUTHORITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE CRITERIA USED IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS REGARDING SUITABILITY, SEE " GAMING REGULATION OVERVIEW " IN EXHIBIT 99.2 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. 
 FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER NEVADA GAMING LAWS, EACH PERSON WHO ACQUIRES, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF ANY VOTING SECURITY, OR BENEFICIAL OR RECORD OWNERSHIP OF ANY NON-VOTING SECURITY OR ANY DEBT SECURITY, IN A PUBLIC CORPORATION WHICH IS REGISTERED WITH THE NEVADA GAMING COMMISSION, OR THE GAMING COMMISSION, MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE FOUND SUITABLE IF THE GAMING COMMISSION HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS OR HER ACQUISITION OF THAT OWNERSHIP, OR HIS OR HER CONTINUED OWNERSHIP IN GENERAL, WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE DECLARED PUBLIC POLICY OF NEVADA, IN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE GAMING COMMISSION. ANY PERSON REQUIRED BY THE GAMING COMMISSION TO BE FOUND SUITABLE SHALL APPLY FOR A FINDING OF SUITABILITY WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE GAMING COMMISSION'S REQUEST THAT HE OR SHE SHOULD DO SO AND, TOGETHER WITH HIS OR HER APPLICATION FOR SUITABILITY, DEPOSIT WITH THE NEVADA GAMING CONTROL BOARD A SUM OF MONEY WHICH, IN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE CONTROL BOARD, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO PAY THE ANTICIPATED COSTS AND CHARGES INCURRED IN THE INVESTIGATION AND PROCESSING OF THAT APPLICATION FOR SUITABILITY, AND DEPOSIT SUCH ADDITIONAL SUMS AS ARE REQUIRED BY THE CONTROL BOARD TO PAY FINAL COSTS AND CHARGES. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER OHIO LAW, AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR, WHICH IS BROADLY DEFINED AND INCLUDES ANY CORPORATION THAT HOLDS ANY AMOUNT OF OUR STOCK, WILL BE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR AND OBTAIN A WAIVER OF SUITABILITY DETERMINATION. 
 FURTHERMORE, ANY PERSON REQUIRED BY A GAMING AUTHORITY TO BE FOUND SUITABLE, WHO IS FOUND UNSUITABLE BY THE GAMING AUTHORITY, MAY NOT HOLD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF ANY VOTING SECURITY OR THE BENEFICIAL OR RECORD OWNERSHIP OF ANY NON-VOTING SECURITY OR ANY DEBT SECURITY OF ANY PUBLIC CORPORATION WHICH IS REGISTERED WITH THE GAMING AUTHORITY BEYOND THE TIME PRESCRIBED BY THE GAMING AUTHORITY. SUCH A FINDING COULD RESULT IN AN OWNER OF OUR SECURITIES BEING REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF THEIR SECURITIES AT PRICES LESS THAN THE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH SECURITIES. A VIOLATION OF THE FOREGOING MAY CONSTITUTE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. A FINDING OF UNSUITABILITY BY A PARTICULAR GAMING AUTHORITY IMPACTS THAT PERSON S ABILITY TO ASSOCIATE OR AFFILIATE WITH GAMING LICENSEES IN THAT PARTICULAR JURISDICTION AND COULD IMPACT THE PERSON S ABILITY TO ASSOCIATE OR AFFILIATE WITH GAMING LICENSEES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS PROVISIONS ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT TO REDEEM OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK HELD BY DISQUALIFIED HOLDERS IF SUCH HOLDER IS DETERMINED BY ANY GAMING REGULATORY AGENCY TO BE UNSUITABLE. 
 MANY JURISDICTIONS ALSO REQUIRE ANY PERSON WHO ACQUIRES BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF VOTING SECURITIES OF A GAMING COMPANY AND, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, NON-VOTING SECURITIES, TYPICALLY 5 , TO REPORT THE ACQUISITION TO GAMING AUTHORITIES, AND GAMING AUTHORITIES MAY REQUIRE SUCH HOLDERS TO APPLY FOR QUALIFICATION OR A FINDING OF SUITABILITY, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS FOR "INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS" THAT HOLD A COMPANY S VOTING SECURITIES FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY. UNDER MARYLAND GAMING LAWS, WE MAY NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER MORE THAN 5 OF THE LEGAL OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN HORSESHOE BALTIMORE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE MARYLAND LOTTERY AND GAMING CONTROL COMMISSION, OR THE MARYLAND COMMISSION, AFTER THE MARYLAND COMMISSION DETERMINES THAT THE TRANSFEREE IS QUALIFIED OR GRANTS THE TRANSFEREE AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR WAIVER. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF GAMING LICENSES IN WHICH A PERSON MAY HOLD AN OWNERSHIP OR A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND IN MARYLAND AN INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS ENTITY MAY NOT OWN AN INTEREST IN MORE THAN ONE VIDEO LOTTERY FACILITY. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH PROHIBITIONS WILL APPLY TO ONLINE REAL MONEY GAMING OPERATIONS WHEN AND IF SUCH OPERATIONS BECOME LEGAL IN U.S. JURISDICTIONS OTHER THAN NEVADA, NEW JERSEY, AND DELAWARE. 
 YOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN US MAY BE DILUTED IN THE FUTURE. 
 YOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN CAC MAY BE DILUTED IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF EQUITY AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED TO OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE FUTURE. WE MAY DECIDE TO ESTABLISH EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE GRANT OF COMMON STOCK-BASED EQUITY AWARDS TO OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY ISSUE EQUITY IN ORDER TO RAISE CAPITAL OR IN CONNECTION WITH FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD DILUTE YOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. 
 BECAUSE WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS ON OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
 WE HAVE NO PRESENT PLANS TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, INTEND TO RETAIN ALL OF OUR EARNINGS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS. THE DECLARATION OF ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS BY US IS WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD AND WILL BE DEPENDENT ON OUR EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY OUR BOARD. 
 39 

WE ARE A "CONTROLLED COMPANY" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE NASDAQ MARKETPLACE RULES AND, AS A RESULT, WILL QUALIFY FOR, AND INTEND TO RELY ON, EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
 HAMLET HOLDINGS CONTROLS A MAJORITY OF OUR VOTING CLASS A COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, WE ARE A "CONTROLLED COMPANY" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS. UNDER THE NASDAQ MARKETPLACE RULES, A COMPANY OF WHICH MORE THAN 50 OF THE VOTING POWER IS HELD BY AN INDIVIDUAL, GROUP OR ANOTHER COMPANY IS A "CONTROLLED COMPANY" AND MAY ELECT NOT TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING: 
 
 THE REQUIREMENT THAT A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD CONSISTS OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS; 
 
 THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE A NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE THAT IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS; 
 
 THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE A COMPENSATION COMMITTEE THAT IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS; AND 
 
 THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEES. 
 WE INTEND TO UTILIZE THESE EXEMPTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE WILL NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS NOR WILL OUR NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEES CONSIST ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEES. ACCORDINGLY, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
 WE ARE AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" AND OUR POSSIBLE ELECTION TO DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO PUBLIC COMPANIES MAY RESULT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOT BEING COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS AND OTHER REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES, OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. 
 WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY, AS DEFINED IN THE JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT OF 2012 (THE "JOBS ACT"), AND WE INTEND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM VARIOUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES," INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NOT BEING REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE AUDITOR ATTESTATION REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (THE "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT"), REDUCED DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS AND PROXY STATEMENTS, AND EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOLDING A NONBINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF ANY GOLDEN PARACHUTE PAYMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. IN ADDITION, SECTION 107 OF THE JOBS ACT PROVIDES THAT AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXTENDED TRANSITION PERIOD PROVIDED IN SECTION 7(A)(2)(B) OF THE SECURITIES ACT FOR COMPLYING WITH NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SUCH THAT AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" CAN DELAY THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UNTIL THOSE STANDARDS WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY TO PRIVATE COMPANIES. 
 WE HAVE ELECTED TO DELAY SUCH ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ON THE RELEVANT DATES ON WHICH ADOPTION OF SUCH STANDARDS IS REQUIRED FOR NON-EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES. 
 WE MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE REPORTING EXEMPTIONS UNTIL WE ARE NO LONGER AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY." WE WILL REMAIN AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" UNTIL THE EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE LAST DAY OF THE FISCAL YEAR DURING WHICH OUR TOTAL ANNUAL GROSS REVENUES EQUAL OR EXCEED 1.0 BILLION, (II) THE LAST DAY OF THE FISCAL YEAR FOLLOWING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, (III) THE DATE ON WHICH WE HAVE, DURING THE PREVIOUS THREE-YEAR PERIOD, ISSUED MORE THAN 1.0 BILLION IN NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT OR (IV) THE DATE ON WHICH WE ARE DEEMED A "LARGE ACCELERATED FILER" UNDER RULE 12B-2 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. 
 WE CANNOT PREDICT IF INVESTORS WILL FIND OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE WE WILL RELY ON CERTAIN OF THESE EXEMPTIONS. IF SOME INVESTORS FIND OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE AS A RESULT, THERE MAY BE A LESS ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE MORE VOLATILE. 
 AS A RESULT OF OUR BECOMING A COMPANY WITH PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK, OUR EXPENSES AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN INCREASED AND WILL LIKELY FURTHER INCREASE PARTICULARLY AFTER WE ARE NO LONGER AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" AS DEFINED IN THE JOBS ACT. 
 AS A COMPANY WITH PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK, WE INCUR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE DID NOT INCUR AS A COMPANY WITHOUT A PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITY. IN ADDITION, OUR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE NEED TO CREATE OR REVISE THE ROLES AND DUTIES OF OUR BOARD COMMITTEES AND RETAIN A TRANSFER AGENT. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO HOLD AN ANNUAL MEETING FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH WILL REQUIRE US TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO PREPARE, PRINT AND MAIL A PROXY STATEMENT RELATING TO THE ANNUAL MEETING. 
 40 

IN ADDITION, CHANGING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INCLUDING THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT AND RELATED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE SEC AND THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT ("DODD-FRANK"), WHICH AMENDED THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, AMONG OTHER FEDERAL LAWS, ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES, INCREASING LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND MAKING SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME CONSUMING. DODD-FRANK, SIGNED INTO LAW ON JULY 21, 2010, EFFECTS COMPREHENSIVE CHANGES TO THE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND WILL SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY ADOPTED OR HOW DODD-FRANK AND SUCH REGULATIONS WILL IMPACT THE COST OF COMPLIANCE FOR A COMPANY WITH PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AND MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DODD-FRANK AND OTHER NEW AND PROPOSED RULES AND CANNOT PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE ADDITIONAL COSTS WE MAY INCUR OR THE TIMING OF SUCH COSTS. THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS, IN MANY CASES DUE TO THEIR LACK OF SPECIFICITY, AND, AS A RESULT, THEIR APPLICATION IN PRACTICE MAY EVOLVE OVER TIME AS NEW GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED BY REGULATORY AND GOVERNING BODIES. THIS COULD RESULT IN CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY REGARDING COMPLIANCE MATTERS AND HIGHER COSTS NECESSITATED BY ONGOING REVISIONS TO DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. WE INTEND TO INVEST RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS, AND THIS INVESTMENT MAY RESULT IN INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S TIME AND ATTENTION FROM REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES TO COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. IF OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS DIFFER FROM THE ACTIVITIES INTENDED BY REGULATORY OR GOVERNING BODIES DUE TO AMBIGUITIES RELATED TO PRACTICE, REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY INITIATE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT BEING A COMPANY WITH PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK AND THESE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS WILL MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT REDUCED COVERAGE OR INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER COSTS TO OBTAIN COVERAGE. THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD, PARTICULARLY TO SERVE ON OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND QUALIFIED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
 AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K, AS AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" AS DEFINED IN THE JOBS ACT, WE MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS FROM VARIOUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NOT BEING REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE AUDITOR ATTESTATION REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, REDUCED DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS AND PROXY STATEMENTS, AND EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOLDING A NONBINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF ANY GOLDEN PARACHUTE PAYMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED . WHEN THESE EXEMPTIONS CEASE TO APPLY, WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND DEVOTE INCREASED MANAGEMENT EFFORT TOWARD ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THEM. WE CANNOT PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL COSTS WE MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A PUBLIC COMPANY OR THE TIMING OF SUCH COSTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL, AND ANY UNCERTAINTY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND RETAIL ENVIRONMENT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY
TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE FURTHER THE AMOUNT OF OUR DIVIDENDS . WE PAID DIVIDENDS
TOTALING 0.20 PER SHARE DURING EACH OF 2014, 2013 AND 2012. HOWEVER, ANY DOWNTURN IN THE STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY, WEAKNESS IN CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR DIFFICULT RETAIL ENVIRONMENT MAY CAUSE US TO REDUCE OR SUSPEND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. 
 ANY VOLATILITY OR INSTABILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN NEW FINANCING OR TO REFINANCE EXISTING
INDEBTEDNESS . ANY INSTABILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT
FINANCING, TO ARRANGE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC FINANCING OR TO REFINANCE OUR EXISTING DEBT AS IT MATURES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE FORCED TO SEEK POTENTIALLY LESS ATTRACTIVE FINANCINGS,
INCLUDING EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ON TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FAVORABLE TO US. IN DOING SO, WE MAY BE COMPELLED TO DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS THAT COULD ALSO ADVERSELY REDUCE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 OUR PROPERTIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GROCERY-ANCHORED SHOPPING CENTERS. OUR PERFORMANCE THEREFORE IS LINKED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKET FOR
RETAIL SPACE GENERALLY . OUR PROPERTIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GROCERY-ANCHORED SHOPPING CENTERS, AND OUR
PERFORMANCE THEREFORE IS LINKED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKET FOR RETAIL SPACE GENERALLY. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS THAT AFFECT THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY, INCLUDING THE LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING, THE
WILLINGNESS OF RETAILERS TO LEASE SPACE IN OUR SHOPPING CENTERS, TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE IMPACT OF INTERNET SALES ON THE DEMAND FOR RETAIL SPACE, ONGOING CONSOLIDATION IN THE RETAIL SECTOR, AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONSUMER
CONFIDENCE. A DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND REDUCED CONSUMER SPENDING COULD IMPACT OUR TENANTS ABILITY TO MEET THEIR LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE TO POOR OPERATING RESULTS, LACK OF LIQUIDITY OR OTHER REASONS, AND THEREFORE DECREASE THE REVENUE
GENERATED BY OUR PROPERTIES AND/OR THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES. OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE AND NEGOTIATE AND MAINTAIN FAVORABLE RENTS COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY. MOREOVER, THE DEMAND FOR LEASING SPACE IN OUR
SHOPPING CENTERS COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE DURING A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY THAT COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR OCCUPANCY PERCENTAGE AND REDUCTION IN RENTAL REVENUES. ANY SUSTAINED LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT CAN BE
EXPECTED TO HAVE A SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMER SPENDING AND SALES BY TENANTS AT OUR SHOPPING CENTERS. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN
ENERGY COSTS IN THIS COUNTRY MAY CAUSE SHOPPERS TO RESTRICT THEIR TRIPS BY AUTOMOBILE TO SHOPPING CENTERS, REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF GASOLINE AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THE FUEL SERVICE STATIONS AT SEVERAL OF OUR PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS REDUCE THEIR
LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, ALL OF WHICH, IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AT OUR PROPERTIES.

 OUR PERFORMANCE AND VALUE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND WITH THE REAL ESTATE
INDUSTRY. OUR PERFORMANCE AND VALUE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND WITH THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY,
INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RISKS RELATED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAKE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE
SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO MEET OPERATING EXPENSES, FUTURE DEBT SERVICE AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS. EVENTS AND CONDITIONS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF REAL PROPERTY THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL MAY DECREASE CASH AVAILABLE FOR
DISTRIBUTION AND THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES. THESE EVENTS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDE, BUT MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: 

1. 
 LOCAL OVERSUPPLY, INCREASED COMPETITION OR DECLINING DEMAND FOR REAL ESTATE; 

2. 
 LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY PLANT CLOSINGS, BUSINESS LAYOFFS, INDUSTRY SLOW-DOWNS, WEATHER CONDITIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS;

3. 
 NON-PAYMENT OR DEFERRED PAYMENT OF RENT OR OTHER CHARGES BY TENANTS, EITHER AS A RESULT OF TENANT-SPECIFIC FINANCIAL ILLS, OR GENERAL ECONOMIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ADVERSELY AFFECTING CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME OR
CREDIT; 

4. 
 VACANCIES OR AN INABILITY TO RENT SPACE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS; 

5. 
 INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, INCLUDING REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE PREMIUMS, UTILITIES, AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE; 

6. 
 VOLATILITY AND/OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, OR THE NON-AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS IN GENERAL; 

7. 
 INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH CURRENT, NEW OR EXPANDED GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS; 

8. 
 THE RELATIVE ILLIQUIDITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS; 

9. 
 CHANGING MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS; 

10. 
 CHANGING TRAFFIC PATTERNS; AND 

11. 
 AN INABILITY TO REFINANCE MATURING DEBT IN ACCEPTABLE AMOUNTS AND/OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. THE LEVEL OF
OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ANY CONSTRAINTS ON CREDIT MAY IMPEDE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. 
 THE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS BY (1) REQUIRING US TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR
AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY TO PAY REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE AND/OR REPAYMENTS OR ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL RESERVES, WHICH WOULD REDUCE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS, (2) PLACING US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS
DEBT OR DEBT AT MORE FAVORABLE TERMS, (3) MAKING US MORE VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY 
 14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

DOWNTURNS AND REDUCING OUR FLEXIBILITY IN RESPONDING TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND (4) LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO BORROW MORE MONEY FOR OPERATIONS OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.
IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES MAY IMPEDE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. FURTHER, PAYMENTS OF REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE OR AMOUNTS DUE AT MATURITY, OR CREATION OF ADDITIONAL RESERVES UNDER LOAN AGREEMENTS,
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY. AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM RENTAL INCOME, FAILURE OF TENANTS TO PAY RENT OR DELAYS
IN ARRANGING LEASES AND OCCUPANCY AT OUR PROPERTIES COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM RENTAL INCOME FROM OUR PROPERTIES. OUR TENANTS MAY EXPERIENCE A DOWNTURN IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND/OR IN THE ECONOMY GENERALLY AT ANY TIME THAT MAY WEAKEN THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH TENANTS MAY DELAY LEASE COMMENCEMENT, FAIL TO MAKE RENTAL PAYMENTS WHEN DUE, DECLINE TO EXTEND A LEASE UPON ITS
EXPIRATION, BECOME INSOLVENT, OR DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. ANY LEASING DELAYS, FAILURE TO MAKE RENTAL OR OTHER PAYMENTS WHEN DUE, OR TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, COULD RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF TENANTS LEASES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COMPETITION MAY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO RENEW LEASES OR RE-LET SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 OUR BUSINESS MAY BE SERIOUSLY HARMED IF A MAJOR TENANT FAILS TO RENEW ITS LEASE(S) OR VACATES ONE OR MORE PROPERTIES AND PREVENTS US FROM
RE-LEASING SUCH PREMISES BY CONTINUING TO PAY BASE RENT FOR THE BALANCE OF THE LEASE TERMS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF SUCH A MAJOR TENANT COULD RESULT IN LEASE TERMINATIONS OR REDUCTIONS IN RENT BY OTHER TENANTS AT THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES, AS
PROVIDED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE LEASES. NO TENANT LEASED MORE THAN 10 OF GLA AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 OR CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN 10 OF TOTAL REVENUES DURING 2014, EXCEPT FOR GIANT FOOD STORES, LLC AND STOP SHOP, INC., EACH OF WHICH IS OWNED
BY AHOLD N.V., A NETHERLANDS CORPORATION, WHICH LEASED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY 11 OF OUR GLA, EXCLUDING PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE, AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND ACCOUNTED FOR AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY 14 OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, EXCLUDING
PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE, DURING 2014. WE MAY BE RESTRICTED FROM RE-LEASING SPACE BASED ON EXISTING EXCLUSIVITY LEASE PROVISIONS WITH
SOME OF OUR TENANTS. IN THESE CASES, THE LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS GIVING THE TENANT THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO SELL PARTICULAR TYPES OF MERCHANDISE OR PROVIDE SPECIFIC TYPES OF SERVICES WITHIN THE PARTICULAR RETAIL CENTER, WHICH LIMITS THE ABILITY OF
OTHER TENANTS WITHIN THAT CENTER TO SELL SUCH MERCHANDISE OR PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. WHEN RE-LEASING SPACE AFTER A VACANCY BY ONE OF SUCH OTHER TENANTS, SUCH LEASE PROVISIONS MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF PROSPECTIVE TENANTS FOR THE VACANT SPACE.
THE FAILURE TO RE-LEASE SPACE OR TO RE-LEASE SPACE ON SATISFACTORY TERMS COULD HARM OPERATING RESULTS. ANY BANKRUPTCY FILINGS BY, OR
RELATING TO, ONE OF OUR TENANTS OR A LEASE GUARANTOR WOULD GENERALLY BAR EFFORTS BY US TO COLLECT PRE-BANKRUPTCY DEBTS FROM THAT TENANT, OR LEASE GUARANTOR, UNLESS WE RECEIVE AN ORDER PERMITTING US TO DO SO FROM THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. A BANKRUPTCY BY
A TENANT OR LEASE GUARANTOR COULD DELAY EFFORTS TO COLLECT PAST DUE BALANCES, AND COULD ULTIMATELY PRECLUDE FULL OR, IN FACT, ANY COLLECTION OF SUCH SUMS. IF A LEASE IS AFFIRMED BY THE TENANT IN BANKRUPTCY, ALL PRE-BANKRUPTCY BALANCES DUE UNDER THE
LEASE MUST GENERALLY BE PAID IN FULL. HOWEVER, IF A LEASE IS DISAFFIRMED BY A TENANT IN BANKRUPTCY, WE WOULD HAVE ONLY AN UNSECURED CLAIM FOR DAMAGES, WHICH WOULD BE PAID NORMALLY ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE, AND
 
 15 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ONLY IN THE SAME PERCENTAGE AS IS PAID TO ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME CLASS OF UNSECURED CREDITORS. IT IS POSSIBLE, AND INDEED LIKELY, THAT WE WOULD RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, OR IN FACT
NO PORTION OF, THE FULL VALUE OF ANY UNSECURED CLAIMS WE HOLD, AND WOULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF ANY STRAIGHT-LINE RENT RECEIVABLE RECORDED FOR SUCH TENANT, WHICH MAY IN TURN HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR TENANTS AND OUR BUSINESS. 
 WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH MAY CAUSE THE BUSINESS OF CERTAIN OF OUR TENANTS TO BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY
DIMINISHED OR FUNCTIONALLY OBSOLETE, WITH THE RESULT THAT SUCH TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY RENT, BECOME INSOLVENT, FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, CLOSE THEIR STORES, OR TERMINATE THEIR LEASES. EXAMPLES OF THE POTENTIALLY ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NEW
TECHNOLOGY ON RETAIL BUSINESSES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE EFFECT OF E-BOOKS AND SMALL SCREEN READERS ON BOOK STORES, AND INCREASED SALES OF MANY PRODUCTS ON-LINE. 
 RECENT ANNUAL INCREASES IN ON-LINE SALES HAVE ALSO CAUSED MANY RETAILERS TO SELL PRODUCTS ON-LINE ON THEIR WEBSITES WITH PICK-UPS AT A STORE
OR WAREHOUSE OR THROUGH DELIVERIES, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF THEIR IN-STORE SALES AND THE AMOUNT OF RENT WE ARE ABLE TO COLLECT FROM THEM. WITH RESPECT TO GROCER TENANTS, ON-LINE GROCERY ORDERS HAVE BECOME
INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, BUT HAVE NOT YET BECOME A MAJOR FACTOR AFFECTING GROCERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY HOW GROWTH IN INTERNET SALES WILL IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR SPACE AT OUR PROPERTIES OR HOW
MUCH REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED AT BRICKS AND MORTAR STORE LOCATIONS IN THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO TRENDS IN RETAILER AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, OUR OCCUPANCY LEVELS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER.
 WE FACE RISKS RELATING TO CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS, LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS. 
 WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND PROCESS TRANSACTIONS. OUR BUSINESS IS AT RISK FROM AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY
CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS, INCLUDING ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR CONFIDENTIAL DATA AND OTHER ELECTRONIC SECURITY BREACHES. SUCH CYBER-ATTACKS CAN RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SYSTEMS TO MORE SOPHISTICATED SECURITY THREATS. WHILE WE EMPLOY A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO PREVENT, DETECT AND MITIGATE THESE THREATS INCLUDING PASSWORD PROTECTION, BACKUP SERVERS AND ANNUAL PENETRATION TESTING, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE SUCH EFFORTS WILL
BE SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING A CYBER-ATTACK. CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, DEPENDING ON THEIR NATURE AND SCOPE, COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE COMPROMISE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IMPROPER USE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, MANIPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF
DATA, SYSTEM DOWNTIMES AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COMPETITIVENESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT A SECURITY BREACH OR FAILURE RESULTS IN THE DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE TENANT OR OTHER
THIRD-PARTY DATA, OR THE TRANSMISSION OF HARMFUL/MALICIOUS CODE TO THIRD PARTIES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY OR CLAIMS. COMPETITION MAY
IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO RENEW LEASES OR RE-LET SPACES AS LEASES EXPIRE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM SIMILAR RETAIL CENTERS WITHIN OUR RESPECTIVE TRADE AREAS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RENEW LEASES OR RE-LET
SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE. CERTAIN NATIONAL RETAIL

CHAIN BANKRUPTCIES AND RESULTING STORE CLOSINGS/LEASE DISAFFIRMATIONS HAVE GENERALLY RESULTED IN INCREASED AVAILABLE RETAIL SPACE WHICH, IN TURN, HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURE TO
RENEW TENANT LEASES UPON EXPIRATION AND TO FIND NEW TENANTS FOR VACANT SPACE AT SUCH PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, ANY NEW COMPETITIVE PROPERTIES THAT ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE TRADE AREAS OF OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION FOR
CUSTOMER TRAFFIC AND CREDITWORTHY TENANTS. INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TENANTS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE TENANT AND/OR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PROPERTIES BEYOND THOSE THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PLANNED TO MAKE. ANY UNBUDGETED TENANT AND/OR CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS WE UNDERTAKE MAY REDUCE CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. ULTIMATELY, TO THE EXTENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW LEASES OR RE-LET SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY
IMPACTED. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR OPERATING OR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES, WHICH MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR OPERATING OR ACQUISITION
ACTIVITIES, WHICH MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. OUR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITIES AND THE MORTGAGES ON OUR PROPERTIES CONTAIN CUSTOMARY NEGATIVE COVENANTS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY, WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT
OF THE LENDER, TO SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER ANY OWNERSHIP INTEREST, TO FURTHER MORTGAGE THE APPLICABLE PROPERTY, TO ENTER INTO LEASES, OR TO DISCONTINUE INSURANCE COVERAGE. OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS
SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY, WHICH IS BASED ON THE ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME OF DESIGNATED UNENCUMBERED PROPERTIES, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND OVERALL
RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS WE CAN INCUR. IF WE BREACH COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, THE LENDERS COULD DECLARE A DEFAULT AND REQUIRE US TO REPAY THE DEBT IMMEDIATELY AND, IF THE DEBT IS SECURED, TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY OR
PROPERTIES SECURING THE LOAN. THE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE WASHINGTON DC TO BOSTON CORRIDOR EXPOSES US TO GREATER ECONOMIC
RISKS THAN IF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSED A BROADER REGION. OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED LARGELY IN THE REGION
THAT STRADDLES THE WASHINGTON DC TO BOSTON CORRIDOR, WHICH EXPOSES US TO GREATER ECONOMIC RISKS THAN IF OUR PROPERTIES WERE MORE DIVERSELY LOCATED (IN PARTICULAR, 26 OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN PENNSYLVANIA). ANY ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPMENTS RESULTING FROM THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, BUSINESS CLIMATE, FISCAL PROBLEMS OR WEATHER IN SUCH REGIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR PROSPECTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF EACH OF OUR MARKETS MAY BE DEPENDENT ON ONE OR
MORE INDUSTRIES. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN ONE OF THESE INDUSTRY SECTORS MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN TENANT VACANCIES, WHICH MAY HARM OUR PERFORMANCE IN THE AFFECTED MARKETS. 
 COMPETITION AND SATURATION IN OUR EXISTING MARKETS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY FOR FURTHER GROWTH IN THESE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. 
 NUMEROUS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS AND REAL ESTATE COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US SEEKING PROPERTIES FOR ACQUISITION IN OUR EXISTING TARGET MARKETS.
THIS COMPETITION MAY OPERATE TO REDUCE THE PROPERTIES AVAILABLE FOR ACQUISITION IN THESE MARKETS, INCREASE THE COST OF THE PROPERTIES WE ACQUIRE, REDUCE THE RATE OF RETURN ON THESE PROPERTIES, AND INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN
TENANTS.

 HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN THE WASHINGTON DC TO BOSTON CORRIDOR DUE TO MATURE ECONOMIES, ROAD
PATTERNS, DENSITY OF POPULATION, RESTRICTIONS ON DEVELOPMENT, AND HIGH LAND COSTS, COUPLED WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF OFTEN OVERLAPPING GOVERNMENT JURISDICTIONS, MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN THESE AREAS. 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON KEY PERSONNEL WHOSE CONTINUED SERVICE IS NOT GUARANTEED. 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF KEY PERSONNEL, WHOSE CONTINUED SERVICE IS NOT GUARANTEED. KEY PERSONNEL COULD BE LOST BECAUSE WE COULD
NOT OFFER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. THE LOSS OF SERVICES OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF DIMINISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH LENDERS, SOURCES OF EQUITY CAPITAL, CONSTRUCTION
COMPANIES, AND EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE TENANTS, AND THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WITHOUT MATERIAL DISRUPTION. NATURAL
DISASTERS AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOW AND OPERATING RESULTS. SOME OF OUR
PROPERTIES COULD BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY ACQUIRE PROPERTIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO NATURAL DISASTERS. PROPERTIES COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY
OF HURRICANES OR OTHER STORMS, WHETHER SUCH INCREASES ARE CAUSED BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS. THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS OR SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS CAN INCREASE INVESTMENT COSTS TO REPAIR OR REPLACE DAMAGED PROPERTIES,
INCREASE OPERATING COSTS, INCREASE FUTURE PROPERTY INSURANCE COSTS, AND/OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TENANT DEMAND FOR LEASE SPACE. IF INSURANCE IS UNAVAILABLE TO US, OR IS UNAVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR IF OUR INSURANCE IS NOT ADEQUATE TO COVER
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSSES FROM SUCH EVENTS, OUR EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY AND/OR CAPITAL RESOURCES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR REDEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES MAY NOT YIELD ANTICIPATED RETURNS, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND REDUCE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. 
 REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ENTAIL CONSIDERABLE RISKS, INCLUDING: 

TIME LAG BETWEEN COMMENCEMENT AND COMPLETION, LEAVING US EXPOSED TO HIGHER-THAN-ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING LABOR AND MATERIAL COSTS; 

FAILURE OR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CONSTRUCTION OR PERMANENT FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS; 

EXPENDITURE OF MONEY AND TIME ON PROJECTS THAT MAY NEVER BE COMPLETED; 

INABILITY TO SECURE KEY ANCHOR OR OTHER TENANTS; 

INABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROJECTED RENTAL RATES OR ANTICIPATED PACE OF LEASE-UP; AND 

DELAYS IN COMPLETION RELATING TO WEATHER, LABOR DISRUPTIONS, CONSTRUCTION OR ZONING DELAYS. 
 THE FAILURE OF OUR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO YIELD THEIR ANTICIPATED RETURN COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING
RESULTS.

 POTENTIAL LOSSES MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. 
 POTENTIAL LOSSES MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE CARRY COMPREHENSIVE LIABILITY, FIRE, FLOOD, EXTENDED COVERAGE AND RENTAL LOSS INSURANCE
UNDER A BLANKET POLICY COVERING ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES. WE BELIEVE THE POLICY SPECIFICATIONS AND INSURED LIMITS ARE APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE GIVEN THE RELATIVE RISK OF LOSS, THE COST OF THE COVERAGE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE. WE DO NOT CARRY INSURANCE
FOR LOSSES RELATED TO WAR, NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS, AND NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL OCCURRENCES FROM TERRORIST S ACTS. SOME OF THE INSURANCE, SUCH AS THOSE COVERING LOSSES DUE TO WIND, FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES, IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS INVOLVING
LARGE DEDUCTIBLES OR CO-PAYMENTS AND POLICY LIMITS THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN TENANTS HAVE TERMINATION RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN CASUALTIES. IF WE RECEIVE CASUALTY PROCEEDS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REINVEST
SUCH PROCEEDS PROFITABLY OR AT ALL, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO RECOGNIZE TAXABLE GAIN ON THE AFFECTED PROPERTY. IF WE EXPERIENCE LOSSES THAT ARE UNINSURED OR THAT EXCEED POLICY LIMITS, WE COULD LOSE THE CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE DAMAGED PROPERTIES AS
WELL AS THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE DAMAGED PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS, WE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE LIABLE FOR THE INDEBTEDNESS, EVEN IF THESE PROPERTIES WERE IRREPARABLY DAMAGED.
 FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS COULD HARM THE DEMAND FOR, AND THE VALUE OF, OUR PROPERTIES. 
 FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS, SUCH AS THE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED IN NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHINGTON DC ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND
OTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR, COULD HARM THE DEMAND FOR, AND THE VALUE OF, OUR PROPERTIES. TERRORIST ATTACKS COULD DIRECTLY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES THROUGH DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION, LOSS OR INCREASED SECURITY COSTS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF
INSURANCE FOR SUCH ACTS MAY BE LIMITED OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COST INCREASES. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR TENANTS ARE IMPACTED BY FUTURE ATTACKS, THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO HONOR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEIR EXISTING LEASES COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LITIGATION OVER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. ALL REAL PROPERTY AND THE OPERATIONS CONDUCTED ON REAL PROPERTY ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY. ACCORDINGLY, WE OR OUR TENANTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES
RELEASED ON PROPERTIES WE OWN OR OPERATE, AND ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY OTHER RELATED COSTS. OUR LEASES TYPICALLY IMPOSE OBLIGATIONS ON OUR TENANTS TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ANY COMPLIANCE COSTS WE MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON
THE PROPERTY CAUSED BY THE TENANT. IF A TENANT FAILS TO OR IS UNABLE TO COMPLY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO PAY THESE COSTS. IF NOT ADDRESSED, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR RE-LEASE THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE,
RESULT IN LOWER SALES PRICES OR RENT PAYMENTS, AND RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS USING THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES AS COLLATERAL. WE
COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND LITIGATION OVER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS, AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE
AND CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR OTHER CONTAMINANTS AT PROPERTY OWNED, LEASED, MANAGED OR OTHERWISE OPERATED BY SUCH PERSON, AND MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR TO THIRD PARTIES FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND FOR INVESTIGATION,
REMEDIATION AND CLEANUP COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH 
 19 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CONTAMINATION. THE COST OF INVESTIGATION, REMEDIATION OR REMOVAL OF SUCH SUBSTANCES MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL, AND THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SUBSTANCES, OR THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY REMEDIATE SUCH CONDITIONS,
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OWNER S, LESSOR S OR OPERATOR S ABILITY TO SELL OR RENT SUCH PROPERTY OR TO ARRANGE FINANCING USING SUCH PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. WE MAY BE LIABLE WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER WE KNEW OF, OR WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR,
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED, WHETHER THE CONTAMINATION OCCURRED BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION. 
 WE BELIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES CONDUCTED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES DID NOT REVEAL ANY MATERIAL
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE, AND WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED A MATERIAL LIABILITY. IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND
LOCAL LAWS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO BRING THE PROPERTY INTO COMPLIANCE. IF WE INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS, WE MIGHT ADDITIONALLY INCUR GOVERNMENTAL FINES OR PRIVATE DAMAGE AWARDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT EXISTING REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT CHANGE OR THAT FUTURE REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE
SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED EXPENDITURES THAT WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 (THE
 ADA COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE REMEDIAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROPERTIES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO COMPLY
WITH THE ADA, AS AMENDED, AND SIMILAR LAWS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT ALL PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ACCESS AND USE BY DISABLED PERSONS, AND WITH VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS STATE
AND LOCAL FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. IF WE FAIL TO CONTINUE AS A REIT, OUR DISTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE, AND OUR INCOME WILL BE
SUBJECT TO TAXATION, THEREBY REDUCING EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, OUR
DISTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE, AND OUR INCOME WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION, REDUCING EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE. A REIT WILL GENERALLY NOT BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION ON
THAT PORTION OF ITS INCOME THAT QUALIFIES AS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DISTRIBUTES AT LEAST 90 OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, IF WE DID NOT CONTINUE TO QUALIFY
AS A REIT, WE WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES IN CERTAIN OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. 
 WE INTEND TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN THE
RECOGNITION OF TAXABLE INCOME AND THE ACTUAL RECEIPT OF CASH COULD REQUIRE US TO SELL ASSETS, BORROW FUNDS OR PAY A PORTION OF THE DIVIDEND IN COMMON STOCK TO MEET THE 90 DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT OF THE CODE. CERTAIN ASSETS GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAXABLE INCOME AND INCOME RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES GAAP ). SUCH ASSETS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OPERATING REAL ESTATE THAT WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH
STRUCTURES THAT MAY LIMIT OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE DEPRECIATION DEDUCTION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AS A RESULT, THE CODE REQUIREMENT TO DISTRIBUTE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR
 
 20 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OTHERWISE NET TAXABLE INCOME IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS COULD CAUSE US TO (1) DISTRIBUTE AMOUNTS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR REPAYMENT
OF DEBT, (2) BORROW ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, (3) SELL ASSETS ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, OR (4) IF NECESSARY, PAY A PORTION OF OUR COMMON DIVIDEND IN COMMON STOCK. IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, IT COULD LIMIT OUR
OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO GROW, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY
REITS DO NOT QUALIFY FOR REDUCED TAX RATES UNDER THE CODE. CURRENTLY, THE MAXIMUM FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL TAX RATE FOR NONQUALIFIED DIVIDENDS PAYABLE IS 39.6 ; QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS FROM MOST C CORPORATIONS RECEIVED BY INDIVIDUALS ARE SUBJECT TO A
REDUCED FEDERAL RATE OF 20 . IN ADDITION TO THESE RATES, CERTAIN HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS MAY BE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL 3.8 TAX ON CERTAIN INVESTMENT INCOME, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS. THE MORE FAVORABLE FEDERAL TAX RATES
APPLICABLE TO REGULAR CORPORATE DIVIDENDS MAY RESULT IN THE STOCK OF REITS BEING PERCEIVED TO BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE STOCK OF CORPORATIONS THAT PAY DIVIDENDS QUALIFYING FOR REDUCED RATES OF TAX, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK
OF REITS. OUR CHARTER AND MARYLAND LAW CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION AND DEPRESS OUR STOCK
PRICE. OUR CHARTER AND MARYLAND LAW CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION AND
DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE CHARTER, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AUTHORIZES DIRECTORS TO TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AS ARE NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE RELATING TO QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, AND TO LIMIT ANY PERSON TO BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF NO
MORE THAN 9.9 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, MAY EXEMPT A PROPOSED TRANSFEREE FROM THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT, BUT MAY NOT GRANT AN EXEMPTION FROM THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT TO ANY PROPOSED
TRANSFEREE WHOSE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR STATUS AS A REIT. THESE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND OWNERSHIP WILL NOT APPLY IF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINES THAT IT IS NO LONGER IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO CONTINUE TO
QUALIFY AS, OR TO BE, A REIT. THIS OWNERSHIP LIMIT MAY DELAY OR IMPEDE A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE OF CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS. BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO
DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS WAIVED THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT TO PERMIT COMPANIES AFFILIATED WITH EACH OF INLAND AMERICAN REAL ESTATE TRUST, INC. INLAND ), BLACKROCK, INC. AND COHEN AND STEERS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. TO ACQUIRE UP TO 14 , 14.9 AND 15 , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, INLAND HAS AGREED TO VARIOUS VOTING RESTRICTIONS AND STANDSTILL PROVISIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 WE MAY AUTHORIZE AND ISSUE STOCK AND OP UNITS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. OUR CHARTER
AUTHORIZES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK, TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL OP UNITS, TO CLASSIFY OR RECLASSIFY ANY UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK, AND TO SET THE PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND OTHER TERMS
OF SUCH CLASSIFIED OR UNCLASSIFIED SHARES. WE HAVE AGREED NOT TO USE OUR PREFERRED STOCK FOR ANTI-TAKEOVER PURPOSES OR IN CONNECTION WITH A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN UNLESS WE OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW (THE MGCL MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF INHIBITING A THIRD PARTY FROM MAKING A PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE US OR OF IMPEDING A CHANGE OF CONTROL UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OTHERWISE COULD PROVIDE THE HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE A PREMIUM OVER THE THEN-PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF SUCH SHARES, INCLUDING:

 BUSINESS COMBINATION PROVISIONS THAT, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, PROHIBIT CERTAIN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BETWEEN US AND AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER (DEFINED GENERALLY AS ANY PERSON OR AN AFFILIATE
THEREOF WHO BENEFICIALLY OWNS 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF OUR SHARES) FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER THE MOST RECENT DATE ON WHICH THE STOCKHOLDER BECOMES AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, AND THEREAFTER IMPOSES SPECIAL APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND SPECIAL
STOCKHOLDER VOTING REQUIREMENTS ON THESE COMBINATIONS; AND 

2. 
 CONTROL SHARE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THAT OUR CONTROL SHARES (DEFINED AS SHARES THAT, WHEN AGGREGATED WITH OTHER SHARES CONTROLLED BY THE STOCKHOLDER, ENTITLE THE STOCKHOLDER TO EXERCISE ONE OF
THREE INCREASING RANGES OF VOTING POWER IN ELECTING DIRECTORS) ACQUIRED IN A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION (DEFINED AS THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF CONTROL SHARES) HAVE NO VOTING RIGHTS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
APPROVED BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST ON THE MATTER, EXCLUDING ALL INTERESTED SHARES. 
 WE HAVE OPTED OUT OF THESE PROVISIONS OF THE MGCL. HOWEVER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY, BY RESOLUTION, ELECT TO OPT IN TO THE BUSINESS

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,
THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS LISTED BELOW AND THE OTHER MATTERS SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM
10-K. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US, OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL, MAY ALSO
IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THESE RISKS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK.

12 

WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. 

FOR MOST OF 2008, FINANCIAL MARKETS GLOBALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED DISRUPTION, INCLUDING, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, EXTREME VOLATILITY IN SECURITY PRICES, SEVERELY DIMINISHED LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT
AVAILABILITY, RATINGS DOWNGRADES OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DECLINING VALUATIONS OF OTHERS.
GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS INTENDED TO ADDRESS EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS THAT,
AMONG OTHER CONCERNS, INCLUDE SEVERELY RESTRICTED CREDIT. LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THESE DISRUPTIONS
IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, MOST ANALYSTS BELIEVE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A POTENTIALLY PROLONGED
RECESSION. THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT BUSINESSES LIKE OURS IN A NUMBER OF
WAYS, SUCH AS:

THE RATE OF SMALL BUSINESS FORMATIONS, SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, CONSUMER SPENDING AND
EMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AS WELL AS ENERGY COSTS, ALL HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES. BELOW
AVERAGE SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM AND A DECLINE IN SMALL BUSINESS FORMATIONS NEGATIVELY
IMPACTED OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES IN 2008, AND WE EXPECT THIS
TREND TO CONTINUE, AND POSSIBLY WORSEN, THROUGH 2009. CONSUMER SPENDING AND EMPLOYMENT LEVELS
ALSO TRENDED NEGATIVELY DURING 2008, RESULTING IN SOME NEGATIVE IMPACT IN OUR PERSONAL CHECK
BUSINESSES. A PROLONGED DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL
DECLINES IN OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. 

THE FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LARGER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS, OR LARGE PORTIONS
OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION TO THE
POSSIBILITY OF LOSING A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT, THE INABILITY TO RECOVER CONTRACT ACQUISITION
COSTS PAID TO ONE OR MORE OF OUR LARGER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS, OR THE INABILITY TO
COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CONTRACT TERMINATION PAYMENTS FROM
THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS DURING THIS
PERIOD OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. SUCH AN INCREASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING
RESULTS. OFTEN THE NEWLY COMBINED ENTITY SEEKS TO REDUCE COSTS BY LEVERAGING ECONOMIES OF
SCALE IN PURCHASING, INCLUDING ITS CHECK SUPPLY CONTRACTS. THIS RESULTS IN CHECK PROVIDERS
COMPETING INTENSELY ON PRICE IN ORDER TO RETAIN NOT ONLY THEIR PREVIOUS BUSINESS WITH ONE OF
THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT ALSO TO GAIN THE BUSINESS OF THE OTHER PARTY IN THE
MERGER/ACQUISITION. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE
DURATION OF OUR CONTRACTS. NORMALLY, THE LENGTH OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
RANGES FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER, CONTRACTS ARE SOMETIMES RENEGOTIATED OR BOUGHT OUT
MID-TERM DUE TO A CONSOLIDATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 

THE EFFECTS OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ON OUR EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS AND THE BROADER U.S.
MARKET RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR SHARE PRICE AND LED TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT
CHARGES IN 2008 RELATED TO TRADE NAMES IN OUR SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES SEGMENT. BOTH BEFORE
AND AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR COMMON STOCK TRADED AT PRICES LOWER THAN THE DECEMBER 31,
2008 CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF 14.96. IF SUCH A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK
PRICE OCCURS IN THE FUTURE FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD, IT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF A FURTHER
DECLINE IN OUR FAIR VALUE AND WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE US TO RECORD AN
IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR A PORTION OF THE 40.2 MILLION OF GOODWILL
ALLOCATED TO ONE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT A NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE
RELATED TO THIS REPORTING UNIT AND/OR FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR
INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADE NAME ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE. THIS REPORTING UNIT HAD A CALCULATED FAIR VALUE WHICH EXCEEDED ITS
CARRYING VALUE BY 2.7 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND OUR
INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADE NAME HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF 24.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR COMMITTED LINE OF CREDIT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A RATIO
OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES TO INTEREST EXPENSE OF 3.0 TIMES, AS MEASURED QUARTERLY
ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR QUARTERS. SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE
FUTURE COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THIS DEBT COVENANT, IN WHICH CASE, OUR LENDERS
COULD DEMAND IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR LINE OF CREDIT. ALTHOUGH WE
WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS DEBT COVENANT EVEN IF OUR REPORTED PRE-TAX
EARNINGS FOR 2008 HAD BEEN 52 MILLION LOWER THAN WE REPORTED, WE CANNOT PROVIDE DEFINITIVE
ASSURANCE REGARDING OUR CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH THIS DEBT COVENANT. 

THE SEVERITY AND LENGTH OF THE PRESENT DISRUPTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND RECESSION IN
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY ARE UNKNOWN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A FURTHER
DETERIORATION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IN GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE COSTS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. 

THE INTENSE COMPETITION WE FACE COMPELS US TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCY IN
ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE PROFITABILITY. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE EXPENSES, PRIMARILY
WITHIN OUR SHARED SERVICES FUNCTIONS OF FULFILLMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, REAL ESTATE, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES AND LEGAL.
WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES
AND REDUCE OUR COST AND EXPENSE STRUCTURE. THESE INITIATIVES HAVE REQUIRED AND WILL

13 

CONTINUE TO
REQUIRE UP-FRONT EXPENDITURES RELATED TO ITEMS SUCH AS REDESIGNING AND STREAMLINING PROCESSES,
CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS, STANDARDIZING TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS AND IMPROVING
REAL ESTATE UTILIZATION. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR ANTICIPATED COST
REDUCTIONS OR THAT WE WILL DO SO WITHOUT INCURRING UNEXPECTED OR GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED
EXPENDITURES. MOREOVER, WE MAY FIND THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION AND
COST REDUCTION GOALS WITHOUT DISRUPTION TO OUR BUSINESS AND, AS A RESULT, MAY CHOOSE TO DELAY OR
FOREGO CERTAIN COST REDUCTIONS AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS REQUIRE. FAILURE TO MEET OUR PLANNED COST
REDUCTION TARGETS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
PROSPECTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AT IMPLEMENTING OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES WITHIN SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES. 

WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE STRATEGIES INTENDED TO DRIVE SUSTAINED GROWTH WITHIN SMALL BUSINESS
SERVICES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN SEVERAL KEY ENABLERS TO
ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIES, INCLUDING CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR
E-COMMERCE CAPABILITIES, IMPLEMENTING AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM FOR OUR
VARIOUS BRANDS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER ANALYTICS, FOCUSING ON KEY
CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND IMPROVING OUR MERCHANDISING. WE
EXPECT TO DRIVE GROWTH AS WE OBTAIN A GREATER PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM HIGHER GROWTH
ANNUITY-BASED BUSINESS SERVICES, INCLUDING WEB HOSTING AND OTHER WEB SERVICES, BUSINESS NETWORKING
AND PAYROLL. ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES HAVE REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE INVESTMENT. SMALL
BUSINESS SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED IN 2008, AS COMPARED TO 2007, AS THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS MORE THAN OFFSET ANY FAVORABILITY RESULTING FROM OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES. WE CAN PROVIDE
NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE LONG-TERM AND RESULT IN A
POSITIVE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT. ALSO, NEGATIVE IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THE OTHER RISK FACTORS
DESCRIBED HEREIN MAY OFFSET OR MORE THAN OFFSET THE BENEFIT REALIZED FROM OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. 

ALTHOUGH WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CHECK PRINTERS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE FACE CONSIDERABLE
COMPETITION. IN ADDITION TO COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS, WE ALSO FACE INTENSE
COMPETITION FROM ANOTHER CHECK PRINTER IN OUR TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SALES CHANNEL, FROM
DIRECT MAIL SELLERS OF PERSONAL CHECKS, FROM SELLERS OF BUSINESS CHECKS AND FORMS, FROM CHECK
PRINTING SOFTWARE VENDORS AND FROM INTERNET-BASED SELLERS OF CHECKS TO INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL
BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY, LOW PRICE, HIGH VOLUME OFFICE SUPPLY CHAIN STORES OFFER STANDARDIZED
BUSINESS FORMS, CHECKS AND RELATED PRODUCTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION
WITH OUR BUSINESS SERVICES OFFERINGS. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPETITORS. CONTINUED COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN
ADDITIONAL PRICE REDUCTIONS, REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND AN INCREASE IN UP-FRONT
CASH PAYMENTS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UPON CONTRACT EXECUTION OR RENEWAL, WHICH WOULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES STANDARDIZED BUSINESS FORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS FACE TECHNOLOGICAL
OBSOLESCENCE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. 

CONTINUAL TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE PROVIDED SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS WITH ALTERNATIVE
MEANS TO ENACT AND RECORD BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF THE LOWER PRICE AND HIGHER
PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PRINTERS, SMALL BUSINESSES NOW HAVE AN
ALTERNATE MEANS TO PRINT MANY BUSINESS FORMS. ADDITIONALLY, ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION SYSTEMS AND
OFF-THE-SHELF BUSINESS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO REPLACE PRE-PRINTED BUSINESS
FORMS PRODUCTS. IF SMALL BUSINESS PREFERENCES CHANGE RAPIDLY AND WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH COMPARABLE PROFIT MARGINS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED.

THE CHECK PRINTING PORTION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS MATURE AND, IF CHECK USAGE DECLINES
FASTER THAN EXPECTED, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 

CHECK PRINTING IS, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS,
REPRESENTING 65.4 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN 2008. WE SELL CHECKS FOR PERSONAL AND SMALL
BUSINESS USE AND BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL DEMAND FOR THESE CHECKS FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHECKS WRITTEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
IN DECLINE SINCE THE MID-1990S. ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHECKS WRITTEN BY
INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES IS DECLINING APPROXIMATELY FOUR TO SIX PERCENT EACH YEAR, ALTHOUGH
THE DECLINES WERE GREATER IN 2008, WE BELIEVE, DUE TO THE ECONOMIC RECESSION AND INSTABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF CHECKS WRITTEN WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE DUE TO THE
INCREASING USE OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS, INCLUDING CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS, AUTOMATED
TELLER MACHINES, DIRECT DEPOSIT AND ELECTRONIC AND OTHER BILL PAYING SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE RATE
AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS WILL ACHIEVE ACCEPTANCE AND REPLACE CHECKS,
WHETHER AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, PERSONAL PREFERENCE OR OTHERWISE, CANNOT BE
PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. A SURGE IN THE POPULARITY OF ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

14 

METHODS, OR
OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY OFFSET THE DECLINE IN CHECK USAGE WITH OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE,
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS.

CONSOLIDATION AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS, AND MAY CONTINUE TO, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CLIENTS. 

THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS DECLINED DUE TO CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES INDUSTRY. MARGIN PRESSURES ARISE FROM SUCH CONSOLIDATION AS MERGED ENTITIES SEEK TO REDUCE
COSTS BY LEVERAGING ECONOMIES OF SCALE, INCLUDING THEIR CHECK SUPPLY CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE IN
GENERAL NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE POSSESSED BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAS RESULTED IN CONTRACTS
WHICH ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE TO US AS THOSE HISTORICALLY NEGOTIATED WITH THESE CLIENTS, AND IN SOME
CASES, HAS RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF CLIENTS TO COMPETITORS. ALTHOUGH WE DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT
TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVELY-PRICED, HIGH-QUALITY SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR
THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION
CLIENTS WILL BE RETAINED OR THAT THE LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT CLIENT CAN BE OFFSET THROUGH THE
ADDITION OF NEW CLIENTS OR BY EXPANDED SALES TO OUR REMAINING CLIENTS.

CONTINUING SOFTNESS IN DIRECT MAIL RESPONSE RATES COULD HAVE A FURTHER ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. 

OUR DIRECT CHECKS SEGMENT AND PORTIONS OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES SEGMENT HAVE EXPERIENCED
DECLINES IN RESPONSE RATES RELATED TO DIRECT MAIL PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS. WE BELIEVE THAT MEDIA
RESPONSE RATES ARE DECLINING ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE
BELIEVE THAT OUR DECLINES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GENERAL DECLINE IN CHECK USAGE AND THE GRADUAL
OBSOLESCENCE OF STANDARDIZED FORMS PRODUCTS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO OFFSET THESE IMPACTS, WE CONTINUE TO
MODIFY OUR MARKETING AND SALES EFFORTS AND HAVE RECENTLY SHIFTED A GREATER PORTION OF OUR
ADVERTISING INVESTMENT TO THE INTERNET. COMPETITIVE PRESSURE MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO REFLECT
INCREASED COSTS IN THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND NEW MARKETING STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.
WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFSET THE DECLINE IN RESPONSE RATES, EVEN WITH
ADDITIONAL MARKETING AND SALES EFFORTS.

THE INABILITY TO SECURE ADEQUATE ADVERTISING PLACEMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. 

THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR DIRECT CHECKS SEGMENT DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO SECURE
ADEQUATE ADVERTISING MEDIA PLACEMENTS AT ACCEPTABLE RATES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE REGARDING
THE FUTURE COST, EFFECTIVENESS AND/OR AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE ADVERTISING MEDIA. IN ADDITION,
FUTURE LEGISLATION COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ADVERTISE VIA DIRECT MAIL. CONGRESS ENACTED A
FEDERAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER BACKLASH AGAINST TELEMARKETERS AND IS
CONTEMPLATING ENACTING ANTI-SPAM LEGISLATION IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT UNSOLICITED
E-MAIL ADVERTISEMENTS. IF ANTI-SPAM LEGISLATION IS ENACTED AND/OR IF SIMILAR LEGISLATION IS ENACTED
FOR DIRECT MAIL ADVERTISERS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY. IN
ADDITION, MANY DIRECT CHECKS CUSTOMERS ACCESS OUR WEBSITES THROUGH INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES. DURING
2008, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DOMINANT SEARCH ENGINE S DECISION TO
LIMIT OUR INTERNET ADVERTISING BASED UPON ITS REVISED ADVERTISING POLICIES. AS WE ANALYZE OUR
OVERALL ADVERTISING STRATEGY, WE MAY HAVE TO RESORT TO MORE COSTLY RESOURCES TO REPLACE THIS
INTERNET TRAFFIC, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. 

DURING 2008, WE ACQUIRED HOSTOPIA.COM INC., PARTNERUP, INC., AND LOGO DESIGN MOJO, INC. WITH
THE INTENTION OF INCREASING SALES OF HIGHER-GROWTH ANNUITY-BASED BUSINESS SERVICES. THE INTEGRATION
OF ANY ACQUISITION INVOLVES NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING: DIFFICULTIES IN ASSIMILATING OPERATIONS AND
PRODUCTS; DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS; POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY
EMPLOYEES; POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO UNKNOWN LIABILITIES; AND POSSIBLE LOSS OF OUR CLIENTS AND
CUSTOMERS OR THE CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS
COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AN ACQUISITION AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN REGARD TO FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES
CAN BE ACQUIRED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR WHETHER ANY ACQUIRED PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESSES
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR REVENUE OR EARNINGS TO ANY MATERIAL EXTENT. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS
TYPICALLY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR DEBT AND/OR ADDITIONAL AMORTIZATION
EXPENSE RELATED TO ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THUS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

15 

DECLINES IN THE EQUITY MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT AND
PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

THE ASSETS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT AND PENSION PLANS ARE VALUED AT FAIR VALUE USING
QUOTED MARKET PRICES. INVESTMENTS, IN GENERAL, ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS, INCLUDING CREDIT,
INTEREST AND OVERALL MARKET VOLATILITY RISKS. DURING 2008, THE EQUITY MARKETS SAW A SIGNIFICANT
DECLINE IN VALUE. AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR PLAN ASSETS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM DECEMBER
31, 2007. THIS MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AND WILL RESULT IN HIGHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2009. ALTHOUGH OUR OBLIGATION IS LIMITED TO FUNDING BENEFITS AS
THEY BECOME PAYABLE, CONTINUED DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER
EXPENSE INCREASES, AS WELL AS THE NEED TO CONTRIBUTE INCREASED AMOUNTS OF CASH TO FUND BENEFITS
PAYABLE UNDER THE PLANS.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, DELIVERY SERVICES AND ENERGY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF PAPER, PLASTICS, INK,
OTHER RAW MATERIALS, DELIVERY SERVICES AND ENERGY. POSTAL RATES INCREASED IN 2007 AND 2008 AND FUEL
COSTS HAVE FLUCTUATED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW PAPER
SUPPLIERS. AS SUCH, WHEN OUR SUPPLIERS INCREASE PAPER PRICES, AS THEY HAVE INDICATED WILL BE THE
CASE IN 2009, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN BETTER PRICING FROM ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS. COMPETITIVE
PRESSURES AND/OR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO REFLECT INCREASED COSTS IN THE
PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

PAPER COSTS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR MATERIALS COST. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT
BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PAPER SHORTAGES BECAUSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS PAPER
SUPPLIERS. HOWEVER, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE SUFFICIENT
QUANTITIES OF PAPER IF SUCH A SHORTAGE WERE TO OCCUR. ADDITIONALLY, WE DEPEND UPON THIRD PARTY
PROVIDERS FOR DELIVERY SERVICES. EVENTS RESULTING IN THE INABILITY OF THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO
PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS EXTENDED LABOR STRIKES, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING US TO SECURE ALTERNATE PROVIDERS AT HIGHER COSTS.

FORECASTS INVOLVING FUTURE RESULTS REFLECT VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE INCORRECT. 

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAKE PREDICTIONS OR FORECASTS REGARDING OUR FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FORECASTS REGARDING ESTIMATED REVENUE, EARNINGS PER SHARE OR CASH PROVIDED BY
OPERATING ACTIVITIES. ANY FORECAST REGARDING OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE REFLECTS VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS
WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A MATTER OF COURSE, MAY PROVE TO BE
INCORRECT. FURTHER, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY FORECAST DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH ARE BEYOND
OUR CONTROL. AS A RESULT, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR PERFORMANCE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH ANY
MANAGEMENT FORECASTS OR THAT THE VARIATION FROM SUCH FORECASTS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL AND ADVERSE.
YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO BASE YOUR ENTIRE ANALYSIS OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS UPON ISOLATED
PREDICTIONS, AND ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE THE ENTIRE MIX OF HISTORICAL AND FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
MADE AVAILABLE BY US, AND OTHER INFORMATION AFFECTING US AND OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING
THE FACTORS DISCUSSED HERE.

IN ADDITION, INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS PERIODICALLY PUBLISH REPORTS REGARDING OUR PROJECTED FUTURE
PERFORMANCE. THE METHODOLOGIES WE EMPLOY IN ARRIVING AT OUR OWN INTERNAL PROJECTIONS AND THE
APPROACHES TAKEN BY INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS IN MAKING THEIR ESTIMATES ARE LIKELY DIFFERENT IN MANY
SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO ADVISE ANALYSTS OR THE PUBLIC
MARKETS OF OUR VIEWS REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE PUBLISHED ESTIMATES OF INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS. IF
YOU ARE RELYING ON THESE ESTIMATES, YOU SHOULD PURSUE YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF THEIR
ACCURACY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED.

SECURITY BREACHES INVOLVING CUSTOMER DATA, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT E-COMMERCE IS NOT SECURE,
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS. 

WE RELY ON VARIOUS SECURITY PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE SECURE STORAGE AND
TRANSMISSION OF DATA. COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET ARE, BY NATURE, VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT MISUSE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR ADVANCES IN CRIMINAL
CAPABILITIES WILL NOT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS RESULTING IN
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND/OR USE OF CUSTOMER DATA, INCLUDING CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL
INFORMATION. A SECURITY BREACH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, DETER CLIENTS AND CONSUMERS FROM
ORDERING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, LEAD TO THE TERMINATION OF CLIENT CONTRACTS AND RESULT IN
CLAIMS AGAINST US. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING A LAWSUIT REGARDING
SECURITY BREACHES, WE MAY BE FORCED TO PAY DAMAGES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, GENERAL PUBLICITY REGARDING SECURITY BREACHES AT OTHER COMPANIES
COULD LEAD TO THE PERCEPTION AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT E-COMMERCE IS NOT SECURE. THIS COULD
DECREASE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES AND FORECLOSE FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

16 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR LICENSES TO USE THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON
FAVORABLE TERMS. 

CHECK DESIGNS EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ACCOUNT FOR A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE.
THESE LICENSE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY AVERAGE THREE YEARS IN DURATION. THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT
SUCH LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US INDEFINITELY OR UNDER TERMS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE
TO SELL THE LICENSED PRODUCTS PROFITABLY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEBSITE OPERATIONS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD DAMAGE OUR
REPUTATION AND HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

THE SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR REPUTATION AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS. WE COULD
EXPERIENCE TEMPORARY INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR WEBSITES, TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS, NETWORK
INFRASTRUCTURE, PRINTING PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF
REASONS, INCLUDING HUMAN ERROR, SOFTWARE ERRORS, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FIRE,
FLOOD, EXTREME WEATHER AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, OUR TECHNOLOGY,
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES MAY CONTAIN UNDETECTED ERRORS OR DESIGN FAULTS WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR
WEBSITES OR OPERATING SYSTEMS TO FAIL. THE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 

WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT LAWS, TRADE SECRET AND PATENT PROTECTION,
AND CONFIDENTIALITY AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS, SOFTWARE AND OTHER
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THESE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AFFORD ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION. DESPITE OUR
EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THIRD PARTIES MAY INFRINGE OR MISAPPROPRIATE OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES WHICH DO NOT INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEND
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS AND TO MONITOR AND POLICE OUR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE LOSS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION OR THE INABILITY TO SECURE OR ENFORCE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS FOR CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
NEEDS. 

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SERVICES, INCLUDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK SERVER SERVICES. IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OR MORE
OF THESE PROVIDERS IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE OR TIMELY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES, WE
COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE
FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, A FAILURE TO PERFORM BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD CAUSE A
DISRUPTION IN OUR BUSINESS WHILE WE OBTAIN AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF SUPPLY. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF
SUBSTITUTE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED EXPENSE.

LEGISLATION RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTION COULD LIMIT OR HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
OF THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL MODERNIZATION LAW KNOWN AS THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND OTHER FEDERAL
REGULATION AND STATE LAW ON THE SAME SUBJECT. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP,
IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF
CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MORE
RESTRICTIVE THAN THE REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS AND AGREEMENTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE OR
DISCLOSE NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR OTHER THAN THE PURPOSES ORIGINALLY INTENDED. THIS
COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER MORE RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION WILL BE ADOPTED IN
THE FUTURE. ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION, OR THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LEGISLATION OR
REGULATION, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS. LAWS
AND REGULATIONS MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNET, E-COMMERCE OR MARKETING
PRACTICES GENERALLY RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. SUCH LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF
THE INTERNET AND/OR USE OF OTHER SALES OR MARKETING VEHICLES. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW PRIVACY LAWS COULD
DECREASE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES, DECREASE TELEMARKETING OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE THE COST OF
OBTAINING NEW CUSTOMERS.

17 

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO SALES AND OTHER TAXES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL TAX LAWS, WE CURRENTLY COLLECT SALES, USE OR OTHER
SIMILAR TAXES IN STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE. ONE OR MORE STATE
OR LOCAL JURISDICTION MAY SEEK TO IMPOSE SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS ON OUT-OF-STATE COMPANIES
WHICH ENGAGE IN REMOTE OR ONLINE COMMERCE. FURTHER, TAX LAW AND THE INTERPRETATION OF
CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS THEREON IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IN ADDITION, ANY NEW OPERATIONS IN STATES
WHERE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE COULD SUBJECT SHIPMENTS OF GOODS BY OUR
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER BUSINESSES INTO SUCH STATES TO SALES TAX UNDER CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS. IF ONE OR
MORE STATE OR LOCAL JURISDICTION SUCCESSFULLY ASSERTS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE COLLECTED SALES OR OTHER
TAXES IN THE PAST BUT DID NOT, OR THAT WE MUST COLLECT SALES OR OTHER TAXES IN THE FUTURE BEYOND
OUR CURRENT PRACTICES, EITHER DETERMINATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL, ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. 

OUR PRINTING FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT
THE ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE SOLD FORMER PRINTING FACILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, AND IN SOME INSTANCES,
HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE BUYER OF THE FACILITY FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.
UNFORESEEN CONDITIONS AT THESE FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LIABILITY AND EXPENSE BEYOND
OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE.

RISK FACTORS 

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND BUSINESS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR CAPITAL PLAN. 

OUR CAPITAL PLAN, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL UNDER BUSINESS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ABOVE, HAS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING AND THEREAFTER MAINTAINING CERTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED BY RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY OUR BANK'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN DECEMBER 2009 (AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED). IN 2009 AND 2010, WE ENGAGED IN VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS TO HELP US ACHIEVE THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS SET FORTH IN THE CAPITAL PLAN, WHICH ARE ALSO DESCRIBED UNDER "BUSINESS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS" ABOVE. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED THE FINAL INITIATIVE OF OUR CAPITAL PLAN, WHICH IS A PUBLIC OFFERING FOR CASH. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR BANK MET ONE OF THE TWO MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS SET FORTH IN THE RESOLUTIONS, BUT NOT BOTH. 

IN LIGHT OF OUR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSET QUALITY AND OTHER POSITIVE INDICATORS, INCLUDING OUR UPDATED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS, WE ARE REEVALUATING OUR ALTERNATIVES FOR ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CAPITAL PLAN, INCLUDING THE SIZE AND TIMING OF ANY COMMON STOCK OFFERING. THIS EVALUATION WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS, AS WELL AS INPUT FROM OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND THE TREASURY. 

HOWEVER, WHATEVER STRATEGY WE PURSUE TO REACH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CAPITAL PLAN WILL INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL PLAN IS, IN MANY RESPECTS, LARGELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL AS IT PRIMARILY DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS OUR ABILITY TO RAISE NEW CAPITAL, WHICH DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, OTHER MACRO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INVESTORS PERCEPTION OF THE ABILITY OF THE MICHIGAN ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT RECESSION. IN ADDITION, OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING EACH OF THOSE DESCRIBED IN THESE "RISK FACTORS," COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, WHICH WOULD IN TURN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO REACH THE GOALS SET FORTH IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN. 

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS SET FORTH IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN, IT WOULD LIKELY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES. AN INABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL POSITION WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO WITHSTAND CONTINUED LOSSES AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN MICHIGAN AND OTHER FACTORS, AS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS RISK FACTORS SECTION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR BANK S CAPITAL COULD FALL BELOW THE LEVELS NECESSARY TO REMAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED UNDER FEDERAL REGULATORY STANDARDS. IN THAT CASE, OUR PRIMARY BANK REGULATORS MAY IMPOSE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS ON US THROUGH A REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTION. IF OUR BANK FAILS TO REMAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED UNDER FEDERAL REGULATORY STANDARDS, IT WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM ACCEPTING OR RENEWING BROKERED DEPOSITS WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT OF THE FDIC, WHICH WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF OUR REGULATORS TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST US, IT WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES (DUE TO ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH SUCH ENFORCEMENT ACTION) AND COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS (DUE TO RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION). THERE COULD BE OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF OUR CAPITAL, SUCH AS INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS PAYABLE TO THE FDIC. 

BECAUSE OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AT MARCH 31, 2010, WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FANNIE MAE IN MAY 2010 ADVISING US THAT WE WERE IN BREACH OF OUR SELLING AND SERVICING CONTRACT WITH FANNIE MAE. THE LETTER STATES THAT IF THIS BREACH IS NOT REMEDIED AS EVIDENCED BY OUR CALL REPORT AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, FANNIE MAE WILL SUSPEND OUR SERVICING CONTRACT. THE SUSPENSION OF OUR CONTRACT WITH FANNIE MAE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHILE OUR BANK REMAINS WELL-CAPITALIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION UNDERLYING THE MAY 2010 LETTER HAS NOT BEEN REMEDIED AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE FROM FANNIE MAE. THUS, THIS MATTER REMAINS UNRESOLVED AND THE RISK EXISTS THAT FANNIE MAE MAY REQUIRE US TO VERY QUICKLY SELL OR TRANSFER MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS TO A THIRD PARTY OR UNILATERALLY STRIP US OF SUCH SERVICING RIGHTS IF WE CANNOT COMPLETE AN APPROVED TRANSFER. DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, THIS FORCED SALE OR TRANSFER OF SUCH MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING RIGHTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE EARNINGS PROSPECTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTICE FROM FREDDIE MAC SIMILAR TO THE NOTICE WE RECEIVED FROM FANNIE MAE, A SIMILAR TYPE OF ACTION COULD BE TAKEN BY FREDDIE MAC. 

ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS WOULD MAKE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO WITHSTAND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ANY CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO, OR ANY ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO ESTIMATED POTENTIAL INCURRED LOSSES FOR MEPCO FROM VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT COUNTERPARTY CONTINGENCIES. WE COULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN A SALE OR OTHER TRANSACTION WITH A THIRD PARTY OR OUR BANK COULD BE PLACED INTO RECEIVERSHIP BY BANK REGULATORS. ANY SUCH EVENT COULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A LOSS OF THE ENTIRE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND IT COULD ALSO RESULT IN A LOSS OF THE ENTIRE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND PREFERRED STOCK. 

24 

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE RESULTS SIMILAR TO OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS. 

IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, TO BE DELIVERED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE APRIL 26, 2011 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (FILED AS EXHIBIT 13 TO THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K), WE DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING OUR POTENTIAL FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR BELIEF THAT OUR BANK CAN REMAIN ABOVE WELL-CAPITALIZED FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, EVEN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND ATTAIN THE BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED BY THE CAPITAL PLAN IN 2012 AND OUR BELIEF THAT OUR BANK CAN RETURN TO PROFITABILITY IN 2012. THESE PROJECTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WERE BASED ON INFORMATION ABOUT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND, THOUGH CONSIDERED REASONABLE BY US, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR BANK MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED AS WE WORK THROUGH ASSET QUALITY ISSUES AND SEEK TO RETURN TO CONSISTENT PROFITABILITY. ANY SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN OR INABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL POSITION WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO WITHSTAND CONTINUED LOSSES THAT WE MAY INCUR AND THAT MAY BE INCREASED OR MADE MORE LIKELY AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER FACTORS. WE DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. NEITHER WE NOR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY ASSUMES ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF THESE PROJECTIONS, AS THE PROJECTIONS ARE NOT, AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS, A GUARANTEE OF OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CONDITION. 

WE HAVE CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AND OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ACTUAL LOAN LOSSES, DESPITE ANALYSES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED (BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES) TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ALLOWANCE. 

OUR LOAN CUSTOMERS MAY NOT REPAY THEIR LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE TERMS, AND THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE PAYMENT OF THESE LOANS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER ANY LOSSES WE MAY INCUR. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CREDIT LOSSES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. WE MAKE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR BORROWERS AND THE VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS SERVING AS COLLATERAL FOR THE REPAYMENT OF MANY OF OUR LOANS. NON-PERFORMING LOANS AMOUNTED TO 67.6 MILLION AND 109.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. OUR ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIO OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS WAS 100.5 AND 74.4 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. IN DETERMINING THE SIZE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WE RELY ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND OUR EVALUATION OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, OUR CURRENT ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER CERTAIN LOAN LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO. MATERIAL ADDITIONS TO OUR ALLOWANCE WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OR RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL LOAN CHARGE-OFFS. ANY INCREASE IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OR LOAN CHARGE-OFFS REQUIRED BY THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PERFORMED INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TESTING OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO TO HELP ENSURE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, IF THE ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS USED IN THESE ANALYSES PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, OUR CURRENT ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER LOAN LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THESE ANALYSES WERE COMPLETED IN EARLY 2010, AND WE HAVE NOT UNDERTAKEN UPDATED ANALYSES WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL. MATERIAL ADDITIONS TO OUR ALLOWANCE WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OR RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED. 

25 

OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND PARTICULARLY BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A GREAT EXTENT UPON THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN S LOWER PENINSULA. WE HAVE IN GENERAL EXPERIENCED A SLOWING ECONOMY IN MICHIGAN SINCE 2001. UNLIKE LARGER BANKS THAT ARE MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFIED, WE PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN MICHIGAN S LOWER PENINSULA. OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO, THE ABILITY OF THE BORROWERS TO REPAY THESE LOANS, AND THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THESE LOANS WILL BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES FACED IN MICHIGAN HAVE HAD AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE MANY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

LOAN DELINQUENCIES MAY INCREASE; 

PROBLEM ASSETS AND FORECLOSURES MAY INCREASE; 

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE; AND 

COLLATERAL FOR OUR LOANS MAY DECLINE IN VALUE, IN TURN REDUCING CUSTOMERS BORROWING POWER AND REDUCING THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND COLLATERAL ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING LOANS. 

ADDITIONALLY, THE OVERALL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION SINCE THE START OF THE U.S. RECESSION. IN SOME CASES, THE MARKETS HAVE PRODUCED DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON STOCK PRICES AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY FOR CERTAIN ISSUERS WITHOUT REGARD TO THOSE ISSUERS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STRENGTH. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE U.S. RECESSION, BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES FACES SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES DUE TO THE LACK OF CONSUMER SPENDING AND THE EXTREME LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN THE GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. WHILE MICHIGAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DECLINED IN RECENT MONTHS, IT IS STILL AMONG THE HIGHEST OF ALL STATES. 

WHILE WE BELIEVE WE STARTED TO SEE SOME POSITIVE TRENDS IN THE MICHIGAN ECONOMY IN 2010, THE GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS CONTINUED TO HAVE AN OVERALL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS DURING 2010. IF CONDITIONS DO NOT SHOW SOME MEANINGFUL AND SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENT, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 

CURRENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN REAL ESTATE MARKETS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INDUSTRY, BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

DRAMATIC DECLINES IN THE HOUSING MARKET IN RECENT YEARS, WITH FALLING HOME PRICES AND INCREASING FORECLOSURES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS OF ASSET VALUES BY US AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE WRITE-DOWNS HAVE CAUSED MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, TO MERGE WITH LARGER AND STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, TO FAIL. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONDITIONS, MANY LENDERS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE REDUCED, AND IN SOME CASES CEASED TO PROVIDE, FUNDING TO BORROWERS INCLUDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE MICHIGAN ECONOMY STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN 2010, IT IS POSSIBLE CONDITIONS WILL NOT STABILIZE OR RECOVER AT OR EVEN CLOSE TO THE PACE EXPECTED. 

THIS MARKET TURMOIL AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DELINQUENCIES, LACK OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, INCREASED MARKET VOLATILITY, AND WIDESPREAD REDUCTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY GENERALLY. THE RESULTING LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT, LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND REDUCED BUSINESS ACTIVITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

FURTHER NEGATIVE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS AND MAY CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES. A WORSENING OF THESE CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY EXACERBATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THESE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS ON US AND OTHERS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

EVENTS IN THE VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT INDUSTRY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE INCREASED OUR CREDIT RISK AND REPUTATION RISK AND COULD EXPOSE US TO FURTHER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. 

ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, MEPCO, IS ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING AND SERVICING PAYMENT PLANS FOR CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASE VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THE RECEIVABLES GENERATED IN THIS BUSINESS INVOLVE A DIFFERENT, AND GENERALLY HIGHER, LEVEL OF RISK OF DELINQUENCY OR COLLECTION THAN GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS OF OUR BANK. UPON CANCELLATION OF THE PAYMENT PLANS ACQUIRED BY MEPCO (WHETHER DUE TO VOLUNTARY CANCELLATION BY THE CONSUMER OR NON-PAYMENT), THE THIRD PARTY ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICE CONTRACTS OR OTHER PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS BECOME OBLIGATED TO REFUND MEPCO THE UNEARNED PORTION OF THE SALES PRICE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY MEPCO. THE REFUND OBLIGATIONS OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES ARE NOT FULLY SECURED. 

IN ADDITION, SEVERAL OF THESE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE COUNTERPARTY DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT RISK FACTOR BELOW AND OTHER COMPANIES FROM WHICH MEPCO HAS PURCHASED PAYMENT PLANS, HAVE BEEN SUED OR ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF TELEMARKETING LAWS AND OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. THE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT PRIMARILY BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) BUT THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN CLASS ACTION AND OTHER PRIVATE LAWSUITS FILED. IN SOME CASES, THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PLACED INTO RECEIVERSHIP, FILED BANKRUPTCY, OR DISCONTINUED THEIR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLEGATIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO BLATANTLY ABUSIVE TELEMARKETING PRACTICES BY A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MARKETERS, HAVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY THAT HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND CUSTOMER CANCELLATIONS OF PURCHASED PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMIC RECESSION. IT IS POSSIBLE THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO CAUSE FEDERAL OR STATE LAWMAKERS TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO FURTHER REGULATE THE INDUSTRY. 

THESE EVENTS HAVE HAD AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON MEPCO IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST, WE FACE INCREASED RISK WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULTING IN THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO MEPCO WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR LOSSES IF THESE COUNTERPARTIES GO OUT OF BUSINESS. SECOND, THESE EVENTS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED SALES AND CUSTOMER CANCELLATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY, WHICH HAS HAD AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF MEPCO S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IF ANY FEDERAL OR STATE INVESTIGATION IS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FINANCE COMPANIES SUCH AS MEPCO, MEPCO WILL FACE ADDITIONAL LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH INVESTIGATION. AN INCREASED LEVEL OF PRIVATE ACTIONS IN WHICH MEPCO IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT WILL ALSO CAUSE MEPCO TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LEGAL EXPENSES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. FINALLY, MEPCO HAS INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES, IN GENERAL, IN DEALING WITH THESE INDUSTRY PROBLEMS. NET PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES TOTALED 201.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY 7.9 OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND 406.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY 13.7 OF TOTAL ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES WILL DECLINE AT A MORE MODERATE PACE DURING 2011. THIS DECLINE IN PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN. 

MEPCO HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO A SINGLE COUNTERPARTY THAT FILED BANKRUPTCY IN 2010. THE CHARGES WE HAVE TAKEN FOR EXPECTED LOSSES RELATED TO THE FAILURE OF THIS COUNTERPARTY HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IF ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED THE CHARGES WE HAVE TAKEN, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL. 

MEPCO HAD PURCHASED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PAYMENT PLANS FROM A SINGLE COUNTERPARTY THAT DECLARED BANKRUPTCY ON MARCH 1, 2010. THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES PURCHASED FROM THIS COUNTERPARTY AND OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 29.0 MILLION (COMPARED TO 206.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009). IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THIS COUNTERPARTY OWED MEPCO 49.2 MILLION FOR PREVIOUSLY CANCELLED PAYMENT PLANS. THE BANKRUPTCY AND WIND DOWN OF OPERATIONS BY THIS COUNTERPARTY IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL LOSSES AS THIS ENTITY WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO HONOR ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS ON PAYMENT PLANS THAT MEPCO HAD PURCHASED WHICH ARE CANCELLED PRIOR TO PAYMENT IN FULL. MEPCO WILL SEEK TO RECOVER AMOUNTS OWED BY THE COUNTERPARTY FROM VARIOUS CO-OBLIGORS AND GUARANTORS, THROUGH THE LIQUIDATION OF CERTAIN COLLATERAL HELD BY MEPCO, AND THROUGH CLAIMS AGAINST THIS COUNTERPARTY S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. IN THE LAST HALF OF 2009, MEPCO ESTABLISHED A 19.0 MILLION RESERVE FOR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COUNTERPARTY. DURING 2010 THIS RESERVE WAS INCREASED BY 3.6 MILLION, TO 22.6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, MEPCO HAD RECORDED A RECEIVABLE OF 3.4 MILLION FOR DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING AND ASSOCIATED PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SINGLE COUNTERPARTY. 

27 

WE BELIEVE OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWING TO MEPCO AS A RESULT OF THIS COUNTERPARTY'S FAILURE ARE REASONABLE, AND WE BASED THEM ON OUR GOOD FAITH JUDGMENTS USING DATA CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF RESERVES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND THE VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT COUNTERPARTY CONTINGENCIES EXPENSE THAT WE HAVE RECORDED ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN OUR ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES AT THE APPLICABLE BALANCE SHEET DATE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE NUMEROUS AND COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS MADE, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE RESERVES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED RELATED TO THE FAILURE OF THIS COUNTERPARTY WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE ACTUAL LOSSES WE MAY INCUR, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE NEXT RISK FACTOR. 

THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE IN CALCULATING ESTIMATED POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR MEPCO MAY BE INACCURATE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOSSES THAT ARE MATERIALLY GREATER THAN THE CHARGES WE HAVE TAKEN TO DATE. 

WE MAKE A NUMBER OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR MEPCO, INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY COULD DISCONTINUE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THE CANCELLATION RATES FOR OUTSTANDING PAYMENT PLANS, THE VALUE OF AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ANY COLLATERAL SECURING THE AMOUNTS OWED TO MEPCO UPON CANCELLATION OF OUTSTANDING PAYMENT PLANS, AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT SUCH AMOUNTS FROM OTHER COUNTERPARTIES OBLIGATED TO MEPCO. IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE APPROXIMATELY PAST 18 TO 24 MONTHS THAT EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED THAT HAVE LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT COUNTERPARTY CONTINGENCIES EXPENSE. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT COUNTERPARTY CONTINGENCIES EXPENSE RECORDED IN PAST YEARS HAS GROWN FROM 0 IN 2007, TO 1.0 MILLION IN 2008, TO 31.2 MILLION IN 2009, AND DECLINED TO 18.6 MILLION IN 2010. AS A RESULT, MEPCO DOES NOT HAVE MUCH HISTORICAL DATA TO DRAW FROM IN MAKING THE ASSUMPTIONS NECESSARY TO PREDICT PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES (SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER FROM SERVICE CONTRACT ADMINISTRATORS AMOUNTS FUNDED BY MEPCO TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT SELLER). IF ACTUAL CANCELLATION RATES ARE HIGHER THAN WE ESTIMATED OR IF ACTUAL COUNTERPARTY REPAYMENTS ARE LESS THAN WE ESTIMATED, THE AMOUNT OF OUR RESERVES MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR ACTUAL LOSSES, AND THE ADDITIONAL LOSSES WE INCUR COULD BE MATERIAL. MOREOVER, WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BRING SUIT AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES IN ORDER TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO MEPCO. WE EXPECT WE WILL NEED TO INITIATE ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AGAINST OTHER COUNTERPARTIES THAT DO NOT PAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO MEPCO, WHICH ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE, AND ACTUAL EVENTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY ONE OR MORE OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS. IN THAT CASE, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL, AND POSSIBLY MATERIAL, LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE CHARGES WE HAVE TAKEN. 

MEPCO HAS HISTORICALLY CONTRIBUTED A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF PROFIT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT THE SIZE OF ITS BUSINESS SHRUNK SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2010 AND MAY CONTINUE TO SHRINK, ALBEIT AT A MORE MODERATE PACE. 

FOR 2008 AND 2007, MEPCO HAD NET INCOME OF 10.7 MILLION AND 5.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WITH THE COUNTERPARTY LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY MEPCO LATE IN 2009 (INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE COUNTERPARTY DESCRIBED ABOVE) AND A 16.7 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, MEPCO INCURRED AN 11.7 MILLION LOSS IN 2009. FOR 2010, MEPCO REPORTED A NET LOSS OF 1.4 MILLION. 

NET PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES TOTALED 201.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY 7.9 OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND 406.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY 13.7 OF TOTAL ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THIS REPRESENTS A DECLINE OF OVER 50 IN 2010. WE EXPECT THAT THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES WILL DECLINE AT A MORE MODERATE PACE DURING 2011. THIS DECLINE IN PAYMENT PLAN RECEIVABLES HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN. 

MEPCO S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AND PRESENTS UNIQUE OPERATIONAL AND INTERNAL CONTROL CHALLENGES. 

MEPCO FACES UNIQUE OPERATIONAL AND INTERNAL CONTROL CHALLENGES DUE TO THE RELATIVELY RAPID TURNOVER OF ITS PORTFOLIO AND HIGH VOLUME OF NEW PAYMENT PLANS. MEPCO S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED, AND ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF ITS EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES FAMILIAR WITH ITS BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE ACTIVITY IN THIS MARKET IS CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNAFFILIATED VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT DIRECT MARKETERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED NATIONWIDE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL SUPERVISORY OVERSIGHT IS GENERALLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN OUR BANK. THE RISK OF THIRD PARTY FRAUD IS ALSO HIGHER AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS. ACTS OF FRAUD ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND DETER, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE INVESTORS THAT THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS WILL PREVENT LOSSES FROM FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AT MEPCO, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSS IN THIS BUSINESS. 

28 

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE ADEQUATE FUNDING. OUR USE OF WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES EXPOSES US TO LIQUIDITY RISK AND POTENTIAL EARNINGS VOLATILITY. 

WE RELY ON WHOLESALE FUNDING, INCLUDING FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK BORROWINGS, BROKERED DEPOSITS, AND FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BORROWINGS, TO AUGMENT OUR CORE DEPOSITS TO FUND OUR BUSINESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR USE OF SUCH WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 344.6 MILLION OR 14.8 OF TOTAL FUNDING. BECAUSE WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FROM WHOLESALE SOURCES MAY BE DEPENDENT ON THE CONFIDENCE THESE PARTIES HAVE IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER BANKING OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY TO US OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES IS UNCERTAIN, AND BROKERED DEPOSITS MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR REPLACE AT ATTRACTIVE RATES AS THEY MATURE. OUR LIQUIDITY WILL BE CONSTRAINED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW OUR WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES OR IF ADEQUATE FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE AT ACCEPTABLE RATES OF INTEREST OR AT ALL. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND NEW LOANS, AND WE MAY NEED TO LIQUIDATE LOANS OR OTHER ASSETS UNEXPECTEDLY, IN ORDER TO REPAY OBLIGATIONS AS THEY MATURE. 

THE CONSTRAINT ON OUR LIQUIDITY WOULD BE EXACERBATED IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN OUR CORE DEPOSITS, AND WE CANNOT BE SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF CORE DEPOSITS. IN PARTICULAR, THOSE DEPOSITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNINSURED OR THOSE DEPOSITS THAT WERE IN THE FDIC TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE PROGRAM TAGP ), WHICH EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2010, MAY BE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUTFLOW, ALTHOUGH THE DODD-FRANK ACT EXTENDED PROTECTION SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED UNDER THE TAGP THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012 FOR ONLY NON-INTEREST BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WE HAD 156.9 MILLION OF UNINSURED DEPOSITS AND AN ADDITIONAL 139.0 MILLION OF DEPOSITS THAT WERE IN NON-INTEREST BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AND FULLY INSURED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012 UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT. A REDUCTION IN CORE DEPOSITS WOULD INCREASE OUR NEED TO RELY ON WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES, AT A TIME WHEN OUR ABILITY TO DO SO MAY BE MORE RESTRICTED, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 

AS A RESULT OF THESE LIQUIDITY RISKS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR LEVEL OF OVERNIGHT CASH BALANCES IN INTEREST-BEARING ACCOUNTS TO 336.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 FROM 223.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED LONGER-TERM (TWO TO FIVE YEARS) CALLABLE BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND REDUCED CERTAIN SECURED BORROWINGS TO INCREASE AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES. WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS WILL ASSIST US IN MEETING OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS DURING 2011. HOWEVER, THESE ACTIONS HAVE HAD AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN. NET INTEREST INCOME TOTALED 111.7 MILLION DURING 2010, WHICH REPRESENTS A 26.9 MILLION OR 19.4 DECREASE FROM 2009. THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 REFLECTS DECLINE IN OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. 

IN ADDITION, IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED UNDER FEDERAL REGULATORY STANDARDS, WE WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM ACCEPTING OR RENEWING BROKERED DEPOSITS WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT OF THE FDIC. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD BROKERED DEPOSITS OF APPROXIMATELY 273.5 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY 22.2 MILLION OF THESE BROKERED DEPOSITS MATURE DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS BROKERED DEPOSITS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

MOREOVER, WE CANNOT BE SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF CORE DEPOSITS. OUR DEPOSIT CUSTOMERS COULD MOVE THEIR DEPOSITS IN REACTION TO MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT BANK FAILURES IN GENERAL OR, PARTICULARLY, IF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE TO DETERIORATE FURTHER. A REDUCTION IN CORE DEPOSITS WOULD INCREASE OUR NEED TO RELY ON WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES, AT A TIME WHEN OUR ABILITY TO DO SO MAY BE MORE RESTRICTED, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING OR IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON MORE EXPENSIVE FUNDING SOURCES. IN SUCH CASE, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

DIVIDENDS BEING DEFERRED ON OUR OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OUR OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK ARE ACCUMULATING AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME SUCH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AT ANY TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 

WE ARE CURRENTLY DEFERRING PAYMENT OF QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY THE TREASURY, WHICH PAYS CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS QUARTERLY AT A RATE OF 5 PER ANNUM THROUGH FEBRUARY 14, 2014, AND 9 PER ANNUM THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT TO DEFER ALL QUARTERLY INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES WE ISSUED TO OUR TRUST SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT, ALL QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON THE RELATED TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE ALSO BEING DEFERRED. WE MAY DEFER SUCH INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR A TOTAL OF 20 CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR QUARTERS WITHOUT CAUSING AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE DOCUMENTS GOVERNING THESE SECURITIES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, WE MUST PAY ALL DEFERRED INTEREST AND RESUME QUARTERLY INTEREST PAYMENTS OR WE WILL BE IN DEFAULT. 

29 

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON OUR OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES OR OUR OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK. IF AND WHEN EITHER OF SUCH PAYMENTS RESUME, HOWEVER, THE ACCRUED AMOUNTS MUST BE PAID AND MADE CURRENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE AMOUNT OF THESE ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WAS 5.0 MILLION. 

WE FACE UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP STABILIZE THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM, ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT CAUSED THE RECENT CRISIS IN THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS, OR OTHERWISE REGULATE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. 

BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED NEW LAWS INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM. SEE BUSINESS REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS ABOVE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, AS TO THE ACTUAL IMPACT THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE EXTREME LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND LIMITED CREDIT AVAILABILITY CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED. THE FAILURE OF THESE AND OTHER PROGRAMS TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND A CONTINUATION OR WORSENING OF DEPRESSED FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ACCESS TO CREDIT, OR THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

IN ADDITION, ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US. FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 21, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE DODD-FRANK ACT INTO LAW, WHICH INCLUDES THE CREATION OF A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WITH POWER TO PROMULGATE AND, WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH MORE THAN 10 BILLION IN ASSETS, ENFORCE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS, THE CREATION OF A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY WITH AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT MIGHT POSE A SYSTEMIC RISK, PROVISIONS AFFECTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OF ALL COMPANIES WHOSE SECURITIES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, A PROVISION THAT WILL BROADEN THE BASE FOR FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS AND PERMANENTLY INCREASE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE TO 250,000, A PROVISION UNDER WHICH INTERCHANGE FEES FOR DEBIT CARDS OF ISSUERS WITH AT LEAST 10 BILLION IN ASSETS WILL BE SET BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER A RESTRICTIVE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL COST PER TRANSACTION STANDARD, A PROVISION THAT WILL REQUIRE BANK REGULATORS TO SET MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE AS STRONG AS THOSE REQUIRED FOR THEIR INSURED DEPOSITORY SUBSIDIARIES, SUBJECT TO A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH LESS THAN 15 BILLION IN ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND NEW RESTRICTIONS ON HOW MORTGAGE BROKERS AND LOAN ORIGINATORS MAY BE COMPENSATED. WHEN IMPLEMENTED, THESE PROVISIONS MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR EARN CERTAIN FEES AND BY EXPOSING US TO INCREASED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER COSTS. MANY ASPECTS OF THE NEW LAW REQUIRE FEDERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED, SO THE FULL IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT IS NOT YET KNOWN. THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL AS OTHER SIMILAR FEDERAL INITIATIVES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE HAVE CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. 

WE MAINTAIN DIVERSIFIED SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS, WHICH INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS OF THE TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES AS WELL AS SECURITIES ISSUED BY STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. WE ALSO INVEST IN CAPITAL SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE PREFERRED STOCKS AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. WE SEEK TO LIMIT CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS BY GENERALLY PURCHASING ONLY HIGHLY RATED SECURITIES (RATED AA OR HIGHER BY A MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCY) OR BY CONDUCTING SIGNIFICANT DUE DILIGENCE ON THE ISSUER FOR UNRATED SECURITIES. HOWEVER, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES ON SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN OUR PORTFOLIO TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 5.2 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 (COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009). WE BELIEVE THESE UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD AS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITIES TO MATURITY OR UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE UNREALIZED LOSSES REVERSE. HOWEVER, WE EVALUATE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE FOR OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI) AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. THOSE EVALUATIONS MAY RESULT IN OTTI CHARGES TO OUR EARNINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WE MAY, IN THE FUTURE, EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHARGES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

30 

OUR MORTGAGE-BANKING REVENUES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUBSTANTIAL VARIATIONS DEPENDENT LARGELY UPON FACTORS THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL, SUCH AS MARKET INTEREST RATES. 

A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM GAINS ON THE SALE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS. WE REALIZED NET GAINS OF 12.3 MILLION ON THE SALE OF MORTGAGE LOANS DURING 2010 COMPARED TO 10.9 MILLION DURING 2009. THESE NET GAINS PRIMARILY DEPEND ON THE VOLUME OF LOANS WE SELL, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ORIGINATE REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS AND THE DEMAND FOR FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER LOANS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR ESTABLISHED INTEREST-RATE RISK PARAMETERS. NET GAINS ON REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CAN OFTEN BE A VOLATILE PART OF OUR OVERALL REVENUES. 

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. 

WE REALIZE INCOME PRIMARILY FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST EARNED ON LOANS AND INVESTMENTS AND THE INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS. OUR INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BY THE POLICIES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES INTENDED TO MANAGE THE RISKS OF OPERATING IN A CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN AVOIDING UNDUE INTEREST RATE RISK. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE GAPS IN THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITIES OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, MEANING THAT EITHER OUR INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES WILL BE MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES THAN OUR INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, OR VICE VERSA. IN EITHER EVENT, IF MARKET INTEREST RATES SHOULD MOVE CONTRARY TO OUR POSITION, THIS GAP WILL WORK AGAINST US, AND OUR EARNINGS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. 

WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT FLUCTUATIONS OF MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING: 

INFLATION OR DEFLATION RATES; 

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY; 

RECESSION; 

UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS; 

MONEY SUPPLY; 

DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN EVENTS; AND 

INSTABILITY IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL MARKETS. 

WE RELY HEAVILY ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, AND THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF KEY MANAGERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR CAPITAL PLAN AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES. 

THE CONTINUITY OF OUR OPERATIONS IS INFLUENCED STRONGLY BY OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND TO RETAIN SENIOR MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCED IN BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS OF EACH OF OUR LINES OF BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT TO SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL PLAN AND OUR STRATEGIES. WE DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT OR NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVES OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES (ALTHOUGH WE RECENTLY ENTERED INTO A CONSULTING AND TRANSITION AGREEMENT WITH OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECENTLY ANNOUNCED MANAGEMENT TRANSITION PLAN). IN ADDITION, WE FACE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPENSATE OUR EXECUTIVES AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CPP UNDER TARP. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS DO NOT FACE THESE SAME RESTRICTIONS. THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF SERVICES OF ANY KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, OR THE INABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

COMPETITION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. 

WE FACE VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING SAVINGS BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, AND CREDIT UNIONS. A NUMBER OF THESE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES AND LENDING LIMITS, LARGER BRANCH SYSTEMS, AND A WIDER ARRAY OF BANKING SERVICES. TO A LIMITED EXTENT, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUCH AS MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, CONSUMER FINANCE COMPANIES, AND INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME DEGREE OF REGULATION AS THAT IMPOSED ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, THESE NON-BANK COMPETITORS MAY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US IN PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES, AND THIS COMPETITION MAY REDUCE OR LIMIT OUR MARGINS ON BANKING SERVICES, REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

WE WILL FACE CHALLENGES IN OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE FUTURE GROWTH IN THE NEAR TERM. 

OUR CURRENT CAPITAL POSITION HAS PREVENTED US FROM PURSUING ANY MEANINGFUL GROWTH INITIATIVES, AND WE HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO SHRINK OUR BALANCE SHEET. OUR CURRENT FOCUS, AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT 13 TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR CAPITAL BASE, AS OPPOSED TO PURSUING GROWTH. 

31 

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 

WE ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, SUPERVISION, AND EXAMINATION BY FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING AUTHORITIES. THE BURDEN OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE HAS INCREASED UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATION AND BANKING REGULATIONS AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. RECENT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES AS WELL AS CHANGES IN REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, FUTURE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES COULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON US. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS MAY BE ENACTED OR ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR POWERS, AUTHORITY, AND OPERATIONS; INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS; AND, AS A RESULT, GIVE AN ADVANTAGE TO OUR COMPETITORS WHO MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, REGULATORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION AND POWER TO PREVENT OR REMEDY UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES OR VIOLATIONS OF LAWS BY BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR SUPERVISORY AND ENFORCEMENT DUTIES. THE EXERCISE OF REGULATORY POWER MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT BANK FAILURES, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE AS ADDITIONAL BANKS FAIL. THESE REPORTS HAVE CREATED CONCERNS AMONG CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH DEPOSIT BALANCES IN EXCESS OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE LIMITS. 

WE HAVE PROACTIVELY SOUGHT TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO OUR DEPOSIT CUSTOMERS ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO RETAIN OUR BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIPS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MEANINGFUL LOSS OF CORE DEPOSITS, NOR HAVE WE HAD TO OFFER ABOVE MARKET INTEREST RATES IN ORDER TO RETAIN OUR CORE DEPOSITS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT BE SURE WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING THE MAJORITY OF OUR CORE DEPOSIT BASE. THE OUTFLOW OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEPOSITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

INCREASES IN FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS. 

AS AN FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENTS TO THE FDIC. DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES BEGINNING IN 2008, THE FDIC HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO RESTORE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND. OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE EXPENSE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2009 COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIODS, REFLECTING HIGHER RATES AND A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF 1.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. THIS INDUSTRY-WIDE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT WAS EQUAL TO 5 BASIS POINTS ON OUR TOTAL ASSETS LESS OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, OUR BALANCE OF TOTAL DEPOSITS INCREASED DURING 2009. DURING 2007, WE FULLY UTILIZED THE ASSESSMENT CREDITS THAT REDUCED OUR EXPENSE DURING THAT YEAR. 

UNDER THE FDIC S RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS, ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE PLACED INTO ONE OF FOUR CATEGORIES AND ASSESSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS BASED PRIMARILY ON THEIR LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY EVALUATIONS. DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS CURRENTLY RANGE FROM 0.07 TO 0.78 OF AVERAGE DOMESTIC DEPOSITS, DEPENDING ON AN INSTITUTION'S RISK CLASSIFICATION AND OTHER FACTORS. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2011, BANKS WILL BE CHARGED FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS BASED ON NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS THE QUARTER TO DATE AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL ASSETS LESS THE QUARTER TO DATE AVERAGE DAILY TIER 1 CAPITAL) RATHER THAN BASED ON AVERAGE DOMESTIC DEPOSITS. INITIAL BASE ASSESSMENT RATES WILL VARY FROM 0.05 TO 0.35 OF NET ASSETS AND MAY BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN NEGATIVE 0.025 AND POSITIVE 0.10 FOR AN UNSECURED DEBT ADJUSTMENT AND A BROKERED DEPOSIT ADJUSTMENT. ASSUMING THAT WE REMAIN IN THE SAME RISK CATEGORY, WE EXPECT THAT THIS NEW FDIC ASSESSMENT SYSTEM WILL RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS. HOWEVER, IF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WORSENS AND OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL DETERIORATES FURTHER, OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE EXPENSE MAY INCREASE. THE AMOUNT OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BANK FAILURES AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES. SUCH INCREASES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

INITIATIVES WE MAY TAKE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR CAPITAL PLAN COULD BE HIGHLY DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. 

OUR CAPITAL PLAN CONTEMPLATES CAPITAL RAISING INITIATIVES THAT INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS DESCRIBED UNDER "BUSINESS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS" ABOVE. WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY RE-EVALUATING THE BEST STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENT OUR CAPITAL PLAN, ANY PURSUIT OF THESE CAPITAL RAISING INITIATIVES IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR VOTING POWER. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF THE CAPITAL RAISING TRANSACTIONS WE MAY ENTER INTO OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR. 

32 

IT IS POSSIBLE THE TREASURY OR ONE OR MORE PRIVATE INVESTORS COULD END UP OWNING A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR STOCK AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OUR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS. 

ONE OF THE PRIMARY CAPITAL RAISING INITIATIVES SET FORTH IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN CONSISTS OF THE CONVERSION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY THE TREASURY INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS DESCRIBED UNDER "BUSINESS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS" ABOVE, THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK CURRENTLY HELD BY THE TREASURY IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY SUCH CONVERSION IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN THE TREASURY OWNING A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, PERHAPS OVER 50 . 

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DESIGNATED MATTERS, THE TREASURY HAS AGREED TO VOTE ALL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ACQUIRED UPON CONVERSION OF THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OR UPON EXERCISE OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED WARRANT THAT ARE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY IT AND ITS CONTROLLED AFFILIATES IN THE SAME PROPORTION (FOR, AGAINST, OR ABSTAIN) AS ALL OTHER SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE VOTED. THE "DESIGNATED MATTERS" ARE (I) THE ELECTION AND REMOVAL OF OUR DIRECTORS, (II) THE APPROVAL OF ANY MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR SIMILAR TRANSACTION THAT REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, (III) THE APPROVAL OF A SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS OR PROPERTY, (IV) THE APPROVAL OF OUR DISSOLUTION, (V) THE APPROVAL OF ANY ISSUANCE OF ANY OF OUR SECURITIES ON WHICH OUR SHAREHOLDERS ARE ENTITLED TO VOTE, (VI) THE APPROVAL OF ANY AMENDMENT TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS ON WHICH OUR SHAREHOLDERS ARE ENTITLED TO VOTE, AND (VII) THE APPROVAL OF ANY OTHER MATTERS REASONABLY INCIDENTAL TO THE FOREGOING AS DETERMINED BY THE TREASURY. 

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE INVESTORS, OTHER THAN THE TREASURY, COULD END UP AS THE OWNER OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THIS COULD OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE TREASURY TRANSFERS SHARES OF THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK IT HOLDS OR, UPON CONVERSION OF SUCH STOCK, TRANSFERS TO A THIRD PARTY THE COMMON STOCK ISSUED UPON CONVERSION. IT ALSO COULD OCCUR IF ONE OR MORE LARGE INVESTORS MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN ANY OFFERING OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK THAT WE UNDERTAKE. 

SUBJECT TO THE VOTING LIMITATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE TREASURY AND ITS CONTROLLED AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, ANY SUCH SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER COULD EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON MATTERS SUBMITTED TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION, HAVING A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER COULD MAKE FUTURE TRANSACTIONS MORE DIFFICULT OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF SUCH SHAREHOLDER, WHOSE INTERESTS MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH INTERESTS OF SMALLER SHAREHOLDERS. THESE POSSIBILITIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WE ISSUED TO THE TREASURY CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT AUTOMATICALLY INCREASES THE SIZE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BY TWO PERSONS AND ALLOWS THE TREASURY TO FILL THE TWO NEW DIRECTOR POSITIONS AT SUCH TIME, IF ANY, AS DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR AN AGGREGATE OF SIX QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PERIODS OR MORE, WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEFERRING QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK. IF WE CONTINUE TO DEFER DIVIDENDS EACH QUARTER, THE TREASURY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPOINT THESE TWO DIRECTORS BEGINNING IN APPROXIMATELY AUGUST 2011. 

AN OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD TRIGGER AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE UNDER FEDERAL TAX LAW THAT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND OTHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD FEDERAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF APPROXIMATELY 56.1 MILLION. UNDER FEDERAL TAX LAW, OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THIS CARRYFORWARD AND OTHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS LIMITED IF WE ARE DEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PURSUANT TO SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. PLEASE SEE THE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE TAX RULES UNDER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT 13 TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH RESULTS VARY FROM THE EXPECTATIONS OF MANAGEMENT, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND INVESTORS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO FURTHER LOAN LOSSES OR VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT COUNTERPARTY CONTINGENCIES EXPENSES WE MAY INCUR; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE MAY ENGAGE, INCLUDING THE INITIATIVES THAT ARE PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLAN; 

MARKET ASSESSMENTS REGARDING SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THE TIMING, TERMS, AND LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS OF ANY OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK; 

DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS THAT INVOLVE US; 

CHANGES OR PERCEIVED CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONS OR BUSINESS PROSPECTS; 

LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS; 

THE FAILURE OF GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO STABILIZE AND RECOVER, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN, AND THE PACE OF ANY SUCH STABILIZATION AND RECOVERY; 

THE POSSIBLE DELISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM NASDAQ OR PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DELISTING; 

THE OPERATING AND SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE OF COMPANIES THAT INVESTORS CONSIDER TO BE COMPARABLE TO US; 

FUTURE OFFERINGS BY US OF DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK, OR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, EACH OF WHICH WOULD BE SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK UPON LIQUIDATION AND FOR PURPOSES OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS; 

ACTIONS OF OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK BY EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS AND OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS; AND 

OTHER CHANGES IN U.S. OR GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, ECONOMIES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INTEREST OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, STOCK, COMMODITY, CREDIT OR ASSET VALUATIONS OR VOLATILITY. 

STOCK MARKETS IN GENERAL, AND OUR COMMON STOCK IN PARTICULAR, HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY SINCE OCTOBER 2007 AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME VOLATILITY. AS A RESULT, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR PROSPECTS. INCREASED VOLATILITY COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS. 
 PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS. WHILE THESE COSTS ARE USUALLY PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO NATURAL GAS ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES AND THEREFORE DO NOT POSE A DIRECT RISK TO EARNINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHAT EFFECT A SHARP INCREASE IN NATURAL GAS PRICES MAY HAVE ON OUR CUSTOMERS ENERGY CONSUMPTION OR ABILITY TO PAY. HIGHER PRICES TO CUSTOMERS CAN LEAD TO HIGHER BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND CUSTOMER CONSERVATION. HIGHER PRICES MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOW AS TYPICALLY WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR OUR NATURAL GAS PRIOR TO RECEIVING PAYMENTS FOR THE NATURAL GAS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. 
 OPERATIONAL ISSUES BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE NATURAL GAS DEPENDS BOTH ON OUR OWN OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES AND THAT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LOCAL GAS PRODUCERS AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINE OPERATORS FROM WHOM WE RECEIVE OUR NATURAL GAS SUPPLY. THE LOSS OF USE OR DESTRUCTION OF OUR FACILITIES OR THE FACILITIES OF THIRD PARTIES DUE TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS, BREAKDOWNS, WAR, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR OTHER OCCURRENCES COULD GREATLY REDUCE POTENTIAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND INCREASE OUR COSTS OF REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENT OF ASSETS. ALTHOUGH WE CARRY PROPERTY INSURANCE TO PROTECT OUR ASSETS AND HAVE REGULATORY AGREEMENTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE RECOVERY OF LOSSES FOR SUCH INCIDENTS (UNDER OUR RATE ORDER WE CAN DEFER EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES FOR FUTURE RECOVERY), OUR LOSSES MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE THROUGH INSURANCE OR CUSTOMER RATES. 
 SIGNIFICANTLY WARMER THAN NORMAL WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT THE SALE OF NATURAL GAS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS. 
 THE DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY WEATHER CONDITIONS. SIGNIFICANTLY WARMER THAN NORMAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREAS COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF LOWER GAS SALES. WE MITIGATE THE RISK OF WARMER WINTER WEATHER THROUGH THE WEATHER NORMALIZATION AND REVENUE DECOUPLING CLAUSES IN OUR TARIFFS. THESE CLAUSES ALLOW THE COMPANY TO SURCHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR UNDER RECOVERY OF REVENUE. 
 THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STORING AND TRANSPORTING NATURAL GAS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES. 
 THERE ARE INHERENT HAZARDS AND OPERATION RISKS IN GAS DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS LEAKS, ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSIONS AND MECHANICAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL LOSSES. THESE RISKS COULD, IF THEY OCCUR, RESULT IN THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE, SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, IMPAIRMENT OF OPERATIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. THE LOCATION OF PIPELINES AND STORAGE FACILITIES NEAR POPULATED AREAS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS, COMMERCIAL BUSINESS CENTERS AND INDUSTRIAL SITES, COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THESE RISKS. THESE ACTIVITIES MAY SUBJECT US TO LITIGATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS IS NOT FULLY COVERED BY INSURANCE, THEY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 CHANGES IN REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS. 
 OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWS THE ECONOMIC CYCLE OF THE CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE REGIONS: CORNING, BATH, VIRGIL, AND HAMMONDSPORT, NEW YORK. A FALLING, SLOW OR SLUGGISH ECONOMY THAT WOULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE DOING BUSINESS BY FORCING TEMPORARY PLANT SHUTDOWNS, CLOSING OPERATIONS OR SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH WOULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS POTENTIAL. 
 MANY OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS USE NATURAL GAS IN THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THESE CUSTOMERS MAY SEE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS, WHICH IN TURN MAY LEAD TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS THEY REQUIRE FOR PRODUCTION. 
 DURING ANY ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN THERE IS TYPICALLY AN INCREASE IN INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCIES. AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCIES WOULD INCREASE OUR BAD DEBT EXPENSES AND REDUCE OUR CASH FLOWS. 
 OUR EARNINGS MAY DECREASE IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTIONS. 
 OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE NYPSC. THE NYPSC APPROVES THE RATES THAT WE MAY CHARGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE REQUIRED IN A RATE PROCEEDING TO REDUCE THE RATES WE CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR RATE RELIEF FROM THE NYPSC, PARTICULARLY WHEN NECESSARY TO COVER INCREASED COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH MANDATED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, OUR EARNINGS WOULD DECREASE. 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH MICHAEL I. GERMAN, OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HE CAN TERMINATE HIS AGREEMENT ON NINETY DAYS NOTICE. OTHER SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES, WHO HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS, MAY TERMINATE THEIR EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 PAGE 4 
 CONCENTRATION OF SHARE OWNERSHIP AMONG OUR LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS MAY PREVENT OTHER SHAREHOLDERS FROM INFLUENCING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DECISIONS. 
 THE FIVE LARGEST HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK OWN OVER 63 OF THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, IF ANY CHOSE TO ACT TOGETHER, THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERT SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER ALL MATTERS REQUIRING APPROVAL BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE ELECTION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS AND ANY PROPOSED MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. THIS CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP COULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO OTHER SHAREHOLDERS WITH DIFFERING INTERESTS FROM THESE SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXTRAORDINARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. 
 WE MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO MEET ALL OF OUR CASH NEEDS. AS PART OF OUR 2009 RATE ORDER SET BY THE NYPSC, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO UPGRADE OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE DEBT RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE MADE CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY COMMITMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND OTHER COMMITMENTS. 
 WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING. 
 IN ORDER TO FUND OUR EXTRAORDINARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING.THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND COULD RESULT IN OPERATING AND FINANCING COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY HAVE UNACCEPTABLE TERMS OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDING: 
 LIMITS PLACED ON US BY OUR CURRENT LENDERS IN OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS, 

OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS, 

OUR INABILITY TO MEET OUR BUSINESS PLAN, 

LENDERS OR INVESTORS PERCEPTION OF, AND DEMAND FOR, SECURITIES OF NATURAL GAS UTILITIES, AND 

CONDITIONS OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE FUNDS. 

IF WE CANNOT RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FINANCE THE EXPANSION AND MANDATED UPGRADING OF OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR UNANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. 
 THE COMPANY S PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED COMPETITION. 
 WE ARE IN A GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WITH A NUMBER OF INTERSTATE PIPELINES AND LOCAL PRODUCTION SOURCES. IF A MAJOR CUSTOMER DECIDED TO CONNECT DIRECTLY TO EITHER AN INTERSTATE PIPELINE OR A LOCAL PRODUCER, OUR EARNINGS AND REVENUES WOULD DECREASE.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
THAT HAS MANY RISKS. LISTED BELOW ARE SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL RISK FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY AND THE OFFSHORE MARINE SERVICE INDUSTRY AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. THE EFFECT OF ANY ONE RISK FACTOR
OR A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL RISK FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS AND THE ACCURACY OF ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT MADE IN THIS FORM 10-K. OIL AND GAS PRICES ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE COMMODITY PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE. PRICES ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO THE SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP FOR THE RESPECTIVE NATURAL RESOURCES. HIGH DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND/OR LOW INVENTORY LEVELS
FOR THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS ANY PERCEPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS CAN CAUSE COMMODITY PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS TO RISE, WHILE GENERALLY, LOW DEMAND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND/OR INCREASES IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES
CAUSE COMMODITY PRICES FOR THE RESPECTIVE NATURAL RESOURCES TO DECREASE. FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT
LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ABILITY TO CONTROL CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION LEVELS AND PRICING, AS WELL AS, THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION BY NON-OPEC COUNTRIES; POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES;
ADVANCES IN EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY; WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES; SIGNIFICANT WEATHER CONDITIONS; AND GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY S PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS ARE MAJOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COMPANIES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING BY THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. THE ENERGY INDUSTRY S LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING IS SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE DEMAND FOR THE RESOURCE AND THE PREVAILING COMMODITY PRICE OF NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE
OIL. DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES, THE COMPANY S CUSTOMERS GENERALLY REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL SPENDING BUDGETS FOR OFFSHORE DRILLING, EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT. HISTORICALLY, STRONG FUNDAMENTALS SUCH AS HIGH COMMODITY PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL, TIGHT INVENTORY LEVELS FOR THE RESOURCES ALONG WITH STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND HAVE BEEN POSITIVE INDICATORS FOR INCREASES IN
CAPITAL SPENDING BY THE COMPANY S CUSTOMERS. OTHER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE: WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THE COST OF
EXPLORING AND PRODUCING OIL AND NATURAL GAS WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, SIGNIFICANT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT AFFECT ENERGY AND ITS USAGE. THE OFFSHORE MARINE SERVICE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THE
COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE AND QUALITY OF SERVICE BY VESSEL OPERATORS AND THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF VESSELS. DECREASES IN THE LEVEL OF OFFSHORE DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY BY
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY GENERALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY S VESSELS THEREBY EXERTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON DAY RATES. EXTENDED PERIODS OF LOW VESSEL DEMAND AND/OR LOW DAY RATES WILL REDUCE THE COMPANY S REVENUES.
 EXCESS MARINE SERVICE CAPACITY EXERTS DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON CHARTER RATES. EXCESS CAPACITY CAN OCCUR WHEN NEWLY CONSTRUCTED VESSELS ENTER THE MARKET AND
WHEN VESSELS ARE MOBILIZED BETWEEN MARKET AREAS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF SEVERAL VESSELS, IT HAS ALSO SOLD AND/OR SCRAPPED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VESSELS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AGING OF
THE COMPANY S FLEET THAT HAS NECESSITATED THE COMPANY S NEW VESSEL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS APPEARS IN THE VESSEL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS AND ACQUISITIONS SECTION OF ITEM 7.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL THE COMPANY S SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY S
AREA MANAGERS AND FLEET PERSONNEL, AND THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF A NUMBER OF THE COMPANY S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AREA MANAGERS, FLEET PERSONNEL OR OTHER KEY
EMPLOYEES, OR OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT REPLACEMENTS FOR SUCH PERSONNEL OR TO OTHERWISE ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD HARM THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT CARRY KEY EMPLOYEE LIFE INSURANCE PAYABLE TO THE
COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF ITS MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, 78 , 77 , AND 80 , RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY S TOTAL REVENUES WERE GENERATED BY INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY S INTERNATIONAL VESSEL OPERATIONS ARE VULNERABLE TO THE USUAL RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. SUCH RISKS INCLUDE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, POSSIBLE VESSEL SEIZURES OR
NATIONALIZATION OF ASSETS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MANAGEMENT OF OVERSEAS OPERATIONS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND REVALUATIONS, AND IMPORT/EXPORT RESTRICTIONS; ALL OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE
COMPANY. THE CONTINUED THREAT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND OTHER ACTS OF WAR, OR HOSTILITY, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE RISK OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL INSTABILITY IN SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM MAY BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DOMESTICALLY OR ABROAD AND SUCH ACTS OF TERRORISM COULD BE DIRECTED AGAINST
PROPERTIES AND PERSONNEL OF U.S.-OWNED COMPANIES SUCH AS OURS. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROPERTY LOSSES OR MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS A RESULT OF TERRORISM, POLITICAL
INSTABILITY OR WAR. AT PRESENT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE RISKS OF OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS AND, IN VIEW OF THE MOBILE
NATURE OF THE COMPANY S PRINCIPAL REVENUE PRODUCING ASSETS, DOES NOT CONSIDER THEM TO CONSTITUTE A FACTOR MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS INTERNATIONAL VESSEL OPERATIONS AS A WHOLE. OPERATIONAL RISKS INHERENT TO THE OFFSHORE MARINE INDUSTRY THE
OPERATION OF ANY MARINE VESSEL INVOLVES AN INHERENT RISK OF CATASTROPHIC MARINE DISASTER, ADVERSE WEATHER AND SEA CONDITIONS, MECHANICAL FAILURE, COLLISIONS, AND PROPERTY LOSSES TO VESSELS, AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DUE TO POLITICAL ACTION IN
COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. ANY SUCH EVENT MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN REVENUES OR INCREASED COSTS. THE COMPANY S VESSELS ARE INSURED FOR THEIR ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE AGAINST DAMAGE OR LOSS, INCLUDING WAR, TERRORISM ACTS, AND
POLLUTION RISKS. THE COMPANY ALSO CARRIES WORKERS COMPENSATION, MARITIME EMPLOYER S LIABILITY, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY, GENERAL LIABILITY (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY POLLUTION) AND OTHER INSURANCE CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY.
 POTENTIAL OVERCAPACITY IN THE OFFSHORE MARINE INDUSTRY THE WORLDWIDE OFFSHORE MARINE VESSEL MARKET FACES A POTENTIAL RISK OF OVERCAPACITY. AN ESTIMATED 548 NEW-BUILD VESSELS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE WORLDWIDE OFFSHORE VESSEL MARKET WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS (EXCLUDING THE NUMBER OF
VESSELS CURRENTLY BEING CONSTRUCTED BY THE COMPANY) AS REPORTED BY ODS-PETRODATA. AN INCREASE IN VESSEL CAPACITY WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF LOWERING CHARTER RATES WHICH IN TURN WOULD RESULT IN
LOWER REVENUES TO THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE WORLDWIDE OFFSHORE MARINE VESSEL INDUSTRY HAS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF AGING VESSELS WHOSE COLLECTIVE AGES ARE NEARING OR EXCEEDING THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE VESSELS. THESE OLDER VESSELS
COULD POTENTIALLY RETIRE FROM THE MARKET WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IF THE COST OF EXTENDING THE VESSELS ECONOMIC LIFE IS NOT ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIABLE. ALTHOUGH THE ATTRITION RATE OF THESE AGING VESSELS IS UNKNOWN, A REDUCTION IN WORLDWIDE
VESSEL CAPACITY MAY NEGATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS THE OFFSHORE MARINE INDUSTRY MAY ENCOUNTER WHEN THE NEW-BUILD VESSELS BEGIN BEING DELIVERED TO THE MARKET. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SAME PERIOD, OVER 150 NEW DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SUPPORT UNITS WILL
BE ADDED TO THE WORLDWIDE DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SUPPORT VESSEL FLEET, THAT MAY, IN TURN, IF FULLY UTILIZED, CREATE ADDITIONAL DEMAND AND MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF 548 NEW-BUILD VESSELS BEING ADDED TO THE OFFSHORE SUPPORT VESSEL FLEET.

 RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 

OUR RESERVES FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE BUSINESS, AS WELL AS RESERVES RELATED TO BUSINESSES WE MAY ACQUIRE IN THE
FUTURE, MAY PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCT LINES, WE ESTABLISH AND CARRY AS A LIABILITY ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED RESERVES THAT ARE CALCULATED TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CLAIMS. THESE RESERVES DO
NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF OUR FUTURE BENEFIT LIABILITIES BUT ARE INSTEAD ESTIMATES BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMY, CHANGES IN SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WORK ETHICS,
EMERGING MEDICAL PERCEPTIONS REGARDING PHYSIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES OF DISABILITY, EMERGING OR CHANGING HEALTH ISSUES AND CHANGES IN INDUSTRY REGULATION. CLAIMS EXPERIENCE ON OUR PRODUCTS CAN FLUCTUATE WIDELY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IF
ACTUAL EVENTS VARY MATERIALLY FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS USED WHEN ESTABLISHING THE RESERVES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CLAIMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE OUR RESERVES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. 

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND UNDERWRITING AND RESERVING ASSUMPTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUR LONG TERM
DISABILITY PRODUCTS PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CLAIMS INCURRED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. GENERALLY, GROUP POLICIES OFFER RATE GUARANTEES FOR PERIODS FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS. WHILE WE CAN PROSPECTIVELY RE-PRICE AND RE-UNDERWRITE COVERAGES AT THE END OF
THESE GUARANTEE PERIODS, WE MUST PAY BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS INCURRED DURING THESE PERIODS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO INCREASE GUARANTEED PREMIUM RATES DURING THESE PERIODS. HISTORICALLY, APPROXIMATELY 50 OF ALL CLAIMS FILED UNDER OUR LONG TERM
DISABILITY POLICIES CLOSE WITHIN 24 MONTHS. HOWEVER, CLAIMS CAUSED BY MORE SEVERE 

DISABLING CONDITIONS MAY BE PAID OVER MUCH LONGER PERIODS, INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, UP TO NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE OR LONGER. LONGER DURATION CLAIMS, IN
ADDITION TO A HIGHER VOLUME OF CLAIMS THAN WE EXPECT, EXPOSE US TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY PAY BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE ANTICIPATED WHEN THE POLICY WAS UNDERWRITTEN. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR LONG TERM DISABILITY PRODUCTS IS THUS
SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME OF UNDERWRITING. 

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATION RISK ON OUR GROUP LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS DUE TO THE NATURE OF GROUP LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO
GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION RISK FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF A CATASTROPHE. 

CATASTROPHIC LOSSES FROM A DISEASE PANDEMIC COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OUR LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF LOSS FROM AN
OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC MORTALITY CAUSED BY A DISEASE PANDEMIC, SUCH AS COULD ARISE FROM THE AVIAN FLU, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

CATASTROPHIC LOSSES FROM TERRORISM OR OTHER FACTORS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US AN OCCURRENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT, INCLUDING
NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORISM, OR OTHER DISASTERS, OR A CHANGE IN THE NATURE AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE AND CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO DISINTERMEDIATION RISK DURING PERIODS OF INCREASING INTEREST RATES IN PERIODS OF INCREASING INTEREST RATES, WITHDRAWALS OF ANNUITY
CONTRACTS MAY INCREASE AS POLICYHOLDERS SEEK TO INVEST IN INVESTMENTS WITH HIGHER PERCEIVED RETURNS. THIS PROCESS, REFERRED TO AS DISINTERMEDIATION, MAY LEAD TO CASH OUTFLOWS. THESE OUTFLOWS MAY REQUIRE INVESTMENT ASSETS TO BE SOLD AT A TIME WHEN
THE PRICES OF THOSE ASSETS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH ARE RELATIVELY
ILLIQUID, THUS INCREASING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK IN THE EVENT OF DISINTERMEDIATION DURING A PERIOD OF RISING INTEREST RATES.

 STANCORP FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING INTEREST RATES DURING PERIODS OF DECLINING INTEREST RATES, ANNUITY PRODUCTS MAY BE RELATIVELY
MORE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN INCREASES IN THE PERCENTAGE OF POLICIES REMAINING IN FORCE FROM YEAR TO YEAR DURING A PERIOD WHEN OUR NEW INVESTMENTS CARRY LOWER RETURNS. DURING THESE PERIODS, LOWER RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS COULD PROVE
INADEQUATE FOR US TO MEET CONTRACTUALLY GUARANTEED MINIMUM PAYMENTS TO HOLDERS OF OUR ANNUITY PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR LIFE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PRODUCTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY DECLINING INTEREST RATES. A FACTOR IN PRICING OUR
INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS PREVAILING INTEREST RATES. LONGER DURATION CLAIMS AND PREMIUM RATE GUARANTEE PERIODS CAN EXPOSE US TO INTEREST RATE RISK WHEN PORTFOLIO YIELDS ARE LESS THAN THOSE ASSUMED WHEN PRICING THESE PRODUCTS. MORTGAGES AND BONDS IN OUR
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PREPAID OR REDEEMED AS BORROWERS SEEK TO BORROW AT LOWER INTEREST RATES, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REINVEST THOSE FUNDS IN LOWER INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS. 

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF MARKET VALUE FLUCTUATIONS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND LIQUIDITY OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS
PRIMARILY CONSIST OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE. THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENTS VARY WITH CHANGING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO DEFAULT RISK ON OUR
FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND ITS CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON CREDIT SPREADS, AND DELINQUENCY AND DEFAULT RISK ON OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. DUE TO DECLINING VALUES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AND THE RELATED DECLINE IN MARKET ACTIVITY,
OUR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO HAS BECOME LESS LIQUID. OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ARE ALSO RELATIVELY ILLIQUID. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES, IN A TIMELY
MANNER, OR BOTH IF WE REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH ON SHORT NOTICE. 

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER INSURERS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES,
SUCH AS BANKS, BROKER-DEALERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, AND MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMPLOYER GROUPS, INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. SINCE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES, OFFER A BROADER ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND, WITH RESPECT
TO OTHER 

INSURERS, MAY HAVE HIGHER FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS THAN WE DO, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT ANY ONE OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY
COMPETITION, WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. 

A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS, WHICH RATE OUR CLAIMS PAYING
ABILITY, ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR COMPANY AND IN OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS. RATING ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUALLY REVIEW
THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR COMPANY. A SIGNIFICANT RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD INCREASE OUR SURRENDER LEVELS FOR OUR ANNUITY PRODUCTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, COULD
INCREASE COSTS OF FUTURE DEBT ISSUANCES, AND COULD THEREBY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. 

OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE STATE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL OR FUTURE STATE OR FEDERAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATION ON OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. 

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO LITIGATION RISK IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE A PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF OUR INSURANCE
BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT OPERATIONS. WE ARE FROM TIME TO TIME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF ANY PENDING OR FUTURE LITIGATION CANNOT BE PREDICTED, AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
ANY PENDING LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LITIGATION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

PART I 

THE CONCENTRATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA MAY SUBJECT US TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AS WELL AS CERTAIN CATASTROPHES IN THIS
STATE OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE WESTERN REGION OF THE U.S., PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THIS CONCENTRATION, WE ARE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE RISK OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN CALIFORNIA
AS WELL AS TO CERTAIN CATASTROPHES, SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES AND FIRES, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE REGION. ALTHOUGH WE DIVERSIFY OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO WITHIN CALIFORNIA BY BOTH LOCATION AND TYPE OF PROPERTY IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE EARTHQUAKE
EXPOSURE, SUCH DIVERSIFICATION MAY NOT ELIMINATE THE RISK OF SUCH LOSSES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. 

WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY FROM OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AS A COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LENDER, WE
CUSTOMARILY CONDUCT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO MAKING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE AND BEFORE TAKING TITLE THROUGH FORECLOSURE TO REAL ESTATE COLLATERALIZING DELINQUENT COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS HELD BY US. BASED ON OUR
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY COMPLIANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR ANY REMEDIATION OF AFFECTED PROPERTIES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL
CONDITION. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT MATERIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS WILL NOT BE INCURRED BY US. 

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, MAKE PAYMENTS
ON DEBT SECURITIES AND MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY FOR OUR INSURANCE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARIES AND DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OF OUR OWN. DIVIDENDS AND PERMITTED PAYMENTS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE
OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, MAKE PAYMENTS ON DEBT SECURITIES AND MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT SECURITIES PRIMARILY WILL DEPEND
UPON THE RECEIPT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NON-INSURANCE
BUSINESSES AND HAVE NO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, HOWEVER, ARE REGULATED BY 
 
 INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS THAT THEY COULD DECLARE AND PAY TO US WITHOUT
PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED. UNDER OREGON LAW, STANDARD INSURANCE COMPANY STANDARD MAY PAY DIVIDENDS ONLY FROM THE EARNED SURPLUS ARISING FROM ITS BUSINESS. OREGON LAW GIVES THE DIRECTOR OF THE
OREGON DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SERVICES INSURANCES DIVISION OREGON INSURANCE DIVISION BROAD DISCRETION REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF DIVIDENDS. OREGON LAW REQUIRES US TO RECEIVE THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE OREGON INSURANCE
DIVISION TO PAY A DIVIDEND IF SUCH DIVIDEND EXCEEDS CERTAIN STATUTORY LIMITATIONS; HOWEVER, IT IS AT THE OREGON INSURANCE DIVISION S DISCRETION TO REQUEST PRIOR APPROVAL OF DIVIDENDS AT ANY TIME. SEE PART II, ITEM 7,
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT DIVIDENDS FROM INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. 

OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE DEBT AND RAISE CAPITAL IN FUTURE YEARS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES BUT ALSO ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND
AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN THE MARKET WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEBT MATURITIES IN THE SHORT-TERM. OUR 10-YEAR SENIOR NOTES SENIOR NOTES OF 250 MILLION WILL MATURE IN SEPTEMBER 2012, AND OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SUBORDINATED DEBT OF 300 MILLION WILL MATURE IN 2067 WITH A CALL OPTION IN 2017. WE MAINTAIN A 200 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FACILITY FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH WILL EXPIRE ON
JUNE 15, 2013 AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FACILITY IS COMPOSED OF A SYNDICATION OF SIX BANKS. COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKS TOWARD THE AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT RANGE FROM 10.0 MILLION TO 52.5 MILLION PER BANK.
SHOULD A BANK FROM THIS SYNDICATION DEFAULT, THE AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT WOULD BE REDUCED BY THAT BANK S COMMITMENT TOWARD THE LINE. AT NO TIME SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE FACILITY AGREEMENT 2.5 YEARS AGO HAS THE COMPANY DRAWN DOWN FUNDS IN
EXCESS OF 25 MILLION ON THE LINE. FOR A FULL DISCUSSION OF DEBT MATURITIES SEE PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 9 LONG-TERM DEBT. 

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE LEVELS FACTORS IN THE GROWTH OF STANCORP S GROUP INSURANCE AND RETIREMENT PLANS BUSINESSES ARE

THE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS, BENEFIT OFFERINGS, AND SALARY AND WAGE GROWTH OF ITS EMPLOYER GROUPS. CURRENT ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE OUR EMPLOYER GROUPS TO EXPERIENCE LOWER LEVELS OF INSURED EMPLOYEES, TO LIMIT BENEFIT OFFERINGS, OR TO REDUCE OR SLOW THE GROWTH OF WAGE LEVELS. IF THESE OUTCOMES ARISE THEY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREMIUM LEVELS FOR OUR GROUP
BUSINESSES AND REVENUES IN OUR RETIREMENT PLANS BUSINESS. 

OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING EQUITY MARKETS CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN U.S. AND
GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS. THE VALUE OF EQUITY ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT FROM WHICH OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FEE INCOME IS DERIVED AND OUR REVENUE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE FEES WAS REDUCED AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASED EQUITY VALUES.
SUSTAINED EQUITY MARKET DECLINES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION IN OUR RETIREMENT PLANS, AND COULD FURTHER REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO EARN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE INCOME DERIVED FROM THE VALUE OF THOSE
ASSETS. 

DECLINING EQUITY MARKETS COULD EFFECT THE FUNDING STATUS OF COMPANY SPONSORED PENSION PLANS OUR ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES FOR PENSION AND
OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS INCORPORATE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE RATE USED TO DISCOUNT THE FUTURE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE. A DECLINE IN THE
RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR IN THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR A CHANGE IN WORKFORCE ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD. WE MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE CASH OR RECORD HIGHER
PENSION-RELATED EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS AS A RESULT OF DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY S PLANS. 

A CONTINUING US RECESSION OR CONTINUED DISRUPTION IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US A CONTINUING U.S. RECESSION, OR A CONTINUED
DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY CANNOT PREDICT. IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN WE FACE RISKS THAT MAY INCLUDE: 

DECLINES IN REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AS A RESULT OF LOWER LEVELS OF INSURED EMPLOYEES BY OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING LOSS OF EMPLOYER GROUPS DUE TO BUSINESS
BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE. 

DECLINES IN REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AS A RESULT OF LOWER LEVELS OF ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION. 

INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND COMPETITION AS CUSTOMERS SEEK TO REDUCE BENEFIT COSTS. 

REDUCTION IN VALUE OF OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. 

REDUCTIONS TO OUR BANKING GROUP OR TO OUR COMMITTED CREDIT AVAILABILITY DUE TO COMBINATIONS OR FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 

INCREASES IN CORPORATE TAX RATES TO FINANCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAMS.

 RISK FACTORS THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AND OTHER
INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE PRESENTLY DEEM
LESS SIGNIFICANT MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE MARKETS SERVED BY US. THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE IS DEPENDENT ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO FOREGO OR DELAY NEW PURCHASES AND RELY MORE ON REPAIRING EXISTING EQUIPMENT THUS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR SALES AND PROFITS. RISING GAS
AND OIL PRICES, INCREASING STEEL PRICES, AND SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED WORKERS CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON US. OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF
GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION . IN 2005, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE SAFETEA-LU BILL. THIS BILL APPROPRIATED A MULTI-YEAR GUARANTEED FUNDING FOR FEDERAL HIGHWAY, TRANSIT AND SAFETY PROGRAMS. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS DEPEND ON
FUNDING BY FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. FUTURE LEGISLATION MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE GOVERNMENT SPENDING, WHICH IF DECREASED, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INCOME FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN SYNTHETIC FUEL PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF OIL PRICES . THE TAX CREDITS PROVIDED FOR THE SYNTHETIC FUEL INDUSTRY UNDER
SECTION 29 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE COULD PHASE-OUT OR TERMINATE IF OIL PRICES EXCEED CERTAIN LEVELS. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AFFECTING THE INCOME FROM THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ECONOMICALLY PRODUCE AND SUCCESSFULLY MARKET
SYNTHETIC FUEL PRODUCED BY THESE PARTNERSHIPS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS . WE OPERATE MANUFACTURING AND SALES OFFICES
PRINCIPALLY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS RISKS INHERENT IN NON-U.S. ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DIFFICULTY IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY OPERATIONS, DIFFICULTY IN MANAGING
DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND DIFFICULTY IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPOSITION OF PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING
THOSE RELATING TO IMPORT OR EXPORT OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM TRADE OR FOREIGN POLICY. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER QUOTAS, DUTIES, TAXES OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY UPON THE IMPORT OR EXPORT
OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE FACTORS, OR THE ADOPTION OF RESTRICTIVE POLICIES, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE FACE MARKET RISK
RELATED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR PRINCIPAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE BRITISH POUND. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES GENERALLY ARE NOT HEDGED AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR
FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. PERIODICALLY, WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTEREST RATE HEDGE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATE
CHANGES. IF WE HAVE NOT ADEQUATELY MANAGED OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATES, OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE MAY
ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES WITH FUTURE ACQUISITIONS . AS PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE INTEND TO EVALUATE THE ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES, ASSETS OR PRODUCT LINES THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT OR EXPAND OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES OR BROADEN OUR
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. ALTHOUGH WE CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ALL MATERIAL LIABILITIES OR RISKS RELATED TO POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE
WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE AND ACQUIRE ANY BUSINESS, RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND CUSTOMERS OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OR INTEGRATE ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FINANCING FOR ANY ACQUISITION, IF NECESSARY,
WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACQUISITION. ALTHOUGH WE PERIODICALLY CONSIDER POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, NO SPECIFIC ACQUISITIONS ARE PROBABLE AS OF
THE DATE OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K. WE COULD BE HARMED IF WE VIOLATE FINANCIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY . OUR REVOLVING
CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH PNC BANK, N.A., DATED AUGUST 1, 2003, AND AMENDED JULY 31, 2006, IMPOSES CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OPERATING COVENANTS UPON US, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR DEBT, OR TAKE
CERTAIN OTHER CORPORATE ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS AND PROVIDES FOR LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE FOREGOING COVENANTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS,
DISPOSE OF ASSETS, OR OTHERWISE PURSUE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO FUND FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. CHANGES
IN ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS CONDITIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD IN THE FUTURE CAUSE A VIOLATION OF ONE OR MORE COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS CYCLICAL IN NATURE . ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS SLOW DOWN DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS SINCE OUR CUSTOMERS
GENERALLY DO NOT PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT FOR SHIPMENT IN THEIR PEAK SEASON FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK. IN ADDITION, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES BY THE HIGHWAY
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THE HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN CYCLICAL IN NATURE AND VULNERABLE TO GENERAL DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY. DECREASES IN INDUSTRY SPENDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS
AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPRISED OF STOCKS AND BONDS INVESTED
THROUGH A PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, MARKETS, AND CREDIT . DUE TO THE LEVEL OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE
VALUE OF SECURITIES, CHANGES IN THESE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 THERE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS . OUR OPERATING RESULTS
HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE, TIMING AND SHIPMENT OF INDIVIDUAL ORDERS AND THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN LARGE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE
PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUES UPON SHIPMENT FOR THE REST OF OUR PRODUCTS. OUR ASPHALT PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATION, WHICH MAY LOWER SALES AND RESULT IN POSSIBLE
LOSSES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS OF EACH YEAR. TRADITIONALLY, ASPHALT PRODUCERS DO NOT PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT FOR SHIPMENT DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS TO AVOID DISRUPTION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES DURING PEAK PERIODS OF HIGHWAY
CONSTRUCTION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED . THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS
WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON THE EFFORTS, ABILITIES AND SERVICES OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND CERTAIN OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN
QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, EITHER THROUGH DIRECT HIRING, OR ACQUISITION OF OTHER BUSINESSES EMPLOYING SUCH PERSONS, WILL ALSO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING OUR FUTURE SUCCESS. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OF OTHERS . WE HOLD NUMEROUS PATENTS COVERING TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS RELATED TO VARIOUS
PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS, AND NUMEROUS TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES REGISTERED WITH THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE AND IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE BREADTH OR DEGREE OF PROTECTION THAT EXISTING OR
FUTURE PATENTS OR TRADEMARKS MAY AFFORD US, OR THAT ANY PENDING PATENT OR TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN ISSUED PATENTS OR TRADEMARKS, OR THAT OUR PATENTS, REGISTERED TRADEMARKS OR PATENT APPLICATIONS, IF ANY, WILL BE UPHELD IF CHALLENGED, OR
THAT COMPETITORS WILL NOT DEVELOP SIMILAR OR SUPERIOR METHODS OR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF ANY PATENTS ISSUED, LICENSED OR SUBLICENSED TO US. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF OUR PATENTS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS OR TRADEMARKS INFRINGE UPON
THE PATENTS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS OR TRADEMARKS OF OTHERS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR EXISTING PATENT, TRADEMARK OR OTHER RIGHTS MAY NOT BE VALID OR THAT INFRINGEMENT OF EXISTING OR FUTURE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY OCCUR. IN THE
EVENT THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED TO INFRINGE UPON THE PATENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY THE DESIGN OF OUR PRODUCTS, CHANGE THE NAME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OBTAIN A LICENSE FOR THE USE OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES
INCORPORATED INTO OUR PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF THE FOREGOING IN A TIMELY MANNER, UPON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR AT ALL, AND THE FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. IN
ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE FINANCIAL OR OTHER RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND A PATENT, REGISTERED TRADEMARK OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT, AND, IF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED TO INFRINGE UPON THE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS
OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WE COULD BECOME LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO
SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCTS WE PRODUCE . WE ARE ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS THAT COULD EXPOSE US TO POSSIBLE LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE DUE TO ALLEGED DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING DEFECTS IN OUR PRODUCTS. WE
BELIEVE THAT WE MEET EXISTING PROFESSIONAL SPECIFICATION STANDARDS RECOGNIZED OR REQUIRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND WE HAVE HAD NO MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US AS OF THE DATE HEREOF. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY
MAINTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITY COVERAGE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ADEQUATE FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS, SUCH INSURANCE MAY PROVE INADEQUATE OR BECOME DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN OR UNOBTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH, OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND
REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. SANCTIONS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE
MAY INCLUDE REVOCATION OF PERMITS, CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDERS, ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL PENALTIES AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. OUR BUSINESS INVOLVES ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HISTORICAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. TO
DATE, OUR COST OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL, BUT THE FACT THAT SUCH LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY MAKES PREDICTING THE COST OR IMPACT OF SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS
UNCERTAIN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIES COULD CAUSE PRODUCTION DELAYS, A REDUCTION OF REVENUES OR AN
INCREASE IN COSTS. THE PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIALS WE USE ARE STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS. WE HAVE NO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OF RAW MATERIALS FOR
OUR OPERATIONS, AND CHANGES IN PRICES OF SUCH MATERIALS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT AFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH RAW MATERIALS ARE READILY AVAILABLE FROM ALTERNATE SOURCES, AN INTERRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY OF
STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS OR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ANY OF THESE RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS . WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR
PRODUCTS. ANY FAILURE BY US TO COMPLY WITH PRESENT OR FUTURE REGULATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO FUTURE LIABILITIES, OR THE SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD ALSO
RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR FACILITIES, OR COULD REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE COSTLY EQUIPMENT OR TO INCUR OTHER EXPENSES TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY TO MEET ALL INDUSTRY OR
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY STANDARDS THAT MAY APPLY TO OUR PRODUCT LINES, INCLUDING ALL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN ENVIRONMENTAL, STRUCTURAL, ELECTRICAL AND SAFETY CODES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BECOME MORE
STRINGENT OVER TIME, IMPOSING GREATER COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASING RISKS AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH A VIOLATION. THE COST TO US OF SUCH COMPLIANCE TO DATE HAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT VIOLATIONS WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR, EQUIPMENT FAILURE OR OTHER CAUSES. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE WORKPLACE. WE
CANNOT PREDICT THE NATURE, SCOPE OR EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL LEGISLATION, OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD BE IMPOSED OR HOW EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS WILL BE ADMINISTERED, OR INTERPRETED. COMPLIANCE WITH MORE STRINGENT LAWS OR
REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS MORE VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT POLICIES OF REGULATORY AGENCIES, COULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES BY US AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS EFFECTIVE VOTING CONTROL . OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS BENEFICIALLY OWN AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY 88.2 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF
OUR .10 PAR VALUE CLASS B STOCK. THE CLASS B STOCK IS ENTITLED TO ELECT 75 (CALCULATED TO THE NEAREST WHOLE NUMBER, ROUNDING FIVE-TENTHS TO NEXT HIGHEST WHOLE NUMBER) OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FURTHER, APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY OF THE
CLASS B STOCK IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO EFFECT A SALE OF US AND CERTAIN OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, THESE STOCKHOLDERS CAN ELECT MORE THAN A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER MOST MATTERS
REQUIRING APPROVAL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THIS CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL MAY ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE IN CONTROL. THE
ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK MAY IMPEDE A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR MAY BE DILUTIVE TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS . OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTOR, WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER VOTE, TO ISSUE UP TO 300,000
SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OR MORE SERIES AND TO DETERMINE FOR ANY SERIES THE DIVIDEND, LIQUIDATION, CONVERSION, VOTING OR OTHER PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND TERMS THAT ARE SENIOR, AND NOT AVAILABLE, TO THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THUS,
ISSUANCES OF SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RELATIVE VOTING POWER, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER RIGHTS OF THE COMMON STOCK. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD DETER OR IMPEDE A MERGER, TENDER OFFER OR OTHER TRANSACTION THAT SOME,
OR A MAJORITY, OF OUR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTEREST OR IN WHICH OUR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR SHARES OVER THE THEN CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF SUCH SHARES. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS . WE HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 145 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW TO
INDEMNIFY OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN THAT STATUTE. OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES THAT A DIRECTOR SHALL NOT BE PERSONALLY LIABLE TO US FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AS A DIRECTOR, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
SUCH EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY OR LIMITATION THEREOF IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW. OUR BYLAWS PROVIDE IN PART THAT WE INDEMNIFY EACH OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AGAINST LIABILITIES IMPOSED UPON THEM (INCLUDING
REASONABLE AMOUNTS PAID IN SETTLEMENT) AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THEM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM MADE AGAINST THEM OR ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING TO WHICH THEY MAY BE A PARTY BY REASON OF THEIR BEING OR HAVING BEEN A DIRECTOR OR OFFICER. WE
MAINTAIN OFFICER S AND DIRECTOR S LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH INSURANCE WILL 
 
 10 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT IF AVAILABLE, IT WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US. FURTHERMORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE
INSURANCE COVERAGE PROVIDED WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE AMOUNT OF ANY JUDGMENT AWARDED AGAINST AN OFFICER OR DIRECTOR (EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE). CONSEQUENTLY, IF SUCH JUDGMENT EXCEEDS THE COVERAGE UNDER THE POLICY, WE MAY BE
FORCED TO PAY SUCH DIFFERENCE. WE ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONTAINING PROVISIONS THAT MAY
REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS (OTHER THAN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A CULPABLE NATURE) AND TO ADVANCE
THEIR EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST THEM AS TO WHICH THEY COULD BE INDEMNIFIED. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS AND AGREEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONS AS DIRECTORS AND
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE INTEND TO RETAIN ANY
EARNINGS TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK OR CLASS B STOCK. ANY FUTURE DETERMINATION TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL BE
DEPENDENT UPON THEN EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, BUSINESS PROSPECTS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERS RELEVANT.

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION ON THE RISKS WE FACE AND OUR MANAGEMENT OF RISK CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR IN
OUR OTHER SEC FILINGS, THE FOLLOWING ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS WHICH MAY AFFECT US. EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARISING FROM ONE OR MORE OF THESE RISKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS AND THE VALUE
AND PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THE RISKS IDENTIFIED BELOW ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL RISKS WE FACE AND ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT WE MAY CURRENTLY VIEW AS NOT MATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND
RESULTS. READERS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS
THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT. THIS REPORT IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THESE RISK FACTORS. 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE BANKING INDUSTRY 
 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR INDUSTRY 
 OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE GENERALLY, AND THE ABILITY OF BORROWERS TO PAY INTEREST ON AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL OF OUTSTANDING LOANS AND THE
VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THOSE LOANS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND IN THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. AND LOCAL ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SHOW MODEST SIGNS OF
IMPROVEMENT, CERTAIN SECTORS, REMAIN SOFT, AND UNEMPLOYMENT, ALTHOUGH IMPROVED, REMAINS HIGH IN GENERAL AND IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MANY BUSINESSES ARE STILL EXPERIENCING SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF EUROPEAN DEBT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ASIA, CAN IMPACT THE ECONOMY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE ECONOMIC PRESSURES ON CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MAY ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STOCK PRICE. IN PARTICULAR, WE MAY FACE THE FOLLOWING RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS: 

CURRENT DEADLOCK IN CONGRESS AND FAILURE TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC ISSUES. 

OUR BANKING OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT FISCAL CHALLENGES THE
LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF WHICH ON THE STATE S ECONOMY CANNOT BE PREDICTED. FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COULD IMPAIR BORROWERS ABILITY TO SERVICE THEIR LOANS, DECREASE THE LEVEL AND DURATION OF
DEPOSITS BY CUSTOMERS, AND ERODE THE VALUE OF LOAN COLLATERAL. THESE CONDITIONS COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OUR NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFORTS TO COLLECT OUR NON-PERFORMING LOANS OR OTHERWISE LIQUIDATE OUR
NON-PERFORMING ASSETS (INCLUDING OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED) ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, IF AT ALL, AND COULD ALSO CAUSE A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR A LACK OF GROWTH OR A DECREASE IN DEPOSITS, ANY OF WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR
LOSSES, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CAPITAL, AND HURT OUR BUSINESS. U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE PAST, THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE
ECONOMIC EVENTS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS WELL-CAPITALIZED AND HAS NOT SUFFERED ANY LIQUIDITY ISSUES AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE IF THE RECOVERY FROM THE RECESSION DOES NOT CONTINUE. IN VIEW OF THE
CONCENTRATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE COLLATERAL SECURING OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WE MAY BE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 
 FURTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS 
 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BEGINNING IN 2008, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET EXPERIENCED A SLOW-DOWN DUE TO NEGATIVE ECONOMIC TRENDS
AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTION. WHILE RECOVERY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE APPEARS TO BE HOLDING, THE LONG-TERM IMPACT CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, 51 AND 4 OF OUR TOTAL GROSS LOANS WERE COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE
AND REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION LOANS, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, 41 WAS OWNER-OCCUPIED. ANY FURTHER DOWNTURN IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR
LOANS ARE SECURED BY REAL ESTATE. OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER ON DEFAULTED LOANS BY SELLING THE REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL WOULD THEN BE DIMINISHED AND WE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER LOSSES ON LOANS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL IS
LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUES, ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE COLLATERAL FOR OUR LOANS WOULD PROVIDE LESS SECURITY. REAL ESTATE VALUES COULD BE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A
WORSENING OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AN INCREASE IN FORECLOSURES, A DECLINE IN HOME SALE VOLUMES, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, CONTINUED HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, DROUGHT, EARTHQUAKES, BRUSH FIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS PARTICULAR TO
CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND RELATED REGULATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US 
 RECENT GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAVE RESULTED IN THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.
THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVIDES FOR SWEEPING REGULATORY CHANGES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRENGTHENED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING MINIMUM LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NO LESS THAN THE STRICTEST REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AS OF THE DATE OF ENACTMENT; 

THE REQUIREMENT BY STATUTE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SERVE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR THEIR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES;

ENHANCED REGULATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE DERIVATIVE AND SECURITIZATION MARKETS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PROPRIETARY TRADING
ACTIVITIES BY BANKS; 

ADDITIONAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION REQUIREMENTS; ENHANCED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REGULATIONS,

REVISIONS IN FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENT FEES AND A PERMANENT INCREASE IN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO 250,000; 

AUTHORIZATION FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PAY INTEREST ON BUSINESS CHECKING ACCOUNTS; AND 

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW REGULATORY BODIES, SUCH AS THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES OVERSIGHT COUNSEL, TO
IDENTIFY EMERGING SYSTEMIC RISKS AND IMPROVE INTERAGENCY COOPERATION. MANY OF THE PROVISIONS REMAIN SUBJECT
TO FINAL RULEMAKING AND/OR IMPLEMENTATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT FULLY ASSESS ITS IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COSTS UNTIL FINAL REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED. CURRENT AND FUTURE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED UNDER DODD-FRANK, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO EVALUATE AND MAKE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATION AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND MAY MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. 
 30 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 FURTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BANKING LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL MONETARY POLICY COULD
MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION, AND
SIGNIFICANT NEW LAWS OR CHANGES IN, OR REPEALS OF, EXISTING LAWS MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY. ALSO, FEDERAL MONETARY POLICY, PARTICULARLY AS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS OUR CREDIT CONDITIONS,
PRIMARILY THROUGH OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR MEMBER BANK BORROWING, AND BANK RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THESE CONDITIONS WOULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES
ALSO FREQUENTLY ADOPT CHANGES TO THEIR REGULATIONS OR CHANGE THE MANNER IN WHICH EXISTING REGULATIONS ARE APPLIED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION. 
 WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SUBSTANCE OR IMPACT OF ANY CHANGE IN REGULATION, WHETHER BY REGULATORS OR AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION, OR IN THE WAY
SUCH STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE INTERPRETED OR ENFORCED. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH CURRENT AND POTENTIAL REGULATION AND SCRUTINY MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COSTS, IMPEDE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PRACTICES, REQUIRE US TO
INCREASE OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. WE ARE SUBJECT
TO EXTENSIVE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, AND MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO FUTURE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, IF ANY, THAT MAY BE ENACTED, WHICH COULD LIMIT OR RESTRICT OUR ACTIVITIES, MAY HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE OUR ASSETS AND
EARNINGS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. BANK CLIENTS COULD MOVE THEIR MONEY TO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS CAUSING US TO
LOSE A LOWER COST SOURCE OF FUNDING DEMAND DEPOSITS CAN DECREASE WHEN CLIENTS PERCEIVE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS, AS
PROVIDING A BETTER RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CHANGES HAVE MADE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR BANK CUSTOMERS TO TRANSFER FUNDS INTO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS OR OTHER DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS OFFERED BY OTHER OUT-OF-AREA FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR
NON-BANK SERVICE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO TREND UPWARD, CUSTOMERS MAY WITHDRAW DEPOSITS TO UTILIZE THEM TO FUND BUSINESS EXPANSION OR EQUITY INVESTMENT. MOREOVER, SHOULD INTEREST RATES RISE THIS MAY IMPACT THE BANK S
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT PERCENTAGE OF NON-INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS. WHEN CLIENTS MOVE MONEY OUT OF BANK DEMAND DEPOSITS, PARTICULARLY NON-INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS, WE LOSE A RELATIVELY LOW COST SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCREASING OUR FUNDING COSTS
AND REDUCING OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. SEVERAL RATING AGENCIES PUBLISH UNSOLICITED RATINGS OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND
RELATIVE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF MANY BANKS, INCLUDING CUB, BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. AS THESE RATINGS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, A DECLINE IN THE BANK S RATINGS MAY RESULT IN DEPOSIT OUTFLOWS OR THE INABILITY OF THE BANK TO RAISE DEPOSITS IN
THE SECONDARY MARKET AS BROKER-DEALERS AND DEPOSITORS MAY USE SUCH RATINGS IN DECIDING WHERE TO DEPOSIT THEIR FUNDS. OUR BUSINESS IS
SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES COULD REDUCE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INCOME IS DERIVED FROM THE DIFFERENTIAL, OR SPREAD, BETWEEN THE INTEREST EARNED ON LOANS, INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, AND THE INTEREST
PAID ON DEPOSITS, BORROWINGS AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES. THE INTEREST RATE RISK INHERENT IN OUR LENDING, INVESTING, AND DEPOSIT TAKING ACTIVITIES IS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISK TO US AND OUR BUSINESS. INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST
EARNING ASSETS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE AFFECTED UNIFORMLY BY FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. THE MAGNITUDE AND DURATION OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, EVENTS OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON NET INTEREST INCOME. PREPAYMENT AND EARLY WITHDRAWAL LEVELS, WHICH ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR
FLOATING RATE BORROWERS TO MEET THEIR HIGHER PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS. 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 GENERALLY, THE INTEREST RATES ON OUR INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST-BEARING
LIABILITIES DO NOT CHANGE AT THE SAME RATE, TO THE SAME EXTENT, OR ON THE SAME BASIS. EVEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH SIMILAR MATURITIES OR PERIODS OF RE-PRICING MAY REACT IN DIFFERENT DEGREES TO CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATES ON
CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY FLUCTUATE IN ADVANCE OF CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHILE INTEREST RATES ON OTHER TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY LAG BEHIND CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET RATES. CERTAIN ASSETS, SUCH AS
ADJUSTABLE RATE LOANS, MAY HAVE FEATURES THAT LIMIT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS SUCH AS FLOORS. DURING
THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL PHASE OUT ITS LONG-RUNNING BOND-BUYING ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM KNOWN AS QUANTITATIVE EASING. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, IT IS HOPING THAT BY HOLDING ITS BOND BALANCE, IT
WILL HELP MAINTAIN ACCOMMODATIVE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY WITHOUT NEEDING TO CONTINUE WITH NEW PURCHASES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO SAID THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY BY KEEPING INTEREST RATES LOW FOR A
 CONSIDERABLE TIME AS IT CREDITS ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM WITH SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET SINCE THE INCEPTION OF ITS CURRENCY ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM AND CONTINUES TO SEE SUFFICIENT
UNDERLYING STRENGTH IN THE BROADER ECONOMY. ACCORDINGLY, THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE REINFORCED ITS EXPECTED TIMELINE OF INCREASING INTEREST RATES IN THE MIDDLE OF 2015; HOWEVER, IF THE JOB MARKET IMPROVES MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED OR
INFLATION RISES, RATE HIKES COULD COME SOONER, AND THE COMMITTEE COULD WAIT LONGER IF THE JOB MARKET OR INFLATION SLOWS. A PERSISTENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT LIKELY WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INTEREST INCOME WE EARN ON LOANS AND INVESTMENTS.
 WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES BY STRUCTURING OUR ASSET-LIABILITY COMPOSITION TO OBTAIN
THE MAXIMUM SPREAD. WE USE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND A SIMULATION MODEL TO ASSIST US IN MANAGING ASSET-LIABILITY COMPOSITION. HOWEVER, SUCH MANAGEMENT TOOLS HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS THAT IMPAIR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. 
 THE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS.
 THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE U.S. ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST
OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE NET INTEREST MARGIN. THEY CAN ALSO MATERIALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WE HOLD. FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES CAN ALSO
ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWERS, POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS, OR COULD ADVERSELY CREATE ASSET BUBBLES WHICH RESULT FROM PROLONGED PERIODS OF ACCOMMODATIVE POLICY, AND WHICH IN TURN RESULT IN VOLATILE MARKETS
AND RAPIDLY DECLINING COLLATERAL VALUES. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. INFLATION
AND DEFLATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED
FINANCIAL DATA PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL
DOLLARS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY OVER TIME DUE TO INFLATION OR DEFLATION. THE PRIMARY IMPACT OF INFLATION ON OUR OPERATIONS IS REFLECTED IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS. CONVERSELY, DEFLATION WILL TEND TO
ERODE COLLATERAL VALUES AND DIMINISH LOAN QUALITY. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MONETARY IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PERFORMANCE THAN THE GENERAL LEVELS OF INFLATION OR DEFLATION
 THE COMPANY HAS LIQUIDITY RISK LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE INSUFFICIENT CASH OR ACCESS TO CASH TO SATISFY CURRENT AND FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEMANDS FOR LOANS AND DEPOSIT WITHDRAWALS, FUNDING
OPERATING COSTS, AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. AN INABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH DEPOSITS, BORROWINGS, THE SALE OF LOANS AND OTHER SOURCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES IN AMOUNTS ADEQUATE
 
 32 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

TO FINANCE OUR ACTIVITIES COULD BE IMPAIRED BY FACTORS THAT AFFECT US SPECIFICALLY OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. FACTORS THAT COULD DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY
SOURCES INCLUDE A DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DUE TO A MARKET DOWNTURN OR ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US. OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE DEPOSITS OR BORROW COULD ALSO BE IMPAIRED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO US, SUCH AS A
SEVERE DISRUPTION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OR NEGATIVE VIEWS AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. THE COMPANY MITIGATES LIQUIDITY RISK BY ESTABLISHING AND ACCESSING LINES OF CREDIT WITH VARIOUS
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HAVING BACK-UP ACCESS TO THE BROKERED CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSITS CD S MARKETS (WHICH IT HAS NOT UTILIZED OTHER THAN ON A TESTING BASIS). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY WERE UNABLE TO
SATISFY CURRENT OR FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. SEE PART II, ITEM 7, LIQUIDITY FOR MORE INFORMATION. SEVERE WEATHER,
NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS SEVERE WEATHER, DROUGHT, FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, OR TSUNAMIS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM AND OTHER ADVERSE EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY
TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. SUCH EVENTS COULD AFFECT THE STABILITY OF THE BANK S DEPOSIT BASE; IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF BORROWERS TO REPAY OUTSTANDING LOANS, IMPAIR THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL SECURING LOANS, CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, RESULT IN LOSS
OF REVENUE AND/OR CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED DISASTER RECOVERY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SUCH EVENT IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND WE ROUTINELY
EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF OUR
COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT EXPOSURE DUE US. ANY SUCH LOSSES
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT 
 WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO DESPITE OUR UNDERWRITING PRACTICES 
 WE MITIGATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO BY ADHERING TO SOUND AND PROVEN UNDERWRITING PRACTICES, MANAGED BY EXPERIENCED AND
KNOWLEDGEABLE CREDIT PROFESSIONALS. THESE PRACTICES INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF A BORROWER S PRIOR CREDIT HISTORY, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, TAX RETURNS, AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, VALUATIONS OF COLLATERAL BASED ON REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS AND
VERIFICATIONS OF LIQUID ASSETS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VARIOUS KINDS OF LOANS WE MAKE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ON LOANS THAT MEET OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, AND THESE LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS SET
ASIDE AS RESERVES IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ACTUAL LOSSES
 WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS ON ORGANIC LOANS, WHICH IS A RESERVE ESTABLISHED THROUGH A PROVISION FOR LOAN
LOSSES CHARGED TO EXPENSE, THAT REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT S BEST ESTIMATE OF RISK OF LOSSES WITHIN THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE, IN THE JUDGMENT OF MANAGEMENT, IS NECESSARY TO RESERVE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES AND RISKS INHERENT IN
THE LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE LEVEL OF THE ALLOWANCE REFLECTS MANAGEMENT S CONTINUING EVALUATION OF INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS; SPECIFIC CREDIT RISKS; LIMITED LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE; CURRENT LOAN PORTFOLIO QUALITY; PRESENT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND
REGULATORY CONDITIONS AND UNIDENTIFIED LOSSES INHERENT IN THE CURRENT LOAN 
 33 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS LEVELS UTILIZED BY PEERS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS INHERENTLY INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF SUBJECTIVITY AND REQUIRES THE BANK TO
MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OF CURRENT CREDIT RISKS AND FUTURE TRENDS, ALL OF WHICH MAY UNDERGO MATERIAL CHANGES. 
 DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECTING BORROWERS AND COLLATERAL, NEW INFORMATION REGARDING EXISTING LOANS, IDENTIFICATION OF
PROBLEM LOANS AND OTHER FACTORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY S CONTROL, MAY REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS. IN ADDITION, BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE BANK S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS AND MAY
REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OR THE RECOGNITION OF FURTHER LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, BASED ON JUDGMENTS DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF CHARGE-OFFS IN FUTURE PERIODS EXCEED THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS; THE BANK
WILL NEED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS. ANY INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN NET INCOME AND, POSSIBLY, CAPITAL, AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE SECTION CAPTIONED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS IN ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LOCATED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT
FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE COMPANY S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS. ON DECEMBER 20, 2012, THE FASB ISSUED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT A PROPOSED ASU, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES (SUBTOPIC 825-15) (THE CREDIT LOSS PROPOSAL OR CECL), THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY
CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING FOR CREDIT LOSSES UNDER U.S. GAAP. UNDER U.S. GAAP S CURRENT STANDARDS, CREDIT LOSSES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNTIL IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CREDIT LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. UNDER THE CREDIT LOSS
PROPOSAL, AN ENTITY WOULD REFLECT IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF EACH FINANCIAL ASSET. ON MARCH 12, 2014, THE FASB MODIFIED ITS PLAN, DECIDING THAT THE MODEL WOULD
APPLY ONLY TO INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST, AS OPPOSED TO ALL FINANCIAL PRODUCTS; DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. THE CREDIT LOSS PROPOSAL, IF ADOPTED AS PROPOSED, MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED EARNINGS,
CAPITAL, REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS, AS WELL AS ON REGULATORY LIMITS WHICH ARE BASED ON CAPITAL (E.G., LOANS TO ONE BORROWER) SINCE IT WOULD ACCELERATE THE RECOGNITION OF ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES. 
 LIABILITIES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 IN THE COURSE OF THE BANK S BUSINESS, THE BANK MAY FORECLOSE AND TAKE TITLE TO REAL ESTATE, AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THESE PROPERTIES. THE BANK MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR TO THIRD PARTIES FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP COSTS INCURRED BY THESE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL
CONTAMINATION, OR MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE OR CLEAR UP HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES, OR CHEMICAL RELEASES AT A PROPERTY. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTIGATION OR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. IN ADDITION, AS THE OWNER OR
FORMER OWNER OF ANY CONTAMINATED SITE, THE BANK MAY BE SUBJECT TO COMMON LAW CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES BASED ON DAMAGES, AND COSTS RESULTING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION EMANATING FROM THE PROPERTY. IF THE BANK EVER BECOMES SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. CALIFORNIA S CURRENT DROUGHT MAY IMPACT THE ECONOMY AT
DECEMBER 31, 2014, CALIFORNIA CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A SEVERE DROUGHT IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE. ACCORDING TO A RECENT 2014 REPORT AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS CENTER FOR WATERSHED SCIENCE,
CALIFORNIA S DROUGHT WILL COST CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE 1.5 BILLION, WHICH AMOUNTS TO A NET REVENUE LOSS OF ABOUT 3 OF CALIFORNIA S TOTAL AGRICULTURAL VALUE. THE REPORT PREDICTS TOTAL STATEWIDE ECONOMIC COST OF THE 2014 DROUGHT TO BE 2.2
BILLION AND THE LOSS OF 17,000 JOBS. THE DROUGHT IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2015, REGARDLESS OF EL NI O CONDITIONS. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF AGRICULTURAL LOANS WHICH WOULD BE MOST IMPACTED BY THE DROUGHT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE
OVERALL ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE IMPACT OF THIS DROUGHT AND LACK OF WATER OR COST, FOR VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND APPLICATIONS WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S RESULTS, LOAN QUALITY AND COLLATERAL.

 RISK RELATED TO LEGISLATION AND REGULATION SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BANKING LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL MONETARY POLICY COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, AND SIGNIFICANT NEW LAWS OR CHANGES IN, OR REPEALS OF, EXISTING LAWS WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY. ALSO, FEDERAL
MONETARY POLICY, PARTICULARLY AS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS OUR CREDIT CONDITIONS, PRIMARILY THROUGH OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR MEMBER BANK BORROWING, AND
BANK RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THESE CONDITIONS WOULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS. PARTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO
AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT RECENTLY-ENACTED LEGISLATION AND OTHER REGULATORY INITIATIVES TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, SEE
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION . WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATES A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL THAT WILL RECOMMEND TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE
INCREASINGLY STRICT RULES FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS COMPANIES GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY OTHER NEW REGULATIONS, IN ADDITION TO REGULATORY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS, COULD REQUIRE US TO REDUCE BUSINESS LEVELS OR TO RAISE
CAPITAL, INCLUDING IN WAYS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS DISCUSSED
PREVIOUSLY, IN JULY 2013 U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS JOINTLY ADOPTED FINAL REGULATIONS WHICH REVISED THEIR RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AS REQUIRED BY THE
DODD-FRANK ACT. SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS BEGAN TO BE PHASED-IN ON JANUARY 1, 2015 AND ARE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND THE BANK. CERTAIN OF THE RULES ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKS AND WILL NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT THE
COMPANY. THESE RULES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (AND THE ASSOCIATED COMPLIANCE COSTS) FOR THE COMPANY AND THE BANK WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. LIMITS ON OUR ABILITY TO LEND THE BANK S LEGAL LENDING LIMIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS APPROXIMATELY 55 MILLION FOR SECURED LOANS AND 33 MILLION FOR UNSECURED LOANS. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TARGET MARKET, WE COMPETE WITH MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH LARGER LENDING LIMITS. BUSINESS STRATEGY RISK
 WE COMPETE AGAINST LARGER BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS 
 WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS AND LOANS IN OUR MARKET PLACE. COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS PRIMARILY COME FROM OTHER COMMERCIAL
BANKS, SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS, THRIFT AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, MONEY MARKET AND MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. COMPETITION FOR LOANS COME FROM OTHER COMMERCIAL BANKS, SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS, MORTGAGE BANKING FIRMS, THRIFT AND LOAN
ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. OUR LARGER COMPETITORS, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR LARGER CAPITAL RESOURCES, HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER LENDING LIMITS THAN WE HAVE. THEY ALSO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING TRUST AND
INTERNATIONAL BANKING, WHICH WE ONLY ARE ABLE TO OFFER INDIRECTLY THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES AND ARE ABLE TO OFFER LONGER MATURITIES AND ON OCCASION, LOWER RATES ON FIXED RATE LOANS. 
 THERE ARE RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN EXPANSION THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND MAY CONSIDER ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE. IN NOVEMBER 2014, WE COMPLETED A MERGER OF 1 ST ENTERPRISE INTO THE BANK AND IN JULY 2012, WE COMPLETED A MERGER WITH PREMIER COMMERCIAL BANCORP AND ITS SUBSIDIARY
PREMIER COMMERCIAL BANK, N.A. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE

ACQUIRED CALIFORNIA OAKS STATE BANK. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FREQUENCY, SIZE OR TIMING OF ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, AND WE TYPICALLY DO NOT COMMENT PUBLICLY ON A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION UNTIL WE HAVE
SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS. 
 THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH EXPANSION. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, INCORRECTLY ASSESSING THE ASSET QUALITY OF A BANK
ACQUIRED IN A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, ENCOUNTERING GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED COSTS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, FACING RESISTANCE FROM CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES, BEING UNABLE TO PROFITABLY DEPLOY ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION OR LITIGATION
RESULTING FROM CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING AT THE ACQUIRED ENTITY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF ACQUISITION OR RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION. OUR EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND PROSPECTS AFTER A MERGER OR ACQUISITION DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO
SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY OR TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS. ANY COST SAVINGS WHICH ARE REALIZED MAY BE OFFSET BY LOSSES IN REVENUES OR OTHER CHARGES TO
EARNINGS. TO THE EXTENT WE ISSUE CAPITAL STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS, IF ANY, THESE TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED STOCK ISSUANCES MAY HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE AND SHARE OWNERSHIP. 
 WHILE OUR MANAGEMENT IS EXPERIENCED IN ACQUISITION STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION, ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY AND WE CANNOT
DETERMINE ALL POTENTIAL EVENTS, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD RESULT IN LOSS OR GIVE ASSURANCES THAT OUR INVESTIGATION OR MITIGATION EFFORTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSS. 
 IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO GROW MAY BE LIMITED IF WE CANNOT MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS. ISSUING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO ACQUIRE OTHER BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY RESULT IN
DILUTION FOR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR
GROWTH STRATEGY, WE HAVE ISSUED, AND MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MAY COMPLEMENT OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. RESALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF COMMON STOCK IN THE
PUBLIC MARKET AND THE POTENTIAL OF SUCH SALES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. WE USUALLY MUST PAY AN ACQUISITION PREMIUM
ABOVE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. PAYING THIS ACQUISITION PREMIUM, IN ADDITION TO THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF ISSUING ADDITIONAL SHARES, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS WOULD RESULT IN A
CHARGE TO EARNINGS GOODWILL IS INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS REVIEWED AT LEAST
ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. IF OUR ESTIMATES OF GOODWILL FAIR VALUE CHANGE, WE MAY DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE NECESSARY. ESTIMATES OF
FAIR VALUE ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A COMPLEX MODEL USING CASH FLOWS AND COMPANY COMPARISONS. IF MANAGEMENT S ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE INACCURATE, THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINED COULD BE INACCURATE AND IMPAIRMENT MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN A
TIMELY MANNER. OUR DECISIONS REGARDING THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED COULD BE DIFFERENT THAN INITIALLY ESTIMATED WHICH COULD
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS WE ACQUIRED PORTFOLIOS OF LOANS IN THE 1 ST ENTERPRISE, PREMIER COMMERCIAL BANCORP AND CALIFORNIA OAKS STATE BANK ACQUISITIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE LOANS WERE MARKED DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE PURSUANT TO ASC 805 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, THERE IS
NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ACQUIRED LOANS WILL NOT SUFFER FURTHER DETERIORATION IN

VALUE RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL CHARGE-OFFS. THE FLUCTUATIONS IN NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS THAT WE ACQUIRED FROM
1 ST ENTERPRISE, PREMIER COMMERCIAL BANCORP AND CALIFORNIA
OAKS STATE BANK AND CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME. THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, CANNOT BE CONTROLLED AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, EVEN IF OTHER FAVORABLE EVENTS OCCUR.
 WE MAY NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL TO SUPPORT GROWTH OR ACQUISITION 
 WHILE THE COMPANY S AND THE BANK S CAPITAL LEVELS ARE CURRENTLY IN EXCESS OF THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED WELL
CAPITALIZED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES, ORGANIC GROWTH OR A STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND/OR TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL LEVELS IN EXCESS OF WELL CAPITALIZED . 
 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY PERSONNEL AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THOSE KEY PERSONNEL MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS
 COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES AND PERSONNEL IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF
QUALIFIED PERSONS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF, AND EXPERIENCE IN, THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING INDUSTRY. THE PROCESS OF RECRUITING PERSONNEL WITH THE COMBINATION OF SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT OUR STRATEGIES IS OFTEN LENGTHY. OUR SUCCESS
DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT, LOAN ORIGINATION, FINANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE, MARKETING, COMPLIANCE AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND UPON THE CONTINUED CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND
PERSONNEL. IN PARTICULAR, OUR SUCCESS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITIES OF KEY EXECUTIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH THE COMPANY INTENDS TO INCREASE DEPOSITS AND LOANS AND TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES WHICH COULD, IF IMPLEMENTED, EXPAND ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS. CONTINUED GROWTH MAY PRESENT
OPERATING AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS INDIVIDUAL OR COMBINED BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ITS GROWTH MAY PLACE A STRAIN ON ITS ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL, PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND
INCREASE DEMANDS ON ITS SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS. OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE GROWTH SUCCESSFULLY WILL DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND MAINTAIN COST CONTROLS AND ASSET QUALITY WHILE ATTRACTING ADDITIONAL LOANS AND DEPOSITS ON
FAVORABLE TERMS, AS WELL AS ON FACTORS BEYOND THE OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IF WE GROW TOO QUICKLY AND ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, CONTROL COSTS AND MAINTAIN ASSET QUALITY, THIS CONTINUED
RAPID GROWTH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OUR DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS
 AS A BUSINESS BANK, WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHOSE DEPOSIT LEVELS VARY CONSIDERABLY AND HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SEASONALITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, 84 CUSTOMERS MAINTAINED BALANCES (AGGREGATING ALL RELATED ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE BUSINESS ENTITIES AND PERSONAL FUNDS OF BUSINESS OWNERS) IN EXCESS OF 4 MILLION. THIS AMOUNTED TO
 859 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY 44 PERCENT OF THE BANK S TOTAL CUSTOMER DEPOSIT BASE. THESE DEPOSITS CAN AND DO FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY. WHILE THE LOSS OF ANY COMBINATION OF THESE DEPOSITORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE BANK S
RESULTS, THE BANK EXPECTS, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THAT THESE DEPOSITS WILL FLUCTUATE AND BELIEVES IT IS CAPABLE OF MITIGATING THIS RISK, AS WELL AS THE RISK OF LOSING ONE OF THESE DEPOSITORS, THROUGH ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, AND BUSINESS
GENERATION IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE CUSTOMERS LEAVE THE BANK IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BANK. IF WE CANNOT ATTRACT DEPOSITS AND QUALITY LOANS OUR GROWTH MAY BE INHIBITED OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE OUR ASSET BASE DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS AT FAVORABLE RATES. WE SEEK ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS BY PROVIDING OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND
OFFERING DEPOSIT PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE WITH THOSE OFFERED BY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN OUR MARKETS. IN ADDITION, OUR INCOME DEPENDS IN LARGE PART IN ATTRACTING QUALITY LOAN CUSTOMERS AND LOANS IN WHICH TO INVEST THE DEPOSITS.

FINANCING FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES AS AN INCENTIVE TO MAKE THE LOANS. SBA LENDING IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT CAN AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND FUNDING OF THE PROGRAM. FROM TIME TO TIME, THIS
DEPENDENCE ON LEGISLATIVE FUNDING CAUSES LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES WITH REGARD TO THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF SUCH PROGRAMS, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISK 
 WE HAVE A CONTINUING NEED TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO: 

SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS BETTER; 

INCREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCY BY REDUCING OPERATING COSTS; 

PROVIDE A WIDER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS; AND 

ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL PARTIALLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY USE TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WILL SATISFY OUR CUSTOMERS DEMANDS FOR CONVENIENCE, AS WELL AS TO
CREATE ADDITIONAL OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. OUR LARGER COMPETITORS ALREADY HAVE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES OR SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS. WE GENERALLY ARRANGE FOR SUCH SERVICES THROUGH SERVICE BUREAU
ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES COULD FAIL OR BE CIRCUMVENTED 
 MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES. ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS, HOWEVER WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, BUT NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCES OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS, AND THAT THE OBJECTIVES
OF THESE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN MET. ANY FAILURE OR CIRCUMVENTION OF OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS RELATED TO CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION. THE OCCURRENCE OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BREACHES OF OUR INFORMATION SECURITY OR CYBERSECURITY-RELATED INCIDENTS COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE
ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, INFORMATION SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBERSECURITY-RELATED INCIDENTS THAT MAY BE COMMITTED AGAINST US OR OUR CLIENTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INCREASED COSTS TO US OR OUR CLIENTS, DISCLOSURE OR
MISUSE OF OUR INFORMATION OR OUR CLIENT INFORMATION, MISAPPROPRIATION OF ASSETS, PRIVACY BREACHES AGAINST OUR CLIENTS, LITIGATION, OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. SUCH FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY MAY TAKE MANY FORMS, INCLUDING CHECK FRAUD, ELECTRONIC FRAUD,
WIRE FRAUD, PHISHING, SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND OTHER DISHONEST ACTS. INFORMATION SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBERSECURITY-RELATED INCIDENTS MAY INCLUDE FRAUDULENT OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SYSTEMS USED BY US OR OUR CLIENTS, DENIAL OR DEGRADATION OF SERVICE
ATTACKS, AND MALWARE OR OTHER CYBER-ATTACKS. IN RECENT PERIODS, THERE CONTINUES TO BE A RISE IN ELECTRONIC FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBER-ATTACKS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR
DUE TO CYBER CRIMINALS TARGETING COMMERCIAL BANK ACCOUNTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY TRENDS, WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN ATTEMPTED ELECTRONIC FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS ATTEMPTS AT SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBERSECURITY-RELATED
INCIDENTS IN RECENT PERIODS. MOREOVER, IN RECENT PERIODS, SEVERAL LARGE CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND RETAIL COMPANIES, HAVE SUFFERED MAJOR DATA BREACHES, IN SOME

SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM DATA BREACHES OF SUCH THIRD PARTY S INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR THEIR PAYMENT PROCESSORS. SUCH A DATA SECURITY BREACH COULD COMPROMISE OUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION. WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH REIMBURSING OUR
CUSTOMERS FOR SUCH FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS ON CUSTOMERS CARD ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER COSTS RELATED TO DATA SECURITY BREACHES, SUCH AS REPLACING CARDS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPROMISED CARD ACCOUNTS. 
 IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LEVELS AND SOPHISTICATION, ADVANCES IN COMPUTER CAPABILITIES, NEW DISCOVERIES,
VULNERABILITIES IN THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING BROWSERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS) OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS COULD RESULT IN A COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF THE TECHNOLOGY, PROCESSES AND CONTROLS THAT WE USE TO PREVENT FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS AND TO
PROTECT DATA ABOUT US, OUR CLIENTS AND UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY USED BY OUR CLIENTS TO ACCESS OUR SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN, SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT
SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBER-ATTACKS AND PERIODICALLY TEST OUR SECURITY, OUR INABILITY TO ANTICIPATE, OR FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MITIGATE, BREACHES OF SECURITY COULD RESULT IN: LOSSES TO US OR OUR CLIENTS; OUR LOSS OF BUSINESS AND/OR CLIENTS; DAMAGE TO
OUR REPUTATION; THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL EXPENSES; DISRUPTION TO OUR BUSINESS; OUR INABILITY TO GROW OUR ONLINE SERVICES OR OTHER BUSINESSES; ADDITIONAL REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR PENALTIES; OR OUR EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE FINANCIAL
LIABILITY ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. MORE GENERALLY, PUBLICIZED INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY AND CYBER-RELATED PROBLEMS COULD INHIBIT THE USE OR GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC OR WEB-BASED APPLICATIONS OR SOLUTIONS AS A MEANS OF CONDUCTING
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS. SUCH PUBLICITY MAY ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR BREACHES OF SECURITY IN OUR ONLINE BANKING SERVICES. FEAR OF SECURITY BREACHES (INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY BREACHES) COULD
LIMIT THE GROWTH OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES WE OFFER VARIOUS INTERNET-BASED SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING ONLINE
BANKING SERVICES. THE SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN OUR CLIENTS CONFIDENCE IN OUR ONLINE SERVICES. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING CUSTOMERS PROPRIETARY
INFORMATION AS WELL AS THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH US. WE HAVE SECURITY MEASURES AND PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DEFEND AGAINST THESE CYBERSECURITY RISKS BUT THESE CYBER ATTACKS ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING (INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS CODE, PHISHING OR OTHER
INFORMATION SECURITY BREACHES), AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR PREVENT ALL SUCH ATTACKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE, GATHERING, MONITORING, MISUSE, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF OUR OR OUR CUSTOMERS CONFIDENTIAL,

 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
LETTER SR-09-4 THAT STATES THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO INFORM AND CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY STAFF PRIOR TO TAKING ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED CAPITAL BASE, INCLUDING ANY PAYMENT OR INCREASE IN THE
RATE OF DIVIDENDS. FURTHER, IF WE ARE NOT CURRENT IN OUR PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON OUR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, WE MAY NOT PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. IF THE BANK WERE TO LIQUIDATE, THE BANK S CREDITORS WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ASSETS OF THE BANK TO SATISFY THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANK BEFORE BANCORP, AS A HOLDER OF THE
EQUITY INTEREST IN THE BANK, WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE BANK AS A DISTRIBUTION OR DIVIDEND. THE
RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MOREOVER, HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ONLY WHEN, AS AND IF DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE HAVE NEVER PAID CASH
DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK DIMINISHES THE CASH AVAILABLE TO OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.
 ON NOVEMBER 30, 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT WITH

OBLIGATIONS OF 1 ST ENTERPRISE BANK IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
ISSUANCE OF THE SAME NUMBER AND TYPE OF SECURITIES TO THE TREASURY (WHICH SHARES WERE RETIRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH). THE ISSUANCE WAS PURSUANT TO THE TREASURY S SBLF PROGRAM, A 30 BILLION FUND ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS JOBS ACT
OF 2010, WHICH ENCOURAGES LENDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING CAPITAL TO QUALIFIED COMMUNITY BANKS WITH ASSETS OF LESS THAN 10 BILLION. THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE NON-CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON EACH JANUARY 1, APRIL 1, JULY 1 AND OCTOBER 1. THE CURRENT DIVIDEND RATE IS
FIXED AT THE CURRENT RATE OF 1 THROUGH JANUARY 2016. IF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REMAINS OUTSTANDING BEYOND JANUARY
2016, THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE FIXED AT 9 . DEPENDING ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AT THE TIME, THIS INCREASE IN THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON SHARES. OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO HOW WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL

 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCESSES ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW WE RECORD AND REPORT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SOME OF
THESE POLICIES REQUIRE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. SEVERAL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND
COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS WOULD BE REPORTED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OR USING DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS. PURSUANT TO U.S. GAAP, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE
CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR
ESTIMATES UNDERLYING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES. MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION; 

PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY FINANCIAL ANALYSTS; 

FAILURE TO MEET ANALYSTS REVENUE OR EARNINGS ESTIMATES; 

SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY; 

STRATEGIC ACTIONS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS OR RESTRUCTURINGS; 

ACTIONS BY INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDERS; 

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK PRICE AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR COMPETITORS; 

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY;

PROPOSED OR ADOPTED REGULATORY CHANGES OR DEVELOPMENTS; 

ANTICIPATED OR PENDING INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS OR LITIGATION THAT INVOLVE OR AFFECT US; 

DELETION FROM A WELL KNOWN INDEX; OR 

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC FACTORS UNRELATED TO OUR PERFORMANCE. 
 THE STOCK MARKET AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE MARKET FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION STOCKS, MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY BASED ON ITS
HISTORY. AS A RESULT, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE. IN ADDITION, THE TRADING VOLUME IN OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE MORE THAN USUAL AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PRICE VARIATIONS TO OCCUR. THE TRADING PRICE OF THE SHARES OF OUR
COMMON STOCK AND THE VALUE OF OUR OTHER SECURITIES WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, WHICH MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, PERFORMANCE, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PROSPECTS, FUTURE SALES OF OUR EQUITY OR
EQUITY RELATED SECURITIES, AND OTHER 
 43 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FACTORS IDENTIFIED ABOVE IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES FOR INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS AND COULD LEAD TO
COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE SECURITIES LITIGATION. THE HOLDERS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES HAVE RIGHTS THAT ARE
SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND THAT MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, OUR SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS HAD OUTSTANDING 12.4 MILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. THESE SECURITIES ARE
EFFECTIVELY SENIOR TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK DUE TO THE PRIORITY OF THE UNDERLYING JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT. AS A RESULT, WE MUST MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES BEFORE ANY DIVIDENDS CAN BE PAID ON OUR COMMON STOCK; MOREOVER, IN THE
EVENT OF OUR BANKRUPTCY, DISSOLUTION, OR LIQUIDATION, THE OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO OUR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES MUST BE SATISFIED BEFORE ANY DISTRIBUTIONS CAN BE MADE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. WHILE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFER DIVIDENDS
ON THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO FIVE YEARS, IF ANY SUCH ELECTION IS MADE, NO DIVIDENDS MAY BE PAID TO OUR COMMON OR PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS DURING THAT TIME. 
 ON NOVEMBER 30, 2014, THE COMPANY ISSUED AND SOLD 16,400 SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK TO THE TREASURY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF 1 ST ENTERPRISE BANK AND
IN REPLACEMENT FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED TO THE TREASURY BY 1 ST ENTERPRISE PURSUANT TO THE TREASURY S SBLF PROGRAM. THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE NON-CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS PAYABLE QUARTERLY. SUCH DIVIDENDS ARE NOT CUMULATIVE, BUT THE COMPANY
MAY ONLY DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK IF IT HAS DECLARED AND PAID DIVIDENDS FOR THE CURRENT DIVIDEND PERIOD ON THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK. THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS TO CU BANCORP. IN PARTICULAR, FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING LAWS REGULATE
THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL. THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES
FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH MORE STRINGENT RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES AND LEVERAGE LIMITS APPLICABLE TO BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. IN JULY 2013, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED FINAL RULES, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ARE
INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION S REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES, INCLUDING THE REFORMS KNOWN AS BASEL III. THE FINAL BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE FRB PROVIDE THAT DISTRIBUTIONS
(INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REDEMPTIONS) ON ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS MAY ONLY BE PAID OUT OF NET INCOME, RETAINED EARNINGS, OR SURPLUS RELATED TO OTHER ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FINAL BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS
ALSO INTRODUCE A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER ON TOP OF THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS WILL RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CU BANCORP S ABILITY TO MAKE DIVIDEND
PAYMENTS, REDEMPTIONS OR OTHER CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS. THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY OTHER NEW REGULATIONS OR CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION CONSTRAINTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO CU BANCORP AND, IN TURN,
AFFECT CU BANCORP S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THE CU BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND/OR THE CU BANCORP PREFERRED STOCK. THE
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY ALSO, AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, OTHERWISE LIMIT CU BANCORP S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THE CU BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND/OR THE CU BANCORP PREFERRED STOCK. 
 IN ADDITION, THE CU BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND THE CU BANCORP PREFERRED STOCK MAY BE FULLY SUBORDINATE TO INTERESTS HELD BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT OF A RECEIVERSHIP, INSOLVENCY, LIQUIDATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING, INCLUDING A PROCEEDING UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. 
 CU BANCORP MAY BE UNABLE TO, OR CHOOSE NOT TO, PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK. 
 TO DATE, CU BANCORP HAS NOT PAID ANY CASH DIVIDENDS. PAYMENT OF STOCK OR CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THE FOLLOWING
FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS: 

CU BANCORP MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EARNINGS SINCE ITS PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO IT BY CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK, IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK TO PAY DIVIDENDS; 
 44 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE OVER THE PAST YEAR
AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATION S EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION; 

BEFORE DIVIDENDS MAY BE PAID ON CU BANCORP S COMMON STOCK IN ANY YEAR, PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE ON ITS SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES OR THE CU BANCORP
PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER WITH
1 ST ENTERPRISE; 

CU BANCORP S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DETERMINE THAT, EVEN THOUGH FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, RETAINING THE FUNDS FOR INTERNAL USES,
SUCH AS EXPANSION OF ITS OPERATIONS, IS A BETTER STRATEGY; IF CU BANCORP FAILS TO PAY DIVIDENDS, CAPITAL
APPRECIATION, IF ANY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK MAY BE THE SOLE OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINS ON AN INVESTMENT IN ITS COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT CALIFORNIA UNITED BANK BECOMES UNABLE TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO IT, CU BANCORP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE ITS
DEBT, PAY ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK. ACCORDINGLY, CU BANCORP S INABILITY TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS FROM ITS BANK SUBSIDIARY COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND THE VALUE OF CU BANCORP COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, THE TERMS OF THE CU BANCORP PREFERRED STOCK THAT WAS EXCHANGED FOR 1ST ENTERPRISE PREFERRED STOCK IN THE MERGER LIMIT CU BANCORP S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK.
 CU BANCORP S STOCK TRADING VOLUME MAY NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR INVESTORS. 
 ALTHOUGH SHARES OF CU BANCORP S COMMON STOCK ARE LISTED FOR TRADING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME IN
THE COMMON STOCK IS LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER LARGER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET HAVING THE DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF DEPTH, LIQUIDITY AND ORDERLINESS DEPENDS ON THE PRESENCE IN THE MARKETPLACE OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
WILLING BUYERS AND SELLERS OF THE COMMON STOCK AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THIS PRESENCE DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS OF INVESTORS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS OVER WHICH CU BANCORP HAS NO CONTROL. GIVEN THE DAILY AVERAGE TRADING VOLUME
OF CU BANCORP S COMMON STOCK, SIGNIFICANT SALES OF THE COMMON STOCK IN A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME, OR THE EXPECTATION OF THESE SALES, COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

WE HAVE A
LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY THAT YOU CAN USE TO EVALUATE US, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF
OUR SUCCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES,
COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS THAT WE MAY ENCOUNTER BECAUSE WE ARE A SMALL BUSINESS.
AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE
SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO DEVELOP AS WE HAVE PLANNED. 

OUR
ABILITY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY AND POSITIVE CASH FLOW WILL BE
DEPENDENT UPON: 

MANAGEMENT S
 ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE SKILLS FOR OUR CONVERSION
 SERVICES; 

THE
 COMPANY S ABILITY TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE CHANGES BY THE SECURITIES AND
 EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGARDING ITS EDGAR
SYSTEM; 

OUR
 ABILITY TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS WHO REQUIRE THE SERVICES WE OFFER;
 AND 

OUR
 ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR SERVICES TO POTENTIAL
 CLIENTS WHO NEED OUR FILING
SERVICES. 

BASED
UPON CURRENT PLANS, WE EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS
BECAUSE WE WILL BE INCURRING EXPENSES AND NOT GENERATING SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO
COVER OUR EXPENSES. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN
GENERATING REVENUES IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES
WILL CAUSE US TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY WOULD BE
LOST. 

MANAGING
A SMALL PUBLIC COMPANY INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. FEW SMALL PUBLIC
COMPANIES EVER REACH MARKET STABILITY AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT FROM
GOVERNING BODIES AND REGULATIONS THAT WILL BE COSTLY TO MEET. OUR PRESENT
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS DO NOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING A FULLY REPORTING
PUBLIC COMPANY SO WE MAY BE FORCED TO OBTAIN OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO ASSIST WITH
OUR MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS. THESE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS ARE EXPENSIVE
AND CAN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO BE PROFITABLE. THIS WILL MAKE AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND RISKY INVESTMENT. 

WHILE THE
COMPANY IS ATTEMPTING TO DISCLOSE ALL OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN
INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE RISKS ARE
VISIBLE TO MANAGEMENT. EVENTS OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE MAY BE ADDITIONAL
RISKS TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY WHICH ARE CURRENTLY
UNFORESEEN.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING
RESULTS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RISKS. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY FORESEEABLE TO US MAY
ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING
RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASE, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS
MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

THIS FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE STATEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF FORWARD-LOOKING TERMINOLOGY SUCH
AS BELIEVES, EXPECTS, INTENDS, PLANS, MAY, WILL, 
 SHOULD, OR ANTICIPATION OR THE NEGATIVE THEREOF OR OTHER VARIATIONS THEREON OR COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY.
ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD- LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS,
INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. 

RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS 

OUR COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE
COMPANY THAT HAS NO PRODUCTS APPROVED FOR COMMERCIAL SALE, NEVER GENERATED ANY REVENUES AND MAY NEVER ACHIEVE REVENUES OR PROFITABILITY. 

OUR COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
THAT HAS NO PRODUCTS APPROVED FOR COMMERCIAL SALE, NEVER GENERATED ANY REVENUES AND MAY NEVER ACHIEVE REVENUES OR PROFITABILITY.
WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE NO PRODUCTS APPROVED FOR COMMERCIAL SALE AND, TO DATE,
WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE DEPENDS HEAVILY ON: 

DEMONSTRATION AND PROOF OF PRINCIPLE IN PRE-CLINICAL
TRIALS THAT A NANOVIRICIDE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE; 

SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FIRST PRODUCT CANDIDATES
FLUCIDE, NANOVIRICIDE EYE DROPS, HIVCIDE, HERPECIDE OR ANOTHER ONE OF THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE; 

OUR ABILITY TO SEEK AND OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE INDICATIONS WE ARE SEEKING; 

THE SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES;
AND 

MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. 

ALL OF OUR EXISTING PRODUCT CANDIDATES
ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE SEVERAL YEARS, IF EVER, UNTIL WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL DRUG PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR RESALE.
IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE THESE PRODUCTS, WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE REVENUES OR PROFITABILITY IN THE FORESEEABLE
FUTURE, IF AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE REVENUES OR ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WITH
A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS AND YOUR INVESTMENT. WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT
STAGE AND OUR OPERATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPOSED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A NEW BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: 

THE ABSENCE OF AN OPERATING HISTORY; 

THE LACK OF COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCTS; 

INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL; 

EXPECTED SUBSTANTIAL AND CONTINUAL LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE; 

LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH REGULATORY ISSUES; THE LACK OF MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE AND LIMITED MARKETING EXPERIENCE; 

AN EXPECTED RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PROPOSED PRODUCTS; 

A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY NUMEROUS, WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WELL CAPITALIZED COMPETITORS; AND 

RELIANCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. 

BECAUSE WE ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RISKS,
YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY. 

OUR ABILITY TO BECOME PROFITABLE DEPENDS
PRIMARILY ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 

OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DRUGS, OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR SUCH DRUGS, AND IF APPROVED, TO SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE OUR NANOVIRICIDE
DRUG(S); 

OUR R D EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE TIMING AND COST OF CLINICAL TRIALS; AND 

OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO FAVORABLE ALLIANCES WITH THIRD-PARTIES WHO CAN PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL CAPABILITIES IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT,
REGULATORY AFFAIRS, SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. 

66 

EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND
MARKET OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, WE MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT OR SUSTAINABLE REVENUE TO ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY. 

WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING
LOSSES AND MAY NOT EVER BE PROFITABLE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE HAD A CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCE OF 13,923,245. ALSO, THE
COMPANY HAS INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES SINCE ITS INCEPTION, RESULTING IN AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF 38,299,783 AT JUNE
30, 2014. SUCH LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT OF RECENT FINANCING, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES
THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT CASH TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS THROUGH THE NEXT TWO YEARS, I.E. THROUGH JUNE, 2015. 

WE WILL NEED TO RAISE SUBSTANTIAL
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE SUCH FUNDS WHEN NEEDED AND ON ACCEPTABLE
TERMS. 

WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES
TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ANY OF OUR PROPOSED PRODUCTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE HAVE A CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENT BALANCE OF 13,923,245 WHICH COMBINED WITH THE PROCEEDS RAISED IN THE OFFERING OF 10.33 MILLION AFTER THE CLOSE OF
THE COMPANY S YEAR-END, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AT OUR BUDGETED RATE OF
EXPENDITURES. 

IN THE EVENT THAT WE CANNOT OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE
FINANCING, OR THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT
OF OUR VARIOUS DRUG CANDIDATES. THIS WOULD NECESSITATE IMPLEMENTING STAFF REDUCTIONS AND OPERATIONAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD INCLUDE
REDUCTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS AREAS: 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; 

PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS; MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES, REGULATORY PROCESSES; 

ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR OWN LABORATORY OR A SEARCH FOR THIRD PARTY MARKETING PARTNERS TO MARKET OUR
PRODUCTS FOR US. 

THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE MAY NEED WILL
DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE: 

PROGRESS, TIMING AND SCOPE OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; 

PROGRESS, TIMING AND SCOPE OF OUR PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS; 

TIME AND COST NECESSARY TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS; 

TIME AND COST NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN MARKETING CAPABILITIES OR TO SEEK MARKETING PARTNERS; 

TIME AND COST NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS; 

CHANGES MADE OR NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR EXISTING COLLABORATIVE, LICENSING AND OTHER COMMERCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS; AND 

NEW COLLABORATIVE, LICENSING AND OTHER COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE MAY ESTABLISH. 

OUR FIXED EXPENSES, SUCH AS RENT, LICENSE
PAYMENTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, AS WE MAY: 

ENTER INTO LEASES FOR NEW FACILITIES AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT; 

ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL LICENSES AND COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS; AND 

INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY. 

WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN DRUG
DEVELOPMENT AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP ANY DRUGS. 

UNTIL THE FORMATION OF NANOVIRICIDE, INC.
(THE COMPANY S PREDECESSOR PRIOR TO THE REVERSE MERGER IN 2005) OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN PHARMACEUTICAL
DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP ANY DRUGS. OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY
IN OUR BUSINESS WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON OUR ABILITY TO: 

DEVELOP PRODUCTS INTERNALLY OR OBTAIN RIGHTS TO THEM FROM OTHERS ON FAVORABLE TERMS; 

COMPLETE LABORATORY TESTING AND HUMAN STUDIES; 

OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN NECESSARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCTS; 

SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE REGULATORY REVIEW TO OBTAIN REQUISITE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY APPROVALS; 

ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS ON OUR BEHALF; AND 

ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS. 

DEVELOPMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS
IS A TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. CONSEQUENTLY, WE CAN PROVIDE
NO ASSURANCE OF THE SUCCESSFUL AND TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS. 

OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL
STAGE. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENSIVE TESTING WILL BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THEIR TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY AND COMMERCIAL VIABILITY.
OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND TO TRANSLATE SUCH ADVANCES INTO RELIABLE,
COMMERCIALLY COMPETITIVE DRUGS ON A TIMELY BASIS. DRUGS THAT WE MAY DEVELOP ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR A FEW
YEARS. THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL
DIFFICULTIES, PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY OF OTHERS, AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION, MANY OF WHICH WILL NOT BE WITHIN OUR CONTROL.
ANY DELAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT, INTRODUCTION OR MARKETING OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES COULD RESULT EITHER IN SUCH DRUGS BEING MARKETED
AT A TIME WHEN THEIR COST AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD NOT BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE OR IN THE SHORTENING OF THEIR
COMMERCIAL LIVES. IN LIGHT OF THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF OUR PROJECTS, THE UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED AND THE OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED
ELSEWHERE IN RISK FACTORS , WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY THE DEVELOPMENT OR MARKETING OF ANY DRUGS. 

67 

WE MAY FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND
COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES BECAUSE THEY: 

ARE FOUND TO BE UNSAFE OR INEFFECTIVE IN CLINICAL TRIALS; 

DO NOT RECEIVE NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM THE FDA OR FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES; 

FAIL TO CONFORM TO A CHANGING STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE DISEASES THEY SEEK TO TREAT; OR 

ARE LESS EFFECTIVE OR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CURRENT OR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT METHODS. 

DRUG DEVELOPMENT FAILURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY
STAGE OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS WILL REACH
OUR ANTICIPATED CLINICAL TARGETS. EVEN IF WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS COMPLETE OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE LONG-TERM
EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL BE. FURTHERMORE, OUR DRUG CANDIDATES MAY BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER TREATMENTS
AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH USE WILL NOT LEAD TO UNIQUE SAFETY ISSUES. FAILURE TO COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS OR TO PROVE
THAT OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND COULD
REQUIRE US TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OF OR DISCONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE MUST COMPLY WITH SIGNIFICANT AND
COMPLEX GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, COMPLIANCE WITH WHICH MAY DELAY OR PREVENT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

THE R D, MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING
OF DRUG CANDIDATES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION, PRIMARILY BY THE FDA IN THE UNITED STATES AND BY COMPARABLE AUTHORITIES IN OTHER
COUNTRIES. THESE NATIONAL AGENCIES AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN ENTITIES REGULATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, R D ACTIVITIES
(INCLUDING TESTING IN PRIMATES AND IN HUMANS) AND THE TESTING, MANUFACTURING, HANDLING, LABELING, STORAGE, RECORD KEEPING, APPROVAL,
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN VARIOUS
ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING APPROVAL DELAYS OR REFUSALS TO APPROVE DRUG LICENSES OR OTHER APPLICATIONS, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION
OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS, REVOCATION OF APPROVALS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED, FINES, CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, RECALLS OR SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS,
INJUNCTIONS AGAINST SHIPPING DRUGS AND TOTAL OR PARTIAL SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION AND/OR REFUSAL TO ALLOW A COMPANY TO ENTER INTO
GOVERNMENTAL SUPPLY CONTRACTS. 

THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING FDA APPROVAL HAS
HISTORICALLY BEEN COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. CURRENT FDA REQUIREMENTS FOR A NEW HUMAN DRUG OR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT TO BE MARKETED
IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE: (1) THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF PRE-CLINICAL LABORATORY AND ANIMAL TESTS, IF APPROPRIATE, TO GAIN
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCT S SAFETY; (2) FILING WITH THE FDA OF AN IND APPLICATION TO CONDUCT HUMAN CLINICAL
TRIALS FOR DRUGS OR BIOLOGICS; (3) THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ADEQUATE AND WELL-CONTROLLED HUMAN CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS TO ESTABLISH
THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCT FOR ITS RECOMMENDED USE; AND (4) FILING BY A COMPANY AND ACCEPTANCE AND APPROVAL BY THE
FDA OF A NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR NDA, FOR A DRUG PRODUCT OR A BIOLOGICAL LICENSE APPLICATION, OR BLA, FOR A BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT
TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE DRUG OR BIOLOGIC. A DELAY IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PROCEDURAL STEPS OUTLINED ABOVE COULD BE
HARMFUL TO US IN TERMS OF GETTING OUR DRUG CANDIDATES THROUGH CLINICAL TESTING AND TO MARKET. 

THE FDA REVIEWS THE RESULTS OF THE CLINICAL
TRIALS AND MAY ORDER THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT DISCONTINUATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS AT ANY TIME IF IT BELIEVES THE DRUG CANDIDATE
EXPOSES CLINICAL SUBJECTS TO AN UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH RISK. INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS USED IN CLINICAL STUDIES MUST BE PRODUCED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE, OR GMP, RULES PURSUANT TO FDA REGULATIONS. 

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF PRODUCTS
THAT WE DEVELOP WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS AND MARKETING FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL
PRODUCTS AND DEVICES. THE REQUIREMENTS VARY WIDELY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, BUT TYPICALLY THE REGISTRATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS
TAKES SEVERAL YEARS AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. IN MOST CASES, EVEN IF THE FDA HAS NOT APPROVED A PRODUCT FOR SALE IN THE
UNITED STATES, THE PRODUCT MAY BE EXPORTED TO ANY COUNTRY IF IT COMPLIES WITH THE LAWS OF THAT COUNTRY AND HAS VALID MARKETING
AUTHORIZATION BY THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY. THERE ARE SPECIFIC FDA REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN THIS PROCESS. 

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RISKS
AND OBLIGATIONS, RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF OUR PRODUCTS: 

THE FDA OR FOREIGN REGULATORS MAY INTERPRET DATA FROM PRE-CLINICAL TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS
IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAN WE INTERPRET THEM. 

IF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF A PRODUCT IS GRANTED, THE APPROVAL MAY BE LIMITED TO SPECIFIC INDICATIONS
OR LIMITED WITH RESPECT TO ITS DISTRIBUTION. 

IN ADDITION, MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES CONTROL PRICING AND COVERAGE UNDER THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONAL
SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS. 

THE FDA OR FOREIGN REGULATORS MAY NOT APPROVE OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. 

THE FDA OR FOREIGN REGULATORS MAY CHANGE THEIR APPROVAL POLICIES OR ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS. 

68 

EVEN IF REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR ANY PRODUCT IS OBTAINED, THE MARKETING LICENSE WILL BE SUBJECT
TO CONTINUAL REVIEW, AND NEWLY DISCOVERED OR DEVELOPED SAFETY OR EFFECTIVENESS DATA MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF THE
MARKETING LICENSE. 

IF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS GRANTED, THE MARKETING OF THAT PRODUCT WOULD
BE SUBJECT TO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND A GENERAL PROHIBITION AGAINST PROMOTING PRODUCTS FOR UNAPPROVED OR OFF-LABEL 
USES. 

IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO OFFICIAL RELEASE REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE EACH
BATCH OF THE PRODUCT WE PRODUCE TO BE OFFICIALLY RELEASED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES PRIOR TO ITS DISTRIBUTION BY US. 

WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO CONTINUAL REGULATORY REVIEW AND PERIODIC INSPECTION AND APPROVAL OF MANUFACTURING
MODIFICATIONS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT GMP REGULATIONS. 

WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT
OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OR THAT THE RESULTS OF CLINICAL STUDIES WILL BE FAVORABLE. 

THE COMPANY REPORTS SUMMARY OF ITS STUDIES
AS THE DATA BECOME AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AFTER ANALYZING AND VERIFYING SAME, IN ITS PRESS RELEASES. 

IN ACCORD WITH OUR WORK-PLAN WE FILED A
PRE-IND APPLICATION WITH THE US FDA, AND HELD A MEETING WITH THE US FDA FOR OUR ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUG CANDIDATE, NV-INF-1 IN MARCH,
2012. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, WE HAVE A DEVELOPED AN ORALLY AVAILABLE ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUG CANDIDATE BASED ON OUR NANOVIRICIDES TECHNOLOGY.
THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT A TARGETED NANOMEDICINE WITH ACTIVITY WHEN GIVEN ORALLY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND SUCH ACTIVITY
DEMONSTRATED IN VIVO. WE ARE NOW PERFORMING CERTAIN PRECLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES ON THIS DRUG CANDIDATE. A SET OF THESE STUDIES IS
DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND TOXICOLOGY IN ANIMAL MODELS. ANOTHER SET OF THE STUDIES IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE PHARMACOKINETICS
AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF THE DRUG IN ANIMALS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEGUN TO PERFORM EFFICACY STUDIES USING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT UNRELATED
TYPES AND SUBTYPES OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTI-INFLUENZA ACTIVITY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. THE
EFFICACY STUDIES ARE BEING PERFORMED IN VARIOUS IN VITRO (CELL CULTURE) MODELS AS WELL AS IN VIVO (ANIMAL) MODELS. IN ADDITION,
WE ARE PERFORMING CERTAIN CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS, CHEMISTRY SYNTHESIS PROCESS OPTIMIZATIONS, AND QUALITY CONTROL
AND QUALITY ASSURANCE STUDIES. FURTHER, WE NEED TO SCALE UP THE SYNTHESES TO A LARGER SCALE OF ABOUT 1KG. THESE CHEMISTRY, CHARACTERIZATION,
MANUFACTURING, AND QUALITY STUDIES WILL FORM PART OF THE CMC PACKAGE (CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING, AND CONTROLS). THE DATA WILL THEN
BE USED TO FILE AN IND APPLICATION OR ITS OVERSEAS EQUIVALENT, TOWARDS THE GOAL OF OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR TESTING THE
DRUGS IN HUMANS. 

ON JULY 23, 2012 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED
THAT IT HAD RETAINED AUSTRALIAN BIOLOGICS PTY. LTD, A REGULATORY AFFAIRS CONSULTING FIRM, TO COORDINATE THE REGULATORY REVIEW AND
APPROVAL TO CONDUCT THE FIRST HUMAN TRIALS IN AUSTRALIA FOR FLUCIDE , THE COMPANY S BROAD SPECTRUM ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUG.
AUSTRALIAN BIOLOGICS PTY. LTD WILL ALSO FACILITATE CLINICAL TRIAL SITE SELECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL TRIAL AGREEMENTS WHICH
WE INTEND TO PURSUE. THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY RETAINED THE BIOLOGICS CONSULTING GROUP FOR HELPING US FORMULATE OUR REGULATORY
STRATEGY, DESIGN THE STUDIES TO BE PERFORMED, AND DEVELOP THE IND APPLICATION FOR SUBMISSION TO THE US FDA. 

THE TESTING, MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING
OF ANY PRODUCT FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES WILL REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM THE FDA. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT
OF TIME NECESSARY TO OBTAIN SUCH FDA APPROVAL AND WHETHER ANY SUCH APPROVAL WILL ULTIMATELY BE GRANTED. PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL
TRIALS MAY REVEAL THAT ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS ARE INEFFECTIVE OR UNSAFE, IN WHICH EVENT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD
BE SERIOUSLY DELAYED OR TERMINATED. MOREOVER, OBTAINING APPROVAL FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE TESTING ON HUMAN SUBJECTS OF
SUBSTANCES WHOSE EFFECTS ON HUMANS ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD OR DOCUMENTED. DELAYS IN OBTAINING FDA OR ANY OTHER NECESSARY REGULATORY
APPROVALS OF ANY PROPOSED DRUG AND FAILURE TO RECEIVE SUCH APPROVALS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DRUG S POTENTIAL
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
A PROPOSED DRUG MAY BE FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE OR UNSAFE DUE TO CONDITIONS OR FACTS THAT ARISE AFTER DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED
AND REGULATORY APPROVALS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED. IN THIS EVENT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW SUCH PROPOSED DRUG FROM THE MARKET.
TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON ANY REGULATORY APPROVALS FROM GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT PERFORM ROLES SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE FDA, UNCERTAINTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE STATED ABOVE WILL ALSO EXIST. 

EVEN IF WE OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS,
OUR MARKETED DRUG CANDIDATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REGULATORY REVIEW. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUING U.S. AND FOREIGN
REGULATIONS, WE COULD LOSE OUR APPROVALS TO MARKET THESE DRUGS AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. 

FOLLOWING ANY INITIAL REGULATORY APPROVAL
OF ANY DRUGS WE MAY DEVELOP, WE WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CONTINUING REGULATORY REVIEW, INCLUDING THE REVIEW OF ADVERSE EXPERIENCES
AND CLINICAL RESULTS THAT ARE REPORTED AFTER OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE MADE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE RESULTS FROM
ANY POST-MARKETING TESTS OR VIGILANCE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL. THE MANUFACTURER AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WE USE
TO MAKE ANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW AND INSPECTION BY THE FDA. THE DISCOVERY OF ANY PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THE DRUG, MANUFACTURER OR FACILITY MAY RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE DRUG OR MANUFACTURER OR FACILITY, INCLUDING
WITHDRAWAL OF THE DRUG FROM THE MARKET. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW ALL OR MORE OF OUR DRUGS FROM THE MARKET, WE MAY BE UNABLE
TO CONTINUE REVENUE GENERATING OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT HAVE, AND CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO DEVELOP, THE ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE MATERIAL
FOR OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE. RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS ENTAILS RISKS TO WHICH WE WOULD NOT BE
SUBJECT IF WE MANUFACTURED DRUGS OURSELVES, INCLUDING RELIANCE ON THE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER FOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. OUR DRUG
PROMOTION AND ADVERTISING IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTINUING FDA REVIEW.

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES
REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN R D. OUR R D EXPENSES IN TURN, ARE SUBJECT TO VARIATION BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,
MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR R D EXPENSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE HAVE EXPENDED 28,804,060 ON RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT FROM INCEPTION THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014. 

WE HAVE AN R D AND OTHER COSTS BUDGET
OF APPROXIMATELY 5,000,000 FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST A NUMBER
OF VIRAL DISEASES AND COMPLETED PROOF OF PRINCIPLE STUDIES AGAINST A NUMBER OF VIRAL DISEASES. WE NOW HAVE LEAD DRUG COMPOUNDS
AGAINST ALL INFLUENZAS, HIV, VIRAL DISEASES OF THE EYE, ORAL AND GENITAL HERPES, AND DENGUE VIRUSES. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON
IDENTIFYING AND ESTABLISHING COLLABORATIONS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
CO- DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE EFFORTS, WE WILL CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DRUGS, AS WELL AS OUR
OTHER DRUG DEVELOPMENT ENDEAVORS THAT INCLUDE RABIES, DENGUE VIRUSES, AND EBOLA/MARBURG VIRUSES. 

WE CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS ON HAND
TO TAKE A DRUG CANDIDATE INTO HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS. WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE PURSUING INJECTABLE FLUCIDE TM AS OUR FIRST
DRUG CANDIDATE FOR AN IND AND INITIATING HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS. BEYOND THIS DEVELOPMENT, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE MAY NEED APPROXIMATELY
AN ADDITIONAL 10M TO 15M FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORAL FLUICIDE AND DENGUECIDE DRUG CANDIDATES TOWARDS IND FILING OVER THE
NEXT 36-48 MONTHS. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL ALSO BE NEEDED TO PAY ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, INCREASED SUBCONTRACT COSTS RELATED TO
THE EXPANSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG PIPELINE, AND FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES REQUIRED TO
FILE THE ADDITIONAL IND APPLICATIONS.. 

THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO PROCEED
WITH ITS BUSINESS PLAN BEYOND JUNE 30, 2016, WITHOUT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING OF APPROXIMATELY 10-15 MILLION TO SUPPORT
ITS BUDGETED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER COSTS. 

BECAUSE WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL
RESOURCES ON R D, OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON THE RESULTS AS WELL AS THE COSTS OF OUR R D. A FAILURE IN OUR R D
EFFORTS OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN OUR R D EXPENSES WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. R D EXPENDITURES
ARE UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO MUCH FLUCTUATION. FACTORS AFFECTING OUR R D EXPENSES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: 

THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF CLINICAL STUDIES WE ARE PLANNING TO CONDUCT; FOR EXAMPLE, OUR R D
EXPENSES MAY INCREASE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LATE-STAGE CLINICAL STUDIES THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT; 

THE NUMBER OF DRUGS ENTERING INTO PRE-CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT FROM RESEARCH; FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS
NO GUARANTEE THAT INTERNAL RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL SUCCEED IN GENERATING SUFFICIENT DATA FOR US TO MAKE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT DECISION; 

LICENSING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RELATED DEVELOPMENT FUNDING OR MILESTONE
PAYMENTS; FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS REQUIRING US TO PAY A SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT FEE FOR THE PURCHASE OF IN-PROCESS
R D THAT WE MAY RECORD AS R D EXPENSE. 

WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING
OR SUPERVISING CLINICAL TRIALS AND MUST OUTSOURCE ALL CLINICAL TRIALS. 

WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING OR
SUPERVISING CLINICAL TRIALS THAT MUST BE PERFORMED TO OBTAIN DATA TO SUBMIT IN CONCERT WITH APPLICATIONS FOR APPROVAL BY THE FOOD
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FDA ). THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR DRUGS FOR COMMERCIAL SALE INVOLVES NUMEROUS
STEPS. DRUGS ARE SUBJECTED TO CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF CASE STUDIES TO EXAMINE SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND OTHER ISSUES
TO ENSURE THAT SALE OF DRUGS MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FDA. IN THE EVENT
THAT OUR PROTOCOLS DO NOT MEET STANDARDS SET FORTH BY THE FDA, OR THAT OUR DATA IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW SUCH TRIALS TO VALIDATE
OUR DRUGS IN THE FACE OF SUCH EXAMINATION, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALLOW OUR DRUGS TO BE APPROVED FOR
SALE. 

BECAUSE WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING
OR SUPERVISING CLINICAL TRIALS, WE MUST OUTSOURCE OUR CLINICAL TRIALS TO THIRD PARTIES. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEIR COMPLIANCE
WITH PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS USED TO COMPLETE CLINICAL TRAILS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS REQUIRED BY THE AGENCIES THAT APPROVE
DRUGS FOR SALE. IF THESE SUBCONTRACTORS FAIL TO MEET THESE STANDARDS, THE VALIDATION OF OUR DRUGS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED,
CAUSING A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET REVENUE-GENERATING OPERATIONS. 

70 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT
IN CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS. THE RISK OF NON COMPLIANCE WITH FDA-APPROVED GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES BY CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS,
CLINICAL SITES, OR DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICES COULD DELAY OR PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING OR EVER COMMERCIALIZING OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

AGREEMENTS WITH CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS
AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR CLINICAL TESTING AND WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICES PLACE SUBSTANTIAL RESPONSIBILITIES
ON THESE PARTIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DELAYS IN, OR TERMINATION OF, OUR CLINICAL TRIALS IF THESE PARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF ANY OF OUR CLINICAL TRIAL SITES FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FDA-APPROVED GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO USE
THE DATA GATHERED AT THOSE SITES. IF THESE CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS, MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES DO NOT CARRY OUT
THEIR CONTRACTUAL DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS OR FAIL TO MEET EXPECTED DEADLINES, OR IF THE QUALITY OR ACCURACY OF THE CLINICAL DATA
THEY OBTAIN IS COMPROMISED DUE TO THEIR FAILURE TO ADHERE TO OUR CLINICAL PROTOCOLS OR FOR OTHER REASONS, OUR CLINICAL TRIALS MAY
BE EXTENDED, DELAYED OR TERMINATED, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR OR SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG
CANDIDATES. 

WE OR REGULATORS MAY SUSPEND OR TERMINATE
OUR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. WE MAY VOLUNTARILY SUSPEND OR TERMINATE OUR CLINICAL TRIALS IF AT ANY TIME WE BELIEVE
THAT THEY PRESENT AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK TO THE PATIENTS ENROLLED IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY ORDER
THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT DISCONTINUATION OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS AT ANY TIME IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NOT
BEING CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THEY PRESENT AN UNACCEPTABLE SAFETY RISK TO THE PATIENTS
ENROLLED IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS. 

OUR CLINICAL TRIAL OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT
TO REGULATORY INSPECTIONS AT ANY TIME. IF REGULATORY INSPECTORS CONCLUDE THAT WE OR OUR CLINICAL TRIAL SITES ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE
WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, WE MAY RECEIVE REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS OR WARNING LETTERS
DETAILING DEFICIENCIES, AND WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. IF REGULATORY AGENCIES DEEM OUR RESPONSES TO BE
INADEQUATE, OR ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT WE OR OUR CLINICAL TRIAL SITES HAVE IMPLEMENTED, OUR CLINICAL
TRIALS MAY BE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED, WE MAY BE FINED, WE OR OUR INVESTIGATORS MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM CONDUCTING
ANY ONGOING OR ANY FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS, THE GOVERNMENT MAY REFUSE TO APPROVE OUR MARKETING APPLICATIONS OR ALLOW US TO MANUFACTURE
OR MARKET OUR DRUG CANDIDATES OR WE MAY BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS AND HAVE OUR PRODUCTS
APPROVED DUE TO OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMENCE REVENUE GENERATING OPERATIONS. 

EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENT AND THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS TO CONTAIN OR REDUCE THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES EVEN IF WE WERE TO DEVELOP AN FDA APPROVED
DRUG. 

OUR ABILITY TO EARN SUFFICIENT RETURNS
ON OUR DRUG CANDIDATES MAY DEPEND IN PART ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOVERNMENT HEALTH ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES, PRIVATE HEALTH COVERAGE
INSURERS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COSTS OF SUCH DRUGS AND RELATED TREATMENTS. SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY
EXISTS AS TO THE REIMBURSEMENT STATUS OF NEWLY APPROVED HEALTH CARE DRUGS, AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ADEQUATE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. IF OUR CURRENT AND PROPOSED DRUGS ARE NOT CONSIDERED COST-EFFECTIVE, REIMBURSEMENT TO
THE CONSUMERS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO SELL DRUGS ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. THE FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE
CONTINUING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, SUSPENSION OR WITHDRAWAL OF REGULATORY APPROVAL, PRODUCT RECALLS
AND SEIZURES, OPERATING RESTRICTIONS AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. 

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES
AND OTHERS MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PREVENT DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. DISCLOSURE OF OUR TRADE SECRETS
OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD COMPROMISE ANY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE. 

WE DEPEND UPON CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS
WITH OUR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MAINTAIN THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THESE MEASURES
MAY NOT AFFORD US SUFFICIENT OR COMPLETE PROTECTION, AND MAY NOT AFFORD AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE EVENT OF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OTHERS MAY INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY SIMILAR TO OURS, OTHERWISE AVOIDING THE CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENTS, OR PRODUCE PATENTS THAT WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS. 

WE WILL RELY UPON LICENSED PATENTS
TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OR PROTECT SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR INFRINGING
UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL
DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY OF OTHERS WITH WHICH
WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED PATENT APPLICATIONS FROM THERACOUR PHARMA, INC. AND EXPECT
TO FILE PATENTS OF OUR OWN IN THE COMING YEARS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL ULTIMATELY
RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF A PATENT WITH RESPECT TO THE TECHNOLOGY OWNED BY US OR LICENSED TO US. THE PATENT POSITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL
OR BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING OURS, IS GENERALLY UNCERTAIN AND INVOLVES COMPLEX LEGAL AND FACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE STANDARDS
THAT THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE USE TO GRANT PATENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS APPLIED PREDICTABLY OR UNIFORMLY AND CAN
CHANGE. THERE IS ALSO NO UNIFORM, WORLDWIDE POLICY REGARDING THE SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF CLAIMS GRANTED OR ALLOWABLE IN PHARMACEUTICAL
OR BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT KNOW THE DEGREE OF FUTURE PROTECTION FOR OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR THE BREADTH
OF CLAIMS THAT WILL BE ALLOWED IN ANY PATENTS ISSUED TO US OR TO OTHERS. FURTHER, WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF TRADE SECRETS, KNOW-HOW,
TECHNOLOGY AND NONDISCLOSURE, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS AND TECHNICAL MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY.
IF ANY TRADE SECRET, KNOW-HOW OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT PROTECTED BY A PATENT WERE TO BE DISCLOSED TO OR INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED
BY A COMPETITOR, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

71 

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE DRUG
CANDIDATES WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES NOR ARE THEY INFRINGED UPON BY THIRD PARTIES;
HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT BE FOUND IN THE FUTURE TO INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR
BE INFRINGED UPON BY OTHERS. IN SUCH A CASE, OTHERS MAY ASSERT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST US, AND SHOULD WE BE FOUND TO INFRINGE
UPON THEIR PATENTS, OR OTHERWISE IMPERMISSIBLY UTILIZE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE MIGHT BE FORCED TO PAY DAMAGES, POTENTIALLY
INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES, IF WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE WILLFULLY INFRINGED ON SUCH PARTIES PATENT RIGHTS. IN ADDITION TO ANY
DAMAGES WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM THE HOLDERS OF THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ENTER INTO
ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, OR REDESIGN OUR DRUG CANDIDATES SO AS NOT TO UTILIZE THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, EACH OF WHICH MAY PROVE TO
BE UNECONOMICAL OR OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE. CONVERSELY, WE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PURSUE OUR CLAIMS AGAINST OTHERS
THAT INFRINGE UPON OUR TECHNOLOGY AND THE TECHNOLOGY EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED FROM THE THERACOUR PHARMA INC. THUS, THE PROPRIETARY
NATURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED BY US MAY NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST COMPETITORS. 

MOREOVER, THE COST TO US OF ANY LITIGATION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING RELATING TO OUR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, EVEN IF RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR, COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL,
AND THE LITIGATION WOULD DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT S EFFORTS. UNCERTAINTIES RESULTING FROM THE INITIATION AND CONTINUATION OF
ANY LITIGATION COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. 

OTHER COMPANIES OR ORGANIZATIONS
MAY ASSERT PATENT RIGHTS THAT PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

WE ARE IN A RELATIVELY NEW SCIENTIFIC FIELD
THAT HAS GENERATED MANY DIFFERENT PATENT APPLICATIONS FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TO OBTAIN IMPORTANT PATENTS IN
THE FIELD. BECAUSE THE FIELD IS SO NEW, VERY FEW OF THESE PATENT APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY PROCESSED BY GOVERNMENT PATENT OFFICES
AROUND THE WORLD, AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHICH PATENTS WILL ISSUE, WHEN, TO WHOM, AND WITH WHAT CLAIMS.
IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS, SUCH AS INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS IN VARIOUS PATENT
OFFICES, RELATING TO PATENT RIGHTS IN THE FIELD. OTHERS MAY ATTEMPT TO INVALIDATE OUR PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
EVEN IF OUR RIGHTS ARE NOT DIRECTLY CHALLENGED, DISPUTES AMONG THIRD PARTIES COULD LEAD TO THE WEAKENING OR INVALIDATION OF THOSE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 

THUS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE ORGANIZATIONS
WILL HOLD PATENT RIGHTS TO WHICH WE WILL NEED A LICENSE. ANY LICENSE REQUIRED UNDER ANY PATENT MAY NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY
ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. IN ADDITION, SUCH LICENSES ARE LIKELY TO BE NON-EXCLUSIVE AND, THEREFORE, OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO US. IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN A REQUIRED LICENSE AND ARE UNABLE TO DESIGN AROUND A PATENT,
WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET SOME OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DRUG CANDIDATES, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES
OR ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY AND POSSIBLY PREVENT US FROM GENERATING REVENUE SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THERACOUR PHARMA
INC. FOR THE RIGHTS TO DEVELOP THE PRODUCTS WE INTEND TO SELL. 

OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND
SELL THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PLANS TO DEVELOP IS DERIVED FROM OUR MATERIAL LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH THERACOUR PHARMA
INC. THERACOUR ). WHILE WE HOLD THE LICENSE IN PERPETUITY, THE AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED BY THERACOUR AS A RESULT
OF: THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS BY OR AGAINST THE COMPANY, A GENERAL ASSIGNMENT BY THE COMPANY TO IS CREDITORS, THE
DISSOLUTION OF THE COMPANY, CESSATION BY THE COMPANY OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS FOR NINETY (90) DAYS OR MORE OR THE COMMENCEMENT BY
THE COMPANY OR AN AFFILIATE TO CHALLENGE OR INVALIDATE THE ISSUED PATENTS. 

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD THE RIGHTS TO
ANY OTHER PATENTS NOR DOES THE COMPANY CONDUCT ITS OWN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCTS TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL.
IF THE COMPANY S AGREEMENT WITH THERACOUR IS TERMINATED, IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMMENCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPERATIONS
OR THAT THE COMPANY COULD CONTINUE OPERATING AT ALL. 

WE LACK SUITABLE FACILITIES FOR CLINICAL
TESTING; RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES. 

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE FACILITIES THAT
COULD BE USED TO CONDUCT CLINICAL TESTING. WE EXPECT TO CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT ALL CLINICAL TESTING REQUIRED TO
OBTAIN APPROVALS FOR ANY DRUGS THAT WE MIGHT DEVELOP. WE CURRENTLY OUTSOURCE ALL CLINICAL TESTING TO A NUMBER OF THIRD PARTIES
IN VARIOUS COLLABORATIONS AND SERVICE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, KARD SCIENTIFIC IS NOT UNDER CONTRACT TO PERFORM STUDIES FOR US,
AND STUDIES ARE COMMISSIONED WITH KARD ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. ANY OF OUR COLLABORATORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY DISCONTINUE THE
SERVICE CONTRACT OR COLLABORATION. WE WILL THEN BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OUR PRIORITIES AND GOALS, OBTAIN OTHER COLLABORATORS OR SERVICE
PROVIDERS TO REPLACE THE ONES WE LOSE, OR WE MAY EVEN BE FORCED TO ABANDON CERTAIN DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, ANY
FAILURES BY THIRD PARTIES TO ADEQUATELY PERFORM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES MAY DELAY THE SUBMISSION OF OUR PROPOSED PRODUCTS FOR REGULATORY
APPROVAL, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR OTHERWISE IMPAIR OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. 

72 

WE HAVE LIMITED MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE. 

THE COMPANY HAS NEVER MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS
IN THE HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST
BE MAINTAINED TO OBTAIN LICENSURE AND THE PERMITS REQUIRED TO COMMENCE MANUFACTURING, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO CONTINUE
MANUFACTURING PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT OWN OR LEASE FACILITIES CURRENTLY THAT COULD BE USED TO MANUFACTURE ANY PRODUCTS
THAT MIGHT BE DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DO WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AT THIS TIME TO ACQUIRE OR LEASE SUITABLE FACILITIES. 

WE HAVE NO SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL. 

WE ARE AN EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, SO HAVE NOT SECURED SALES AND MARKETING STAFF
AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OPERATIONS. WE CANNOT GENERATE SALES WITHOUT SALES OR MARKETING STAFF AND MUST RELY ON OFFICERS TO PROVIDE
ANY SALES OR MARKETING SERVICES UNTIL SUCH STAFF ARE SECURED, IF EVER. EVEN IF WE WERE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP APPROVABLE DRUGS,
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THESE DRUGS IF WE OR OUR THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH MANUFACTURING REGULATIONS. 

IF WE WERE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP APPROVABLE
DRUGS, BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN SELLING THESE DRUGS, WE MUST OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND PROCESS OR
THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND PROCESS OF THE THIRD PARTY OR PARTIES WITH WHOM WE MAY OUTSOURCE OUR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES. IN
ADDITION, THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH THE FDA S CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES REGULATIONS, COMMONLY
KNOWN AS GMP REGULATIONS. THE GMP REGULATIONS GOVERN QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OUR MANUFACTURING
FACILITIES, IF ANY IN THE FUTURE AND THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES OF OUR THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS WILL BE CONTINUALLY SUBJECT
TO INSPECTION BY THE FDA AND OTHER STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, BEFORE AND AFTER PRODUCT APPROVAL. WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE THAT WE, OR ANY POTENTIAL THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER OF OUR PRODUCTS, WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE GMP REGULATIONS OR
OTHER APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING REGULATIONS. 

AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE HAVE
THREE EMPLOYEES AND SEVERAL CONSULTANTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE ONLY CONSULTANT/CONTRACTOR THAT WE CONSIDER CRITICAL TO
THE COMPANY IS THERACOUR, DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT RISK FACTOR. KARD SCIENTIFIC, ANOTHER CONSULTANT/CONTRACTOR (SEE ITEM 1. BACKGROUND:
COLLABORATIONS AND SUBCONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS) IS CONSIDERED BY THE COMPANY IMPORTANT BUT NOT CRITICAL AS THEY ARE REPLACEABLE WITH
MODERATE DIFFICULTY. ALL OTHER CONSULTANT/CONTRACTORS WOULD BE MORE READILY REPLACEABLE. WHILE THE COMPANY S CURRENT OPERATIONS
CAUSE IT TO BE UNLIKELY THAT WE WILL NEED TO GROW AND HIRE ADDITIONAL CONSULTANTS, CONTRACTORS OR EMPLOYEES, IF FUTURE PRECLINICAL
STUDIES OF OUR NANOVIRICIDE DRUGS AND TECHNOLOGY SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICACY OVER EXISTING DRUGS, WE INTEND TO EXPAND
OUR OPERATIONS AND STAFF MATERIALLY. AT THAT TIME OUR NEW EMPLOYEES MAY INCLUDE A NUMBER OF KEY MANAGERIAL, TECHNICAL, FINANCIAL,
R D AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHO WILL NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS. WE WOULD EXPECT THE EXPANSION OF
OUR BUSINESS TO PLACE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR LIMITED MANAGERIAL, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
IN INTEGRATING MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. THEREFORE, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE NEW EMPLOYEES INTO
OUR OPERATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE LICENSE OUR CORE TECHNOLOGY FROM
THERACOUR PHARMA INC. AND WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THEM AS THEY HAVE EXCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. IF WE LOSE THE RIGHT TO UTILIZE
ANY OF THE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS AND COSTS IN
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES . 

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO A MATERIAL
LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THERACOUR PHARMA, INC. THERACOUR (AN APPROXIMATELY 23.24 SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY S
COMMON STOCK) WHEREBY THERACOUR HAS EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO DEVELOP EXCLUSIVELY FOR US, THE MATERIALS THAT COMPRISE THE CORE DRUGS
OF OUR PLANNED BUSINESS. THERACOUR IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND NEEDS THE COMPANY S
PROGRESS PAYMENTS TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NANOVIRICIDES. THE COMPANY CONTROLS THE RESEARCH AND WORK THERACOUR PERFORMS
ON ITS BEHALF AND NO COSTS MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY. 

DEVELOPMENT COSTS CHARGED BY AND PAID TO
THERACOUR PHARMA, INC. WERE 8,605,050 SINCE INCEPTION THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014. NO ROYALTIES ARE DUE TO THERACOUR FROM THE COMPANY S
INCEPTION THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014. 

WE DEPEND ON THERACOUR AND OTHER THIRD
PARTIES TO PERFORM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES EFFECTIVELY AND ON A TIMELY BASIS. IF THESE THIRD PARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS REQUIRED,
THIS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR CAUSE DELAYS IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS AND APPLICATIONS
FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL, AND THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMMENCE REVENUE
GENERATING OPERATIONS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND REGULATORS MAY SHUT DOWN
MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THAT THEY BELIEVE DO NOT COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS. WE AND OUR MANUFACTURERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FDA S
CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES, WHICH ARE EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS GOVERNING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, STABILITY TESTING, RECORD-KEEPING
AND QUALITY STANDARDS AND SIMILAR REGULATIONS ARE IN EFFECT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT
TO ROUTINE INSPECTIONS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. 

73 

OUR COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH
THIRD PARTIES COULD CAUSE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND INCUR SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS RISK WITH NO ASSURANCE OF FINANCIAL
RETURN. 

WE ANTICIPATE SUBSTANTIAL RELIANCE UPON
STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS FOR MARKETING AND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES AND WE MAY RELY EVEN MORE ON STRATEGIC
COLLABORATIONS FOR R D OF OUR OTHER DRUG CANDIDATES. OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SELL DRUGS TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
AND TO THE GENERAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET. OFFERING OUR DRUG CANDIDATES FOR NON-MEDICAL APPLICATIONS TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DOES
NOT REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP NEW SALES, MARKETING OR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY EXISTING IN THE COMPANY. SELLING
ANTIVIRAL DRUGS, HOWEVER, DOES REQUIRE SUCH DEVELOPMENT. WE PLAN TO SELL ANTIVIRAL DRUGS THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH OR MANAGE SUCH STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE, OUR REVENUE
AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT MAY BE LIMITED. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES CAPABLE
OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT YET MARKETED OR SOLD ANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES OR ENTERED INTO SUCCESSFUL
COLLABORATIONS FOR THESE SERVICES IN ORDER TO ULTIMATELY COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

IF WE DETERMINE TO ENTER INTO R D COLLABORATIONS
DURING THE EARLY PHASES OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT, OUR SUCCESS WILL IN PART DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR RESEARCH COLLABORATORS.
WE WILL NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL THE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF RESOURCES DEVOTED BY OUR RESEARCH COLLABORATORS TO ACTIVITIES RELATED TO OUR
DRUG CANDIDATES. OUR RESEARCH COLLABORATORS MAY NOT COMMIT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO OUR PROGRAMS. IF ANY RESEARCH COLLABORATOR FAILS
TO COMMIT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, OUR PRECLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS RELATED TO THIS COLLABORATION COULD BE DELAYED
OR TERMINATED. ALSO, OUR COLLABORATORS MAY PURSUE EXISTING OR OTHER DEVELOPMENT-STAGE PRODUCTS OR ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN PREFERENCE
TO THOSE BEING DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH US. FINALLY, IF WE FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED MILESTONE OR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO OUR COLLABORATORS
OR TO OBSERVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS IN OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THEM, OUR COLLABORATORS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THOSE AGREEMENTS. 

MANUFACTURERS PRODUCING OUR DRUG CANDIDATES
MUST FOLLOW CURRENT GMP REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY THE FDA AND FOREIGN EQUIVALENTS. IF A MANUFACTURER OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES DOES
NOT CONFORM TO THE CURRENT GMP REGULATIONS AND CANNOT BE BROUGHT UP TO SUCH A STANDARD, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE
MANUFACTURERS THAT DO CONFORM. THIS MAY BE A LONG AND DIFFICULT PROCESS, AND MAY DELAY OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE FDA OR FOREIGN REGULATORY
APPROVAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES AND CAUSE US TO FALL BEHIND ON OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. 

ESTABLISHING STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS IS
DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING. OUR DISCUSSION WITH POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS MAY NOT LEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLABORATIONS ON
FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS MAY REJECT COLLABORATIONS BASED UPON THEIR ASSESSMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL, REGULATORY
OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITION. EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISH NEW COLLABORATIONS, THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY NEVER RESULT IN
THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES OR THE GENERATION OF SALES REVENUE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE
ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR DRUG REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE LOWER THAN IF WE DIRECTLY MARKETED AND SOLD ANY DRUGS
THAT WE MAY DEVELOP. 

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR
COLLABORATORS WILL REQUIRE: 

SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EFFORT FROM OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM; 

COORDINATION OF OUR MARKETING AND R D PROGRAMS WITH THE MARKETING AND R D PRIORITIES OF
OUR COLLABORATORS; AND 

EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF OUR RESOURCES TO MULTIPLE PROJECTS. 

WE EMPLOY THE USE OF CERTAIN CHEMICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND COMPOUNDS THAT MAY BE DEEMED HAZARDOUS AND WE ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY
TO BECOME PROFITABLE. 

WE USE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, INCLUDING CHEMICALS
AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND COMPOUNDS THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY OR THE ENVIRONMENT. AS APPROPRIATE, WE SAFELY
STORE THESE MATERIALS AND WASTES RESULTING FROM THEIR USE AT OUR LABORATORY FACILITY PENDING THEIR ULTIMATE USE OR DISPOSAL. WE
CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY TO PROPERLY DISPOSE OF THESE MATERIALS AND WASTES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND
LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE USE, GENERATION, MANUFACTURE, STORAGE, HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND WASTES.
WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE. 

74 

IF WE USE BIOLOGICAL AND HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS IN A MANNER THAT CAUSES INJURY, WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES. 

OUR R D AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES
WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR SAFETY PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING AND DISPOSING
OF THESE MATERIALS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE CANNOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL
INJURY OR CONTAMINATION FROM THE USE, STORAGE, HANDLING OR DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS. WE CARRY 1,000,000 CASUALTY AND GENERAL
LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE EVENT OF CONTAMINATION OR INJURY, WE COULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR PENALIZED
WITH FINES IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING OUR RESOURCES AND INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR REGULATORY APPROVALS COULD BE
SUSPENDED. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND
RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL. 

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY
SKILLED PERSONNEL IS CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION. WE FACE COMPETITION FOR THESE TYPES OF PERSONNEL FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES AND MORE ESTABLISHED ORGANIZATIONS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER OPERATIONS AND GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL,
HUMAN AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN US. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL ON A TIMELY BASIS,
ON COMPETITIVE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THESE PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE DEPEND UPON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT
AND THEIR LOSS OR UNAVAILABILITY COULD PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. 

WE CURRENTLY DEPEND UPON THE EFFORTS AND
ABILITIES OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM. THE LOSS OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD
OF TIME COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE HAVE
NOT OBTAINED, DO NOT OWN, NOR ARE WE THE BENEFICIARY OF KEY-PERSON LIFE INSURANCE FOR ALL OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL. 

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS TWO EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS, EUGENE SEYMOUR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND ANIL DIWAN, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF BOARD,
ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY IS A LIMITED BENEFICIARY OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF KEY MAN INSURANCE FOR THESE
TWO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINS. HOWEVER THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE KEY MAN INSURANCE
COVERAGE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE REPLACEMENT OF THESE KEY OFFICERS FOR CONTINUING THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS IN A TIMELY
MANNER, SHOULD SUCH AN EVENT ARISE. 

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS A LIMITED AMOUNT
OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO PROTECT ALL OF ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TAKEN TOGETHER. THERE
CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS D O COVERAGE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ITS INVOCATION,
IN WHICH CASE, THERE COULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, SHOULD SUCH AN UNFORESEEN
EVENT OCCUR. 

ON MARCH 3, 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ITS TWO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, EUGENE
SEYMOUR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND ANIL DIWAN, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF BOARD. BOTH AGREEMENTS PROVIDE
A MINIMUM ANNUAL BASE SALARY OF 250,000 FOR A TERM OF FOUR YEARS. IN ADDITION, DR. SEYMOUR AND DR. DIWAN WERE ELIGIBLE FOR AN
INCREASE IN BASE SALARY TO 275,000 ONCE THE COMPANY CONSUMMATED A FINANCING WITH GROSS PROCEEDS OF AT LEAST 5,000,000. ALSO,
THE BASE SALARY IS ELIGIBLE TO BE INCREASED TO 300,000 FOR DR. SEYMOUR AND 300,000 FOR DR. DIWAN SINCE THE COMPANY HAS BEEN LISTED
ON A NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE. 

AS ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY ISSUED 71,429 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF THE COMPANY S SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND SHALL ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL
71,429 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK ON EACH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESPECTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. 

ON MARCH 3, 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO
AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH DR. JAYANT TATAKE TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
PROVIDES FOR A TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A BASE SALARY OF 150,000. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ISSUED 26,786 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF
SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND 35,715 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, AND WILL ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL 26,786 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES
OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND 35,715 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON EACH ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. 

ON MARCH 3, 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO
AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH DR. RANDALL BARTON TO SERVE AS CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER. THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A TERM
OF FOUR YEARS WITH A BASE SALARY OF 150,000. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ISSUED 35,715 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, AND
WILL ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL 35,715 (AS ADJUSTED) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON EACH ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. 

IN JULY 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT THESE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENTS SHALL CONTINUE IN EFFECT UNTIL NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE. 

75 

THERE ARE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AMONG
OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS. 

CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
AND THEIR AFFILIATES ARE ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES AND HAVE INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES ON THEIR OWN BEHALF OR ON BEHALF OF OTHER
PERSONS. NEITHER WE NOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL HAVE ANY RIGHTS IN THESE VENTURES OR THEIR INCOME OR PROFITS. SPECIFICALLY, ANIL
DIWAN OWNS APPROXIMATELY 70 OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THERACOUR PHARMA, INC. WHICH OWNS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-ONE AND FORTY FOUR
ONE HUNDREDTHS PERCENT (21.44 OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PROVIDES THE COMPANY THE NANOMATERIALS WITH WHICH IT INTENDS TO DEVELOP ITS
PRODUCTS AND IS THE HOLDER OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THE COMPANY USES TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY IS
NOT AWARE OF ANY CONFLICT THAT HAS ARISEN OR ANY TRANSACTION THAT HAS NOT BEEN CONDUCTED ON AN ARM S LENGTH BASIS TO DATE,
DR. DIWAN MAY HAVE CONFLICTING FIDUCIARY DUTIES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THERACOUR. 

CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY
POLICY IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH SUCH SHOULD SUCH A CONFLICT ARISE. 

 IN PARTICULAR: 

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS OR THEIR AFFILIATES MAY HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEREST IN, OR OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH,
PARTNER COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN US. 

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS OR THEIR AFFILIATES HAVE INTERESTS IN ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO US. 

IN ANY OF THESE CASES: 

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS MAY HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN OUR CURRENT INTERESTS AND THEIR
PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN ANOTHER BUSINESS VENTURE. 

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTING FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO US AND THE OTHER ENTITY. 

THE TERMS OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THE OTHER ENTITY MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARM S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS
AND THEREFORE MAY BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO US THAN THOSE THAT COULD BE PROCURED THROUGH ARM S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS. 

WE ANTICIPATE ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS
WITH VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN CONTRACTING WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL CONTRACT
REQUIREMENTS. FUTURE SALES TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN
OF WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY. 

WE MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH VARIOUS
U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHICH HAVE SPECIAL CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS THAT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY VARIOUS RIGHTS OR IMPOSE ON
THE OTHER PARTY VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS THAT CAN MAKE THE CONTRACTS LESS FAVORABLE TO THE NON- GOVERNMENT PARTY. CONSEQUENTLY, IF A
LARGE PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE CONTRACTS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SHOULD THE GOVERNMENTAL
PARTIES EXERCISE ANY OF THESE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OR IMPOSE ANY OF THESE ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS. 

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN
UNFAVORABLE TERMINATION PROVISIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND MODIFICATION BY THE GOVERNMENT AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, WHICH SUBJECTS
US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO UNILATERALLY: 

SUSPEND OR PREVENT US FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME FROM RECEIVING NEW CONTRACTS OR EXTENDING EXISTING
CONTRACTS BASED ON VIOLATIONS OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF LAWS OR REGULATIONS; 

TERMINATE OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS; 

REDUCE THE SCOPE AND VALUE OF OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS; 

AUDIT AND OBJECT TO OUR CONTRACT-RELATED COSTS AND FEES, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS; 

CONTROL AND POTENTIALLY PROHIBIT THE EXPORT OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES; AND 

CHANGE CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN OUR CONTRACTS. 

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY TERMINATE ANY OF
ITS CONTRACTS WITH US EITHER FOR ITS CONVENIENCE OR IF WE DEFAULT BY FAILING TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT SCHEDULE
AND TERMS. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE PROVISIONS GENERALLY ENABLE US TO RECOVER ONLY OUR COSTS INCURRED OR COMMITTED, AND SETTLEMENT
EXPENSES AND PROFIT ON THE WORK COMPLETED PRIOR TO TERMINATION. TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT PROVISIONS DO NOT PERMIT THESE RECOVERIES
AND MAKE US LIABLE FOR EXCESS COSTS INCURRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN PROCURING UNDELIVERED ITEMS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE. 

AS A U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR, WE MAY
BECOME SUBJECT TO PERIODIC AUDITS AND REVIEWS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE AUDITS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY ADJUST OUR CONTRACT-RELATED
COSTS AND FEES, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS. AS PART OF ANY SUCH AUDIT OR REVIEW, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY REVIEW THE ADEQUACY
OF, AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO OUR PURCHASING, PROPERTY, COMPENSATION
AND/OR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, IF AN AUDIT OR REVIEW UNCOVERS ANY IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, WE MAY BE
SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF OUR CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS,
SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, FINES AND SUSPENSION OR PROHIBITION FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE COULD ALSO SUFFER
SERIOUS HARM TO OUR REPUTATION IF ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETY WERE MADE AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT PURCHASING
REGULATIONS, SOME OF OUR COSTS, INCLUDING MOST FINANCING COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PORTIONS OF OUR R D COSTS
AND SOME MARKETING EXPENSES, MAY NOT BE REIMBURSABLE OR ALLOWED UNDER OUR CONTRACTS. FURTHER, AS A U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR,
WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF INVESTIGATIONS, CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, CIVIL FRAUD, WHISTLEBLOWER LAWSUITS AND OTHER
LEGAL ACTIONS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH PURELY PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES ARE NOT. 

76 

WE MAY FAIL TO OBTAIN CONTRACTS TO
SUPPLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN COMMITMENTS
TO HELP SECURE IMPROVED COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST BIO-TERRORISM. THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IS LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN,
AND WE MUST COMPETE FOR EACH CONTRACT. MOREOVER, THE AWARD OF ONE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SECURE THE AWARD OF
FUTURE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME DRUG. IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAKES SIGNIFICANT FUTURE CONTRACT AWARDS FOR THE SUPPLY OF ITS
EMERGENCY STOCKPILE TO OUR COMPETITORS, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY COMMERCIALIZE
OUR COMPETITIVE DRUG CANDIDATE. 

IN ADDITION, THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN
AND WHETHER A DRUG IS READY FOR LARGE SCALE PURCHASE AND POTENTIAL USE WILL BE MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH
A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FDA, THE NIH, THE CDC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED
MEASURES TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIO-DEFENSE DRUGS THROUGH NIH FUNDING, THE REVIEW PROCESS BY THE FDA AND THE FINAL GOVERNMENT
PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING AUTHORITY. WHILE THIS MAY HELP SPEED THE APPROVAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES, IT MAY ALSO ENCOURAGE COMPETITORS
TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN DRUG CANDIDATES. 

THE MARKET FOR GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING OF
H5N1 MEDICINES AND OTHER ANTIVIRAL DRUGS IN THE STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE IS FAIRLY NEW AND UNCERTAIN. 

AT THE PRESENT MANY GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY
STOCKPILED INFLUENZA MEDICINES FOR H5N1. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE SIZE OF THE MARKET, IF ANY FOR ALL OF THE ANTIVIRAL
DRUGS THAT THE GOVERNMENTS MAY WANT TO STOCKPILE. CONSEQUENTLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER SALES, IF ANY, TO GOVERNMENTS WILL BE
SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND COMMENCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPERATIONS. 

IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FAILS TO CONTINUE
FUNDING BIO-DEFENSE DRUG CANDIDATE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR FAILS TO PURCHASE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ANY FUTURE BIO-DEFENSE DRUG
CANDIDATE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. 

WE HOPE TO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BIO-DEFENSE DRUG CANDIDATES. CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT BUDGETS AND AGENDAS, HOWEVER, MAY RESULT
IN FUTURE FUNDING BEING DECREASED AND DE-PRIORITIZED, AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT PERMIT CANCELLATION
IN THE EVENT THAT FUNDS ARE UNAVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THE TIMING OF ANY FUTURE
FUNDING, AND SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF FUNDING COULD RESULT FROM PROTESTS OR CHALLENGES FROM THIRD PARTIES. IF THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT FAILS TO CONTINUE TO ADEQUATELY FUND R D PROGRAMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO CONTINUE
OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, IF WE DEVELOP A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT IS APPROVED BY THE FDA, BUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PLACE SUFFICIENT
ORDERS FOR THIS DRUG, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. 

RISKS RELATED TO THE BIOTECHNOLOGY/BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY 

THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND A HIGH DEGREE OF COMPETITION. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE
WITH ENTERPRISES EQUIPPED WITH MORE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES THAN US. 

THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND A HIGH DEGREE OF COMPETITION BASED PRIMARILY ON SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE AVAILABILITY OF PATENT AND OTHER PROTECTION FOR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS, THE
ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR TESTING, MANUFACTURING AND
MARKETING. 

OUR ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUG IN DEVELOPMENT,
FLUCIDE, WOULD COMPETE WITH NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS TAMIFLU AND RELENZA, ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUGS THAT ARE SOLD BY ROCHE AND GLAXO
SMITHKLINE (GSK), RESPECTIVELY. GENERIC COMPETITORS INCLUDE AMANTADINE AND RIMANTADINE, BOTH ORAL TABLETS THAT ONLY INHIBIT THE
REPLICATION OF THE INFLUENZA A VIRUS. BIOCRYST PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. IS DEVELOPING IV INFUSIONS FORMULATIONS OF PERAMIVIR, AN INFLUENZA
NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITOR, FOR THE TREATMENT OF INFLUENZA. PERAMIVIR IS APPROVED IN JAPAN AND HAD OBTAINED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION
IN THE US. SEVERAL H5N1 BIRD FLU, AND INFLUENZA NOVELH1N1/2009 VACCINES ARE ALSO IN DEVELOPMENT WORLDWIDE. SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE
DEVELOPING ANTI-INFLUENZA DRUGS AND VACCINES. 

WE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED PRELIMINARY
ANIMAL STUDIES AGAINST HIV THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THE FINDING THAT CERTAIN OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES WERE SUPERIOR TO THE ORAL HAART
COCKTAIL IN SCID-HU THY/LIV HUMANIZED MICE LETHALLY INFECTED WITH HIV-I. WE THUS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A VERY STRONG LEAD DRUG IDENTIFIED
AGAINST HIV. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES WITH ANTI-HIV DRUGS IN THE MARKET. A NEW DRUG, MARAVIROC FROM PFIZER HAS RECENTLY BEEN
APPROVED, WHICH FALLS IN A NEW CLASS CALLED CCR5-BLOCKERS. PRIOR TO THIS, TWO NEW DRUGS IN A NEW CLASS CALLED INTEGRASE INHIBITORS
HAVE BEEN APPROVED. A DRUG IN THE CLASS CALLED ENTRY FUSION INHIBITORS, ENFUVIRTIDE, (FUZEONTM, ROCHE) HAS ALSO BEEN AVAILABLE.
ADDITIONALLY, THE CLASSICAL DRUGS, NRTI S, NNRTI S AND PI S (PROTEASE INHIBITORS) ARE USED IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS.
A THREE DRUG COMBO HAS BEEN APPROVED. A FOUR-DRUG COMBO IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROVED SOON. THE HIVCIDE-I NANOVIRICIDE IS EXPECTED
TO ACT BY A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF MECHANISM, DEFINING A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS, THAT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE EXISTING CLASSES OF ANTI-HIV
DRUGS. 

77 

OUR NANOVIRICIDE EYE DROPS FOR VIRAL DISEASES
OF THE EYE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL EFFICACY IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF EKC (ADENOVIRAL EPIDEMIC
KERATO-CONJUNCTIVITIS). WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN VERY STRONG IN VITRO EFFICACY IN HSV-1 REDUCTION IN CELL CULTURES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS
DRUG HAS A VERY GOOD EFFICACY AND SAFETY PROFILE, BASED ON CURRENT DATA. THERE ARE NO APPROVED DRUGS AGAINST ALL VIRAL DISEASES
OF THE EYE, OR ADENOVIRAL EKC IN PARTICULAR. SEVERAL DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF HERPES KERATITIS. IDOXURIDINE, VIDARABINE,
ACYCLOVIR AND ITS DERIVATIVES, ARE AMONG THE LEADING ONES. AGANOCIDE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NANOVIRICIDE EYE
DROPS SHOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF REDUCED FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION NEEDED AND SIMPLE APPLICATION PROCEDURE. 

OUR HCV DRUGS ARE AT THE EARLIEST STAGE
OF DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE A GROWING NUMBER OF ANTI-HCV DRUGS BEING SOLD OR IN ADVANCED STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. TWO NEW
PROTEASE INHIBITORS HAVE BEEN APPROVED. COMPANIES WITH ANTI-HIV AND HCV PRODUCTS INCLUDE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY (BMS), ROCHE,
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM, MERCK CO., INC. (MERCK), ABBOTT LABORATORIES, AND SCHERING PLOUGH, IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL
AND BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRMS. 

WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALIZED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AS WELL AS A GROWING NUMBER OF LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE APPLYING
BIOTECHNOLOGY TO THEIR OPERATIONS. MANY BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE FOCUSED THEIR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN THE HUMAN THERAPEUTICS
AREA, INCLUDING CANCER. MANY MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED INTERNAL BIOTECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES OR MADE
COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
AND PRIVATE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, ALSO COMPETE WITH US IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGHLY QUALIFIED SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL AND
CONSULTANTS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL FIELD WILL ALSO DEPEND TO A CONSIDERABLE
DEGREE ON THE CONTINUING AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL TO US. 

WE ARE AWARE OF NUMEROUS PRODUCTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT OR MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS THAT ARE USED FOR THE PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES WE HAVE TARGETED FOR
DRUG DEVELOPMENT. VARIOUS COMPANIES ARE DEVELOPING BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS THAT POTENTIALLY DIRECTLY COMPETE WITH OUR DRUG CANDIDATES
EVEN THOUGH THEIR APPROACH TO SUCH TREATMENT IS DIFFERENT. 

WE EXPECT THAT OUR DRUG CANDIDATES UNDER
DEVELOPMENT AND IN CLINICAL TRIALS WILL ADDRESS MAJOR MARKETS WITHIN THE ANTI-VIRAL SECTOR. OUR COMPETITION WILL BE DETERMINED
IN PART BY THE POTENTIAL INDICATIONS FOR WHICH DRUGS ARE DEVELOPED AND ULTIMATELY APPROVED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. ADDITIONALLY,
THE TIMING OF THE MARKET INTRODUCTION OF SOME OF OUR POTENTIAL DRUGS OR OF COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE
FACTOR. ACCORDINGLY, THE RELATIVE SPEED WITH WHICH WE CAN DEVELOP DRUGS, COMPLETE PRE-CLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS, APPROVAL
PROCESSES AND SUPPLY COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES TO MARKET ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS. WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION AMONG DRUGS
APPROVED FOR SALE WILL BE BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCT EFFICACY, SAFETY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, PRICE AND PATENT
PROTECTION. 

THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF BIOPHARMACEUTICALS
IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, PRE-CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS OR REGULATORY APPROVALS, COULD CAUSE US TO ABANDON
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. 

SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF BIOPHARMACEUTICALS
IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND IS DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR PROMISING
IN THE EARLY PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT MAY FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING: 

PRE-CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS THAT MAY SHOW THE PRODUCT TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN DESIRED (E.G., THE
STUDY FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMARY OBJECTIVES) OR TO HAVE HARMFUL OR PROBLEMATIC SIDE EFFECTS; 

FAILURE TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS OR A DELAY IN RECEIVING SUCH APPROVALS. AMONG
OTHER THINGS, SUCH DELAYS MAY BE CAUSED BY SLOW ENROLLMENT IN CLINICAL STUDIES, LENGTH OF TIME TO ACHIEVE STUDY ENDPOINTS, ADDITIONAL
TIME REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA ANALYSIS OR A IND AND LATER NDA, PREPARATION, DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FDA, AN FDA REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL
PRE-CLINICAL OR CLINICAL DATA OR UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR MANUFACTURING ISSUES; 

MANUFACTURING COSTS, PRICING OR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES, OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MAKE THE PRODUCT NOT
ECONOMICAL; AND 

THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND THEIR COMPETING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY PREVENT
THE PRODUCT FROM BEING COMMERCIALIZED. 

SUCCESS IN PRE-CLINICAL AND EARLY CLINICAL
STUDIES DOES NOT ENSURE THAT LARGE-SCALE CLINICAL STUDIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. CLINICAL RESULTS ARE FREQUENTLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING
INTERPRETATIONS THAT MAY DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY TO COMPLETE CLINICAL STUDIES
AND TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION FOR MARKETING APPROVAL FOR A FINAL DECISION BY A REGULATORY AUTHORITY VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE
PRODUCT TO THE NEXT, AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. 

78 

RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKETS
AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMON STOCK 

IF WE DO NOT MEET THE CONTINUED LISTING
STANDARDS OF THE NYSE MKT OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE DELISTED FROM TRADING, WHICH COULD LIMIT INVESTORS ABILITY TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS
IN OUR COMMON STOCK AND SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS. 

AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2013, OUR COMMON STOCK
IS LISTED ON THE NYSE MKT, A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE, WHICH IMPOSES CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LISTED
SHARES. IF, HOWEVER, WE FAIL TO SATISFY THE CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS, SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE REQUIREMENT THAT OUR SHARES
NOT TRADE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME AT A LOW PRICE PER SHARE OR THAT WE NOT DISPOSE OF OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING
ASSETS OR DISCONTINUE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, THE NYSE MKT MAY ISSUE ANOTHER NON-COMPLIANCE
LETTER OR INITIATE DELISTING PROCEEDINGS. 

IF OUR SECURITIES ARE DELISTED FROM TRADING
ON THE NYSE MKT AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO LIST OUR SECURITIES ON ANOTHER EXCHANGE OR TO HAVE THEM QUOTED ON NASDAQ, OUR SECURITIES
COULD BE QUOTED ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD OR ON THE PINK SHEETS. AS A RESULT, WE COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES
INCLUDING: 

A LIMITED AVAILABILITY
OF MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR OUR SECURITIES; 

A DETERMINATION THAT OUR COMMON STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK WHICH WILL REQUIRE BROKERS TRADING IN OUR COMMON STOCK TO ADHERE TO MORE STRINGENT RULES AND POSSIBLY RESULT IN A REDUCED LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SECONDARY TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES; 

A LIMITED AMOUNT OF NEWS AND ANALYST COVERAGE FOR US; AND 

A DECREASED ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES (INCLUDING PURSUANT TO SHORT-FORM REGISTRATION STATEMENTS ON FORM S-3 OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE). 

OUR COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE PERIODIC
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE EXCHANGE ACT ), WHICH WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR
AUDIT FEES AND LEGAL FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF SUCH REPORTS. THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS WILL REDUCE OR MIGHT ELIMINATE
OUR PROFITABILITY. 

OUR COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE PERIODIC
REPORTS WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. TO COMPLY WITH THESE
REQUIREMENTS, OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED AUDITORS WILL HAVE TO REVIEW OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDIT OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. MOREOVER, OUR LEGAL COUNSEL WILL HAVE TO REVIEW AND ASSIST IN THE PREPARATION OF SUCH REPORTS. THE COSTS CHARGED BY
THESE PROFESSIONALS FOR SUCH SERVICES CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER AND TYPE
OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE ENGAGE IN AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR REPORTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME AND WILL HAVE A MAJOR AFFECT
ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE SPENT BY OUR AUDITORS AND ATTORNEYS. HOWEVER, THE INCURRENCE OF SUCH COSTS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE AN EXPENSE
TO OUR OPERATIONS AND THUS HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OVERHEAD REQUIREMENTS AND EARN A PROFIT. WE MAY BE
EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS RESULTING FROM NEW REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. IF WE CANNOT PROVIDE
RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS OR PREVENT FRAUD, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED, INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE
IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF A MARKET EVER DEVELOPS, COULD DROP SIGNIFICANTLY,
OR WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS. 

AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 404
OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, WE ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE COMPANY CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. BASED ON ITS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
WERE NOT EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED
AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED BY THE RULES AND FORMS OF THE COMMISSION. THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS RELATES TO A LACK
OF A FUNCTIONING AUDIT COMMITTEE AND A LACK OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS ON THE COMPANY S BOARD. THE REPORT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 2012 INDICATED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS NOT
EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S TIME AS A RESULT
OF PERFORMING THE SYSTEM AND PROCESS EVALUATION, TESTING, AND REMEDIATION REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION
AND AUDITOR ATTESTATION REQUIREMENTS. 

IF WE CONTINUE TO FAIL TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN
THE ADEQUACY OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, AS SUCH STANDARDS ARE MODIFIED, SUPPLEMENTED, OR AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONCLUDE ON AN ONGOING BASIS THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE
WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. MOREOVER, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION,
ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO PRODUCE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ARE IMPORTANT TO HELP PREVENT FINANCIAL FRAUD. IF WE CANNOT PROVIDE
RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS OR PREVENT FRAUD, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS WOULD BE HARMED, INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE
IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF A MARKET EVER DEVELOPS, COULD DROP SIGNIFICANTLY,
OR WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO THE COMMISSION S ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS. 

79 

OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK 
AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SELL. 

THE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS
WHICH GENERALLY DEFINE PENNY STOCK TO BE AN EQUITY SECURITY THAT HAS A MARKET PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE
OR AN EXERCISE PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
HAS FLUCTUATED GREATLY. IF, THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK IS LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE IT THEREFORE MAY BE DESIGNATED AS
A PENNY STOCK ACCORDING TO COMMISSION RULES. THE PENNY STOCK RULES IMPOSE ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE
REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS WHO SELL SECURITIES TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS AND ACCREDITED INVESTORS (GENERALLY
THOSE WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF 1,000,000 OR ANNUAL INCOME EXCEEDING 200,000 OR 300,000 TOGETHER WITH THEIR SPOUSE). FOR TRANSACTIONS
COVERED BY THESE RULES, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL SUITABILITY DETERMINATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF SECURITIES AND HAVE
RECEIVED THE PURCHASER S WRITTEN CONSENT TO THE TRANSACTION BEFORE THE PURCHASE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR ANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING A
PENNY STOCK, UNLESS EXEMPT, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST DELIVER, BEFORE THE TRANSACTION, A DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSION
RELATING TO THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. THE BROKER-DEALER ALSO MUST DISCLOSE THE COMMISSIONS PAYABLE TO BOTH THE BROKER-DEALER AND
THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE AND CURRENT QUOTATIONS FOR THE SECURITIES. FINALLY, MONTHLY STATEMENTS MUST BE SENT DISCLOSING RECENT
PRICE INFORMATION ON THE LIMITED MARKET IN PENNY STOCKS. THESE ADDITIONAL BURDENS IMPOSED ON BROKER-DEALERS MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY
OR DECREASE THE WILLINGNESS OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR COMMON SHARES, AND MAY RESULT IN DECREASED LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMON SHARES
AND INCREASED TRANSACTION COSTS FOR SALES AND PURCHASES OF OUR COMMON SHARES AS COMPARED TO OTHER SECURITIES. 

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND
YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK COULD SUFFER A DECLINE IN VALUE. 

THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS QUOTED
ON THE NYSE MKT MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS
INCLUDE: 

PROGRESS OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS; 

RESULTS OF PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTION AFFECTING OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS IN BOTH THE UNITED
STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES; 

DEVELOPMENTS OR DISPUTES CONCERNING PATENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; 

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS FOR EMERGING GROWTH AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES; 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD; 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS; 

BROAD MARKET FLUCTUATIONS; AND 

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS. 

THERE IS A RISK OF MARKET FRAUD. 

SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ACCORDING
TO SEC RELEASE NO. 34-29093, THE MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS FROM PATTERNS OF FRAUD AND ABUSE. SUCH PATTERNS
INCLUDE (1) CONTROL OF THE MARKET FOR THE SECURITY BY ONE OR A FEW BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE OFTEN RELATED TO THE PROMOTER OR ISSUER;
(2) MANIPULATION OF PRICES THROUGH PREARRANGED MATCHING OF PURCHASES AND SALES AND FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES; (3) BOILER
ROOM PRACTICES INVOLVING HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND UNREALISTIC PRICE PROJECTIONS BY INEXPERIENCED SALES PERSONS; (4) EXCESSIVE
AND UNDISCLOSED BID-ASK DIFFERENTIAL AND MARKUPS BY SELLING BROKER-DEALERS; AND (5) THE WHOLESALE DUMPING OF THE SAME SECURITIES
BY PROMOTERS AND BROKER-DEALERS AFTER PRICES HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED TO A DESIRED LEVEL, ALONG WITH THE RESULTING INEVITABLE COLLAPSE
OF THOSE PRICES AND WITH CONSEQUENT INVESTOR LOSSES. WE ARE AWARE OF THE ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HISTORICALLY IN THE PENNY STOCK
MARKET. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION TO DICTATE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MARKET OR OF BROKER-DEALERS WHO PARTICIPATE
IN THE MARKET, MANAGEMENT WILL STRIVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS TO PREVENT THE DESCRIBED PATTERNS FROM BEING
ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO OUR SECURITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE PATTERNS OR PRACTICES COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR
SHARE PRICE. 

AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2013, OUR COMMON STOCK
IS LISTED ON THE NYSE MKT NATIONAL EXCHANGE. HOWEVER, SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PATTERNS
AND PRACTICES CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PRECLUDED AND THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE PATTERNS OR PRACTICES COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY
OF OUR SHARE PRICE. 

A REGISTRATION OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF OUR OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK. 

AT JUNE 30, 2014, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY
HAD 15,497,951 SHARES (AS ADJUSTED) OF RESTRICTED STOCK, OR 33 OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. IF WE WERE TO FILE A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT INCLUDING ALL OF THESE SHARES, AND THE REGISTRATION IS ALLOWED BY THE SEC, THESE SHARES WOULD BE FREELY TRADABLE UPON
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLANNED REGISTRATION STATEMENT. IF INVESTORS HOLDING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FREELY TRADABLE SHARES DECIDE
TO SELL THEM IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT, SUCH SALES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO
SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. 

80 

WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY CASH
DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND, THEREFORE, ANY RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR CAPITAL STOCK MUST COME FROM INCREASES
IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AND TRADING PRICE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK. 

WE HAVE NOT PAID ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON
OUR COMMON STOCK AND DO NOT INTEND TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE INTEND TO RETAIN FUTURE
EARNINGS, IF ANY, FOR REINVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS. ANY CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WHICH WE MAY ENTER
INTO WITH INSTITUTIONAL LENDERS, MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. WHETHER WE PAY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE
AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITAL
REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECIDES IS RELEVANT. THEREFORE, ANY RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT IN
OUR CAPITAL STOCK MUST COME FROM INCREASES IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AND TRADING PRICE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK. 

WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY SHARES
TO FUND THE COMPANY S OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD DILUTE SHARE OWNERSHIP. 

THE COMPANY S CONTINUED VIABILITY DEPENDS
ON ITS ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL. CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, REGULATORY OR COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO COST INCREASES. MANAGEMENT
MAY ALSO DETERMINE THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES OR PRODUCTS. IN ANY SUCH CASE ADDITIONAL
FINANCING IS REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANY TO MEET ITS OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE
ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY AND AT TIMES REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL. IN SUCH EVENT,
THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO MATERIALLY ALTER ITS BUSINESS PLAN OR CURTAIL ALL OR A PART OF ITS OPERATIONAL PLANS AS DETAILED
FURTHER IN MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS IN THIS FORM 10-K. WHILE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO OFFERS TO SELL ITS
SECURITIES TO OBTAIN FINANCING, SALE OR THE PROPOSED SALE OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS MAY
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY
IS UNABLE TO RAISE OR BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO CURTAIL SIGNIFICANTLY ITS OPERATIONAL PLANS AS FURTHER
DETAILED IN REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THIS FORM 10-K. 

THE COMPANY IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE UP
TO 85,714,286 TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON A POST-SPLIT BASIS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS. AS OF JUNE 30,
2014, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 54,620,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING, WARRANTS AND OPTIONS CONVERTIBLE TO 9,422,926
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND 3,193,079 SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK CONVERTIBLE INTO 11,175,776 SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK. 

AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2013, OUR COMMON STOCK
IS LISTED ON THE NYSE MKT NATIONAL EXCHANGE. 

LARGE AMOUNTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK
WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE UNDER RULE 144. 

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, 15,131,405 OF 53,782,057
ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES (AS ADJUSTED) OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK WERE RESTRICTED SECURITIES AS DEFINED UNDER RULE
144 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ACT AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE RESOLD WITHOUT REGISTRATION
PURSUANT TO RULE 144. 

APPROXIMATELY 2,406,207 SHARES OF OUR RESTRICTED
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (AS ADJUSTED) ARE HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES WHO MAY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
AND SELL THEIR SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144. AS A RESULT, SOME OR ALL OF THESE SHARES MAY BE SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE
144 POTENTIALLY CAUSING THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY S SHARES TO DECLINE. 

IN GENERAL, UNDER RULE 144, A PERSON (OR
PERSONS WHOSE SHARES ARE AGGREGATED) WHO HAS SATISFIED A SIX MONTH HOLDING PERIOD MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SELL WITHIN
ANY THREE-MONTH PERIOD A NUMBER OF SECURITIES WHICH DOES NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF 1 OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK OR THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING VOLUME OF THE CLASS DURING THE FOUR CALENDAR WEEKS PRIOR TO SUCH SALE. RULE 144 ALSO PERMITS,
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE SALE OF SECURITIES, WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION, BY A PERSON WHO IS NOT AN AFFILIATE, AS SUCH TERM
IS DEFINED IN RULE 144(A)(1), OF THE COMPANY AND WHO HAS SATISFIED A ONE-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD. ANY SUBSTANTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY S
COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO RULE 144 MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY S SHARES. THIS FILING WILL
SATISFY CERTAIN PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR SUCH SHARES TO BE SOLD UNDER RULE 144.

THE REQUIREMENTS OF COMPLYING WITH
THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT MAY STRAIN OUR RESOURCES AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT ), AND THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. THE COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES. THE EXCHANGE ACT REQUIRES THAT WE FILE ANNUAL,
QUARTERLY AND CURRENT REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN
EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. HISTORICALLY, AS A PRIVATE COMPANY
WE HAVE MAINTAINED A SMALL ACCOUNTING STAFF, BUT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT WILL BE
REQUIRED. THIS INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RETAINING INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS. THIS EFFORT MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S
ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NEED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL PERSONS WITH APPROPRIATE PUBLIC
COMPANY EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING KNOWLEDGE, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN A TIMELY FASHION. 

SALES OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND YOUR RIGHTS IN THE COMPANY MAY BE REDUCED. 

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT
AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND IN ORDER TO SATISFY OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO SELL ADDITIONAL
EQUITY SECURITIES. OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION AND A REDUCTION IN THE PRICE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN
UPON SALE OF THEIR SHARES. ALSO, ANY NEW SECURITIES ISSUED MAY HAVE GREATER RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES THAN OUR EXISTING
COMMON STOCK THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

BEFORE
 DECIDING TO INVEST IN J2 GLOBAL OR TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE YOUR INVESTMENT,
 YOU
 SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AND RISKS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE, AND THE OTHER INFORMATION
 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH
 THE
 SEC, INCLUDING OUR SUBSEQUENT REPORTS ON FORMS 10-Q AND 8-K. THE RISKS AND
 UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS
 AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL
 ALSO MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR
 UNCERTAINTIES ACTUALLY OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN
 THAT
 EVENT, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL LIKELY DECLINE AND YOU MAY
 LOSE
 PART OR ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

IN
 ORDER TO SUSTAIN OUR GROWTH, WE MUST CONTINUE TO ATTRACT NEW PAID SUBSCRIBERS
 AT
 A GREATER RATE AND WITH AT LEAST AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF REVENUES PER SUBSCRIBER
 THAN
 WE LOSE EXISTING PAID SUBSCRIBERS. 

WE
 MAY
 NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW OR EVEN SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT BASE OF PAID
 CUSTOMERS ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS HEAVILY
 ON
 THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR PAID USER BASE. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OUR GROWTH
 WE
 MUST CONTINUOUSLY OBTAIN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PAID USERS TO REPLACE THE
 USERS
 WHO CANCEL THEIR SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THESE NEW USERS MUST PROVIDE REVENUE
 LEVELS PER SUBSCRIBER THAT ARE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE LEVELS OF OUR
 CURRENT CUSTOMERS OR THE CUSTOMERS THEY ARE REPLACING. WE MUST ALSO RETAIN
 OUR
 EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING TO ATTRACT NEW ONES AT DESIRABLE COSTS.
 WE
 CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR CONTINUOUS EFFORTS TO OFFER HIGH QUALITY SERVICES
 AT
 ATTRACTIVE PRICES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO RETAIN OUR CUSTOMER BASE OR ATTRACT
 NEW
 CUSTOMERS AT RATES SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET CUSTOMERS WHO CANCEL THEIR SERVICE.
 IN
 ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES PROVIDING SIMILAR OR
 ALTERNATIVE SERVICES HAS CAUSED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO CAUSE, SOME OF OUR
 CUSTOMERS OR PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS TO SIGN UP WITH OR TO SWITCH TO OUR
 COMPETITORS SERVICES. THESE FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMER RETENTION
 RATES, THE NUMBER OF OUR NEW CUSTOMER ACQUISITIONS AND/OR THEIR USAGE LEVELS.
 ANY COMBINATION OF A DECLINE IN OUR RATE OF NEW CUSTOMER SIGN-UPS, DECLINE
 IN
 USAGE RATES OF OUR CUSTOMERS, DECLINE IN CUSTOMER RETENTION RATES OR DECLINE
 IN
 THE SIZE OF OUR OVERALL CUSTOMER BASE MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR REVENUES,
 WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

WEAKNESS
 IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IN THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED
 AND MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH HAS
 RESULTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN DECREASED USAGE LEVELS, CUSTOMER
 ACQUISITIONS AND CUSTOMER RETENTION RATES AND, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE
 IN OUR REVENUES OR RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH. 

CERTAIN
 SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS - THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS TIED TO THE HEALTH
 OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE BROADER ECONOMY, SUCH AS BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS
 AND THOSE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY - HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE
 ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND WEAKNESS
 IN
 THE BROADER MORTGAGE MARKET AND THE GENERAL ECONOMY. TO THE EXTENT OUR
 CUSTOMERS BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE ECONOMIC FACTORS AND
 THEIR USAGE LEVELS OF OUR SERVICES DECLINE, WE HAVE AND MAY CONTINUE TO
 EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN OUR AVERAGE USAGE PER SUBSCRIBER AND, THEREFORE, A
 DECREASE IN OUR AVERAGE VARIABLE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER. IN ADDITION,
 CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE ECONOMY HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMER RETENTION RATES AND THE NUMBER OF OUR NEW CUSTOMER
 ACQUISITIONS. THESE FACTORS HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO
 ADVERSELY IMPACT, OUR REVENUES AND RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH. 

OUR
 FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED TAX RATES
 OR
 EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. 

WE
 ARE A
 U.S.-BASED MULTINATIONAL COMPANY SUBJECT TO TAX IN MULTIPLE U.S. AND FOREIGN
 TAX
 JURISDICTIONS. OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON JURISDICTIONAL
 MIX OF
 EARNINGS, STATUTORY RATES AND ENACTED TAX RULES, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING.
 SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME
 TAXES
 AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. IT IS POSSIBLE
 THAT
 THESE POSITIONS MAY BE CHALLENGED OR WE MAY FIND TAX-BENEFICIAL INTERCOMPANY
 TRANSACTIONS TO BE UNECONOMICAL, EITHER OF WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT
 ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. 

A
 NUMBER
 OF FACTORS AFFECT OUR INCOME TAX RATE AND THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS
 COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE. AN INCREASE
 IN
 FUTURE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT NET INCOME IN FUTURE
 PERIODS. WE OPERATE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT INCOME TAX
 RATES.
 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN
 ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES HAVING LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN
 ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES HAVING HIGHER STATUTORY RATES, BY CHANGES IN THE
 VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS
 OR
 INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. 

EFFECTIVE
 JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION
 NO. 48, ACCOUNTING
 FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109
 FIN 48 ). FIN
 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES BY CREATING
 A
 FRAMEWORK FOR HOW COMPANIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE, MEASURE, PRESENT AND DISCLOSE
 IN
 THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN
 OR
 EXPECT TO TAKE IN A TAX RETURN. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING
 AND ESTIMATING OUR TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE
 PERIODIC
 ADJUSTMENTS AND WHICH MAY NOT ACCURATELY ANTICIPATE ACTUAL OUTCOMES (SEE
 NOTE 8
 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE
 IN THIS
 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). 

WE
 ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISKS RELATED TO THE
 EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES,
 AND WE
 MAY BE SUBJECT TO INCREMENTAL TAXES UPON REPATRIATION OF FUNDS. WHILE WE
 CAREFULLY WATCH AND ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES, THESE TYPES OF CHANGES
 CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS . 

9 

IN
 ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY
 THE U.S.
 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE ARE CURRENTLY
 UNDER AUDIT
 BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR THE 2005 TAX YEAR (SEE NOTE 8 OF
 THE NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL
 REPORT ON
 FORM 10-K). WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING
 FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR INCOME TAX RESERVES
 AND
 EXPENSE. IF OUR RESERVES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THESE CONTINGENCIES,
 SUCH
 INADEQUACY COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS,
 FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

A
 SYSTEM FAILURE OR BREACH OF SYSTEM OR NETWORK SECURITY COULD DELAY OR INTERRUPT
 SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, HARM OUR REPUTATION OR SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT
 LIABILITY. 

OUR
 OPERATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR NETWORK FROM INTERRUPTION
 BY DAMAGE FROM FIRE, EARTHQUAKE, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE,
 UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THERE
 CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EXISTING AND PLANNED PRECAUTIONS OF BACKUP SYSTEMS,
 REGULAR DATA BACKUPS, SECURITY PROTOCOLS AND OTHER PROCEDURES WILL BE ADEQUATE
 TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA LOSS. ALSO, DESPITE THE
 IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY MEASURES, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO
 COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS OR SIMILAR DISRUPTIVE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR
 SUBSCRIBERS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHER INTERNET USERS WHO ATTEMPT TO INVADE PUBLIC
 AND
 PRIVATE DATA NETWORKS. ANY DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SECURITY BREACH THAT CAUSES
 INTERRUPTIONS OR DATA LOSS IN OUR OPERATIONS OR IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS OF
 OUR
 CUSTOMERS OR LEADS TO THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS CONFIDENTIAL
 INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY TO US, CAUSE CONSIDERABLE
 HARM
 TO OUR REPUTATION AND DETER CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FROM USING OUR
 SERVICES. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH
 FLOWS. 

OUR
 SECURITY MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT SECURITY BREACHES THAT COULD HARM OUR
 BUSINESS. CURRENTLY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR USERS AUTHORIZE US TO
 BILL
 THEIR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS DIRECTLY FOR ALL TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED
 BY US. WE
 RELY ON ENCRYPTION AND AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY TO EFFECT SECURE TRANSMISSION
 OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD NUMBERS.
 ADVANCES IN
 COMPUTER CAPABILITIES, NEW DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY OR
 OTHER
 DEVELOPMENTS MAY RESULT IN A COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED
 BY US
 TO PROTECT TRANSACTION DATA. ANY COMPROMISE OF OUR SECURITY COULD HARM
 OUR
 REPUTATION AND, THEREFORE, OUR BUSINESS, AND ALSO SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT
 LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, A PARTY WHO IS ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT OUR SECURITY
 MEASURES
 COULD MISAPPROPRIATE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN
 OUR
 OPERATIONS, DAMAGE OUR COMPUTERS OR THOSE OF OUR USERS OR OTHERWISE DAMAGE
 OUR
 REPUTATION AND BUSINESS. 

OUR
 BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON A SMALL NUMBER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS IN EACH
 REGION AND OUR INABILITY TO MAINTAIN AGREEMENTS AT ATTRACTIVE RATES WITH SUCH
 CARRIERS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR
 BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY, AFFORDABILITY, RELIABILITY
 AND
 SECURITY OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CARRIERS
 IN
 EACH REGION, AND IN SOME CASES ONLY ONE CARRIER, OFFER THE TELEPHONE NUMBER
 AND
 NETWORK SERVICES WE REQUIRE. CERTAIN OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES ARE
 PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS THAT THE PROVIDERS CAN TERMINATE
 OR
 ELECT NOT TO RENEW. AS A RESULT, ANY OR ALL OF OUR CURRENT CARRIERS COULD
 DISCONTINUE PROVIDING US WITH SERVICE AT RATES ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL,
 AND
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE REPLACEMENTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY
 AND
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS
 AND CASH FLOWS. 

GENERAL
 MARKET FORCES, THE FAILURE OF PROVIDERS, REGULATORY ISSUES AND OTHER FACTORS
 COULD RESULT IN INCREASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS COSTS, WHICH WOULD IN TURN INCREASE
 THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR SERVICES. IF SIGNIFICANT, THESE INCREASES COULD
 MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

INCREASED
 COST OF EMAIL TRANSMISSIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS. 

WE
 RELY
 ON EMAIL FOR THE DELIVERY OF OUR FAX AND VOICEMAIL MESSAGES. IN ADDITION,
 WE
 DERIVE SOME ADVERTISING REVENUES THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF EMAIL MESSAGES TO
 OUR
 FREE SUBSCRIBERS AND WE REGULARLY COMMUNICATE WITH OUR SUBSCRIBERS VIA EMAIL.
 IF
 REGULATIONS OR OTHER CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY LEAD TO A CHARGE ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 THE SENDING OR RECEIVING OF EMAIL OR VOICEMAIL MESSAGES, THE COST OF PROVIDING
 OUR SERVICES WOULD INCREASE AND, IF SIGNIFICANT, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY
 AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND
 CASH
 FLOWS. 

IF
 WE EXPERIENCE EXCESSIVE FRAUDULENT CREDIT CARD CHARGES OR CANNOT MEET EVOLVING
 CREDIT CARD COMPANY MERCHANT STANDARDS, WE COULD LOSE THE RIGHT TO ACCEPT
 CREDIT
 CARDS FOR PAYMENT AND OUR SUBSCRIBER BASE COULD DECREASE
 SIGNIFICANTLY. 

A
 SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR PAID SUBSCRIBERS AUTHORIZE US TO BILL THEIR CREDIT
 CARD ACCOUNTS DIRECTLY FOR ALL SERVICE FEES CHARGED BY US. WE INCUR LOSSES
 FROM
 CLAIMS THAT THE CUSTOMER DID NOT AUTHORIZE THE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION TO
 PURCHASE OUR SERVICE. IF THE NUMBERS OF UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
 BECOME EXCESSIVE, WE COULD BE ASSESSED SUBSTANTIAL FINES FOR EXCESS CHARGEBACKS
 AND WE COULD LOSE THE RIGHT TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS FOR PAYMENT. IN ADDITION,
 CREDIT CARD COMPANIES MAY CHANGE THE MERCHANT STANDARDS 

10 

REQUIRED
 TO UTILIZE THEIR SERVICES FROM TIME TO TIME. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THESE
 NEW
 STANDARDS, WE COULD BE UNABLE TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. OUR INABILITY TO ACCEPT
 CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR PAID SUBSCRIBER BASE TO SIGNIFICANTLY
 DECREASE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS,
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

OUR
 BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN OR RETAIN TELEPHONE NUMBERS, ARE
 PROHIBITED FROM OBTAINING LOCAL NUMBERS OR ARE LIMITED TO DISTRIBUTING LOCAL
 NUMBERS TO ONLY CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. 

OUR
 FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCURE LARGE QUANTITIES OF LOCAL
 TELEPHONE NUMBERS IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES
 IN DESIRABLE LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND OFFER OUR SERVICES TO OUR
 PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. OUR ABILITY TO PROCURE AND
 DISTRIBUTE TELEPHONE NUMBERS DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS APPLICABLE REGULATIONS,
 THE PRACTICES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS THAT PROVIDE TELEPHONE NUMBERS,
 THE
 COST OF THESE TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR NEW TELEPHONE
 NUMBERS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE ARE THE CUSTOMER OF RECORD FOR ALL OF OUR
 U.S.
 TELEPHONE NUMBERS, FROM TIME TO TIME, CERTAIN U.S. TELEPHONE CARRIERS ILLEGALLY
 PORT OUR TELEPHONE NUMBERS AWAY FROM US TO OTHER CARRIERS . ALSO, IN SOME FOREIGN
 JURISDICTIONS, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PERMITTED TO
 PORT
 THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBERS TO ANOTHER CARRIER. THESE FACTORS COULD LEAD TO
 INCREASED CANCELLATIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OF OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER
 INVENTORY. FAILURE TO OBTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBERS IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE
 MANNER, INCREASED PORTING AWAY OF OUR TELEPHONE NUMBERS OR REGULATORY
 RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR SERVICES WITHOUT RESTRICTION MAY
 HAVE
 A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS, CASH FLOWS AND GROWTH IN OR ENTRY INTO FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC
 MARKETS. 

FOR
 EXAMPLE, IN THE U.S., THE FCC HAS ADOPTED AN ORDER THAT PERMITS STATES TO APPLY
 TO THE FCC FOR DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT SPECIALIZED AREA CODES THAT
 WOULD SEGREGATE SERVICES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE UNIFIED MESSAGING AND OTHER
 SERVICES THAT THE FCC PERCEIVES AS BEING GEOGRAPHICALLY INSENSITIVE, INTO
 UNIQUE AREA CODES. WE HAVE PETITIONED THE FCC FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THIS
 DECISION, WHICH REMAINS PENDING. THE OUTCOME OF THIS PETITION MAY REDUCE DEMAND
 BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS FOR NEW DIDS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS,
 IF
 IT RESTRICTS US FROM OBTAINING TELEPHONE NUMBERS IN AREA CODES THAT ARE
 GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS LOCAL BY CONSUMERS. TWO STATES, CONNECTICUT AND
 CALIFORNIA, HAVE PETITIONED THE FCC FOR SUCH AUTHORITY. THE FCC CONDITIONALLY
 GRANTED CONNECTICUT S PETITION IN 2003, BUT THE STATE HAS NOT ADOPTED A
 SPECIALIZED CODE. WE PARTICIPATED IN CONNECTICUT S PROCEEDINGS TO ATTEMPT TO
 OBTAIN A NONDISCRIMINATORY OUTCOME. IF THE STATE GOES FORWARD AT SOME FUTURE
 DATE AND ADOPTS A SPECIALIZED AREA CODE, THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCEEDING COULD
 AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE STATE. THE FCC GRANTED CALIFORNIA S
 PETITION WITH FEWER CONDITIONS. WE ARE NOW PARTICIPATING IN THE RECONSIDERATION
 STAGE OF THAT FCC DECISION, ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION THAT THE DECISION WILL
 NOT
 APPLY TO OUR SERVICES. THE OUTCOME OF THE FCC DECISION AND CALIFORNIA S EVENTUAL
 IMPLEMENTATION OF IT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBERS THAT
 ARE
 PERCEIVED BY CONSUMERS AS BEING LOCAL. SIMILAR REGULATION HAS OCCURRED IN SOME
 INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ENACTED IN ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS
 IN THE FUTURE. FOR INSTANCE, GERMANY PROHIBITS ISSUING A LOCAL TELEPHONE NUMBER
 TO ANYONE WITHOUT A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH A LOCAL AREA
 CODE. IF THIS CONTINUES, IT MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE THE
 TELEPHONE NUMBERS FOR OUR OPERATIONS. 

IN
 ADDITION, FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR SUBSCRIBER BASE, TOGETHER WITH GROWTH IN THE
 SUBSCRIBER BASES OF PROVIDERS OF OTHER FAX AND/OR VOICEMAIL TO EMAIL AND UNIFIED
 MESSAGING SERVICES, MAY INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR LARGE QUANTITIES OF TELEPHONE
 NUMBERS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND OUR INABILITY TO ACQUIRE
 SUFFICIENT TELEPHONE NUMBERS TO ACCOMMODATE OUR FUTURE GROWTH. 

INADEQUATE
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS COULD PREVENT US FROM ENFORCING OR DEFENDING
 OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. 

OUR
 SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE RELY ON A
 COMBINATION OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND CONTRACTUAL
 RESTRICTIONS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES
 PROVIDE ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETECT UNAUTHORIZED
 USE OR TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,
 PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE LAWS MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY
 RIGHTS AS FULLY AS IN THE U.S. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED A NUMBER OF PATENTS
 AND
 OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE
 THAT
 ANY OF THESE PATENTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR
 THAT ANY RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THESE PATENTS WILL IN FACT PROVIDE COMPETITIVE
 ADVANTAGES TO US. 

CURRENTLY,
 THREE OF OUR PATENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-EXAMINATION PROCEEDINGS WITH THE U.S.
 PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE. THE RESULT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS COULD LIMIT OR
 INVALIDATE SOME OR ALL OF THE CLAIMS UNDER THESE PATENTS, WHICH COULD REQUIRE
 US
 TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR PATENT ASSET IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS. IN THAT CASE, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A CHARGE TO EARNINGS
 IN
 OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT
 OF OUR PATENT IS DETERMINED. THIS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS. 

IN
 ADDITION, EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS
 AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN SOME FOREIGN
 COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT COMPETITORS
 IN
 THESE REGIONS FROM INFRINGING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD
 REDUCE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THOSE REGIONS AND
 NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 

COMPANIES
 IN THE MESSAGING INDUSTRY HAVE EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE 

11 

PENDING
 PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, BOTH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE, AGAINST SEVERAL
 COMPANIES IN THIS INDUSTRY. THIS OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION TO ENFORCE OUR
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING, COULD DIVERT
 MANAGEMENT RESOURCES AND MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PROTECT OUR BUSINESS. 

IF
 OUR TRADEMARKS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR
 DOMAIN NAMES, OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR
 SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS. WE RELY
 ON
 SOME BRANDS THAT USE THE LETTER E BEFORE A WORD,
 SUCH AS EFAX AND EVOICE . SOME REGULATORS AND COMPETITORS HAVE TAKEN THE VIEW
 THAT THE E IS DESCRIPTIVE. OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THESE BRANDS ARE GENERIC
 WHEN APPLIED TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE
 AND PROTECT TRADEMARK RIGHTS TO THESE OR OTHER BRANDS, THE VALUE OF THESE
 BRANDS
 MAY BE DIMINISHED, COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MIMIC OUR
 SERVICE
 AND METHODS OF OPERATIONS, THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND SERVICE TO
 SUBSCRIBERS AND POTENTIAL SUBSCRIBERS MAY BECOME CONFUSED IN THE MARKETPLACE
 AND
 OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT SUBSCRIBERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE
 CURRENTLY HOLD VARIOUS DOMAIN NAMES RELATING TO OUR BRANDS, BOTH IN THE U.S.
 AND
 INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING EFAX.COM AND VARIOUS OTHER INTERNATIONAL EXTENSIONS,
 EVOICE.COM, FAX.COM, ONEBOX.COM AND OTHERS. THE ACQUISITION AND MAINTENANCE
 OF
 DOMAIN NAMES GENERALLY ARE REGULATED BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND THEIR
 DESIGNEES. THE REGULATION OF DOMAIN NAMES IN THE U.S. MAY CHANGE. GOVERNING
 BODIES MAY ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS, APPOINT ADDITIONAL DOMAIN
 NAME REGISTRARS OR MODIFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HOLDING DOMAIN NAMES. AS A
 RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE OR MAINTAIN RELEVANT DOMAIN NAMES IN
 THE
 U.S. FURTHERMORE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REGULATIONS GOVERNING DOMAIN NAMES
 AND LAWS PROTECTING TRADEMARKS AND SIMILAR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE U.S.
 IS
 UNCLEAR. SIMILARLY, INTERNATIONAL RULES GOVERNING THE ACQUISITION AND
 MAINTENANCE OF DOMAIN NAMES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ARE SOMETIMES DIFFERENT
 FROM U.S. RULES, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL OF OUR DOMAINS
 INTERNATIONALLY. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PREVENT
 THIRD
 PARTIES FROM ACQUIRING DOMAIN NAMES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO, INFRINGE UPON OR
 OTHERWISE DECREASE THE VALUE OF OUR TRADEMARKS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
 IN
 ADDITION, FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR DOMAIN NAMES DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND BRANDS, AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
 FOR
 USERS TO FIND OUR WEBSITES AND OUR SERVICES. 

OUR
 GROWTH WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OUR BRANDS AND MARKET NEW BRANDS,
 AND THESE EFFORTS MAY BE COSTLY. 

WE
 BELIEVE THAT CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR CURRENT BRANDS AND EFFECTIVELY
 LAUNCH
 NEW BRANDS WILL BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES,
 AND WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED FOCUS ON ACTIVE MARKETING EFFORTS. THE DEMAND
 FOR AND
 COST OF ONLINE AND TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING HAVE BEEN INCREASING AND MAY CONTINUE
 TO INCREASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NEED TO SPEND INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MONEY
 ON,
 AND DEVOTE GREATER RESOURCES TO, ADVERTISING, MARKETING AND OTHER EFFORTS
 TO
 CREATE AND MAINTAIN BRAND LOYALTY AMONG USERS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUPPORTING
 AN
 INCREASING NUMBER OF BRANDS, EACH OF WHICH REQUIRES ITS OWN RESOURCES. BRAND
 PROMOTION ACTIVITIES MAY NOT YIELD INCREASED REVENUES, AND EVEN IF THEY DO,
 ANY
 INCREASED REVENUES MAY NOT OFFSET THE EXPENSES INCURRED IN BUILDING OUR BRANDS.
 IF WE FAIL TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN OUR BRANDS, OR IF WE INCUR SUBSTANTIAL
 EXPENSE IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN OUR BRANDS, OUR
 BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. 

WE
 MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS,
 WHICH
 COULD EXPOSE US TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE
 HAVE
 BEEN AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT
 WE HAVE INFRINGED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE READY
 AVAILABILITY OF DAMAGES, ROYALTIES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
 HAS
 INCREASED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF PATENT
 INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY OUR RESELLERS
 AND USERS FOR SIMILAR CLAIMS MADE AGAINST THEM. ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHETHER
 OR NOT MERITORIOUS, COULD REQUIRE US TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY IN
 LITIGATION, PAY DAMAGES, DEVELOP NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR ACQUIRE LICENSES
 TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. THESE
 LICENSES, IF REQUIRED, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR HAVE ACCEPTABLE TERMS.
 AS
 A RESULT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AGAINST US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
 EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND
 CASH FLOWS. 

THE
 SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON THE SUPPLY OF CRITICAL
 ELEMENTS AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. 

WE
 DEPEND
 UPON THIRD PARTIES FOR SEVERAL CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING
 VARIOUS TECHNOLOGY, INFRASTRUCTURE, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MARKETING COMPONENTS.
 WE RELY ON PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS FOR OUR INTERNET AND TELEPHONY
 CONNECTIONS AND FOR CO-LOCATION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
 SERVERS. ANY DISRUPTION IN THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY OF THESE SUPPLIERS,
 OR
 ANY FAILURE BY THEM TO HANDLE CURRENT OR HIGHER VOLUMES OF ACTIVITY, COULD
 HAVE
 A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

TO
 OBTAIN
 NEW CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE MARKETING AGREEMENTS WITH OPERATORS OF LEADING SEARCH
 ENGINES AND WEBSITES. THESE 

12 

ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND DO NOT EXTEND OVER A
 SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. FAILURE TO CONTINUE THESE RELATIONSHIPS ON TERMS
 THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US OR TO CONTINUE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS
 COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR
 BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR BILLING SYSTEMS. 

A
 SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUES DEPENDS ON PROMPT AND ACCURATE BILLING
 PROCESSES. CUSTOMER BILLING IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCESS, AND OUR BILLING
 SYSTEMS
 MUST EFFICIENTLY INTERFACE WITH THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THOSE OF CREDIT
 CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES. OUR
 ABILITY TO ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY BILL OUR SUBSCRIBERS IS DEPENDENT
 ON THE
 SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF OUR BILLING SYSTEMS AND THE THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS
 UPON
 WHICH WE RELY, SUCH AS OUR CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR, AND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE
 THESE THIRD PARTIES THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS. IN
 ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW PAID SERVICES OR ALTERNATIVE-BILLING
 PLANS IS
 DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE OUR BILLING SYSTEMS. WE ARE IN THE
 PROCESS
 OF UPGRADING OUR CURRENT BILLING SYSTEMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWING
 SUBSCRIBER BASE. ANY FAILURE TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE UPGRADED SYSTEMS
 OR TO
 MANAGE THE NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURAL TRANSITIONS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY
 TO
 PROPERLY BILL OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS OR ATTRACT AND SERVICE NEW CUSTOMERS.
 IN
 ADDITION, ANY FAILURES OR ERRORS IN OUR CURRENT BILLING SYSTEMS OR PROCEDURES
 OR
 RESULTING FROM ANY UPGRADES TO OUR BILLING SYSTEMS OR PROCEDURES COULD
 MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
 RESULTS. 

OUR
 FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE GROWTH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
 HAVE
 EXPANDED OUR OPERATIONS RAPIDLY AND ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
 AND
 DIVERSIFY BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING INCREASING OUR
 CUSTOMER BASE, THE VOLUME OF MESSAGES AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT PASS THROUGH
 OUR
 NETWORK, THE TYPES OF SERVICES WE OFFER AND OUR METHODS OF SALE. THIS EXPANSION
 HAS PLACED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE, A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN
 ON OUR
 MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AS A RESULT, WE MUST EXPAND
 AND
 ADAPT OUR OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR PERSONNEL
 IN
 CERTAIN AREAS. OUR BUSINESS RELIES ON OUR DATA SYSTEMS, BILLING SYSTEMS FOR
 OUR
 FEE-BASED AND OTHER SERVICES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
 AND
 CONTROL SYSTEMS. ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX DUE
 TO
 THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND TO ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES WITH DIFFERENT
 SYSTEMS. TO MANAGE FURTHER GROWTH WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO AUTOMATE, IMPROVE
 OR REPLACE OUR DATA, BILLING AND OTHER EXISTING OPERATIONAL, CUSTOMER SERVICE
 AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. THESE UPGRADES AND IMPROVEMENTS
 WILL REQUIRE A DEDICATION OF RESOURCES THAT, IN SOME CASES, ARE LIKELY TO
 BE
 COMPLEX. ANY FAILURE TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT AND MANAGE THESE SYSTEMS AND
 PROCEDURAL TRANSITIONS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVICE
 CUSTOMERS, AND COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND DELAYS
 IN THE
 EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. IF WE CANNOT MANAGE GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, OUR
 BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER. 

FUTURE
 ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN DILUTION, OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER HARMFUL
 CONSEQUENCES. 

WE
 MAY
 ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES
 THAT COMPLEMENT OR AUGMENT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND CUSTOMER BASE. WE CANNOT
 ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES,
 INTEGRATE DISPARATE TECHNOLOGIES AND CORPORATE CULTURES AND MANAGE A
 GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED COMPANY. ACQUISITIONS COULD DIVERT ATTENTION FROM
 OTHER
 BUSINESS CONCERNS AND COULD EXPOSE US TO UNFORESEEN LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION,
 WE
 MAY LOSE KEY EMPLOYEES WHILE INTEGRATING ANY NEW COMPANIES. WE MAY PAY FOR
 SOME
 ACQUISITIONS BY ISSUING ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK, WHICH WOULD DILUTE CURRENT
 STOCKHOLDERS. WE MAY ALSO USE CASH TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE WILL BE REQUIRED
 TO
 REVIEW GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN CONNECTION WITH
 PAST AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OPERATING EXPENSES
 IF AN IMPAIRMENT ISSUE IS IDENTIFIED. 

OUR
 SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR RETENTION OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT
 AND OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL KEY PERSONNEL. 

OUR
 SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE SKILLS, EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS,
 SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ONE
 OR
 MORE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES COULD
 HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR
 CONTINUING ABILITY TO ATTRACT, INTEGRATE AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED TECHNICAL,
 SALES AND MANAGERIAL PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR THESE PEOPLE IS INTENSE, AND
 THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN RETAIN OUR KEY EMPLOYEES OR THAT WE CAN
 ATTRACT, ASSIMILATE OR RETAIN OTHER HIGHLY QUALIFIED TECHNICAL, SALES AND
 MANAGERIAL PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE. 

WE
 MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. 

AS
 WE
 CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S., OUR
 FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF
 UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN CURRENCY
 EXCHANGE RATES; POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN A SPECIFIC
 COUNTRY OR REGION; TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING
 AND MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING
 IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES AND
 AFFILIATES. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT
 ON
 OUR FUTURE BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND
 CASH
 FLOWS. 

13 

IN
 ADDITION, WE HAVE ONLY LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MARKETING AND OPERATING OUR
 SERVICES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. MOREOVER, WE HAVE IN SOME CASES
 EXPERIENCED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE IN SOME CASES HIGHER COSTS
 AS A
 PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN CONNECTION WITH ESTABLISHING AND PROVIDING SERVICES
 IN
 INTERNATIONAL MARKETS VERSUS THE U.S. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL
 MARKETS
 MAY BE SLOWER THAN THE U.S. IN ADOPTING THE INTERNET AND/OR OUTSOURCED
 MESSAGING
 AND COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS AND SO OUR OPERATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
 MAY
 NOT DEVELOP AT A RATE THAT SUPPORTS OUR LEVEL OF INVESTMENTS. 

AS
 WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS
 AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BALANCE SHEET AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

AS
 WE
 EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WE COULD BE EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS
 OF
 CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE ALREADY OFFER
 OUR
 SERVICES IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
 CANADIAN DOLLAR, THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND STERLING. AS A RESULT,
 FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE RESULTS OF OUR
 OPERATIONS, WHICH IN TURN MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT REPORTED EARNINGS AND THE
 COMPARABILITY OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS OUR INTERNATIONAL
 OPERATIONS GROW, THESE EFFECTS COULD BECOME MATERIAL. CHANGES IN CURRENCY
 EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO AFFECT THE RELATIVE PRICES AT WHICH WE AND FOREIGN
 COMPETITORS SELL OUR SERVICES IN THE SAME MARKET. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE
 VALUE OF THE RELEVANT CURRENCIES MAY AFFECT THE COST OF CERTAIN ITEMS REQUIRED
 IN OUR OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL
 REGULATIONS, WHICH MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT OUR CONVERSION OF OTHER CURRENCIES
 INTO U.S. DOLLARS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT FUTURE EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS
 WILL
 NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO
 FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING TRANSACTIONS TO CONTROL OR MINIMIZE THESE
 RISKS. 

OUR
 BUSINESS AND USERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SALES TAX AND OTHER
 TAXES. 

THE
 APPLICATION OF INDIRECT TAXES (SUCH AS SALES AND USE TAX, VALUE ADDED TAX
 VAT ), GOODS AND SERVICES TAX, BUSINESS TAX AND GROSS RECEIPT TAX) TO
 E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES SUCH AS J2 GLOBAL AND OUR USERS IS A COMPLEX AND EVOLVING
 ISSUE. MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE THESE TAXES
 WERE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE. IN MANY
 CASES, IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW EXISTING STATUTES APPLY TO THE INTERNET OR
 E-COMMERCE. IN ADDITION, SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE IMPLEMENTED LAWS SPECIFICALLY
 ADDRESSING THE INTERNET OR SOME ASPECT OF E-COMMERCE AND SEVERAL OTHER PROPOSALS
 HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD IMPOSE
 ADDITIONAL TAXES ON THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE INTERNET. THESE
 PROPOSALS, IF ADOPTED, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE,
 HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS AND DIMINISH OUR ABILITY
 TO DERIVE FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM OUR ACTIVITIES. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE
 U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED LEGISLATION EXTENDING THE MORATORIUM ON
 STATES AND OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSING ACCESS OR DISCRIMINATORY TAXES
 ON
 THE INTERNET THROUGH NOVEMBER 2014. THIS MORATORIUM DOES NOT PROHIBIT FEDERAL,
 STATE OR LOCAL AUTHORITIES FROM COLLECTING TAXES ON OUR INCOME OR FROM
 COLLECTING TAXES THAT ARE DUE UNDER EXISTING TAX RULES. THE APPLICATION OF
 EXISTING, NEW OR FUTURE LAWS COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS,
 PROSPECTS AND OPERATING RESULTS. THERE HAVE BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE,
 SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH THE VARIOUS INDIRECT
 TAX REQUIREMENTS IN THE NUMEROUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OR WILL CONDUCT
 BUSINESS. 

WE
 MAY BE ENGAGED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR UNFORESEEN
 EXPENSES AND COULD OCCUPY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR MANAGEMENT S TIME AND
 ATTENTION. 

FROM
 TIME
 TO TIME WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION OR CLAIMS, INCLUDING IN THE AREAS OF
 PATENT
 INFRINGEMENT AND ANTI-TRUST, THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS
 OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SUCH DISPUTES COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR
 UNFORESEEN EXPENSES, OCCUPY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR MANAGEMENT S TIME AND
 ATTENTION AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF OUR CURRENTLY PENDING CASES. SOME
 OR ALL
 OF THE AMOUNT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO DEFEND OR TO SATISFY A JUDGMENT
 OR
 SETTLEMENT OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE.
 UNDER INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WE HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH OUR CURRENT AND
 FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THEM, AND ADVANCE
 EXPENSES TO THEM, IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN PROCEEDINGS ARISING
 OUT OF THEIR SERVICE TO US. THESE PAYMENTS MAY BE MATERIAL. FOR A MORE DETAILED
 DESCRIPTION OF THE LAWSUITS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS. 

THE
 MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY
 HAVE
 GREATER RESOURCES TO COMMIT TO GROWTH, SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGIES, CHEAPER PRICING
 OR
 MORE EFFECTIVE MARKETING STRATEGIES. 

FOR
 INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPETITION, AND THE RISKS ARISING OUT OF THE
 COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED
 COMPETITION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN
 ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE MAJOR COMPANIES WITH MUCH GREATER
 RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER SUBSCRIBER BASES THAN WE HAVE. SOME OF THESE
 COMPETITORS OFFER THEIR SERVICES AT LOWER PRICES THAN WE DO. THESE COMPANIES
 MAY
 BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES
 MORE QUICKLY, ADAPT MORE SWIFTLY TO NEW OR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND CHANGES
 IN
 CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ACQUISITION AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
 MORE READILY AND DEVOTE GREATER RESOURCES TO THE MARKETING AND SALE OF THEIR

14 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAN WE CAN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT
 ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS WILL NOT ENTER MARKETS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY SERVING
 AND
 PLAN TO SERVE OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. COMPETITIVE
 PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, OPERATING PROFITS OR BOTH.

WE
 ARE EXPOSED TO RISK IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN OR ADHERE TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
 AND
 PROCEDURES. 

WE
 HAVE
 ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN, ASSESS AND UPDATE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.
 OUR
 INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES
 REGARDING OUR BUSINESS
 OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT
 LIMITATIONS IN THIS PROCESS, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT PREVENT
 OR
 DETECT ALL ERRORS OR MISSTATEMENTS. TO THE EXTENT OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
 ARE
 INADEQUATE OR NOT ADHERED TO BY OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION
 AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY
 AFFECTED. 

IF
 WE ARE
 NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR
 WITHOUT ADEQUATE COMPLIANCE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL
 RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS OR INVESTIGATIONS
 BY
 REGULATORY AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THE SEC OR NASDAQ. ANY SUCH ACTION OR RESTATEMENT
 OF PRIOR-PERIOD FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OR INVESTORS 
CONFIDENCE IN J2 GLOBAL, AND COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO FALL. 

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY 

OUR
 SERVICES MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO BURDENSOME TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION, WHICH
 COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR RESTRICT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. 

WE
 PROVIDE OUR SERVICES THROUGH DATA TRANSMISSIONS OVER PUBLIC TELEPHONE LINES
 AND
 OTHER FACILITIES PROVIDED BY CARRIERS. THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO
 FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC LAWS AND REGULATION BY THE FCC, STATE PUBLIC UTILITY
 COMMISSIONS AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT
 THE
 AVAILABILITY OF TELEPHONE NUMBERS, THE PRICES WE PAY FOR TRANSMISSION SERVICES,
 THE COMPETITION WE FACE FROM OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND
 OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR MARKET. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SERVICES ARE
 INFORMATION SERVICES UNDER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 AND RELATED
 PRECEDENT AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE SUBJECT TO U.S.
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES REGULATION. THE FCC ALSO VIEWS INTERNET-BASED
 SERVICES AS BEING INTERSTATE AND SUBJECT TO THE PROTECTION OF FEDERAL LAWS
 PREEMPTING STATE EFFORTS TO IMPOSE TRADITIONAL COMMON CARRIER REGULATION ON
 SUCH
 SERVICES. HOWEVER, AS MESSAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES CONVERGE AND AS
 THE
 SERVICES WE OFFER EXPAND, THERE MAY BE INCREASED REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS.
 THEREFORE, IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO FCC OR OTHER REGULATORY
 AGENCY REGULATION. CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT COULD DECREASE OUR
 REVENUES, INCREASE OUR COSTS AND RESTRICT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. IN MANY OF
 OUR
 INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL
 AUTHORITY. 

IN
 THE
 U.S., CONGRESS AND THE FCC REGULATIONS SUBSIDIZE PORTIONS OF THE
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM OUT OF THE USF. CONGRESS AND THE FCC ARE REVIEWING
 THE
 WAY IT COLLECTS USF PAYMENTS FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. AMONG THE
 PROPOSED CHANGES BEING CONSIDERED IS IMPOSING A FLAT FEE PER TELEPHONE NUMBER.
 IF ADOPTED WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION FOR OUR SERVICE, THIS CHANGE IN RULES COULD
 HAVE
 A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF OUR NON-PAID SERVICES, AND COULD
 CAUSE US TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OUR PAID SERVICE. OTHER CHANGES TO THE USF
 SUBSIDY THE CONGRESS AND THE FCC ARE CONSIDERING MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR
 OPERATIONS. 

IN
 AUGUST
 2005, THE FCC RECLASSIFIED WIRELINE BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES (I.E.,
 DSL) AS INFORMATION SERVICES, THEREBY REMOVING THE REGULATION REQUIRING
 TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO OFFER THEIR LINES TO COMPETING PROVIDERS AT LOW RATES.
 INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ILECS CAN NOW SELL OR LEASE THEIR LINES
 FOR WHAT THEY DECIDE IS A FAIR VALUE. THE DECISION COULD POSSIBLY ENABLE ILECS
 TO CHARGE HIGHER RATES FOR UNDERLYING BROADBAND TRANSMISSION SERVICE TO
 COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS THAT SERVICE SOME OF OUR LINES IN VARIOUS
 STATES. IF ONE OR MORE ILECS TAKE THIS ACTION, IT COULD HAVE AN INDIRECT IMPACT
 ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND OPERATIONS. 

THE
 TCPA
 AND FCC RULES IMPLEMENTING THE TCPA PROHIBIT THE USE OF TELEPHONE FAX MACHINES,
 COMPUTERS OR OTHER DEVICES TO SEND UNSOLICITED FACSIMILE ADVERTISEMENTS TO
 TELEPHONE FAX MACHINES. THE JUNK FAX ACT AND FCC RULES IMPLEMENTING THE JUNK
 FAX
 ACT AMENDED THE TCPA REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW FAX ADVERTISEMENTS TO BE SENT TO
 RECIPIENTS WITH WHOM THE SENDER HAS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, AS
 LONG AS THE FAX NUMBER WAS PROVIDED VOLUNTARILY BY THE RECIPIENT. THE FCC IS
 AUTHORIZED TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST COMPANIES THAT SEND SO-CALLED
 JUNK FAXES AND HAS HELD NUMEROUS FAX BROADCASTERS LIABLE FOR VIOLATING THE
 TCPA. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE A PRIVATE
 CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATIONS UNDER THE TCPA AND RECOVER MONETARY DAMAGES
 FOR
 SUCH VIOLATIONS. ALTHOUGH ENTITIES THAT MERELY TRANSMIT FACSIMILE MESSAGES
 ON
 BEHALF OF OTHERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION ON FAXING
 UNSOLICITED ADVERTISEMENTS, THE EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO
 FAX
 TRANSMITTERS THAT HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT OR ACTUAL NOTICE OF AN
 ILLEGAL USE AND HAVE FAILED TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT SUCH TRANSMISSIONS. WE
 TAKE
 SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR SERVICES ARE NOT USED TO TRANSMIT
 UNSOLICITED FAXES ON A LARGE SCALE, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A HIGH
 DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT OR NOTICE OF THE USE OF OUR SERVICE TO BROADCAST JUNK
 FAXES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FAX TRANSMITTERS DO NOT ENJOY AN ABSOLUTE EXEMPTION
 FROM
 LIABILITY UNDER THE TCPA AND RELATED FCC RULES, WE COULD FACE FCC INQUIRY AND
 ENFORCEMENT OR CIVIL LITIGATION, OR PRIVATE CAUSES OF ACTION, IF SOMEONE USES
 OUR SERVICE FOR SUCH IMPERMISSIBLE PURPOSES. IF THIS WERE TO 

15 

OCCUR
 AND
 WE WERE TO BE HELD LIABLE FOR SOMEONE S USE OF OUR SERVICE FOR TRANSMITTING
 UNSOLICITED FAXES, THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
 ON OUR OPERATIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING ALLEGED
 VIOLATIONS OF THE TCPA WITH PROTUS IP SOLUTIONS, INC. FOR MORE INFORMATION
 ABOUT
 THIS LAWSUIT, SEE ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ENTITLED LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS. 

ALSO
 IN
 THE U.S., THE COMMUNICATIONS ASSISTANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT CALEA REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS TO BE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING WIRETAPS
 AND
 RECORDING OTHER CALL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE FCC
 RELEASED AN ORDER DEFINING TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO
 CALEA
 OBLIGATIONS AS FACILITIES-BASED BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDERS AND
 VOICE-OVER-INTERNET-PROTOCOL VOIP PROVIDERS THAT INTERCONNECT WITH THE
 PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK. AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFINITION, WE DO
 NOT
 BELIEVE THAT J2 GLOBAL IS SUBJECT TO CALEA. HOWEVER, IF THE CATEGORY OF SERVICE
 PROVIDERS TO WHICH CALEA APPLIES BROADENS TO ALSO INCLUDE INFORMATION SERVICES,
 THAT CHANGE MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE ITEM
 1 OF
 THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ENTITLED BUSINESS GOVERNMENT
 REGULATION. 

THE
 VALUE-ADDED MESSAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING RAPID
 TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP. 

THE
 VALUE-ADDED MESSAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID
 AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECT OF
 TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES ON OUR BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WIDELY ACCEPTED STANDARDS
 HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES WE USE. WE EXPECT THAT NEW SERVICES
 AND TECHNOLOGIES WILL EMERGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. THESE NEW
 SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO THE SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES
 THAT
 WE USE OR THESE NEW SERVICES MAY RENDER OUR SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE.
 OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT
 TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. WE MAY BE UNABLE
 TO
 OBTAIN ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, AND MAY
 THEREFORE BE UNABLE TO OFFER SERVICES IN A COMPETITIVE MANNER. IF THE GLOBAL
 COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY FAILS TO SET STANDARDS TO ALLOW FOR THE COMPATIBILITY
 OF
 VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, ANY NEW SERVICES
 AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES OR OPERATE
 IN A MANNER SUFFICIENT FOR US TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH COULD HAVE
 A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

WE
 RELY HEAVILY ON THE REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR FAX SERVICES. 

CURRENTLY,
 A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE OVERALL TRAFFIC ON OUR NETWORK IS FAX RELATED.
 OUR
 FUTURE SUCCESS IS THEREFORE DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED USE OF FAX AS A
 MESSAGING MEDIUM AND/OR OUR ABILITY TO DIVERSIFY OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND
 DERIVE MORE REVENUE FROM OTHER SERVICES, SUCH AS VOICE, EMAIL AND UNIFIED
 MESSAGING SOLUTIONS. IF THE DEMAND FOR FAX AS A MESSAGING MEDIUM DECREASES,
 AND
 WE ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE LOST REVENUES FROM DECREASED USAGE OF OUR FAX SERVICES
 WITH A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE OR WITH REVENUES FROM OUR
 OTHER SERVICES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH
 FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE
 BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS TO FAX VERSUS ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS EMAIL,
 IS THAT FAX SIGNATURES ARE A GENERALLY ACCEPTED METHOD OF EXECUTING CONTRACTS.
 THERE ARE ON-GOING EFFORTS BY GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, MANY
 OF WHICH POSSESS GREATER RESOURCES THAN WE DO, TO CREATE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED
 METHOD FOR ELECTRONICALLY SIGNING DOCUMENTS. WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF SO-CALLED
 DIGITAL SIGNATURES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR FAX SERVICES AND, AS A RESULT,
 COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 

WE
 ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. 

CONSUMER
 PRIVACY HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN OF REGULATORS IN THE U.S. AND
 INTERNATIONALLY. AT LEAST NINE U.S. STATES HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS
 THE USES AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION GATHERED ONLINE OR OFFLINE. MANY
 NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ALSO HAVE SUCH LAWS AND CONTINUOUSLY CONSIDER
 STRENGTHENING THEM, ESPECIALLY AGAINST ONLINE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, MORE THAN
 30 STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS THAT REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS OF THE
 OCCURRENCE OF A DATA BREACH THAT MAY RESULT IN UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION OF
 PERSONAL DATA. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WE ARE SUBJECT TO SOME OF THESE
 LAWS. 

STATUTES
 INTENDED TO PROTECT USER PRIVACY HAVE PASSED IN MANY NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.
 FOR
 EXAMPLE, THE E.U. DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE PROTECTS PERSONAL DATA (DEFINED
 AS
 DATA THAT CAN REASONABLY BE USED TO IDENTIFY A LIVING PERSON) BY INSTRUCTING
 E.U. MEMBER STATES TO ENACT LAWS REQUIRING THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION BE
 COLLECTED WITH CONSENT FOR A REASONABLE PURPOSE, USED AND DISCLOSED FOR THE
 LIMITED PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS COLLECTED, ACCURATE, ACCESSIBLE FOR INSPECTION
 AND CORRECTION, AND STORED SECURELY. THE E.U. DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE ALSO
 REQUIRES THAT A DATA COLLECTOR EITHER ESTABLISH A DATA OFFICER IN EACH MEMBER
 STATE WHERE IT OFFERS SERVICE OR SUBMIT A FORMAL NOTIFICATION OF ITS COLLECTION
 ACTIVITIES TO THE LOCAL DATA PRIVACY AGENCY. FINALLY, THE E.U. PRIVACY DIRECTIVE
 PROHIBITS THE TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA FROM AN E.U. COUNTRY TO A NON-E.U.
 COUNTRY THAT LACKS ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION LAWS. BECAUSE THE E.U. HAS
 DETERMINED THAT THE U.S. LACKS ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION LAWS, ENTITIES
 TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA MUST FOLLOW CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES OR RISK
 THE INTERRUPTION OF DATA FLOWS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
 HAS, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE E.U., 

16 

CREATED A SAFE HARBOR REGISTRY WHERE BUSINESSES
 CAN VOLUNTARILY PLEDGE TO ABIDE BY PRESCRIBED DATA PROTECTION STANDARDS IN
 ORDER
 TO PERMIT TRANSBOUNDARY DATA FLOW. THE E.U. DIRECTIVE ALSO PERMITS TRANSBOUNDARY
 DATA FLOW UPON THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE DATA SUBJECT. HOWEVER, AN INFORMAL
 OPINION FROM THE E.U. WORKING PARTY THAT STUDIES DATA PRIVACY ISSUES RECOMMENDS
 THAT THE CONSENT METHOD SHOULD BE USED ONLY WHEN OTHER TRANSFER OPTIONS ARE
 NOT
 AVAILABLE. CANADA S PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT
 PIPEDA LAW SIMILARLY REGULATES THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA.

FAILURE
 TO COMPLY WITH THESE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL DATA PRIVACY LAWS COULD SUBJECT
 US
 TO LAWSUITS, FINES, CRIMINAL PENALTIES, STATUTORY DAMAGES, ADVERSE PUBLICITY
 AND
 OTHER LOSSES THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS OR
 THE
 PASSAGE OF NEW LAWS
 INTENDED TO ADDRESS THESE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION AND RETENTION ISSUES
 COULD
 DIRECTLY AFFECT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS OR COULD CREATE UNCERTAINTY ON THE
 INTERNET. THIS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, INCREASE THE COST
 OF DOING
 BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION COSTS OR INCREASE SERVICE OR DELIVERY
 COSTS,
 OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

NEW
 AND EXISTING REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
 ARE
 SUBJECT TO THE SAME FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC LAWS AS OTHER COMPANIES CONDUCTING
 BUSINESS ON AND OFF THE INTERNET. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW LAWS SPECIFICALLY
 DIRECTED TOWARDS ONLINE SERVICES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE INCREASING POPULARITY
 AND
 USE OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES, MANY LAWS RELATING TO THE INTERNET
 ARE
 BEING DEBATED AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD AND IT IS POSSIBLE
 THAT SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE ADOPTED. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
 COULD
 COVER ISSUES SUCH AS USER PRIVACY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, PRICING, FRAUD,
 CONTENT AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TAXATION, ADVERTISING,
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INFORMATION SECURITY. IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW
 EXISTING LAWS GOVERNING ISSUES SUCH AS PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUES, TAXATION, LIBEL AND DEFAMATION, OBSCENITY AND
 PERSONAL PRIVACY APPLY TO ONLINE BUSINESSES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE LAWS
 WAS
 ADOPTED PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND, AS
 A
 RESULT, DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE OR ADDRESS THE UNIQUE ISSUES OF THE INTERNET AND
 RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THOSE LAWS THAT DO REFERENCE THE INTERNET, SUCH AS THE
 U.S. DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT AND THE E.U. S DIRECTIVE ON DISTANCE
 SELLING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, HAVE BEGUN TO BE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS
 AND
 IMPLEMENTED, BUT THEIR APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE REMAIN SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN.
 ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS
 AND REGULATIONS IN A WAY THAT IS ADVERSE TO US, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
 EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND
 CASH FLOWS. 

THE
 CONTROLLING THE ASSAULT OF NON-SOLICITED PORNOGRAPHY AND MARKETING ACT OF 2003
 (THE CAN-SPAM ACT REQUIRES COMMERCIAL EMAILS TO BE IDENTIFIED AS AN
 ADVERTISEMENT OR SOLICITATION, INCLUDE A VALID POSTAL ADDRESS AND PROVIDE A
 MECHANISM THAT WILL ENABLE RECIPIENTS TO OPT OUT OF RECEIVING FUTURE EMAILS.
 WE
 BELIEVE THAT OUR EMAIL PRACTICES COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CAN-SPAM
 ACT. HOWEVER, THE STATUTORY PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THE CAN-SPAM ACT CAN RUN
 INTO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IF WE WERE EVER FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE
 CAN-SPAM ACT, SUCH AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT
 ON
 OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH
 FLOWS. 

IN
 THE
 E.U., THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL AMENDED THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTIVE
 WITH THE DIRECTIVE ON THE RETENTION OF DATA PROCESSED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
 PROVISION OF PUBLIC ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES DATA RETENTION
 DIRECTIVE ). IN THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND TERRORISM PREVENTION, THE
 DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS AND INFORMATION
 SERVICE PROVIDERS TO STORE TRAFFIC (E.G., TIME OF COMMUNICATION, NUMBERS,
 IDENTITY OF USERS) AND LOCATION DATA FROM ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR SIX
 MONTHS TO TWO YEARS, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MEMBER STATES. MEMBER STATES
 ARE
 IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING THIS DIRECTIVE INTO NATIONAL LAWS AND MANY HAVE
 REQUESTED EXTENSIONS TO THE DEADLINE BY WHICH THE DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE
 IS
 REQUIRED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE
 MAY
 IMPACT SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS. 

IN
 ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE WORLDWIDE, FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS
 MAY CLAIM THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE
 AUSTRALIAN HIGH COURT HAS RULED THAT A U.S. WEBSITE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
 MUST COMPLY WITH AUSTRALIAN LAWS REGARDING LIBEL. AS WE EXPAND AND LOCALIZE
 OUR
 INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, WE MAY BECOME OBLIGATED TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OF
 ADDITIONAL JURISDICTIONS. NON-U.S. LAWS REGULATING INTERNET COMPANIES MAY BE
 LESS FAVORABLE THAN U.S. LAWS, GIVING GREATER RIGHTS TO CONSUMERS, CONTENT
 OWNERS AND USERS. COMPLIANCE MAY BE MORE COSTLY OR MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE
 OUR
 BUSINESS PRACTICES OR RESTRICT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE
 U.S. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FOREIGN LAWS COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES
 RANGING FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTION TO BANS ON OUR SERVICES.

FUTURE
 SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. 

AS
 OF
 FEBRUARY 13, 2008, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON

 WERE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO VOLUME AND MANNER OF SALE LIMITATIONS
 APPLICABLE TO AFFILIATES UNDER SEC RULE 144. SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER
 OF
 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET OR THE PERCEPTION OF SUCH SALES
 COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. THESE SALES

 OF DELAWARE LAW AND OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS COULD
 MAKE IT
 MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF US. FOR EXAMPLE,
 WE ARE
 SUBJECT TO SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, WHICH WOULD
 MAKE
 IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANOTHER PARTY TO ACQUIRE US WITHOUT THE APPROVAL
 OF OUR
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AUTHORIZES
 OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY
 STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, AND PREFERRED STOCK COULD BE ISSUED AS A DEFENSIVE
 MEASURE
 IN RESPONSE TO A TAKEOVER PROPOSAL. THESE PROVISIONS COULD MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD
 PARTY TO ACQUIRE US EVEN IF AN ACQUISITION MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST
 OF OUR
 STOCKHOLDERS. 

OUR
 STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE OR MAY DECLINE. 

OUR
 STOCK
 PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES HAVE BEEN VOLATILE AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS VOLATILITY
 WILL CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO FACTORS, SUCH AS: 

ASSESSMENTS
 OF THE SIZE OF OUR SUBSCRIBER BASE AND OUR AVERAGE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER,
 AND COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS VERSUS PRIOR
 PERFORMANCE AND THAT OF OUR
 COMPETITORS; 

VARIATIONS
 BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND INVESTOR
 EXPECTATIONS; 

REGULATORY
 OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR
 MARKETS; 

INVESTOR
 PERCEPTIONS OF US AND COMPARABLE PUBLIC
 COMPANIES; 

A
 LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STOCK BEING SOLD
 SHORT; 

CONDITIONS
 AND TRENDS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS, MESSAGING AND INTERNET-RELATED
 INDUSTRIES; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS
 OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND
 ACQUISITIONS; 

INTRODUCTION
 OF NEW SERVICES BY US OR OUR
 COMPETITORS; 

DEVELOPMENTS
 WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 RIGHTS; 

CONDITIONS
 AND TRENDS IN THE INTERNET AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY
 INDUSTRIES; 

RUMORS,
 GOSSIP OR SPECULATION PUBLISHED ON PUBLIC CHAT OR BULLETIN
 BOARDS; 

GENERAL
 MARKET CONDITIONS; AND 

GEOPOLITICAL
 EVENTS SUCH AS WAR, THREAT OF WAR OR TERRORIST
 ACTIONS. 

IN
 ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE
 AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE COMMON
 STOCKS OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERNET
 COMPANIES. THESE BROAD MARKET FLUCTUATIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY RESULTED IN A
 MATERIAL DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING
 PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF A PARTICULAR COMPANY S SECURITIES,
 SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS OFTEN BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THAT COMPANY.
 WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. LITIGATION
 IS
 OFTEN EXPENSIVE AND DIVERTS MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH COULD
 HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
 OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 
 RISK FACTORS 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR MERCHANDISING
BUSINESS 
 A DECLINE IN DISCRETIONARY
CONSUMER SPENDING COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE. 
 OUR
REVENUE DEPENDS ON DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH MAY DECREASE DUE TO A
VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: 
 
 UNFAVORABLE GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS; 
 INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES; 
 INCREASES IN INFLATION; 
 WARS, FEARS OF WAR, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS AND
 ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES; 
 INCREASES IN CONSUMER DEBT LEVELS AND DECREASES IN
 THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT; 
 ADVERSE OR UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS OR
 EVENTS; 
 INCREASES IN GASOLINE PRICES REDUCING THE
 WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL TO OUR RETAIL STORES; 
 ADVERSE CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND
 REGULATIONS; 
 ADVERSE LEGISLATION RELATING TO SALES OF FIREARMS
 AND AMMUNITION; 
 INCREASES IN TAXATION; 
 ADVERSE FLUCTUATIONS OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES; 

 ADVERSE UNEMPLOYMENT TRENDS; 
 ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE MORTGAGE AND HOUSING
 MARKETS; AND 
 OTHER FACTORS THAT ADVERSELY INFLUENCE CONSUMER
 CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING. 
 OUR
CUSTOMERS' PURCHASES OF DISCRETIONARY ITEMS, INCLUDING OUR PRODUCTS, COULD
DECLINE DURING PERIODS WHEN DISPOSABLE INCOME IS LOWER OR PERIODS OF ACTUAL OR
PERCEIVED UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THIS OCCURS, OUR REVENUE WOULD
DECLINE. 
 DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY GENERALLY MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY
GENERALLY. VOLATILE OIL PRICES, FALLING EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE VALUES, THE
LIMITED AVAILABILITY AND HIGH COST OF CREDIT, RISKS OF INCREASED INFLATION AND
DEFLATION, DECLINING BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND INCREASED
UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE CREATED FEARS OF A SEVERE RECESSION. FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER
SPENDING AND THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS ALL AFFECT THE
BUSINESS AND MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, THE REVENUE AND
PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS. IN A RECESSION CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER
UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING, THE DEMAND FOR
OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THIS MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 13 

COMPETITION IN THE OUTDOOR RECREATION AND CASUAL APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR
MARKETS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. 
 THE
OUTDOOR RECREATION AND CASUAL APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED
AND COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF
COMPANIES: 
 
 OTHER
 SPECIALTY RETAILERS THAT COMPETE WITH US ACROSS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR
 MERCHANDISING CATEGORIES THROUGH RETAIL STORE OR DIRECT BUSINESSES, SUCH AS
 BASS PRO SHOPS, GANDER MOUNTAIN, ORVIS, THE SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE, AND SPORTSMAN'S
 WAREHOUSE; 
 LARGE-FORMAT SPORTING GOODS STORES AND CHAINS,
 SUCH AS THE SPORTS AUTHORITY, DICK'S SPORTING GOODS, AND BIG 5 SPORTING
 GOODS; 
 RETAILERS THAT CURRENTLY COMPETE WITH US THROUGH
 RETAIL BUSINESSES THAT MAY ENTER THE DIRECT BUSINESS; 
 MASS MERCHANDISERS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, DISCOUNT
 STORES, AND DEPARTMENT STORES, SUCH AS WAL-MART AND TARGET; AND 
 CASUAL OUTDOOR APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR RETAILERS,
 SUCH AS L.L. BEAN, LANDS END, AND REI. 
 MANY OF
OUR COMPETITORS HAVE A LARGER NUMBER OF STORES, AND SOME OF THEM HAVE
SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER MARKET PRESENCE, NAME RECOGNITION, AND FINANCIAL,
DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. IN ADDITION, IF OUR
COMPETITORS REDUCE THEIR PRICES, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE OUR PRICES IN ORDER TO
COMPETE. FURTHERMORE, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVELY BUILDING
NEW STORES IN LOCATIONS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF OUR DIRECT BUSINESS
CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS COMPETITION, WE MAY NEED TO SPEND MORE ON
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION. SOME OF OUR MASS MERCHANDISING COMPETITORS, SUCH AS
WAL-MART, DO NOT CURRENTLY COMPETE IN MANY OF THE PRODUCT LINES WE OFFER. IF
THESE COMPETITORS WERE TO BEGIN OFFERING A BROADER ARRAY OF COMPETING PRODUCTS,
OR IF ANY OF THE OTHER FACTORS LISTED ABOVE OCCURRED, OUR REVENUE COULD BE
REDUCED OR OUR COSTS COULD BE INCREASED, RESULTING IN REDUCED
PROFITABILITY. 
 IF WE
ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE
FINANCIAL COVENANTS, OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE TERMINATED
AND OUR UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES COULD BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE. ADDITIONALLY, WE
ARE SUBJECT TO COUNTERPARTY RISK ON OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY. 
 OUR 430
MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN
CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM DEBT COVERAGE,
A FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, A CASH FLOW LEVERAGE RATIO, AND A MINIMUM
TANGIBLE NET WORTH STANDARD. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY THESE RATIOS,
ESPECIALLY IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS DETERIORATE AS A RESULT OF, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, ADVERSE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE DEEPENING OF THE RECESSION, OR THE
IMPACT OF OTHER RISK FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A BREACH OF ANY FINANCIAL COVENANT OR OUR INABILITY TO
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIRED FINANCIAL RATIOS COULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER OUR
UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES, AND WE CAN
PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY WAIVERS OR
AMENDMENTS FROM OUR LENDERS TO REMEDY A DEFAULT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULT
THAT IS NOT WAIVED, THE LENDERS UNDER OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
ARE NOT REQUIRED TO LEND ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OR ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT AND
COULD REQUIRE US TO APPLY ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH TO COLLATERALIZE ANY
OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND DECLARE ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, TOGETHER
WITH ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER FEES, TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. IN
ADDITION, THE HOLDERS OF OUR UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES COULD DECLARE ALL
OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS, TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER FEES, TO BE
IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. 
 IN
ADDITION, RECENT AND UNPRECEDENTED DISTRESS IN THE WORLDWIDE CREDIT MARKETS HAS
HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. ALTHOUGH OUR 430 MILLION
UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL JUNE 2012, CONTINUED
MARKET DETERIORATION COULD JEOPARDIZE THE COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS OF ONE OR
MORE OF THE BANKS PARTICIPATING IN OUR FACILITY, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REPLACE SUCH CREDIT FACILITY OR
FIND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. 
 14 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF
NEEDED. 
 THE
RECENT DOWNTURN IN THE EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS, THE TIGHTENING OF THE CREDIT
MARKETS, AND THE WORLDWIDE RECESSION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO
RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN
THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED AND TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED OR,
IF AVAILABLE, ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IF WE CANNOT RAISE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL FUNDS
ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ALSO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND EXPANSION, TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES, MEET OUR EXISTING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR
RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS. 
 OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES
WILL FLUCTUATE AND MAY NOT BE A MEANINGFUL INDICATOR OF FUTURE
PERFORMANCE. 
 CHANGES
IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES RESULTS COULD AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK. A NUMBER OF FACTORS HAVE HISTORICALLY AFFECTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO
AFFECT, OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES RESULTS, INCLUDING: 
 
 COMPETITION; 
 NEW STORE OPENINGS; 
 GENERAL REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS; 
 ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; 
 CONSUMER TRENDS AND PREFERENCES; 
 NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND CHANGES IN OUR
 PRODUCT MIX; 
 TIMING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PROMOTIONAL EVENTS;
 AND 
 WEATHER CONDITIONS. 
 WE CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WILL NOT CONTINUE TO DECREASE. OUR
COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, AND AN UNANTICIPATED
DECLINE IN REVENUES OR COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. 
 IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN THE
STRENGTH AND VALUE OF OUR BRAND, OUR REVENUE IS LIKELY TO DECLINE.
 
 OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE VALUE AND STRENGTH OF THE CABELA S BRAND. THE CABELA S
NAME IS INTEGRAL TO OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR
STRATEGIES FOR EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS. MAINTAINING, PROMOTING, AND POSITIONING
OUR BRAND WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING
EFFORTS AND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND A CONSISTENT,
HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. OUR BRAND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE
FAIL TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES OR IF OUR PUBLIC IMAGE OR REPUTATION WERE TO BE
TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN DECREASES
IN REVENUE. 
 15 

IF WE
CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR RETAIL STORE EXPANSION STRATEGY, OUR GROWTH
AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. 
 WE
CONTINUE TO SEEK ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS TO OPEN NEW RETAIL STORES. OUR ABILITY TO
OPEN NEW RETAIL STORES IN A TIMELY MANNER AND OPERATE THEM PROFITABLY DEPENDS ON
A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING:

OUR ABILITY TO
 MANAGE THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF OUR RETAIL GROWTH
 STRATEGY; 
 OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE LOCATIONS,
 INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO GATHER AND ASSESS DEMOGRAPHIC AND MARKETING DATA TO
 DETERMINE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LOCATIONS WE SELECT; 
 OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE AND OBTAIN ECONOMIC
 DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES WITH LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS WHERE OUR NEW RETAIL
 STORES WOULD BE LOCATED; 
 OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE LEASE
 AGREEMENTS; 
 OUR ABILITY TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE IMPLICATIONS OF
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES AND CUSTOMER DENSITY TO PROJECT THE
 PROFITABILITY OF POTENTIAL NEW RETAIL STORE LOCATIONS; 
 THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ON FAVORABLE
 TERMS; 
 OUR ABILITY TO SECURE REQUIRED GOVERNMENTAL
 PERMITS AND APPROVALS; 
 OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND TRAIN SKILLED STORE
 OPERATING PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL; 
 THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND
 LABOR AND THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION DELAYS OR COST
 OVERRUNS; 
 OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY MIX OF
 MERCHANDISE THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS LIVING IN THE
 AREAS WHERE NEW RETAIL STORES ARE BUILT; 
 OUR ABILITY TO SUPPLY NEW RETAIL STORES WITH
 INVENTORY IN A TIMELY MANNER; 
 OUR ABILITY TO PROPERLY ASSESS OPERATIONAL AND
 REGULATORY CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN OPENING AND SUCCESSFULLY OPERATING RETAIL
 STORES IN CANADA; 
 OUR COMPETITORS BUILDING OR LEASING STORES NEAR
 OUR RETAIL STORES OR IN LOCATIONS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS TARGETS FOR A NEW
 RETAIL STORE; AND 
 GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AFFECTING
 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING AND THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS.
 
 WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF OUR RETAIL STORES, THE
REVENUE GROWTH HISTORICALLY ACHIEVED BY OUR RETAIL STORES, OR TO MAINTAIN
CONSISTENT LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY AS WE
EXPAND INTO MARKETS NOW SERVED BY OTHER LARGE-FORMAT SPORTING GOODS RETAILERS
AND MASS MERCHANDISERS. IN PARTICULAR, NEW RETAIL STORES TYPICALLY GENERATE
LOWER OPERATING MARGINS BECAUSE PRE-OPENING COSTS ARE FULLY EXPENSED IN THE YEAR
OF OPENING AND BECAUSE FIXED COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, ARE HIGHER. IN
ADDITION, THE SUBSTANTIAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES WHICH OUR RETAIL STORE
EXPANSION STRATEGY REQUIRES MAY RESULT IN DISRUPTION TO OUR EXISTING BUSINESS
OPERATIONS WHICH MAY HARM OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 THE SLOWER PACE OF OUR
RETAIL STORE EXPANSION MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND
PROFITABILITY. 
 THE
OPENING OF NEW RETAIL STORES HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE RECENT GROWTH
OF OUR MERCHANDISING REVENUE. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RETAIL
OPERATIONS, AND IN LIGHT OF THE CHALLENGING MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT FACING
RETAILERS, WE MADE THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO SLOW THE PACE OF OUR RETAIL STORE
EXPANSION. WE OPENED EIGHT NEW RETAIL STORES IN 2007, TWO NEW RETAIL STORES IN
2008, AND CURRENTLY PLAN TO OPEN ONE NEW RETAIL STORE IN 2009. THE SLOWER PACE
OF OUR RETAIL STORE EXPANSION MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND
PROFITABILITY. 
 16 

RETAIL
STORE EXPANSION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR RETAIL
BUSINESS AND REDUCE THE REVENUE OF OUR DIRECT BUSINESS. 
 AS THE
NUMBER OF OUR RETAIL STORES INCREASES, OUR STORES WILL BECOME MORE HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED IN THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WE SERVE. AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF
CUSTOMERS AND RELATED REVENUE AT INDIVIDUAL STORES MAY DECLINE AND THE AVERAGE
AMOUNT OF SALES PER SQUARE FOOT AT OUR STORES MAY BE REDUCED. IN ADDITION, AS WE
OPEN MORE RETAIL STORES AND AS OUR COMPETITORS OPEN STORES WITH SIMILAR FORMATS,
OUR RETAIL STORE FORMAT MAY BECOME LESS UNIQUE AND MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE TO
CUSTOMERS AS TOURIST AND ENTERTAINMENT SHOPPING LOCATIONS. IF EITHER OF THESE
EVENTS OCCURS, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF OUR RETAIL STORES MAY ALSO DRAW CUSTOMERS
AWAY FROM OUR DIRECT BUSINESS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR DIRECT BUSINESS AND OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, THE REVENUE OF
OUR DIRECT BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 OUR
FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR DIRECT BUSINESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 DURING
2008, OUR DIRECT BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR 46.0 OF THE TOTAL REVENUE IN OUR RETAIL
AND DIRECT BUSINESSES. OUR DIRECT BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING:

OUR INABILITY
 TO PROPERLY ADJUST THE FIXED COSTS OF A CATALOG MAILING TO REFLECT SUBSEQUENT
 SALES OF THE PRODUCTS MARKETED IN THE CATALOG; 
 LOWER AND LESS PREDICTABLE RESPONSE RATES FOR
 CATALOGS SENT TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS; 
 INCREASES IN U.S. POSTAL SERVICE RATES, PAPER
 COSTS, AND PRINTING COSTS RESULTING IN HIGHER CATALOG PRODUCTION COSTS AND
 LOWER PROFITS FOR OUR DIRECT BUSINESS; 
 FAILURES TO PROPERLY DESIGN, PRINT, AND MAIL OUR
 CATALOGS IN A TIMELY MANNER; 
 FAILURES TO INTRODUCE NEW CATALOG TITLES; 
 FAILURES TO TIMELY FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS; 
 CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, WILLINGNESS TO
 PURCHASE GOODS THROUGH CATALOGS OR THE INTERNET, WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND
 ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, AND UNSEASONAL WEATHER IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS; 

 INCREASES IN SOFTWARE FILTERS THAT MAY INHIBIT OUR
 ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH E-MAIL MESSAGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND
 INCREASES IN CONSUMER PRIVACY CONCERNS RELATING TO THE INTERNET; 
 CHANGES IN APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE
 REGULATION; 
 BREACHES OF INTERNET SECURITY; AND 
 FAILURES IN OUR INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE OR THE
 FAILURE OF SYSTEMS OF THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS TELEPHONE OR ELECTRIC POWER
 SERVICE, RESULTING IN WEBSITE DOWNTIME, CUSTOMER CARE CENTER CLOSURES, OR
 OTHER PROBLEMS. 
 ANY ONE
OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD RESULT IN LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED REVENUE FOR OUR
DIRECT BUSINESS. THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, INCREASED
MERCHANDISE RETURNS, SLOWER TURNING INVENTORIES, INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND
WORKING CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS. BECAUSE OUR DIRECT BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR A
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE, ANY PERFORMANCE SHORTCOMINGS
EXPERIENCED BY OUR DIRECT BUSINESS WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 17 

ANY DISRUPTION OF THE SUPPLY
OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM OUR VENDORS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. 
 OUR VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS
INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
 VENDORS TO
 SUPPLY OUR MERCHANDISE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES IN A
 TIMELY MANNER; 
 OUTSIDE PRINTERS AND CATALOG PRODUCTION VENDORS TO
 PRINT AND MAIL OUR CATALOGS AND TO CONVERT OUR CATALOGS TO DIGITAL FORMAT FOR
 WEBSITE POSTING; 
 SHIPPING COMPANIES, SUCH AS UNITED PARCEL SERVICE,
 THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, AND COMMON CARRIERS, FOR TIMELY DELIVERY OF OUR
 CATALOGS, SHIPMENT OF MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND DELIVERY OF
 MERCHANDISE FROM OUR VENDORS TO US AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO OUR
 RETAIL STORES; 
 TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE TELEPHONE SERVICE
 TO OUR IN-HOUSE CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS; 
 COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE OUR INTERNET
 USERS WITH ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITE AND A WEBSITE HOSTING SERVICE PROVIDER TO
 HOST AND MANAGE OUR WEBSITE; 
 SOFTWARE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE AND RELATED
 SERVICES TO RUN OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR OUR RETAIL AND DIRECT BUSINESSES;
 AND 
 THIRD-PARTY CARD PROCESSORS, SUCH AS FIRST DATA
 RESOURCES, THAT PROCESS CABELA S CLUB VISA TRANSACTIONS. 
 ANY
DISRUPTION IN THESE SERVICES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO
MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS, AND SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR TEN LARGEST TRADE
VENDORS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 13 OF OUR TOTAL MERCHANDISE
PURCHASES IN 2008. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE SUITABLE MERCHANDISE OR LOSE ONE
OR MORE KEY VENDORS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO
OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT. WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, SUCH AS THE
UNAVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR DISPUTES, UNION ORGANIZING ACTIVITY,
STRIKES, INCLEMENT WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, WAR AND TERRORISM, AND ADVERSE
GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT LIMIT OUR VENDORS' ABILITY
TO PROVIDE US WITH QUALITY MERCHANDISE ON A TIMELY BASIS. WE HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL
ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDING FOR CONTINUED SUPPLY FROM OUR KEY VENDORS AND OUR VENDORS
MAY DISCONTINUE SELLING TO US AT ANY TIME. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP
RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEW VENDORS, AND PRODUCTS FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, IF ANY,
MAY BE OF A LESSER QUALITY AND MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THOSE WE CURRENTLY PURCHASE.
ANY DELAY OR FAILURE IN OFFERING PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, IF THE COST OF FUEL RISES,
THE COST TO DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO THE CUSTOMERS OF OUR DIRECT BUSINESS AND FROM
OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO OUR RETAIL STORES MAY RISE WHICH COULD HAVE AN
ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND UNREST IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE
OUR MERCHANDISE VENDORS ARE LOCATED AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS UPON IMPORTS FROM
THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SOURCE MERCHANDISE
AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 IN 2008,
APPROXIMATELY 15 OF OUR MERCHANDISE WAS IMPORTED DIRECTLY FROM VENDORS LOCATED
IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WITH APPROXIMATELY 88 OF OUR IMPORTED MERCHANDISE BEING
OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM VENDORS LOCATED IN CHINA, HONG KONG, SOUTH KOREA, AND
TAIWAN. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OTHER VENDORS
OBTAIN THEIR PRODUCTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES
WHERE OUR VENDORS ARE LOCATED, SUCH AS: 
 
 INCREASED
 IMPORT DUTIES, TARIFFS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, AND QUOTAS; 
 WORK STOPPAGES; 
 ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES (INCLUDING
 INFLATION); 
 ADVERSE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; 
 WARS, FEARS OF WAR, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS AND
 ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES; 
 ADVERSE FLUCTUATIONS OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES;
 AND 
 POLITICAL UNREST. 
 WE CANNOT
PREDICT WHEN, OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE
MANUFACTURED WILL EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE ABOVE EVENTS. ANY EVENT CAUSING A
DISRUPTION OR DELAY OF IMPORTS FROM FOREIGN LOCATIONS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE
COST OR REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF MERCHANDISE AVAILABLE TO US AND WOULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY IF IMPORTS OF OUR CABELA S BRANDED
MERCHANDISE WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS OUR MARGINS ARE HIGHER ON OUR CABELA S
BRANDED MERCHANDISE. 
 18 

IN
ADDITION, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED TARIFFS OR QUOTAS, EMBARGOES,
SAFEGUARDS, AND CUSTOMS RESTRICTIONS AGAINST APPAREL ITEMS, AS WELL AS UNITED
STATES OR FOREIGN LABOR STRIKES, WORK STOPPAGES, OR BOYCOTTS COULD INCREASE THE
COST OR REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF MERCHANDISE AVAILABLE TO US OR MAY REQUIRE US TO
MODIFY OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HURT OUR
PROFITABILITY. 
 DUE TO THE SEASONALITY OF
OUR BUSINESS, OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR
REVENUE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTATIONS.
 
 WE
EXPERIENCE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS.
HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE REALIZED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS
FOR THE YEAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN 2008, WE GENERATED 34.5 OF OUR REVENUE,
AND 64.7 OF OUR NET INCOME, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT
ADDITIONAL EXPENSES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DUE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER PURCHASE
VOLUMES AND INCREASED STAFFING. IF WE MISCALCULATE THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS
GENERALLY OR FOR OUR PRODUCT MIX DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, OUR REVENUE COULD
DECLINE, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, ABNORMALLY
WARM WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER CAN REDUCE SALES OF MANY OF
THE PRODUCTS NORMALLY SOLD DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AND INCLEMENT WEATHER CAN
REDUCE STORE TRAFFIC OR CAUSE US TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE STORES CAUSING A REDUCTION
IN REVENUE. BECAUSE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OPERATING INCOME IS DERIVED
FROM OUR FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE, A SHORTFALL IN EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE
WOULD CAUSE OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS TO SUFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. 
 IF WE LOSE KEY MANAGEMENT OR
ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE TALENT REQUIRED FOR OUR BUSINESS, OUR
OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER. 
 OUR
FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ON THE SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, AND
EFFORTS OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND MERCHANDISING TEAMS. WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF OUR CHAIRMAN, RICHARD N. CABELA, AND OUR VICE CHAIRMAN, JAMES W.
CABELA, NONE OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR DIRECTORS HAS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
OTHER THAN OUR MANAGEMENT CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS. WE DO NOT
CARRY KEY-MAN LIFE INSURANCE ON ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVES OR KEY MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN A SPARSELY
POPULATED RURAL AREA WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED
INDIVIDUALS FOR KEY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF
THESE INDIVIDUALS OR THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS
FOR OUR KEY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO
SUFFER. 
 OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR
ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO, OUR RETAIL STORE
EXPANSION STRATEGY MAY BE DELAYED AND OUR REVENUE GROWTH MAY SUFFER.
 
 OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON HIRING, TRAINING, MANAGING, AND RETAINING QUALITY MANAGERS,
SALES ASSOCIATES, AND EMPLOYEES IN OUR RETAIL STORES AND CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS.
OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, RETURN CENTER, AND SOME OF OUR
RETAIL STORES ARE LOCATED IN SPARSELY POPULATED RURAL AREAS. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT
TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL
PERSONNEL, IN THESE AREAS. COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL
EMPLOYEES COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY HIGHER WAGES OR GRANT ABOVE MARKET LEVELS OF
STOCK COMPENSATION TO ATTRACT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE UNABLE
TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AS NEEDED, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR
RETAIL STORE EXPANSION STRATEGY MAY BE DELAYED AND OUR REVENUE GROWTH MAY
SUFFER. 
 19 

OUR
HISTORIC SALES TAX COLLECTION POLICY FOR OUR DIRECT BUSINESS MAY SUBJECT US TO
LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID SALES TAXES ON PAST DIRECT BUSINESS SALES.
 
 MANY
STATES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REQUIRE THAT OUT-OF-STATE DIRECT MARKETERS, WHOSE ONLY
CONTACTS WITH THE STATE ARE SOLICITATIONS AND DELIVERY TO THEIR RESIDENTS OF
PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE MAIL OR THE INTERNET, COLLECT SALES TAXES ON THE
SALE OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, A PRIVATE LITIGANT, PURPORTEDLY ON BEHALF
OF VARIOUS STATES, HAS INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST SEVERAL OUT-OF-STATE DIRECT
MARKETERS ALLEGING THAT THE FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REMIT SALES TAX VIOLATES
VARIOUS STATE FALSE CLAIMS LAWS. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT STATES,
ABSENT CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION, MAY NOT IMPOSE TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS ON
OUT-OF-STATE DIRECT MARKETERS UNLESS THE OUT-OF-STATE DIRECT MARKETER HAS NEXUS
WITH THE STATE. NEXUS GENERALLY IS CREATED BY THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE
DIRECT MARKETER, ITS AGENTS, OR ITS PROPERTY WITHIN THE STATE. OUR SALES TAX
COLLECTION POLICY FOR OUR DIRECT BUSINESS IS TO COLLECT AND REMIT SALES TAX IN
STATES WHERE OUR DIRECT BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED NEXUS. PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF
A RETAIL STORE, WE HISTORICALLY SOUGHT A PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE STATE IN
WHICH THE STORE WOULD BE LOCATED AS TO WHETHER OUR DIRECT BUSINESS WOULD HAVE
NEXUS WITH THAT STATE AS A RESULT OF THE STORE OPENING. SOME STATES HAVE ENACTED
LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES SALES TAX COLLECTION BY DIRECT MARKETERS WITH NO
PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THAT STATE. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE LEGISLATION ASSUMES
NEXUS EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF AN AFFILIATED ENTITY ENGAGED IN
THE SAME LINE OF BUSINESS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE RECEIVED AN
ASSESSMENT FOR UNPAID SALES TAXES ON PRIOR DIRECT BUSINESS SALES FROM A STATE
WITH SUCH LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY RECEIVE FUTURE
ASSESSMENTS FROM OTHER STATES FOR UNPAID SALES TAXES ON PRIOR DIRECT BUSINESS
SALES. WE PRESENTLY INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY CONTEST THE ASSESSMENT AND ANY FUTURE
SALES TAX ASSESSMENTS, BUT WE MAY NOT PREVAIL. IF WE DO NOT PREVAIL WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ASSESSMENT, WE COULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR SALES TAXES ON PRIOR DIRECT
BUSINESS SALES, WHICH COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. 
 
 WE
MUST SUCCESSFULLY ORDER AND MANAGE OUR INVENTORY TO REFLECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND
ANTICIPATE CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BUYING TRENDS OR OUR REVENUE AND
PROFITABILITY WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR INVENTORY AND TO
ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO MERCHANDISE TRENDS AND CUSTOMER DEMANDS IN A TIMELY
MANNER. WE CANNOT PREDICT CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH CERTAINTY AND THEY MAY
CHANGE OVER TIME. WE USUALLY MUST ORDER MERCHANDISE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE
APPLICABLE SELLING SEASON. THE EXTENDED LEAD TIMES FOR MANY OF OUR PURCHASES MAY
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO RESPOND RAPIDLY TO NEW OR CHANGING PRODUCT TRENDS OR
CHANGES IN PRICES. IF WE MISJUDGE EITHER THE MARKET FOR OUR MERCHANDISE OR OUR
CUSTOMERS' PURCHASING HABITS, OUR REVENUE MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE MAY
NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF MERCHANDISE TO SATISFY CUSTOMER DEMAND OR WE
MAY BE REQUIRED TO MARK DOWN EXCESS INVENTORY, EITHER OF WHICH WOULD RESULT IN
LOWER PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR RETAIL STORE EXPANSION
STRATEGY, WE WILL NEED TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR EXPAND
THE SIZE OF OUR EXISTING DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING NUMBER OF
RETAIL STORES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR NEW DISTRIBUTION
CENTERS OR TO TIMELY INTEGRATE NEW OR EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS INTO OUR
INVENTORY CONTROL PROCESS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER INVENTORY TO OUR RETAIL
STORES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REVENUE AND
CASH FLOWS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESS. 
 A
NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER DISRUPTION AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR RETURN
FACILITY COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MERCHANDISE AND BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER
TO OUR DIRECT CUSTOMERS AND RETAIL STORES. 
 WE
CURRENTLY RELY ON DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN SIDNEY, NEBRASKA; PRAIRIE DU CHIEN,
WISCONSIN; AND WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA, TO HANDLE OUR DISTRIBUTION NEEDS. WE
OPERATE A RETURN CENTER IN OSHKOSH, NEBRASKA; AND OUR WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA,
DISTRIBUTION CENTER ALSO PROCESSES RETURNS. ANY NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER
SERIOUS DISRUPTION TO THESE CENTERS DUE TO FIRE, TORNADO, OR ANY OTHER CALAMITY
COULD DAMAGE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY AND MATERIALLY IMPAIR OUR
ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY STOCK OUR RETAIL STORES, DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO CUSTOMERS,
AND PROCESS RETURNS TO VENDORS AND COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, INCREASED
COSTS, AND REDUCED PROFITS. 
 20 

OUR
FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR NEGOTIATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES WITH LOCAL AND
STATE GOVERNMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER OUR RETAIL STORE
STRATEGY OR FORMAT AND/OR DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR RETAIL
STORES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE, CASH FLOWS, AND
PROFITABILITY. 
 WE HAVE
RECEIVED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES FROM MANY OF THE LOCAL AND STATE
GOVERNMENTS WHERE OUR RETAIL STORES ARE LOCATED. IN SOME LOCATIONS, WE HAVE
EXPERIENCED AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT AND CITIZEN RESISTANCE AND
CRITICAL REVIEW OF PENDING AND EXISTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES. THIS
RESISTANCE AND CRITICAL REVIEW MAY CAUSE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN
FUTURE LOCATIONS TO DENY OR LIMIT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES THAT MIGHT
OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO US. THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN SIMILAR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PACKAGES IN THE FUTURE FOR ANY OF THESE REASONS COULD CAUSE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY
ALTER OUR RETAIL STORE STRATEGY OR FORMAT. AS A RESULT, WE COULD BE FORCED TO
INVEST LESS CAPITAL IN OUR STORES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT THE STORES AS ATTRACTIVE TOURIST AND ENTERTAINMENT SHOPPING
DESTINATIONS, POSSIBLY LEADING TO A DECREASE IN REVENUE OR REVENUE GROWTH. IN
ADDITION, THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN SIMILAR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES FOR STORES
BUILT IN THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND ON THE
RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THESE STORES. 
 THE
FAILURE OF PROPERTIES TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXES TO AMORTIZE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT BONDS OWNED BY US THAT RELATE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PROPERTIES
WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 WE OFTEN
PURCHASE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BONDS ISSUED BY STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RETAIL STORES. THE PROCEEDS
OF THESE BONDS ARE THEN USED TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPPING OF NEW
RETAIL STORES AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE REPAYMENTS OF
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THESE BONDS ARE TYPICALLY TIED TO SALES, PROPERTY, OR
LODGING TAXES GENERATED FROM THE RELATED RETAIL STORE AND, IN SOME CASES, FROM
OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE SURROUNDING AREA, OVER PERIODS WHICH RANGE BETWEEN 20
AND 30 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE THE BONDS
IS NOT OTHERWISE LIABLE FOR REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS TO
THE EXTENT THAT THE ASSOCIATED TAXES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THE BONDS. AT THE
TIME WE PURCHASE THESE BONDS, WE MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH
FLOW STREAMS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE IN THE FORM OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL
PAYMENTS. BECAUSE THESE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON FUTURE PROPERTY OR
SALES TAX COLLECTIONS AT OUR RETAIL STORES AND OTHER FACILITIES (WHICH IN MANY
CASES MAY NOT BE OPERATING AT THE TIME WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATES), THESE ESTIMATES
ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE AND THE PROBABILITY OF ULTIMATE REALIZATION IS HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN. IF SUFFICIENT TAX REVENUE IS NOT GENERATED BY THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES,
WE WILL NOT RECEIVE THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED PAYMENTS DUE UNDER THE
BONDS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY.
 
 OUR
FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF CURRENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
COULD RESULT IN OUR REPAYMENT OF GRANT MONEY OR OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT
WOULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 THE
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF OUR CURRENT STORES HAVE, IN SOME INSTANCES, CONTAINED FORFEITURE
PROVISIONS AND OTHER REMEDIES IN THE EVENT WE DO NOT FULLY COMPLY WITH THE TERMS
OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS. AMONG THE TERMS WHICH COULD TRIGGER
THESE REMEDIES ARE THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE LEVELS,
FAILURE TO TIMELY OPEN AND OPERATE A RETAIL STORE, AND FAILURE TO DEVELOP
PROPERTY ADJACENT TO A RETAIL STORE. AT THE END OF 2008, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF
GRANT FUNDING SUBJECT TO REPAYMENT PURSUANT TO A SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL REMEDY WAS
APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION. OTHER REMEDIES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN SOME
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS ARE LOSS OF PRIORITY TO TAX PAYMENTS SUPPORTING
THE REPAYMENT OF BONDS HELD BY US. WHERE SPECIFIC REMEDIES ARE NOT SET FORTH,
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE ENTITLED TO PURSUE GENERAL CONTRACT REMEDIES. A
DEFAULT BY US UNDER THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 21 

WE MAY
INCUR COSTS FROM LITIGATION OR INCREASED REGULATION RELATING TO PRODUCTS THAT WE
SELL, PARTICULARLY TREE STANDS AND FIREARMS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. 
 WE MAY
INCUR DAMAGES DUE TO LAWSUITS RELATING TO PRODUCTS WE SELL. WE ARE CURRENTLY A
DEFENDANT IN CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INCLUDING LAWSUITS RELATING TO
TREE STANDS. WE MAY INCUR LOSSES DUE TO LAWSUITS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CLASS
ACTIONS, RELATING TO OUR PERFORMANCE OF BACKGROUND CHECKS ON FIREARMS PURCHASES
AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER SALES LAWS AS MANDATED BY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. WE
MAY ALSO INCUR LOSSES FROM LAWSUITS RELATING TO THE IMPROPER USE OF FIREARMS OR
AMMUNITION SOLD BY US, INCLUDING LAWSUITS BY MUNICIPALITIES OR OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER COSTS FROM MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS OF
FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY
OUR VENDORS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS THEY SELL TO US MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER
CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL. IN ADDITION, CLAIMS OR
LAWSUITS RELATED TO PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE FOR
PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, COULD RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF THESE PRODUCTS FROM
OUR PRODUCT LINE REDUCING REVENUE. IF ONE OR MORE SUCCESSFUL CLAIMS AGAINST US
ARE NOT COVERED BY OR EXCEED OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, OR IF INSURANCE COVERAGE IS
NO LONGER AVAILABLE, OUR AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL MAY BE IMPAIRED AND OUR
OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EVEN UNSUCCESSFUL CLAIMS COULD
RESULT IN THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS AND MANAGEMENT TIME AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND ON FUTURE PREMIUMS WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY
ON OUR INSURANCE POLICIES. 
 CURRENT AND FUTURE GOVERNMENT REGULATION MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR
OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. 
 FEDERAL,
STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND THE DEMAND FOR
PRODUCTS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDE: 
 
 FTC
 REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH ORDERS MAY BE SOLICITED AND
 PRESCRIBING OTHER OBLIGATIONS IN FULFILLING ORDERS AND CONSUMMATING
 SALES; 
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE
 SALE, IN CERTAIN STATES AND LOCALITIES, OF CERTAIN ITEMS WE OFFER SUCH AS
 FIREARMS, BLACK POWDER FIREARMS, AMMUNITION, BOWS, KNIVES, AND SIMILAR
 PRODUCTS; 
 THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND
 EXPLOSIVES GOVERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SELL FIREARMS AND
 AMMUNITION; 
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING HUNTING AND
 FISHING; 
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE COLLECTING
 AND SHARING OF NON-PUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION; AND 
 UNITED STATES CUSTOMS LAWS AND REGULATIONS
 PERTAINING TO PROPER ITEM CLASSIFICATION, QUOTAS, PAYMENT OF DUTIES AND
 TARIFFS, AND MAINTENANCE OF DOCUMENTATION AND INTERNAL CONTROL PROGRAMS WHICH
 RELATE TO IMPORTING TAXIDERMY WHICH WE DISPLAY IN OUR RETAIL STORES.
 
 CHANGES
IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR ADDITIONAL REGULATION COULD CAUSE THE DEMAND
FOR AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO DECREASE. MOREOVER, COMPLYING WITH INCREASED OR
CHANGED REGULATIONS COULD CAUSE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO INCREASE. THIS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. 
 OUR
INABILITY OR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 OUR
TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS, DOMAIN NAMES, AND
OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE VALUABLE ASSETS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. EFFECTIVE TRADEMARK AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION MAY NOT
BE AVAILABLE IN EVERY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE. THE
UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION OR OTHER MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR BRANDS OR GOODWILL AND CAUSE A DECLINE IN OUR
REVENUE. ANY INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM MADE AGAINST US,
WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS MERIT, COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY
LITIGATION, CAUSE PRODUCT DELAYS, OR REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO ROYALTY OR
LICENSING AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH CLAIM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT
ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 22 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS 
 WE MAY
EXPERIENCE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING OR VARIATION IN FUNDING COSTS FOR
OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH COULD LIMIT GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS AND
DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH TO OPERATE.
THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL INCREASE IF OUR CREDIT CARD ORIGINATIONS INCREASE
OR IF OUR CARDHOLDERS' BALANCES OR SPENDING INCREASE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE
RELIED UPON EXTERNAL FINANCING SOURCES TO FUND THESE OPERATIONS, AND WE INTEND
TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS EXTERNAL SOURCES TO FUND OUR GROWTH. A NUMBER OF FACTORS
SUCH AS OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, CHANGES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION, DISRUPTIONS IN
THE CAPITAL MARKETS, INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, OUR CORPORATE
AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS, POSSIBLE NEGATIVE CREDIT RATINGS AFFECTING OUR ASSET-BACKED
SECURITIES, AND ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY CHANGES AND RELATIONS COULD MAKE SUCH
FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN OR MORE EXPENSIVE. 
 WE HAVE
BEEN PARTICULARLY RELIANT ON FUNDING FROM SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS FOR OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. SECURITIZATION FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE BOTH
COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT FACILITIES AND FIXED AND FLOATING RATE TERM
SECURITIZATIONS. A FAILURE TO RENEW THESE FACILITIES, TO RESECURITIZE THE TERM
SECURITIZATIONS AS THEY MATURE, OR TO ADD ADDITIONAL TERM SECURITIZATIONS AND
COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS ON FAVORABLE TERMS AS IT BECOMES NECESSARY COULD
INCREASE OUR FINANCING COSTS AND POTENTIALLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. 
 FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO SECURITIZE OUR CREDIT CARD LOANS
CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE, POOR PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZED LOANS,
INCLUDING INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES, LOWER PAYMENT RATES, OR A
DECREASE IN EXCESS SPREADS BELOW CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, COULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE
OR WITHDRAWAL OF THE RATINGS ON THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES ISSUED IN OUR
SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, CAUSE EARLIER THAN EXPECTED REPAYMENT OF THESE
SECURITIES, OR RESULT IN HIGHER REQUIRED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT LEVELS. THIS COULD
JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS ON
ACCEPTABLE TERMS, DECREASE OUR LIQUIDITY, AND FORCE US TO RELY ON OTHER
POTENTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FUNDING SOURCES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE, WHICH WOULD
DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY. IF AN EARLIER THAN EXPECTED REPAYMENT OF THE NOTES
OCCURS, WE MAY SUSTAIN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON OUR RETAINED INTERESTS AND OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS MAY NEED TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. IN
ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RETAIN ALL NEW RECEIVABLES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE HIGHER ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES, INCREASE REGULATORY
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS. 
 WE MAY
HAVE TO REALLOCATE CAPITAL FROM OUR RETAIL AND DIRECT BUSINESSES TO MEET THE
CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH COULD ALTER OUR RETAIL
STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM. 
 OUR BANK
SUBSIDIARY MUST SATISFY THE CAPITAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENT
REGULATORS AND ITS AGREEMENT WITH VISA U.S.A., INC. VISA ). A VARIETY OF
FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY TO EXCEED
OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CAPITAL INTERNALLY OR FROM THIRD PARTY SOURCES. FOR
EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENT REGULATORS OR VISA COULD UNILATERALLY INCREASE THEIR MINIMUM
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. ALSO, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE
FORM OF THE UNUSED CREDIT LINES OF OUR CARDHOLDERS. AT THE END OF 2008, THESE
UNFUNDED AMOUNTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 13 BILLION. DRAWS ON THESE LINES OF
CREDIT COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED PREDICTED LINE USAGE. IN ADDITION, THE OCCURRENCE
OF CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT DEFAULTS IN PAYMENT OF SECURITIZED LOANS
OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF SECURITIZATION COVENANTS, MAY CAUSE
PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN
SCHEDULED OR BE RECLASSIFIED AS A LIABILITY FOR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES,
BOTH OF WHICH WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE CAPITAL
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY, AS AFFECTED OFF-BALANCE SHEET
LOANS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND WOULD
BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IF ANY OF THESE FACTORS OCCUR, WE
MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE CAPITAL TO OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO
RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL AND/OR DIVERT CAPITAL FROM OUR RETAIL
AND DIRECT BUSINESSES, WHICH IN TURN COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER OUR RETAIL STORE
EXPANSION STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, OUR EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT LIMITS THE AMOUNT
OF CAPITAL WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY TO 25 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL
YEAR OR 75 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE. IN DECEMBER 2008, WE MADE A 25 MILLION
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY THROUGH A CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING
PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT. 
 23 

THE
VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS AS WELL AS
DOWNGRADES OF THE RATINGS ON THE OUTSTANDING NOTES ISSUED BY OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS' SECURITIZATION TRUST MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO
ACCESS FINANCING. 
 WHILE WE
INTEND TO FINANCE OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES AND OPERATIONS WITH EXISTING CASH, CASH
FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY, WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES
AND OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE EXISTING UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL AND
CREDIT MARKETS, OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE
TO US OR AT ALL. FURTHER, THE ABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS TO
ENGAGE IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL COULD BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FURTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR OTHER
EVENTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS TO LOSE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF CAPITAL. 
 IN
ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 19, 2009, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD
DOWNGRADED THE RATINGS ON 21 CLASSES OF ASSET-BACKED NOTES ISSUED BY THE TRUST
OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. DOWNGRADES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE
ABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS TO COMPLETE OTHER SECURITIZATION
TRANSACTIONS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL AND FORCE OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES
BUSINESS TO RELY ON OTHER POTENTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FUNDING SOURCES, TO THE
EXTENT AVAILABLE, WHICH WOULD DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
THIS DOWNGRADE WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS TO COMPLETE OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS ON ACCEPTABLE
TERMS OR TO ACCESS FINANCING. 
 WITH THE
CURRENT DISRUPTIONS AND WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES
BUSINESS, LIKE MANY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS INCREASED ITS FUNDING FROM
CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS. OUR CURRENT FUNDING STRATEGY INCLUDES A CONTINUED
RELIANCE ON CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT TO FUND GROWTH AND MATURING SECURITIZATIONS.
WITH THE INCREASE IN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RELYING ON THE DEPOSITS MARKET
FOR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSITS MARKET MAY INCREASE
RESULTING IN LESS FUNDS AVAILABLE OR FUNDS AT UNATTRACTIVE RATES. IN ADDITION TO
THE NON-BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT MARKET TO FUND GROWTH AND MATURING
SECURITIZATIONS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT MARKET
THROUGH MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING PURPOSES. OUR
ABILITY TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT IS RELIANT ON OUR CURRENT REGULATORY
CAPITAL LEVELS. IF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY WERE TO BE CLASSIFIED AS AN ADEQUATELY
CAPITALIZED BANK, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC IN
ORDER TO CONTINUE TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS. 
 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD REQUIRE US TO
CONSOLIDATE PREVIOUS AND FUTURE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD
MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAUSE US TO REALLOCATE
CAPITAL FROM OUR RETAIL AND DIRECT BUSINESSES TO MEET THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. 
 ON
SEPTEMBER 15, 2008, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD FASB ISSUED TWO
EXPOSURE DRAFTS PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FAS 140, ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES AND
FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46R, CONSOLIDATION OF
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES . CURRENTLY, THE
TRANSFERS OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY S CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IN SECURITIZATION
TRANSACTIONS QUALIFY FOR SALE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. THE TRUSTS USED IN OUR BANK
SUBSIDIARY S SECURITIZATIONS ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED WITH US FOR FINANCIAL
REPORTING PURPOSES BECAUSE THE TRUSTS ARE QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES QSPE ). BECAUSE THE TRANSFERS QUALIFY AS SALES AND THE TRUSTS ARE NOT SUBJECT
TO CONSOLIDATION, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE TRUSTS ARE NOT REPORTED ON
OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QSPE, MODIFY THE
CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, AND REQUIRE CONTINUAL
REASSESSMENT OF CONSOLIDATION CONCLUSIONS. AS PROPOSED, THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD
BE EFFECTIVE FOR US AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE PROPOSED
AMENDMENTS, IF ADOPTED, COULD REQUIRE US TO CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY S SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. THIS COULD CAUSE US
TO BREACH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND UNSECURED
NOTES. THIS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
ABILITY TO MEET THE CAPITAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY, AS
AFFECTED OFF-BALANCE SHEET LOANS WOULD BE RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE
SHEET AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. 
 24 

IT MAY
BE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN THE HISTORICAL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS, AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AS WE ATTEMPT TO GROW
THE BUSINESS. 
 WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN EXISTING CARDHOLDERS, GROW ACCOUNT BALANCES, OR ATTRACT
NEW CARDHOLDERS AND THE PROFITS FROM OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS COULD
DECLINE, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL,
INCLUDING: 
 
 CREDIT RISK
 RELATED TO THE LOANS WE MAKE TO CARDHOLDERS AND THE CHARGE-OFF LEVELS OF OUR
 CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS; 
 INABILITY OF CARDHOLDERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO US
 DUE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LIMITED ACCESS TO OTHER CREDIT
 SOURCES; 
 INABILITY TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK AND KEEP CREDIT
 MODELS UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT CONSUMER CREDIT TRENDS; 
 LACK OF GROWTH OF POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS
 GENERATED BY OUR RETAIL AND DIRECT BUSINESSES; 
 LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK RELATING TO OUR ABILITY
 TO CREATE THE LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CARDHOLDERS AND
 PROVIDE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENT
 REGULATORS AND VISA; AND 
 OPERATIONAL RISK RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE
 THE NECESSARY OPERATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE, MANAGE EXPENSES
 AS WE EXPAND, AND RECRUIT MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WITH THE
 EXPERIENCE TO RUN AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND HIGHLY-REGULATED BUSINESS.
 
 ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND SOCIAL AND OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR CREDIT
CARD CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES TO INCREASE, OR CREDIT CARD BALANCES TO
DECREASE, WHICH WOULD DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 ECONOMIC
DOWNTURNS LEAD TO HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND GENERALLY LEAD TO INCREASED
CHARGE-OFFS AND CREDIT LOSSES IN THE CONSUMER FINANCE INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD
CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES IN OUR CREDIT
CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CAN HURT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS
CARDHOLDERS DEFAULT ON THEIR BALANCES OR CARRY LOWER BALANCES. A VARIETY OF
SOCIAL AND OTHER FACTORS ALSO MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN CREDIT CARD USE, PAYMENT
PATTERNS, AND THE RATE OF DEFAULTS BY CARDHOLDERS. THESE SOCIAL FACTORS INCLUDE
CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS, THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF THE USE OF
CREDIT CARDS, CHANGING ATTITUDES ABOUT INCURRING DEBT, AND THE STIGMA OF
PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY. ADDITIONALLY, CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS TEND TO EXHIBIT A RISING
TREND IN CREDIT LOSS AND DELINQUENCY RATES BETWEEN 18 TO 30 MONTHS AFTER THEY
ARE ISSUED. IF THE RATE OF GROWTH IN NEW ACCOUNT GENERATION SLOWS, THE
PROPORTION OF ACCOUNTS IN THE PORTFOLIO THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR BETWEEN 18 TO 30
MONTHS WILL INCREASE AND THE PERCENTAGE OF CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES MAY
INCREASE. OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND PRODUCT DESIGN MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO
PROTECT THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS DURING A
SUSTAINED PERIOD OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR RECESSION OR A MATERIAL SHIFT IN SOCIAL
ATTITUDES, AND MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE
FACTORS. 
 THE
PERFORMANCE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE
PERFORMANCE OF OUR MERCHANDISING BUSINESSES. 
 NEGATIVE
DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR RETAIL AND DIRECT BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
GROW OR MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO
MAINTAIN CARDHOLDERS AND ATTRACT NEW CARDHOLDERS IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH
CUSTOMER LOYALTY TO OUR MERCHANDISING BUSINESSES AND TO THE STRENGTH OF THE
CABELA'S BRAND. IN ADDITION, TRANSACTIONS ON CARDHOLDER ACCOUNTS PRODUCE LOYALTY
POINTS WHICH THE CARDHOLDER MAY APPLY TO FUTURE PURCHASES FROM US. ADVERSE
CHANGES IN THE DESIRABILITY OF PRODUCTS WE SELL, NEGATIVE TRENDS IN RETAIL
CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION, OR THE TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF THE
LOYALTY PROGRAM COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BANK SUBSIDIARY S ABILITY TO
GROW ITS ACCOUNT BASE AND TO ATTRACT DESIRABLE CO-BRANDING OPPORTUNITIES WITH
THIRD PARTIES. 
 OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES
BUSINESS FACES THE RISK OF A COMPLEX AND CHANGING REGULATORY AND LEGAL
ENVIRONMENT. 
 OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS OPERATES IN A HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND IS
THEREFORE SUBJECT TO A WIDE ARRAY OF BANKING AND CONSUMER LENDING LAWS AND
REGULATIONS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN
FINANCIAL, STRUCTURAL, AND OPERATIONAL PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED. IN ADDITION, AS
A VISA MEMBER BANK, OUR BANK MUST COMPLY WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY
VISA. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BANK AND CABELA S COULD BE FINED BY VISA FOR FAILING TO
COMPLY WITH VISA S DATA SECURITY STANDARDS. 
 25 

EFFECTIVE
JULY 1, 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD S AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION AA (UNFAIR
OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES) AND REGULATION Z (TRUTH IN LENDING) WILL PLACE
NEW LIMITATIONS ON CREDIT CARD ISSUERS. THIS INCLUDES NEW RULES REGARDING
INCREASING INTEREST RATES, ALLOCATIONS OF PAYMENTS, REASONABLE TIME TO MAKE
PAYMENTS, AND CHANGES TO DEFAULT PRICING. IN ADDITION, THESE AMENDMENTS WILL
INCREASE DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS AS WELL AS INCREASE NOTICE PERIODS FOR CHANGES
IN TERMS AND INTEREST RATES. THE AMENDMENTS WILL RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE
CREDIT RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT EARNINGS. WE ARE
EVALUATING THESE AMENDMENTS AND LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MITIGATE THEIR POTENTIAL
IMPACT AND REDUCE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS TO EARNINGS. 
 CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES
COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS. 
 IN
CONNECTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WE BORROW MONEY FROM
INSTITUTIONS AND ACCEPT FUNDS BY ISSUING BROKERED AND NON-BROKERED CERTIFICATES
OF DEPOSIT, WHICH WE THEN LEND TO CARDHOLDERS. WE EARN INTEREST ON THE
CARDHOLDERS' ACCOUNT BALANCES, AND PAY INTEREST ON THE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
AND BORROWINGS WE USE TO FUND THOSE LOANS. CHANGES IN THESE TWO INTEREST RATES
AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES
BUSINESS. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE (OR MORE
RAPIDLY) THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME,
AND THEREFORE OUR EARNINGS, COULD FALL. OUR EARNINGS COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED IF THE RATES ON OUR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT BALANCES FALL MORE QUICKLY THAN
THOSE ON OUR BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, AT THE END OF 2008, APPROXIMATELY 30.7 OF
OUR CARDHOLDERS DID NOT MAINTAIN BALANCES ON THEIR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. WE DO
NOT EARN ANY INTEREST FROM THESE ACCOUNTS BUT DO EARN OTHER FEES FROM THESE
ACCOUNTS SUCH AS VISA INTERCHANGE FEES. 
 IN THE EVENT INTEREST RATES RISE, THE SPREAD
BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS AND THE FEES WE EARN FROM
THESE ACCOUNTS MAY CHANGE AND OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. 
 
CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY LITIGATION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE
GENERATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. 
 OUR
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS FACES POSSIBLE RISK FROM THE OUTCOMES OF CERTAIN
CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY LITIGATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A NUMBER OF ENTITIES, EACH
PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF RETAIL MERCHANTS, HAVE SUED VISA AND SEVERAL
MEMBER BANKS, AND OTHER CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATIONS, ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THAT VISA AND ITS MEMBER BANKS HAVE VIOLATED U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS BY CONSPIRING
TO FIX THE LEVEL OF INTERCHANGE FEES. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED AS A
DEFENDANT IN ANY CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY LAWSUITS. IF THE INTERCHANGE FEES THAT ARE
CHARGED TO MERCHANTS ARE REDUCED AS A RESULT OF THE INTERCHANGE LAWSUITS OR IF
THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OTHER CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY
LITIGATION, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR FINANCIAL
SERVICES BUSINESS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 
 FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF
OUR INTERESTS IN OUR SECURITIZATIONS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. 
 IN
CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIZATIONS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS,
WE RETAIN CERTAIN INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITIZATION. THESE
INTERESTS ARE CARRIED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INCLUDE OUR
"TRANSFEROR S INTEREST" IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS; AN "INTEREST-ONLY STRIP,"
WHICH REPRESENTS OUR RIGHT TO RECEIVE EXCESS CASH AVAILABLE AFTER REPAYMENT OF
ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO THE INVESTORS; SERVICING RIGHTS; AND IN SOME CASES CASH
RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHICH MAY BE SUBORDINATE TO THE
INVESTORS NOTES. THE VALUE OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS DEPENDS UPON INCOME
EARNED ON THESE INTERESTS WHICH IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS NOT WITHIN OUR
CONTROL, INCLUDING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SECURITIZED LOANS, INTEREST PAID TO
THE HOLDERS OF SECURITIZATION SECURITIES, CREDIT LOSSES, AND TRANSACTION
EXPENSES. THE VALUE OF OUR INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZATIONS WILL VARY OVER TIME
AS THE AMOUNT OF LOANS IN THE SECURITIZED POOL AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE
LOANS FLUCTUATE. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LOANS INCLUDED IN OUR SECURITIZATIONS IS
SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT AFFECT THE LOANS THAT WE HAVE
NOT SECURITIZED, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT
LOSSES, ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND SOCIAL FACTORS, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS,
CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND REGULATIONS, COMPETITION, EXPENSES,
DEPENDENCE UPON THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, FLUCTUATIONS IN ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNT
BALANCES, AND INDUSTRY RISKS. THE EARNINGS OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS MAY ALSO BE
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF CERTAIN SECURITIZATIONS WERE REDUCED OR NOT RENEWED.

RISK
RELATED TO OUR COMPANY 

OUR
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. 

WE
INCURRED A NET LOSS OF 9,153,310 AND 2,977,889 FOR THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE OF OUR
CONTINUED OPERATING LOSSES, NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT, IN THEIR REPORT ON OUR FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS INCLUDED AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH REGARDING THEIR SUBSTANTIAL
DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE NET OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FORESEEABLE
FUTURE. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE A PROFIT AND/OR OBTAIN NECESSARY FUNDING
FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES, INCLUDING OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES, INCREASING SALES OR OBTAINING LOAN
FROM VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHERE POSSIBLE. OUR CONTINUED NET OPERATING LOSSES INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY IN MEETING SUCH
GOALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT SUCH METHODS WILL PROVE SUCCESSFUL.

THERE ARE 30 STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT HAVE LAWS AND/OR REGULATION THAT RECOGNIZE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL USES FOR CANNABIS AND CONSUMER USE OF CANNABIS IN CONNECTION WITH MEDICAL TREATMENT. MANY OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING
SIMILAR LEGISLATION. CONVERSELY, UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT (THE CSA ), THE POLICY AND REGULATIONS OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES IS THAT CANNABIS HAS NO MEDICAL BENEFIT AND A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING CULTIVATION AND
USE OF CANNABIS FOR PERSONAL USE IS PROHIBITED. UNTIL CONGRESS AMENDS THE CSA WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA, THERE IS A RISK
THAT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES MAY ENFORCE CURRENT FEDERAL LAW, AND WE MAY BE DEEMED TO BE FACILITATING THE SELLING OR DISTRIBUTION
OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATORY POSITION ON CANNABIS MAY
THUS INDIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND PROFITS OF THE COMPANY. THE RISK OF STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE CSA IN LIGHT OF
CONGRESSIONAL ACTIVITY, JUDICIAL HOLDINGS AND STATED FEDERAL POLICY REMAINS UNCERTAIN. 

FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT FOCUSED THEIR RESOURCES ON SUCH TANGENTIAL OR SECONDARY VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT, NOR HAVE THEY THREATENED TO
DO SO, WITH RESPECT TO THE LEASING OF REAL PROPERTY OR THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT THAT MIGHT BE USED BY MEDICAL CANNABIS GARDENERS,
OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUPPLIES MARKETED TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE EMERGING MEDICAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNAWARE OF SUCH A BROAD
APPLICATION OF THE CSA BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN ATTEMPTED APPLICATION WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED. 

THE
COMPANY MAY PROVIDE SERVICES TO AND POTENTIALLY HANDLE MONIES FOR BUSINESSES IN THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. 

SELLING
OR DISTRIBUTING MEDICAL OR RETAIL CANNABIS IS DEEMED TO BE ILLEGAL UNDER THE FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT EVEN THOUGH SUCH
ACTIVITIES MAY BE PERMISSIBLE UNDER STATE LAW. A RISK EXISTS THAT OUR LENDING AND SERVICES COULD BE DEEMED TO BE FACILITATING
THE SELLING OR DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, OR TO CONSTITUTE AIDING OR ABETTING,
OR BEING AN ACCESSORY TO, A VIOLATION OF THAT ACT. SUCH A FINDING, CLAIM, OR ACCUSATION WOULD LIKELY SEVERELY LIMIT THE COMPANY S
ABILITY TO CONTINUE WITH ITS OPERATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN OUR INVESTORS LOSING ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY. 

THE
LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY FACES AN UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT ON STATE, FEDERAL, AND LOCAL LEVELS. 

ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE MOST RECENT LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING
THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY, THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE COULD SHIFT IN A MANNER NOT CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED
BY THE COMPANY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE WE THINK THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE FOR COMPLIANCE-RELATED SERVICES, BROADER STATE AND FEDERAL
LEGALIZATION COULD RENDER THE COMPLIANCE LANDSCAPE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TECHNICAL, WHICH WOULD RENDER OUR SUITE OF COMPLIANCE SERVICES
LESS VALUABLE AND MARKETABLE. LENDING MONEY TO LEGAL CANNABIS PARTICIPANTS COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CHALLENGE IF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT OR ANOTHER JURISDICTION DECIDES TO MORE ACTIVELY ENFORCE APPLICABLE LAWS. THESE UNKNOWN LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS COULD DIRECTLY
AND INDIRECTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

PROFIT
SHARING, DISTRIBUTIONS, AND EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES AND GROWING OPERATIONS ARE NOT PERMISSIBLE.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN LEGAL CANNABIS DISPENSARIES OR
GROWING OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA OR ELSEWHERE. WE BELIEVE SUCH OWNERSHIP IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. INVESTORS SHOULD
BE AWARE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE. IF THE APPLICABLE LAWS
MAKE IT SO THAT THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OWN INTERESTS IN LEGAL CANNABIS DISPENSARIES IN GROWING OPERATIONS EVER, THE COMPANY
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN ITS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS, AND THUS, THIS WOULD DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS. 

WE
DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS FOR A RELIABLE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE FAILURE OF THESE THIRD PARTIES, OR THE INTERNET
IN GENERAL, FOR ANY REASON WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
OUTSOURCE ALL OF OUR DATA CENTER FACILITY MANAGEMENT TO THIRD PARTIES WHO HOST THE ACTUAL SERVERS AND PROVIDE POWER AND SECURITY
IN MULTIPLE DATA CENTERS IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. THESE THIRD PARTY FACILITIES REQUIRE UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.
IF THE OPERATION OF OUR SERVERS IS INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTER, FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY OF A THIRD PARTY
PROVIDER, OR MALICIOUS ELECTRONIC INTRUSION INTO THE DATA CENTER, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED. IF EITHER A THIRD
PARTY FACILITY FAILED, OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE INTERNET WAS INTERFERED WITH BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF INTERNET EQUIPMENT
IN GENERAL OR WE BECOME SUBJECT TO MALICIOUS ATTACKS OF COMPUTER INTRUDERS, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

12 

THE
GATHERING, TRANSMISSION, STORAGE AND SHARING OR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD GIVE RISE TO LIABILITIES OR ADDITIONAL COSTS
OF OPERATION AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, CIVIL ACTIONS OR DIFFERING VIEWS OF PERSONAL PRIVACY
RIGHTS. 

WE
TRANSMIT AND PLAN TO STORE A LARGE VOLUME OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE COURSE OF PROVIDING OUR SERVICES. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS
AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION, USE, RETENTION, SHARING AND SECURITY OF DATA THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR
USERS. ANY FAILURE, OR PERCEIVED FAILURE, BY US TO COMPLY WITH U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE PRIVACY OR CONSUMER PROTECTION-RELATED LAWS,
REGULATIONS OR INDUSTRY SELF-REGULATORY PRINCIPLES COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS OR ACTIONS AGAINST US BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES
OR OTHERS, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY,
WE MAY ALSO BE CONTRACTUALLY LIABLE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS OUR CUSTOMERS FROM THE COSTS OR CONSEQUENCES OF INADVERTENT
OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS PERSONAL DATA WHICH WE STORE OR HANDLE AS PART OF PROVIDING OUR SERVICES. 

THE
INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND DATA RETENTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNSETTLED PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO LOCATION-BASED SERVICES, USE OF CUSTOMER DATA TO TARGET ADVERTISEMENTS AND COMMUNICATION WITH CONSUMERS VIA MOBILE
DEVICES. SUCH LAWS MAY BE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED INCONSISTENTLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND INCONSISTENTLY WITH OUR CURRENT DATA
PROTECTION POLICIES AND PRACTICES. COMPLYING WITH THESE VARYING INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL
COSTS OR REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN A MANNER ADVERSE TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

AS
PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION HAVE BECOME MORE SENSITIVE ISSUES, WE MAY ALSO BECOME EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AS A RESULT
OF DIFFERING VIEWS ON THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THESE AND OTHER PRIVACY CONCERNS, INCLUDING SECURITY BREACHES, COULD
ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

IN
THE U.S., WE HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO COMPLY WITH WIRELESS CARRIER TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO THEIR
CUSTOMERS MOBILE DEVICES, AND ALSO TRADE ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES AND CODES OF CONDUCT ADDRESSING THE PROVISION OF LOCATION-BASED
SERVICES, DELIVERY OF PROMOTIONAL CONTENT TO MOBILE DEVICES AND TRACKING OF USERS OR DEVICES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELIVERING TARGETED
ADVERTISING. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO THESE REQUIREMENTS, GUIDELINES AND CODES, INCLUDING IN WAYS THAT ARE
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PRACTICES OR IN CONFLICT WITH THE RULES OR GUIDELINES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. 

WE
HAVE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH COULD, IF NOT REMEDIATED, RESULT IN
MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 

OUR
MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS DEFINED
IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT ). A MATERIAL WEAKNESS
IS DEFINED AS A DEFICIENCY, OR COMBINATION OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, SUCH THAT THERE IS A
REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF OUR ANNUAL OR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED
ON A TIMELY BASIS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017, MANAGEMENT IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 9A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. AS A RESULT OF THESE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES,
OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS NOT EFFECTIVE BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE
COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATION OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN INTERNAL CONTROL-AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. WE ARE PLANNING TO
ENGAGE IN DEVELOPING A REMEDIATION PLAN DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. IF OUR REMEDIAL MEASURES ARE INSUFFICIENT
TO ADDRESS THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, OR IF ADDITIONAL MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL ARE
DISCOVERED OR OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED
TO RESTATE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR ACCOUNTING AND LEGAL FEES AND SHAREHOLDER
LITIGATION. 

WE
MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS. 

WE
MONITOR OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR FUNDS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND FUTURE OPERATING REQUIREMENTS,
WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH CORPORATE FINANCE TRANSACTIONS OR CURTAIL OUR GROWTH AND REDUCE OUR LIABILITIES.
ANY EQUITY, HYBRID OR DEBT FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE AT ALL, MAY BE ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE
CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

RISKS
RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK 

ALTHOUGH
THERE IS PRESENTLY A MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND INVESTORS MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THEIR PURCHASE PRICE, OR AT ALL. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE MARKET MAY BE POTENTIALLY HIGHLY
VOLATILE AND MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE OF: 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FUTURE
 BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS; 

CHANGES IN OR FAILURE TO MEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS; 

FLUCTUATIONS IN STOCK MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME 

OUR
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, B. MICHAEL FRIEDMAN, HOLDS SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK WHICH WILL PROVIDE HIM CONTINUING VOTING CONTROL
OVER THE COMPANY AND, AS A RESULT, HE WILL EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER CORPORATE DECISIONS. 

B.
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN, OUR PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND SOLE DIRECTOR OWNS 100 OF CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK (THE SERIES
B PREFERRED STOCK ). PURSUANT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION, THE SERIES B P REF E R RED
 S TOCK HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN AGGREGATE, ON ALL SHAREHOLDER MATTERS EQUAL TO 51 
OF THE TOTAL VOTE, NO MATTER HOW MANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY ARE ISSUED OR OUTSTANDING IN
THE FUTURE. THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK HAS A RIGHT TO VOTE ON ALL MATTERS PRESENTED OR SUBMITTED TO THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS
FOR APPROVAL IN PARI PASSU WITH THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, AND NOT AS A SEPARATE CLASS. THE HOLDERS OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK
HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAST VOTES FOR EACH SHARE OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK HELD OF RECORD ON ALL MATTERS SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO CUMULATIVE VOTING IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. THE HOLDERS
OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK VOTE TOGETHER WITH ALL OTHER CLASSES AND SERIES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY AS A SINGLE CLASS ON
ALL ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT VOTING AS A SEPARATE CLASS OR SERIES IS REQUIRED
BY LAW. 

AS
A RESULT OF THE ABOVE, MR. FRIEDMAN EXERCISES CONTROL IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING
THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS, MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, THE SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS, AND ALSO THE POWER TO
PREVENT OR CAUSE A CHANGE IN CONTROL. ANY INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE SHARES WILL BE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS AND AS SUCH WILL HAVE NO
SAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY AND THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT EVEN IF YOU
OWN SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND WISH TO VOTE THEM AT ANNUAL OR SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS, YOUR SHARES WILL HAVE
NO EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF CORPORATE DECISIONS OR THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. FURTHERMORE, INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT MR.
FRIEDMAN MAY CHOOSE TO ELECT NEW DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY AND/OR TAKE THE COMPANY IN A NEW BUSINESS
DIRECTION ALTOGETHER, AND, AS A RESULT, CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY WILL HAVE LITTLE TO NO SAY IN SUCH MATTERS. 

AS
A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES. 

THE
U.S. SECURITIES LAWS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REVIEW, AUDIT, AND PUBLIC REPORTING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,
AND OTHER MATTERS. RECENT SEC REGULATION, INCLUDING REGULATION ENACTED AS A RESULT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, HAS ALSO
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, AND OTHER COSTS RELATED TO BECOMING AND REMAINING AN SEC REPORTING COMPANY. IF
WE DO NOT HAVE CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY AVAILABLE TO MARKET MAKERS, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRADE OUR STOCK. THE
PUBLIC COMPANY COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION WITH THE SEC AND FURNISHING AUDITED
REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS, WILL CAUSE OUR EXPENSES TO BE HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD BE IF WE WERE PRIVATELY-HELD. THESE INCREASED COSTS
MAY BE MATERIAL AND MAY INCLUDE THE HIRING OF ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES AND/OR THE RETENTION OF ADDITIONAL ADVISORS AND PROFESSIONALS.
OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS COULD RESULT IN PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US AND/OR
OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, WHICH COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCES, THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK, AND THE
ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO RESELL THEIR STOCK. 

FINRA
SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. 

FINRA 
HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT RELATE TO THE APPLICATION OF THE SEC S PENNY STOCK RULES IN TRADING OUR SECURITIES AND REQUIRE THAT
A BROKER/DEALER HAVE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR THAT CUSTOMER, PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING
THE INVESTMENT. PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING SPECULATIVE, LOW PRICED SECURITIES TO THEIR NON-INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, BROKER/DEALERS
MUST MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMER S FINANCIAL STATUS, TAX STATUS, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
AND OTHER INFORMATION. UNDER INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE RULES, FINRA BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT SPECULATIVE,
LOW PRICED SECURITIES WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR AT LEAST SOME CUSTOMERS. THE FINRA REQUIREMENTS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BROKER/DEALERS
TO RECOMMEND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BUY OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY AND
LIQUIDITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, MANY BROKERS CHARGE HIGHER TRANSACTIONAL FEES FOR PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT,
FEWER BROKER/DEALERS MAY BE WILLING TO MAKE A MARKET IN OUR COMMON STOCK, REDUCING A SHAREHOLDER S ABILITY TO RESELL SHARES
OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

14 

THE
COMPANY S COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY DEEMED TO BE PENNY STOCK , WHICH MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS
TO SELL THEIR SHARES . 

THE
COMPANY S COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES ADOPTED UNDER SECTION 15(G) OF THE EXCHANGE
ACT. THE PENNY STOCK RULES APPLY TO COMPANIES WHOSE COMMON STOCK IS NOT LISTED ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET OR OTHER NATIONAL SECURITIES
EXCHANGE AND TRADES AT LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE OR THAT HAVE TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF LESS THAN 5,000,000 2,000,000 IF THE COMPANY
HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS). THESE RULES REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT BROKERS WHO TRADE PENNY STOCK TO PERSONS
OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS COMPLETE CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION, MAKE SUITABILITY INQUIRIES OF INVESTORS AND PROVIDE
INVESTORS WITH CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING TRADING IN THE SECURITY, INCLUDING A RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND QUOTE INFORMATION
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. MANY BROKERS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TRADE PENNY STOCKS BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENNY STOCK
RULES AND, AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF BROKER-DEALERS WILLING TO ACT AS MARKET MAKERS IN SUCH SECURITIES IS LIMITED. IF THE COMPANY
REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET, IF ANY, FOR
THE COMPANY S SECURITIES. IF THE COMPANY S SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES, INVESTORS WILL FIND IT
MORE DIFFICULT TO DISPOSE OF THE COMPANY S SECURITIES. 

WE
HAVE RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE USE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

BECAUSE
OF THE SIZE OF OUR COMPANY AND ITS STATUS AS A PENNY STOCK AS WELL AS THE CURRENT ECONOMY AND DIFFICULTIES IN COMPANIES
OUR SIZE FINDING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF FUNDING, WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND
OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CARRY FAVORABLE CONVERSION TERMS TO THEIR HOLDERS OF UP TO 42 DISCOUNTS TO THE
MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON CONVERSION AND IN SOME CASES PROVIDE FOR THE IMMEDIATE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES INTO THE OPEN
MARKET. ACCORDINGLY, THIS HAS CAUSED DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN 2017 AND MAY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2017, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 979,443 IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND POTENTIAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT OUTSTANDING. THIS CONVERTIBLE DEBT BALANCE
AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT WE INCUR IN THE FUTURE WILL CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

BECAUSE
WE ARE QUOTED ON THE OTCQB INSTEAD OF AN EXCHANGE OR NATIONAL QUOTATION SYSTEM, OUR INVESTORS MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME SELLING
THEIR STOCK OR EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE VOLATILITY ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQB. THE OTCQB IS OFTEN HIGHLY ILLIQUID, IN PART BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE A NATIONAL QUOTATION
SYSTEM BY WHICH POTENTIAL INVESTORS CAN FOLLOW THE MARKET PRICE OF SHARES EXCEPT THROUGH INFORMATION RECEIVED AND GENERATED BY
A LIMITED NUMBER OF BROKER-DEALERS THAT MAKE MARKETS IN PARTICULAR STOCKS. THERE IS A GREATER CHANCE OF VOLATILITY FOR SECURITIES
THAT ARE QUOTED ON THE OTCQB AS COMPARED TO A NATIONAL EXCHANGE OR QUOTATION SYSTEM. THIS VOLATILITY MAY BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY
OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE PRICE QUOTATIONS, THE ABSENCE OF CONSISTENT ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISION OF
BID AND ASK QUOTATIONS, LOWER TRADING VOLUME, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. INVESTORS IN OUR COMMON STOCK MAY EXPERIENCE HIGH FLUCTUATIONS
IN THE MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME OF THE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES. THESE FLUCTUATIONS, WHEN THEY OCCUR, HAVE A NEGATIVE
EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE A FAIR PRICE FROM THEIR
SHARES WHEN THEY DETERMINE TO SELL THEM OR MAY HAVE TO HOLD THEM FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON
STOCK IMPROVES. 

WE
DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. 

WE
DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO LEGALLY
PAY DIVIDENDS. EVEN IF FUNDS ARE LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, WE MAY NEVERTHELESS DECIDE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION NOT TO
PAY DIVIDENDS. THE DECLARATION, PAYMENT AND AMOUNT OF ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE MADE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
AND WILL DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING AND CAPITAL
REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY CONSIDER RELEVANT. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PAY ANY DIVIDENDS
IN THE FUTURE, AND, IF DIVIDENDS ARE PAID, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH DIVIDEND. 

OUR
OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF PROFITS WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR SHARE PRICE. YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR
COMMON SHARES AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU. THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON
SHARES IS PARTICULARLY VOLATILE GIVEN OUR STATUS AS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMPANY WITH A SMALL AND THINLY TRADED PUBLIC FLOAT. 

15 

THE
MARKET FOR OUR COMMON SHARES IS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY WHEN COMPARED TO SEASONED ISSUERS, AND WE EXPECT
THAT OUR SHARE PRICE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MORE VOLATILE THAN A SEASONED ISSUER FOR THE INDEFINITE FUTURE. THE VOLATILITY IN OUR
SHARE PRICE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS. FIRST, OUR COMMON SHARES ARE SPORADICALLY AND THINLY TRADED. AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF THIS LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THE TRADING OF RELATIVELY SMALL QUANTITIES OF SHARES BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY DISPROPORTIONATELY INFLUENCE
THE PRICE OF THOSE SHARES IN EITHER DIRECTION. THE PRICE FOR OUR SHARES COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY IN THE EVENT
THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR COMMON SHARES ARE SOLD ON THE MARKET WITHOUT COMMENSURATE DEMAND, AS COMPARED TO A SEASONED ISSUER
WHICH COULD BETTER ABSORB THOSE SALES WITHOUT ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS SHARE PRICE. SECONDLY, WE ARE A SPECULATIVE OR RISKY 
INVESTMENT DUE TO OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF PROFITS TO DATE, AND UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR
POTENTIAL PRODUCTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ENHANCED RISK, MORE RISK-ADVERSE INVESTORS MAY, UNDER THE FEAR OF LOSING ALL OR MOST
OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF NEGATIVE NEWS OR LACK OF PROGRESS, BE MORE INCLINED TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE MARKET MORE
QUICKLY AND AT GREATER DISCOUNTS THAN WOULD BE THE CASE WITH THE STOCK OF A SEASONED ISSUER. MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE BEYOND
OUR CONTROL AND MAY DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES, REGARDLESS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE CANNOT MAKE ANY
PREDICTIONS OR PROJECTIONS AS TO WHAT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES WILL BE AT ANY TIME, INCLUDING AS TO WHETHER
OUR COMMON SHARES WILL SUSTAIN THEIR CURRENT MARKET PRICES, OR AS TO WHAT EFFECT THAT THE SALE OF SHARES OR THE AVAILABILITY OF
COMMON SHARES FOR SALE AT ANY TIME WILL HAVE ON THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE. 

SHAREHOLDERS
SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ACCORDING TO SEC RELEASE NO. 34-29093, THE MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS FROM PATTERNS
OF FRAUD AND ABUSE. SUCH PATTERNS INCLUDE (1) CONTROL OF THE MARKET FOR THE SECURITY BY ONE OR A FEW BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE OFTEN
RELATED TO THE PROMOTER OR ISSUER; (2) MANIPULATION OF PRICES THROUGH PREARRANGED MATCHING OF PURCHASES AND SALES AND FALSE AND
MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES; (3) BOILER ROOM PRACTICES INVOLVING HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND UNREALISTIC PRICE PROJECTIONS BY
INEXPERIENCED SALES PERSONS; (4) EXCESSIVE AND UNDISCLOSED BID-ASK DIFFERENTIAL AND MARKUPS BY SELLING BROKER-DEALERS; AND (5)
THE WHOLESALE DUMPING OF THE SAME SECURITIES BY PROMOTERS AND BROKER-DEALERS AFTER PRICES HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED TO A DESIRED LEVEL,
ALONG WITH THE RESULTING INEVITABLE COLLAPSE OF THOSE PRICES AND WITH CONSEQUENT INVESTOR LOSSES. OUR MANAGEMENT IS AWARE OF THE
ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HISTORICALLY IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION TO DICTATE THE
BEHAVIOR OF THE MARKET OR OF BROKER-DEALERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET, MANAGEMENT WILL STRIVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PRACTICAL
LIMITATIONS TO PREVENT THE DESCRIBED PATTERNS FROM BEING ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO OUR SECURITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE PATTERNS
OR PRACTICES COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE. 

FEDERAL
REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MARIJUANA LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR
REVENUES AND PROFITS . 

CURRENTLY,
THERE ARE THIRTY STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT HAVE LAWS AND/OR REGULATION THAT RECOGNIZE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL USES FOR CANNABIS AND CONSUMER USE OF CANNABIS IN CONNECTION WITH MEDICAL TREATMENT. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO STATES THAT
HAVE LAWS AND/OR REGULATION THAT PERMITS CONSUMER USE OF CANNABIS FOR COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. MANY OTHER STATES
ARE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION TO SIMILAR EFFECT. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS WRITING, THE POLICY AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
AND ITS AGENCIES IS THAT CANNABIS HAS NO MEDICAL BENEFIT AND A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING CULTIVATION AND USE OF CANNABIS FOR
PERSONAL USE IS PROHIBITED ON THE BASIS OF FEDERAL LAW AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE PERMITTED ON THE BASIS OF STATE LAW. ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT
OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATORY POSITION ON CANNABIS ON A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL BASIS MAY DIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS
OF CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO INVEST IN OR LEASE PROPERTIES FROM THE COMPANY THAT MAY BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH CANNABIS. ACTIVE
ENFORCEMENT OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATORY POSITION ON CANNABIS MAY THUS INDIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND PROFITS
OF THE COMPANY. 

WE
MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO PROPERTIES THAT WE ACQUIRE FOR WHICH WE MAY HAVE
LIMITED OR NO RECOURSE. 

ASSETS
AND ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED OR MAY ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR WHICH
WE MAY HAVE LIMITED OR NO RECOURSE AGAINST THE SELLERS. UNKNOWN OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES MIGHT INCLUDE LIABILITIES FOR OR WITH
RESPECT TO LIENS ATTACHED TO PROPERTIES, UNPAID REAL ESTATE TAX, OR UTILITIES CHARGES FOR WHICH A SUBSEQUENT OWNER REMAINS LIABLE,
CLEAN-UP OR REMEDIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR CODE VIOLATIONS, CLAIMS OF CUSTOMERS, VENDORS OR OTHER PERSONS DEALING
WITH THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES AND TAX LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. 

16 

OUR
REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE NOT DIRECTLY CORRELATED, AND BECAUSE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE FIXED, WE MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO ADAPT OUR COST STRUCTURE TO OFFSET DECLINES IN OUR REVENUE. 

MOST
OF THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS ACQUISITION COSTS, RENOVATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS, REAL ESTATE TAXES,
PERSONAL AND AD VALOREM TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, EMPLOYEE WAGES AND BENEFITS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE FIXED
AND DO NOT NECESSARILY DECREASE WITH A REDUCTION IN REVENUE FROM OUR BUSINESS. OUR EXPENSES AND ONGOING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL
ALSO BE AFFECTED BY INFLATIONARY INCREASES AND CERTAIN OF OUR COST INCREASES MAY EXCEED THE RATE OF INFLATION IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.
BY CONTRAST, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR RENTAL INCOME WILL BE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY
OF ALTERNATIVE RENTAL PROPERTIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR TARGET MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET
RISING COSTS AND CAPITAL SPENDING BY HIGHER LEASE RATES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN,
EVEN IF THE COST OF MAINTENANCE IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR ANY POTENTIAL BENEFIT FROM LEASING THE PROPERTY. 

OUR
FUTURE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF PROPERTIES GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND ANY ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN LOCAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS, THE DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN THESE MARKETS OR NATURAL DISASTERS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

OUR
FUTURE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF PROPERTIES GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED IN COLORADO. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOCAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS, OTHER REGULATIONS, THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES AND NATURAL DISASTERS IN THESE AREAS.
IF THERE IS A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY, AN OVERSUPPLY OF OR DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THESE MARKETS
OR NATURAL DISASTERS IN THESE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN
IF WE OWNED A REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO THAT WAS MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFIED. 

WE
MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER UNINSURABLE, NOT ECONOMICALLY INSURABLE OR THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE.

OUR
PROPERTIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR ACCIDENTS WHICH MAY OCCUR
ON OUR PROPERTIES. OUR INSURANCE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL DAMAGES OR LOSSES FROM THESE EVENTS, OR IT MAY NOT BE ECONOMICALLY
PRUDENT TO PURCHASE INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF LOSSES. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN THE EVENT
OF ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND NATURAL DISASTERS OR EVENTS WHICH RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL OR PERSONAL LIABILITY. WE MAY NOT
CARRY OR MAY DISCONTINUE CERTAIN TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE ON SOME OR ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE IF THE COST OF PREMIUMS
FOR ANY OF THESE POLICIES IN OUR JUDGMENT EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE COVERAGE DISCOUNTED FOR THE RISK OF LOSS. IF WE EXPERIENCE
LOSSES THAT ARE UNINSURED OR EXCEED POLICY LIMITS, WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNINSURED COSTS OR LIABILITIES, LOSE THE CAPITAL
INVESTED IN THE PROPERTIES, AND LOSE THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, OUR ENVIRONMENTAL OR
PERSONAL LIABILITY MAY RESULT IN LOSSES SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF THE VALUE OF THE RELATED PROPERTY. 

COMPLIANCE
WITH NEW OR EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND COVENANTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO OUR FUTURE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING PERMIT, LICENSE AND
ZONING REQUIREMENTS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR RENOVATIONS, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS
OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. 

OUR
FUTURE PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS COVENANTS AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PERMITTING AND LICENSING
REQUIREMENTS. LOCAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING MUNICIPAL OR LOCAL ORDINANCES, ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IMPOSED
BY COMMUNITY DEVELOPERS MAY RESTRICT OUR USE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND MAY REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS OR COMMUNITY
STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS AT ANY TIME WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROPERTIES, INCLUDING PRIOR TO ACQUIRING A PROPERTY OR WHEN UNDERTAKING
RENOVATIONS OF ANY OF OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT EXISTING REGULATORY POLICIES WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT
US OR THE TIMING OR COST OF ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR RENOVATIONS, OR THAT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE ADOPTED THAT WOULD
INCREASE SUCH DELAYS OR RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN PERMITS, LICENSES AND ZONING APPROVALS ON A TIMELY BASIS
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

POOR
TENANT SELECTION AND DEFAULTS BY RENTERS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REPUTATION. 

17 

OUR
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN LARGE PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TENANTS FOR OUR PROPERTIES. THIS WILL DEPEND,
IN TURN, UPON OUR ABILITY TO SCREEN APPLICANTS, IDENTIFY GOOD TENANTS AND AVOID TENANTS WHO MAY DEFAULT. WE WILL INEVITABLY MAKE
MISTAKES IN OUR SELECTION OF TENANTS, AND WE MAY RENT TO TENANTS WHOSE DEFAULT ON OUR LEASES OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS
OF THE LEASE NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, REPUTATION AND THE QUALITY AND VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES. FOR EXAMPLE,
TENANTS MAY DEFAULT ON PAYMENT OF RENT, MAKE UNREASONABLE AND REPEATED DEMANDS FOR SERVICE OR IMPROVEMENTS, MAKE UNSUPPORTED OR
UNJUSTIFIED COMPLAINTS TO REGULATORY OR POLITICAL AUTHORITIES, MAKE USE OF OUR PROPERTIES FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES, DAMAGE OR MAKE
UNAUTHORIZED STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO OUR PROPERTIES WHICH MAY NOT BE FULLY COVERED BY SECURITY DEPOSITS, REFUSE TO LEAVE THE PROPERTY
WHEN THE LEASE IS TERMINATED, ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE OR SIMILAR DISTURBANCES, DISTURB NEARBY RESIDENTS WITH NOISE, TRASH, ODORS OR
EYESORES, FAIL TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS, SUBLET TO LESS DESIRABLE INDIVIDUALS IN VIOLATION OF OUR LEASES, OR PERMIT UNAUTHORIZED
PERSONS TO LIVE THEREIN. THE PROCESS OF EVICTING A DEFAULTING RENTER FROM A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CAN BE ADVERSARIAL, PROTRACTED
AND COSTLY. FURTHERMORE, SOME TENANTS FACING EVICTION MAY DAMAGE OR DESTROY THE PROPERTY. DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTIES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY
DELAY RE-LEASING AFTER EVICTION, NECESSITATE EXPENSIVE REPAIRS OR IMPAIR THE RENTAL INCOME OR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY, RESULTING
IN A LOWER THAN EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN. IN ADDITION, WE WILL INCUR TURNOVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RE-LEASING THE PROPERTIES SUCH
AS MARKETING AND BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND WILL NOT COLLECT REVENUE WHILE THE PROPERTY SITS VACANT. ALTHOUGH WE WILL ATTEMPT TO
WORK WITH TENANTS TO PREVENT SUCH DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ALL OR MOST CASES.
SUCH TENANTS WILL NOT ONLY CAUSE US NOT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES FOR THE PROPERTIES, BUT MAY SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY,
AND MAY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR OTHER TENANTS AND IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE DO BUSINESS. 

DECLINING
REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

OUR
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE RENTAL PROPERTIES AT ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS, SUCH THAT WE CAN EARN A SATISFACTORY
RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT PRIMARILY THROUGH RENTAL INCOME AND SECONDARILY THROUGH INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. IF
WE OVERPAY FOR PROPERTIES OR IF THEIR VALUE SUBSEQUENTLY DROPS OR FAILS TO RISE BECAUSE OF MARKET FACTORS, WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE
OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. 

WE
WILL PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR VALUE, BASED ON MARKET FACTORS, PROJECTED INCOME
AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, HAS PERMANENTLY DECREASED SUCH THAT IT IS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO TAKE AN IMPAIRMENT
LOSS IN THE RELEVANT ACCOUNTING PERIOD. SUCH A LOSS WOULD CAUSE AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION OF NET INCOME IN THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING
PERIOD AND WOULD BE REFLECTED IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE SHEET ASSETS. THE REDUCTION OF NET INCOME FROM AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS COULD
LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN OUR DIVIDENDS, BOTH IN THE RELEVANT ACCOUNTING PERIOD AND IN FUTURE PERIODS. EVEN IF WE DO NOT DETERMINE
THAT IT IS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, A REDUCTION IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A PROPERTY WOULD BECOME
MANIFEST OVER TIME THROUGH REDUCED INCOME FROM THE PROPERTY AND WOULD THEREFORE AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

INCREASING
REAL ESTATE TAXES, FEES AND INSURANCE COSTS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

THE
COST OF REAL ESTATE TAXES AND INSURING OUR PROPERTIES IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR EXPENSES. REAL ESTATE TAXES, FEES AND
INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES, WHICH CAN BE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. IF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL
ESTATE TAXES, FEES AND ASSESSMENTS OR INSURANCE SHOULD RISE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE RENTS TO OFFSET SUCH INCREASES,
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 

WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH, WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, AND OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE
PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY, WHICH WILL DEMAND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND ATTENTION AND MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THIS GROWTH, WHICH IS DEPENDENT, IN PART,
UPON THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO: 

STABILIZE AND MANAGE A RAPIDLY INCREASING
 NUMBER OF PROPERTIES AND TENANT RELATIONSHIPS WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BUILDING AND ENHANCING
 OUR BRAND; 

IDENTIFY AND SUPERVISE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF
 SUITABLE THIRD PARTIES ON WHICH WE RELY ON TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES TO OUR PROPERTIES; 

CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL
 CONTROLS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS; AND, 

SCALE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND
 OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS TO ADEQUATELY SERVICE NEW PROPERTIES. 

WE
CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS OR THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY.
ANY FAILURE TO DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SHOULD
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL
RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

THE
 LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, A DATA CENTER OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OR
 INTERRUPTION TO OUR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE COULD MATERIALLY HARM
 OUR REVENUE AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR
 OPERATIONS. 

BECAUSE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE REQUIRE
 COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO QUERY A COPY OF OUR
 CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED DATABASES AND DIRECTORIES TO OBTAIN
 NECESSARY ROUTING AND OTHER ESSENTIAL OPERATIONAL DATA, THE
 INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA CENTERS, INCLUDING NETWORK ELEMENTS
 MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND THE SYSTEMS
 THROUGH WHICH WE DELIVER OUR SERVICES IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR
 BUSINESS. NOTABLY, OUR DATA CENTERS AND RELATED SYSTEMS ARE
 ESSENTIAL TO THE ORDERLY OPERATION OF THE
 U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ENABLE CSPS TO
 ENSURE THAT TELEPHONE CALLS ARE ROUTED TO THE APPROPRIATE
 DESTINATIONS.

OUR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IS INTEGRAL TO OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS A
 HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER.
 MOREOVER, BOTH WE AND OUR CUSTOMERS RELY ON HARDWARE, SOFTWARE
 AND OTHER EQUIPMENT DEVELOPED, SUPPORTED AND MAINTAINED BY
 THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS. WE COULD EXPERIENCE FAILURES OR
 INTERRUPTIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS AND SERVICES, OR OTHER PROBLEMS IN
 CONNECTION WITH OUR OPERATIONS, AS A RESULT OF:

DAMAGE TO, OR FAILURE OF, OUR COMPUTER SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE OR
 OUR CONNECTIONS AND OUTSOURCED SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD
 PARTIES;

FAILURE OF, OR DEFECTS IN, THE THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE OR
 EQUIPMENT ON WHICH WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS RELY TO ACCESS OUR DATA
 CENTERS AND OTHER SYSTEMS;

ERRORS IN THE PROCESSING OF DATA BY OUR SYSTEM;

COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SOFTWARE DEFECTS;

PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, SABOTAGE, DISTRIBUTED DENIAL
 OF SERVICE, OR DDOS, ATTACKS, INTENTIONAL ACTS OF VANDALISM AND
 SIMILAR EVENTS;

INCREASED CAPACITY DEMANDS OR CHANGES IN SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS OF
 OUR CUSTOMERS;

POWER LOSS, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 FAILURES; OR

ERRORS BY OUR EMPLOYEES OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT REDUNDANT SYSTEMS OR
 BACK-UP 
 FACILITIES TO ALLOW US TO RECEIVE AND PROCESS DATA IN THE EVENT
 OF ONE OF THE FOREGOING EVENTS. FURTHER, WE HAVE INCREASED THE
 SCOPE OF SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE, WHICH HAS INCREASED THE
 COMPLEXITY OF OUR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. AS THE SCOPE OF
 SERVICES WE PROVIDE EXPANDS OR CHANGES IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE
 REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO ESTABLISH NEW DATA
 CENTERS FROM WHICH WE MAY PROVIDE SERVICES. MOREOVER, AS WE ADD
 CUSTOMERS, EXPAND OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND INCREASE OUR
 VISIBILITY IN THE

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

MARKET, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BECOME A TARGET OF PHYSICAL
 OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, SABOTAGE, DDOS ATTACKS, INTENTIONAL
 ACTS OF VANDALISM AND SIMILAR EVENTS INCREASES. IF WE CANNOT
 ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE ABILITY OF OUR DATA CENTERS AND RELATED
 SYSTEMS TO PERFORM CONSISTENTLY AT A HIGH LEVEL AND WITHOUT
 INTERRUPTIONS, OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS 
 EXPECTATIONS:

OUR REPUTATION MAY BE DAMAGED, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN CUSTOMERS FOR OUR EXISTING
 SERVICES, AND MAY ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MARKET
 OUR SERVICES;

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR DAMAGES CLAIMS,
 UNDER OUR CONTRACTS OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO
 PAY SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES RELATED TO SERVICE LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
 IN OUR CONTRACTS;

WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO REPAIR OR
 REPLACE EQUIPMENT, THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS OR, IN SOME CASES, AN
 ENTIRE DATA CENTER, OR TO ESTABLISH NEW DATA CENTERS AND SYSTEMS
 FROM WHICH WE MAY PROVIDE SERVICES;

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MAY INCREASE AS A
 RESULT OF CORRECTIVE EFFORTS THAT WE MUST PERFORM;

OUR CUSTOMERS MAY POSTPONE OR CANCEL SUBSEQUENTLY SCHEDULED WORK
 OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF OUR SERVICES; OR

ONE OR MORE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS MAY BE TERMINATED
 EARLY, OR MAY NOT BE RENEWED.

ANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE,
 PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

SECURITY
 BREACHES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES, INTERRUPTIONS
 OF SERVICE OR REDUCED QUALITY OF SERVICE, WHICH COULD INCREASE
 OUR COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF OUR SERVICES BY
 OUR CUSTOMERS. 

OUR SYSTEMS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO PHYSICAL BREAK-INS, COMPUTER
 VIRUSES, ATTACKS BY COMPUTER HACKERS OR SIMILAR DISRUPTIVE
 PROBLEMS. IF UNAUTHORIZED USERS GAIN ACCESS TO OUR DATABASES,
 THEY MAY BE ABLE TO STEAL, PUBLISH, DELETE OR MODIFY SENSITIVE
 INFORMATION THAT IS STORED OR TRANSMITTED ON OUR NETWORKS AND
 THAT WE ARE REQUIRED BY OUR CONTRACTS AND FCC RULES TO KEEP
 CONFIDENTIAL. SUCH A SECURITY OR PRIVACY BREACH COULD SUBJECT US
 TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES AS WELL AS CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES UNDER OUR
 CONTRACTS. FURTHER, A SECURITY OR PRIVACY BREACH COULD RESULT IN
 AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE OR REDUCED QUALITY OF SERVICE, AND WE
 MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES IN CONNECTION
 WITH CORRECTIVE EFFORTS WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM. IN ADDITION,
 A SECURITY OR PRIVACY BREACH MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE
 OUR CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THEIR USE OF OUR SERVICES, WHICH COULD
 HARM OUR REVENUE AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

OUR
 SEVEN CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT LLC
 REPRESENT IN THE AGGREGATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE,
 ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND COULD BE TERMINATED OR MODIFIED IN WAYS
 UNFAVORABLE TO US, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW THESE CONTRACTS
 AT THE END OF THEIR TERM. 

OUR SEVEN CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT
 LLC, AN INDUSTRY GROUP THAT REPRESENTS ALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE UNITED STATES, TO PROVIDE TELEPHONE
 NUMBER PORTABILITY AND OTHER CLEARINGHOUSE SERVICES ARE NOT
 EXCLUSIVE AND COULD BE TERMINATED OR MODIFIED IN WAYS
 UNFAVORABLE TO US. THESE SEVEN SEPARATE CONTRACTS, EACH OF WHICH
 REPRESENTED BETWEEN 6 AND 14 OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2008,
 REPRESENTED IN THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATELY 68 OF OUR TOTAL
 REVENUE IN 2008. NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT LLC
 COULD, AT ANY TIME, SOLICIT OR RECEIVE PROPOSALS FROM OTHER
 PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO
 OURS. IN ADDITION, THESE CONTRACTS HAVE FINITE TERMS AND ARE
 CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN JUNE 2015. FURTHERMORE, ANY OF
 THESE CONTRACTS COULD BE TERMINATED IN ADVANCE OF ITS SCHEDULED
 EXPIRATION DATE IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, MOST NOTABLY IF WE ARE
 IN DEFAULT OF THESE AGREEMENTS. ALTHOUGH THESE CONTRACTS DO NOT
 CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS LEADING TO A
 DEFAULT BY US UNDER ONE OF OUR CONTRACTS COULD LEAD TO A DEFAULT
 UNDER OTHERS, OR ALL SEVEN.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW THESE CONTRACTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS
 WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED FOR RENEWAL IF WE FAIL TO MEET OUR
 CUSTOMERS EXPECTATIONS, INCLUDING FOR PERFORMANCE OR OTHER
 REASONS, OR IF ANOTHER PROVIDER OFFERS TO PROVIDE THE SAME OR
 SIMILAR SERVICES AT A LOWER COST. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE
 FORCES RESULTING FROM THE POSSIBLE ENTRANCE OF A COMPETITIVE
 PROVIDER COULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT PRICING PRESSURE, WHICH COULD
 THEN CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR SERVICES UNDER
 OUR CONTRACTS. IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE TERMINATED OR MODIFIED IN
 A MANNER THAT IS ADVERSE TO US, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW
 THESE CONTRACTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS UPON THEIR EXPIRATION, IT
 WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS,
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CERTAIN
 OF OUR OTHER CONTRACTS MAY BE TERMINATED OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO
 RENEW THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SERVICES
 WE CAN OFFER AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. 

IN ADDITION TO OUR CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY
 MANAGEMENT LLC, WE RELY ON OTHER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE OTHER
 SERVICES THAT WE OFFER, INCLUDING THE CONTRACTS THAT APPOINT US
 TO SERVE AS THE:

NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING PLAN ADMINISTRATOR, UNDER WHICH WE
 MAINTAIN THE AUTHORITATIVE DATABASE OF TELEPHONE NUMBERING
 RESOURCES IN NORTH AMERICA;

NATIONAL POOLING ADMINISTRATOR, UNDER WHICH WE PERFORM THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND
 MANAGEMENT OF TELEPHONE NUMBER INVENTORY AND ALLOCATION OF
 POOLED BLOCKS OF UNASSIGNED TELEPHONE NUMBERS;

PROVIDER OF NUMBER PORTABILITY SERVICES IN CANADA;

OPERATOR OF THE .US REGISTRY;

OPERATOR OF THE .BIZ REGISTRY; AND

OPERATOR OF THE REGISTRY OF U.S. COMMON SHORT CODES.

EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDES FOR EARLY TERMINATION IN
 LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, MOST NOTABLY IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT. IN
 ADDITION, OUR CONTRACTS TO SERVE AS THE NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING
 PLAN ADMINISTRATOR AND AS THE NATIONAL POOLING ADMINISTRATOR AND
 TO OPERATE THE .US REGISTRY, EACH OF WHICH IS WITH THE
 U.S. GOVERNMENT, MAY BE TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AT
 WILL. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE FCC, THE
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE OR OUR CUSTOMERS, AS THE CASE
 MAY BE, FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING FOR PERFORMANCE-RELATED OR
 OTHER REASONS, OR IF ANOTHER PROVIDER OFFERS TO PERFORM THE SAME
 OR SIMILAR SERVICES FOR A LOWER PRICE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO
 EXTEND OR RENEW THESE CONTRACTS. FURTHER, WITH RESPECT TO THE
 RENEWAL OR EXTENSION OF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WE MAY
 BE SUBJECT TO BID PROTESTS FROM A COMPETITOR, WHICH MAY REQUIRE
 THE DEDICATION OF SUBSTANTIAL COMPANY RESOURCES, AND MAY RESULT
 IN THE LOSS OF THE CONTRACT. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO RENEW OR
 EXTEND ANY OF THESE CONTRACTS, THE NUMBER OF SERVICES WE ARE
 ABLE TO OFFER MAY BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 REVENUE FROM THE PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES. FURTHER, EACH OF
 THE CONTRACTS LISTED ABOVE ESTABLISHES US AS THE SOLE PROVIDER
 OF THE PARTICULAR SERVICES COVERED BY THAT CONTRACT DURING ITS
 TERM. IF ONE OF THESE CONTRACTS WERE TERMINATED, OR IF WE WERE
 UNABLE TO RENEW OR EXTEND THE TERM OF ANY PARTICULAR CONTRACT,
 WE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES COVERED BY
 THAT CONTRACT AND COULD SUFFER A LOSS OF PRESTIGE THAT WOULD
 MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE FOR CONTRACTS TO
 PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES IN THE FUTURE.

FAILURE
 TO COMPLY WITH NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF
 SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS. 

PURSUANT TO ORDERS AND REGULATIONS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
 AND PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN OUR MATERIAL CONTRACTS, WE MUST
 CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS, MEANING
 GENERALLY THAT WE CANNOT FAVOR ANY PARTICULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDER, TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY SEGMENT OR
 TECHNOLOGY OR GROUP OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONSUMERS OVER ANY
 OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER, INDUSTRY SEGMENT,
 TECHNOLOGY OR GROUP OF CONSUMERS IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.
 THE FCC OVERSEES OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS
 APPLICABLE TO US IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THE SERVICES WE
 PROVIDE. WE PROVIDE TO THE FCC AND THE NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING
 COUNCIL, A FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED BY THE FCC TO
 ADVISE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON TELEPHONE NUMBERING ISSUES,
 REGULAR CERTIFICATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE
 REQUIREMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE NEUTRALITY
 REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE
 ACTIVITIES OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF
 THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK SUBJECTS US TO UNDUE
 INFLUENCE BY PARTIES WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF
 NUMBERING ADMINISTRATION, THE FCC COULD DETERMINE THAT WE ARE
 NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR NEUTRALITY OBLIGATIONS. OUR FAILURE
 TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH
 WE ARE SUBJECT UNDER APPLICABLE ORDERS AND REGULATIONS OF THE
 U.S. GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS MAY RESULT IN
 FINES, CORRECTIVE MEASURES OR TERMINATION OF OUR CONTRACTS, ANY
 ONE OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS.

REGULATORY
 AND STATUTORY CHANGES THAT AFFECT US OR THE COMMUNICATIONS
 INDUSTRY IN GENERAL MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

THE FCC HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR
 OPERATIONS, MOST NOTABLY OUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR NEUTRALITY
 REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY BUSINESS RISKS SPECIFIC TO
 THE REGULATED COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. MOREOVER, THE BUSINESS OF
 OUR CUSTOMERS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION THAT INDIRECTLY AFFECTS
 OUR BUSINESS. AS COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE
 COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE STATUTES
 GOVERNING THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY OR THE REGULATORY POLICIES
 OF THE FCC MAY CHANGE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THE DEMAND FOR OUR
 SERVICES COULD CHANGE IN WAYS THAT WE CANNOT PREDICT AND OUR
 REVENUE COULD DECLINE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, MOST NOTABLY THE FCC, TO:

INCREASE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE;

ADOPT OR MODIFY STATUTES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES, PROCEDURES OR
 PROGRAMS THAT ARE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE, OR
 THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE PLANS, OR THAT
 REQUIRE MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS,
 INCLUDING THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CHARGE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR
 SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE,

IN NOVEMBER 2005, BELLSOUTH CORPORATION FILED A PETITION WITH
 THE FCC SEEKING CHANGES IN THE WAY OUR CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED FOR
 SERVICES PROVIDED BY US UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN
 PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT LLC; AND

AFTER THE AMENDMENT OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN
 PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT LLC IN SEPTEMBER 2006, TELCORDIA
 TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FILED A PETITION WITH THE FCC REQUESTING AN
 ORDER THAT WOULD REQUIRE NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT
 LLC TO CONDUCT A NEW BIDDING PROCESS TO APPOINT A PROVIDER OF
 TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES,
 WHICH TELCORDIA HAS CONTINUED TO PURSUE IN RESPONSE TO OUR
 AMENDMENT OF THESE CONTRACTS IN JANUARY 2009. IF SUCCESSFUL,
 THIS PETITION COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR
 CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT LLC OR
 OTHERWISE FRUSTRATE OUR STRATEGIC PLANS;

PROHIBIT US FROM ENTERING INTO NEW CONTRACTS OR EXTENDING
 EXISTING CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNICATIONS
 INDUSTRY BASED ON ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF OUR
 NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS, BUSINESS PERFORMANCE CONCERNS, OR OTHER
 REASONS;

ADOPT OR MODIFY STATUTES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES, PROCEDURES OR
 PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT COULD CAUSE CHANGES TO OUR OPERATIONS OR
 COSTS OR THE OPERATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS;

APPOINT, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO APPOINT, SUBSTITUTE OR ADD
 ADDITIONAL PARTIES TO PERFORM THE SERVICES THAT WE CURRENTLY
 PROVIDE; AND

PROHIBIT OR RESTRICT THE PROVISION OR EXPORT OF NEW OR EXPANDED
 SERVICES UNDER OUR CONTRACTS, OR PREVENT THE INTRODUCTION OF
 OTHER SERVICES NOT UNDER THE CONTRACTS BASED UPON RESTRICTIONS
 WITHIN THE CONTRACTS OR IN FCC POLICIES.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ARISING OUT OF THE
 DELEGATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE S RESPONSIBILITIES
 FOR THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM TO THE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION FOR
 ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS, OR ICANN. CHANGES IN THE REGULATIONS
 OR STATUTES TO WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SUBJECT COULD CAUSE OUR
 CUSTOMERS TO ALTER OR DECREASE THE SERVICES THEY PURCHASE FROM
 US. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN, OR UPON WHAT TERMS AND CONDITIONS,
 FURTHER REGULATION OR DEREGULATION MIGHT OCCUR OR THE EFFECT
 FUTURE REGULATION OR DEREGULATION MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.

IF WE
 DO NOT ADAPT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, WE COULD LOSE
 CUSTOMERS OR MARKET SHARE. 

OUR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND
 FREQUENT NEW SERVICE OFFERINGS. SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL
 CHANGES COULD MAKE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES OBSOLETE. WE MUST
 ADAPT TO OUR RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKET BY CONTINUALLY IMPROVING
 THE FEATURES, FUNCTIONALITY, RELIABILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF
 OUR ADDRESSING, INTEROPERABILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES,
 AND BY DEVELOPING NEW FEATURES, SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS TO
 MEET CHANGING CUSTOMER NEEDS. OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
 OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MARKET MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST IN

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

DEVELOPMENT AND INCUR OTHER EXPENSES WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR
 ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM THESE SERVICES. WE CANNOT
 GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THESE CHALLENGES OR
 RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY OR IN A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY, PARTICULARLY IN
 THE EARLY STAGES OF LAUNCHING A NEW SERVICE. FURTHER, WE MAY
 EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONE OR MORE FEATURES OF
 OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE THE POTENTIAL
 BENEFITS TO US FOR PROVIDING THESE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THERE
 CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR SOLUTIONS WILL BE ADOPTED BY
 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH ACCEPTABLE
 CONTRACT TERMS WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. OUR
 FAILURE TO ADAPT TO MEET MARKET DEMAND IN A COST-EFFECTIVE
 MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND RETAIN
 CUSTOMERS OR MARKET SHARE.

OUR
 CUSTOMERS FACE IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPPORT CHALLENGES IN
 INTRODUCING
 IP-BASED 
 SERVICES, WHICH MAY SLOW THEIR RATE OF ADOPTION OR
 IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS. 

HISTORICALLY, COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN
 RELATIVELY SLOW TO IMPLEMENT NEW, COMPLEX SERVICES SUCH AS
 INSTANT MESSAGING AND OTHER
 IP-BASED 
 COMMUNICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2008, WE WITNESSED SLOWER
 THAN ANTICIPATED DEPLOYMENT OF OUR MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING
 SOLUTIONS BY OUR CARRIER CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE LIMITED OR NO
 CONTROL OVER, AND CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT, THE PACE AT WHICH
 COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS IMPLEMENT THESE NEW
 IP-BASED 
 SERVICES. MOREOVER, THE LAUNCH OF NEW
 IP-BASED 
 SERVICES BY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS REQUIRES
 SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES BY OUR CUSTOMERS TO MARKET AND DRIVE
 ADOPTION BY END USERS. WE CANNOT CONTROL THE DECISION OVER
 WHETHER SUCH EXPENDITURES WILL OCCUR OR THE TIMING OF SUCH
 EXPENDITURES. IN TURN, EVEN IF CSPS ATTEMPT TO DRIVE ADOPTION OF
 NEW IP-BASED 
 SERVICES, OUR FUTURE REVENUE AND PROFITS WILL ALSO DEPEND, IN
 PART, ON THE WIDE ADOPTION OF SUCH SERVICES BY END USERS. FOR
 INSTANCE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO
 SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MARKET AND DRIVE THE
 ADOPTION OF OUR MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICES BY END USERS.
 THE FAILURE OF, OR DELAY BY, COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO
 INTRODUCE AND SUPPORT
 IP-BASED 
 SERVICES UTILIZING OUR SOLUTIONS IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE
 MANNER, OR THE FAILURE BY END USERS TO ADOPT SUCH SERVICES,
 COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND
 OPERATING RESULTS.

THE
 MARKET FOR CERTAIN OF OUR ADDRESSING, INTEROPERABILITY, AND
 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES IS COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN
 FEWER CUSTOMER ORDERS, REDUCED REVENUE OR MARGINS OR LOSS OF
 MARKET SHARE. 

OUR SERVICES FREQUENTLY COMPETE AGAINST THE IN-HOUSE SYSTEMS OF
 OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER, WE COMPETE IN SOME AREAS
 AGAINST COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE COMPANIES, COMMUNICATIONS
 SOFTWARE COMPANIES AND SYSTEM INTEGRATORS THAT PROVIDE SYSTEMS
 AND SERVICES USED BY CSPS TO MANAGE THEIR NETWORKS AND INTERNAL
 OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY,
 INSTANT MESSAGING AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TRANSACTIONS. WE FACE
 COMPETITION FROM LARGE, WELL-FUNDED PROVIDERS OF ADDRESSING,
 INTEROPERABILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES. MOREOVER, WE ARE
 AWARE OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE FOCUSING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES
 ON DEVELOPING AND MARKETING SERVICES THAT WILL COMPETE WITH US.
 WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED GROWTH OF COMPETITION. SOME OF OUR
 CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
 EMPLOYEES AND GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND OTHER
 RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO RESPOND
 MORE QUICKLY TO NEW OR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND CHANGES IN
 CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS THAN WE CAN. ALSO, MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND
 POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER NAME RECOGNITION THAT THEY
 CAN USE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. INCREASED COMPETITION COULD RESULT
 IN FEWER CUSTOMER ORDERS, REDUCED REVENUE, REDUCED MARGINS OR
 LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, ANY OF WHICH WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR
 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES RELATING TO MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING MAY
 BE FRUSTRATED BY THE ACTIONS OF OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS WITH
 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN OURS, AS WELL AS
 THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. 

OUR MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING SOLUTIONS ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE
 SYSTEMS OF OUR CSP CUSTOMERS AND WITH MOBILE DEVICES, AND RELY
 IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEROPERATE WITH LARGE INTERNET
 PORTALS SUCH AS YAHOO! AND MICROSOFT. BECAUSE OUR STRATEGIC
 OBJECTIVES MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR THE
 INTERNET PORTALS, AND BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE INTERNET
 PORTALS MAY NOT AGREE ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MOBILE INSTANT
 MESSAGING SHOULD OPERATE, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY
 MAY BE FRUSTRATED. AS A RESULT, REVENUE FROM OUR INSTANT
 MESSAGING SOLUTIONS MAY NOT GROW AS EXPECTED AND MAY DECLINE. IN
 ADDITION, SOME OF OUR MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING SOLUTIONS RELY ON
 THE USE OF OPEN STANDARDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE OUR
 INSTANT MESSAGING SOLUTIONS WITH SYSTEMS USED BY

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR CUSTOMERS OR DEVICE MANUFACTURERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ADOPT
 OPEN STANDARDS OR OTHERWISE, REVENUE FROM OUR INSTANT MESSAGING
 SOLUTIONS MAY NOT GROW AS EXPECTED AND MAY DECLINE. MOREOVER,
 THE PROLIFERATION OF OPEN STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS COULD MAKE IT
 EASIER FOR NEW MARKET ENTRANTS AND EXISTING COMPETITORS TO
 INTRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH COULD
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IF WE
 WERE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 ADEQUATELY, THE VALUE OF OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS COULD BE
 DIMINISHED. 

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT IN PART ON OBTAINING, MAINTAINING AND
 ENFORCING OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND OUR ABILITY TO AVOID
 INFRINGING ON THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. WHILE WE TAKE
 PRECAUTIONARY STEPS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES AND
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELY IN PART ON PATENT, TRADEMARK,
 TRADE SECRET AND COPYRIGHT LAWS, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE
 PRECAUTIONARY STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN WILL COMPLETELY PROTECT OUR
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. BECAUSE PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE
 UNITED STATES ARE MAINTAINED IN SECRECY UNTIL EITHER THE PATENT
 APPLICATION IS PUBLISHED OR A PATENT IS ISSUED, WE MAY NOT BE
 AWARE OF THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, PATENT APPLICATIONS AND OTHER
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELEVANT TO OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS
 THAT MAY BLOCK OUR USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR MAY BE
 USED BY THIRD-PARTIES WHO COMPETE WITH OUR SERVICES AND
 SOLUTIONS.

AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES AND
 SOLUTIONS, THERE MAY BE AN INCREASED RISK OF INFRINGEMENT AND
 OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES. FROM TIME
 TO TIME, WE AND OUR CUSTOMERS MAY RECEIVE CLAIMS ALLEGING
 INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR MAY BECOME
 AWARE OF CERTAIN THIRD PARTY PATENTS THAT MAY RELATE TO OUR
 SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INSTANT MESSAGING
 SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO CONFORM TO OPEN MOBILE ALLIANCE, OR
 OMA, SPECIFICATIONS AND THOSE OF OTHER STANDARDS BODIES. TO THE
 EXTENT THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OMA OR OTHER STANDARDS BODIES CLAIMS
 THAT IT HAS RETAINED ITS RIGHTS RELATING TO SUCH INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT BY SUCH
 INDIVIDUALS OR ORGANIZATIONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE GREATER
 FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LARGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIOS
 THAN OUR OWN.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THAT WE
 INDEMNIFY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RESULTING FROM
 THEIR USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EMBEDDED IN THEIR
 PRODUCTS. ANY LITIGATION REGARDING PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND COULD DIVERT OUR
 MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE
 COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED, AND THE NUMBER OF PARTIES
 HOLDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE COMMUNICATIONS
 INDUSTRY, INCREASE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY LITIGATION. MOREOVER, THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR
 SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT AN
 INFRINGEMENT CLAIM MAY BE MADE AGAINST US. ROYALTY OR LICENSING
 ARRANGEMENTS, IF REQUIRED, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS
 ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM SUCCESSFULLY
 ASSERTED AGAINST US OR AGAINST A CUSTOMER FOR WHICH WE HAVE AN
 OBLIGATION TO DEFEND COULD RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION, THE
 PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES, AND AN INJUNCTION THAT PROHIBITS
 US FROM CONTINUING TO OFFER THE SERVICE OR SOLUTION IN QUESTION,
 ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD BE MISAPPROPRIATED, WHICH COULD
 FORCE US TO BECOME INVOLVED IN EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING
 LITIGATION. 

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGICAL
 INNOVATION IS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED
 TECHNOLOGY. WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENT, COPYRIGHT, AND
 TRADE SECRET LAWS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR
 PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN SUCH TECHNOLOGY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO
 PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS,
 UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY COPY OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN AND USE OUR
 PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY OR TRADEMARKS. EFFECTIVELY POLICING OUR
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY, AND THE
 STEPS TAKEN BY US MAY NOT PREVENT INFRINGEMENT OF OUR
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS,
 TECHNOLOGY AND TRADEMARKS, PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES
 WHERE IN MANY INSTANCES THE LOCAL LAWS OR LEGAL SYSTEMS DO NOT
 OFFER THE SAME LEVEL OF PROTECTION AS IN THE UNITED STATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR
 FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE AT DESIRED
 PRICING LEVELS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN
 PROFITABILITY OR POSITIVE CASH FLOW. 

OUR COMPETITORS AND CUSTOMERS MAY CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE PRICES
 WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF
 PRICING PRESSURE INCLUDE:

COMPETITORS OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AT REDUCED PRICES,
 OR BUNDLING AND PRICING SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT MAKES IT
 DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE. FOR EXAMPLE, A COMPETING PROVIDER
 OF INTEROPERABILITY SERVICES MIGHT OFFER ITS SERVICES AT LOWER
 RATES THAN WE DO, A COMPETING DOMAIN NAME REGISTRY PROVIDER MAY
 REDUCE ITS PRICES FOR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION OR AN ISP OR A
 COMPETITOR MAY OFFER MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING SOLUTIONS AT
 REDUCED PRICES OR AT NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER;

CUSTOMERS WITH A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE
 ENHANCED LEVERAGE IN PRICING NEGOTIATIONS WITH US; AND

IF OUR PRICES ARE TOO HIGH, POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY FIND IT
 ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO HANDLE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS INTERNALLY
 INSTEAD OF USING OUR SERVICES.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF ANY PRICE REDUCTIONS
 BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS WE HANDLE OR THE NUMBER
 OF CUSTOMERS WE SERVE, BY GENERATING HIGHER REVENUE FROM
 ENHANCED SERVICES OR BY REDUCING OUR COSTS.

A
 SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WE HANDLE
 COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS. 

UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH NORTH AMERICAN PORTABILITY MANAGEMENT
 LLC, WE EARN REVENUE FOR TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY SERVICES
 ON AN ANNUAL, FIXED-FEE BASIS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT THE
 VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS IN A GIVEN YEAR IS ABOVE OR BELOW THE
 CONTRACTUALLY ESTABLISHED VOLUME RANGE FOR THAT YEAR, THE
 FIXED-FEE MAY BE ADJUSTED UP OR DOWN, RESPECTIVELY, WITH ANY
 SUCH ADJUSTMENT BEING APPLIED TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR S
 INVOICES. IN ADDITION, UNDER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CANADIAN LNP
 CONSORTIUM INC., WE EARN REVENUE ON A PER TRANSACTION BASIS. AS
 A RESULT, IF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE UNITED STATES REDUCE
 THEIR USAGE OF OUR SERVICES IN A PARTICULAR YEAR TO LEVELS BELOW
 THE ESTABLISHED VOLUME RANGE FOR THAT YEAR OR IF INDUSTRY
 PARTICIPANTS IN CANADA REDUCE THEIR USAGE OF OUR SERVICES FROM
 THEIR CURRENT LEVELS, OUR REVENUE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY
 SUFFER. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY COULD RESULT
 IN A DECLINE IN TRANSACTIONS IF THE REMAINING CSPS DECIDE TO
 HANDLE CHANGES TO THEIR NETWORKS INTERNALLY RATHER THAN USE THE
 SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. MOREOVER, IF CUSTOMER CHURN AMONG CSPS
 IN THE INDUSTRY STABILIZES OR DECLINES, OR IF CSPS DO NOT
 COMPETE VIGOROUSLY TO LURE CUSTOMERS AWAY FROM THEIR
 COMPETITORS, USE OF OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY AND OTHER
 SERVICES MAY DECLINE. IF CSPS DEVELOP INTERNAL SYSTEMS TO
 ADDRESS THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS, OR IF THE COST OF SUCH
 TRANSACTIONS MAKES IT IMPRACTICAL FOR A GIVEN CARRIER TO USE OUR
 SERVICES FOR THESE PURPOSES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN
 TRANSACTION VOLUMES. FINALLY, THE TRENDS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL
 DRIVE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR CLEARINGHOUSE SERVICES, SUCH AS
 THE EMERGENCE OF IP SERVICES, GROWTH OF WIRELESS SERVICES,
 CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY, AND PRESSURE ON CARRIERS TO
 REDUCE COSTS, MAY NOT ACTUALLY RESULT IN INCREASED DEMAND FOR
 OUR EXISTING SERVICES OR FOR THE ANCILLARY DIRECTORY SERVICES
 THAT WE EXPECT TO OFFER, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR FUTURE REVENUE AND
 GROWTH PROSPECTS.

IF WE
 ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE OUR COSTS, OUR PROFITS COULD BE ADVERSELY
 AFFECTED. 

HISTORICALLY, SUSTAINING OUR GROWTH HAS PLACED SIGNIFICANT
 DEMANDS ON OUR MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS ON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE,
 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. FOR US TO CONTINUE TO
 MANAGE OUR EXPANDED OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY FUTURE GROWTH, WE
 MUST CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND
 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND EXPAND, MOTIVATE AND MANAGE
 OUR WORKFORCE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COSTS
 WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR QUALITY OF SERVICE, OR IF NEW SYSTEMS
 THAT WE IMPLEMENT TO ASSIST IN MANAGING OUR OPERATIONS DO NOT
 PRODUCE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TURNOVER
 IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR REVENUE AND PROFITS COULD BE
 ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE MAY
 BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE SUITABLE ACQUISITIONS, OR WE MAY UNDERTAKE
 ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR LIABILITIES OR BE
 DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS. 

WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST, AND ONE OF
 OUR STRATEGIES IS TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS SELECTIVELY IN THE
 FUTURE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION
 CANDIDATES AT PRICES THAT WE CONSIDER APPROPRIATE OR ON TERMS
 THAT ARE SATISFACTORY TO US. IF WE DO IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE
 ACQUISITION CANDIDATE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY
 NEGOTIATE THE TERMS OR, IF THE ACQUISITION OCCURS, INTEGRATE THE
 ACQUIRED BUSINESS INTO OUR EXISTING BUSINESS. ACQUISITIONS OF
 BUSINESSES OR OTHER MATERIAL OPERATIONS MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL
 DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE OR
 DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESS
 OPERATIONS COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS BY DIVERTING MANAGEMENT
 AWAY FROM DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. THE DIFFICULTIES OF INTEGRATION
 MAY BE INCREASED BY THE NECESSITY OF COORDINATING GEOGRAPHICALLY
 DISPERSED ORGANIZATIONS, INTEGRATING PERSONNEL WITH DISPARATE
 BUSINESS BACKGROUNDS AND COMBINING DIFFERENT CORPORATE CULTURES.
 WE ALSO MAY NOT REALIZE COST EFFICIENCIES OR SYNERGIES OR OTHER
 BENEFITS THAT WE ANTICIPATED WHEN SELECTING OUR ACQUISITION
 CANDIDATES, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
 AND RESOURCES AFTER ACQUISITION TO MAINTAIN OR GROW THE
 BUSINESSES THAT WE ACQUIRE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NEED TO RECORD
 WRITE-DOWNS FROM IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 THAT OCCUR AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH COULD
 REDUCE OUR FUTURE REPORTED EARNINGS. IF WE FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY
 INTEGRATE AND SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESSES WE
 ACQUIRE, OR IF ANTICIPATED REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS
 ARE NOT REALIZED FROM THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, OUR BUSINESS,
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE
 MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, AT TIMES, ACQUISITION
 CANDIDATES MAY HAVE LIABILITIES, NEUTRALITY-RELATED RISKS OR
 ADVERSE OPERATING ISSUES THAT WE FAIL TO DISCOVER THROUGH DUE
 DILIGENCE PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. THE FAILURE TO DISCOVER SUCH
 ISSUES PRIOR TO SUCH ACQUISITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
 EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AN
 IMPAIRMENT IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OR LONG-LIVED
 ASSETS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS AND NET WORTH. 

GOODWILL IS INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND IS NOT
 AMORTIZED, BUT IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR
 MORE FREQUENTLY IF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARE PRESENT. IN
 GENERAL, LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE ONLY REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF
 IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARE PRESENT. IN ASSESSING GOODWILL AND
 LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
 AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT
 MARKET PENETRATION, ANTICIPATED GROWTH RATES, AND RISK-ADJUSTED
 DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON OUR BUDGETS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC
 PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INDUSTRY DATA.
 SOME OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT HAVE A
 HIGH DEGREE OF SUBJECTIVITY AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ON
 THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR OUR
 NGM BUSINESS DUE TO ITS EARLY STAGE OF OPERATIONS AND THE
 EMERGING NATURE OF MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING TECHNOLOGY. CHANGES
 IN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR IMPAIRMENT
 TESTING MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT, AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT
 CHARGES COULD SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE
 PERIODS OF SUCH CHARGES.

OUR
 EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY BE SUBJECT TO
 UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH
 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, DISRUPT OUR
 OPERATIONS, AND REQUIRE INCREASED FOCUS FROM OUR
 MANAGEMENT. 

OUR INSTANT MESSAGING SOLUTIONS PREDOMINANTLY TARGET
 INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE PURSUING, AND WE
 INTEND TO PURSUE IN THE FUTURE, OTHER INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 OPPORTUNITIES. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS EXPANSION
 PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING:

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH
 WE OPERATE OR SEEK TO OPERATE;

DIFFICULTY OF ENFORCING CONTRACTS AND COLLECTING RECEIVABLES
 THROUGH SOME FOREIGN LEGAL SYSTEMS;

DIFFERENCES IN FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN
 TAX, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LABOR AND CONTRACT LAW, AS WELL AS
 UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

DIFFERING TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS AND PACE OF ADOPTION;

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES;

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND ANY IMPOSITION OF
 CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS;

INCREASED COMPETITION BY LOCAL, REGIONAL, OR GLOBAL
 COMPANIES; AND

DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING A LARGE ORGANIZATION
 SPREAD THROUGHOUT VARIOUS COUNTRIES.

IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS GLOBALLY, OUR SUCCESS WILL
 DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND
 EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR
 INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND, CONSEQUENTLY,
 OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

OUR
 SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT TO OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS,
 AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR SENIOR MANAGERS COULD HAVE A
 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE CONTINUED
 CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WE RELY ON OUR EXECUTIVE
 OFFICERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO GENERATE BUSINESS AND EXECUTE
 PROGRAMS SUCCESSFULLY. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIPS AND
 REPUTATION THAT MEMBERS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAVE ESTABLISHED
 AND MAINTAIN WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR REGULATORS CONTRIBUTE TO
 OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONS. IF WE DO NOT
 RETAIN OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, OR IF WE FAIL TO PLAN ADEQUATELY
 FOR THE SUCCESSION OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS, OUR CUSTOMER
 RELATIONSHIPS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY
 BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE
 MUST RECRUIT AND RETAIN SKILLED EMPLOYEES TO SUCCEED IN OUR
 BUSINESS, AND OUR FAILURE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED
 EMPLOYEES COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR
 BUSINESS. 

WE BELIEVE THAT AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR SUCCESS IS OUR ABILITY
 TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ADVANCED SKILLS IN THE
 SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE PROVIDE AND WHO WORK WELL WITH
 OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE REGULATED ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.
 IN PARTICULAR, WE MUST HIRE AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES WITH THE
 TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN
 AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR OPERATIONS AND MUST EFFECTIVELY
 MANAGE OUR GROWING SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE
 THE GROWTH OF OUR OPERATIONS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE
 ABILITY OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO ESTABLISH
 DIRECT SALES CHANNELS AND TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION
 CHANNELS WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER THIRD
 PARTIES. THE EMPLOYEES WITH THE SKILLS WE REQUIRE ARE IN GREAT
 DEMAND AND ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN A LIMITED RESOURCE IN THE
 FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A
 SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS, OUR ABILITY
 TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

RISKS
 RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS 

THE
 RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT MARKET
 UTILIZATION OF OUR EXISTING AND NEW SERVICES AND MAY HARM OUR
 FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OUR
 EXISTING SERVICES AND OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES,
 EXTENSIONS OF EXISTING SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION. FOR
 SOME OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE, THE MARKET HAS ONLY RECENTLY
 DEVELOPED, AND THE VIABILITY AND PROFITABILITY OF THESE SERVICES
 IS UNPROVEN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS WILL BE
 COMPROMISED IF WE DO NOT DEVELOP AND MARKET SERVICES THAT
 ACHIEVE BROAD MARKET ACCEPTANCE WITH OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL
 CUSTOMERS. IF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS DO NOT GAIN WIDESPREAD
 MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER. THE
 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION EXPERIENCED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF
 2008, AND ANY CONTINUING UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS, MAY RESULT IN LOWER OVERALL SPENDING BY OUR CURRENT
 AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
 GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR EXISTING SERVICES, INTRODUCE NEW
 SERVICES OR EXTENSIONS OF EXISTING SERVICES AND EXPAND
 GEOGRAPHICALLY. IF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS PROLONGED, WE MAY
 HAVE DIFFICULTY IN MAINTAINING AND ESTABLISHING A MARKET FOR OUR
 EXISTING AND NEW SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY
 SUFFER.

FUNDS
 INVESTED IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD MAY NOT BE
 ACCESSIBLE IN THE SHORT TERM, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST
 THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES THROUGH AN ASSET
 IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE
 SECURITIES, OR ARS, WITH AN AGGREGATE PAR VALUE TOTALING
 APPROXIMATELY 41.7 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS
 NONCURRENT. OUR ARS ARE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES WITH LONG-TERM
 MATURITIES, CERTAIN OF WHICH HAVE UNDERLYING ASSETS THAT ARE
 GUARANTEED BY THIRD PARTIES, AND ALL OF

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WHICH WERE MARKETED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH AUCTION RESET
 DATES PRIMARILY AT 28 OR 35 DAY INTERVALS TO PROVIDE
 SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2008, AUCTIONS FOR
 THESE SECURITIES BEGAN TO FAIL, WHICH HAS DECREASED THE
 SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THESE SECURITIES AND CAUSED THE INTEREST
 RATES EARNED ON THESE SECURITIES TO INCREASE. THE REMAINING
 CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF THESE SECURITIES RANGE FROM 16 TO
 38 YEARS. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE REMAINING
 FUNDS UNTIL A FUTURE AUCTION FOR THESE ARS IS SUCCESSFUL, WE
 SELL THE SECURITIES IN A SECONDARY MARKET, OR THEY ARE REDEEMED
 BY THE ISSUER. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO
 SELL OUR ARS IN A SECONDARY MARKET AT A FAVORABLE PRICE OR
 OTHERWISE. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE ISSUER OF OUR ARS TO
 REPURCHASE THE ARS AT PAR VALUE BEGINNING ON JUNE 30, 2010.
 IF THE CREDIT RATING OF EITHER THE ISSUER OF THE ARS OR THE
 THIRD-PARTY INSURERS OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS DETERIORATES,
 WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO FURTHER ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE
 ARS THROUGH A LOSS IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

WE MAY
 NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE AND IT MAY NOT BE
 AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. 

WE HAVE HISTORICALLY RELIED ON OUTSIDE FINANCING AND CASH FLOW
 FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND
 EXPANSION. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO
 FUND OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCE INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT OR
 INFRASTRUCTURE, OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR STRATEGIC
 OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, OUR NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT OR
 PROHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING BY
 RESTRICTING THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN PARTIES FROM ACQUIRING OUR
 STOCK OR OUR DEBT, OR THE AMOUNT THAT SUCH PARTIES MAY ACQUIRE.
 IN ADDITION, DIFFICULTIES IN THE GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS HAVE
 RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF
 CREDIT. SOME COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE REFUSING TO PROVIDE FINANCING,
 OTHERS ARE IMPOSING MORE ONEROUS TERMS ON BORROWERS, INCLUDING
 HIGHER INTEREST RATES. AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT
 BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. FURTHER, THE
 TERMS OF AVAILABLE FINANCING MAY PLACE LIMITS ON OUR FINANCIAL
 AND OPERATING FLEXIBILITY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT
 CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY:

NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR SERVICE
 QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND COMPETITIVE PRICING;

BE FORCED TO REDUCE OUR OPERATIONS;

NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND OR ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY
 BUSINESSES; AND

NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES OR OTHERWISE RESPOND TO
 CHANGING BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR COMPETITIVE PRESSURES.

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

OUR
 COMMON STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE
 WIDELY. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A
 COMMON STOCK COULD BE CAUSED BY MANY THINGS, INCLUDING:

OUR PERCEIVED PROSPECTS AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE TELEPHONE AND
 INTERNET INDUSTRIES IN GENERAL;

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS
 AND THOSE EXPECTED BY INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS;

CHANGES IN ANALYSTS RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROJECTIONS;

CHANGES IN GENERAL VALUATIONS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES;

ADOPTION OR MODIFICATION OF REGULATIONS, POLICIES, PROCEDURES OR
 PROGRAMS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS;

SALES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK BY OUR OFFICERS,
 DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS;

SALES OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN
 THE PUBLIC MARKET, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH SALES MAY OCCUR;

SALES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK DUE TO A REQUIRED
 DIVESTITURE UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF
 INCORPORATION; AND

CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS AND BROAD
 MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

EACH OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
 ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON
 STOCK. RECENTLY, THE STOCK MARKET IN GENERAL HAS EXPERIENCED
 EXTREME PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THIS VOLATILITY HAS HAD A
 SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICES OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY
 MANY COMPANIES FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING
 PERFORMANCE OF THE SPECIFIC COMPANIES. SOME COMPANIES THAT HAVE
 HAD VOLATILE MARKET PRICES FOR THEIR SECURITIES HAVE HAD
 SECURITIES CLASS ACTION SUITS FILED AGAINST THEM. IF A SUIT WERE
 TO BE FILED AGAINST US, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, IT COULD
 RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF OUR
 MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. THIS COULD HAVE A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DELAWARE
 LAW AND PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
 BYLAWS COULD MAKE A MERGER, TENDER OFFER OR PROXY CONTEST
 DIFFICULT, AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK
 MAY BE LOWER AS A RESULT. 

WE ARE A DELAWARE CORPORATION, AND THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS
 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW MAY DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR
 PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL BY PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING IN A
 BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER FOR A PERIOD
 OF THREE YEARS AFTER THE PERSON BECOMES AN INTERESTED
 STOCKHOLDER, EVEN IF A CHANGE OF CONTROL WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO
 OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, OUR CERTIFICATE OF
 INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS MAY DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A
 CHANGE IN OUR MANAGEMENT OR CONTROL OVER US THAT STOCKHOLDERS
 MAY CONSIDER FAVORABLE. OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
 BYLAWS:

AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF BLANK CHECK PREFERRED
 STOCK THAT COULD BE ISSUED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THWART A
 TAKEOVER ATTEMPT;

PROHIBIT CUMULATIVE VOTING IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS, WHICH
 WOULD OTHERWISE ENABLE HOLDERS OF LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF OUR
 VOTING SECURITIES TO ELECT SOME OF OUR DIRECTORS;

ESTABLISH A CLASSIFIED BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS A RESULT OF WHICH
 THE SUCCESSORS TO THE DIRECTORS WHOSE TERMS HAVE EXPIRED WILL BE
 ELECTED TO SERVE FROM THE TIME OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION
 UNTIL THE THIRD ANNUAL MEETING FOLLOWING ELECTION;

REQUIRE THAT DIRECTORS ONLY BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE FOR CAUSE;

PROVIDE THAT VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING
 NEWLY-CREATED DIRECTORSHIPS, MAY BE FILLED ONLY BY A MAJORITY
 VOTE OF DIRECTORS THEN IN OFFICE;

DISQUALIFY ANY INDIVIDUAL FROM SERVING ON OUR BOARD IF SUCH
 INDIVIDUAL S SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR WOULD CAUSE US TO
 VIOLATE OUR NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS;

LIMIT WHO MAY CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS;

PROHIBIT STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT, REQUIRING ALL
 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AT A MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS; AND

ESTABLISH ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR NOMINATING CANDIDATES
 FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR FOR PROPOSING MATTERS
 THAT CAN BE ACTED UPON BY STOCKHOLDERS AT STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS.

IN
 ORDER TO COMPLY WITH OUR NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS, OUR
 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER
 RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS
 AND THEIR AFFILIATES, WHICH MAY INHIBIT POTENTIAL ACQUISITION
 BIDS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER FAVORABLE, AND THE
 MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY BE LOWER AS A
 RESULT. 

IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE
 FCC IN ITS ORDERS AND RULES, NO ENTITY THAT QUALIFIES AS A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER OR AFFILIATE OF
 A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER, AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED
 UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934 AND FCC RULES AND ORDERS,
 MAY BENEFICIALLY OWN 5 OR MORE OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK. AS A
 RESULT, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, OUR CERTIFICATE OF
 INCORPORATION PROHIBITS ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER
 OR AFFILIATE OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER FROM
 BENEFICIALLY OWNING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, 5 OR MORE OF OUR
 OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK. AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CERTIFICATE
 OF INCORPORATION PROVIDES THAT:

IF ONE OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS EXPERIENCES A CHANGE IN STATUS OR
 OTHER EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE STOCKHOLDER VIOLATING THIS
 RESTRICTION, OR IF ANY TRANSFER OF OUR STOCK OCCURS THAT, IF
 EFFECTIVE, WOULD VIOLATE THE 5 RESTRICTION, WE MAY

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ELECT TO PURCHASE THE EXCESS SHARES (I.E., THE SHARES THAT CAUSE
 THE VIOLATION OF THE RESTRICTION) OR REQUIRE THAT THE EXCESS
 SHARES BE SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY WHOSE OWNERSHIP WILL NOT VIOLATE
 THE RESTRICTION;

PENDING A REQUIRED DIVESTITURE OF THESE EXCESS SHARES, THE
 HOLDER WHOSE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP VIOLATES THE 5 RESTRICTION
 MAY NOT VOTE THE SHARES IN EXCESS OF THE 5 THRESHOLD; AND

IF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR ITS PERMITTED DESIGNEE, DETERMINES
 THAT A TRANSFER, ATTEMPTED TRANSFER OR OTHER EVENT VIOLATING
 THIS RESTRICTION HAS TAKEN PLACE, WE MUST TAKE WHATEVER ACTION
 WE DEEM ADVISABLE TO PREVENT OR REFUSE TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE
 TRANSFER, INCLUDING REFUSAL TO REGISTER THE TRANSFER, DISREGARD
 OF ANY VOTE OF THE SHARES BY THE PROHIBITED OWNER, OR THE
 INSTITUTION OF PROCEEDINGS TO ENJOIN THE TRANSFER.

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS
 AS TO WHETHER ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK IS A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER OR AN AFFILIATE OF A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER. ANY PERSON WHO ACQUIRES, OR
 ATTEMPTS OR INTENDS TO ACQUIRE, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF OUR
 STOCK THAT WILL OR MAY VIOLATE THIS RESTRICTION MUST NOTIFY US
 AS PROVIDED IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. IN ADDITION,
 ANY PERSON WHO BECOMES THE BENEFICIAL OWNER OF 5 OR MORE OF OUR
 STOCK MUST NOTIFY US AND CERTIFY THAT SUCH PERSON IS NOT A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER OR AN AFFILIATE OF A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER. IF A 5 STOCKHOLDER FAILS
 TO SUPPLY THE REQUIRED CERTIFICATION, WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO TREAT
 THAT STOCKHOLDER AS A PROHIBITED OWNER MEANING,
 AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WE MAY ELECT TO PURCHASE THE EXCESS
 SHARES OR REQUIRE THAT THE EXCESS SHARES BE SOLD TO A THIRD
 PARTY WHOSE OWNERSHIP WILL NOT VIOLATE THE RESTRICTION. WE MAY
 REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO ENSURE
 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS RESTRICTION. OUR BOARD WILL TREAT ANY
 GROUP, AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN
 SECTION 13(D)(3) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS
 A SINGLE PERSON FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE OWNERSHIP AND
 TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.

NOTHING IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION RESTRICTS OUR
 ABILITY TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK. IF A PURCHASE
 BY US OF SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK RESULTS IN A
 STOCKHOLDER S PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN OUR OUTSTANDING
 CAPITAL STOCK INCREASING TO OVER THE 5 THRESHOLD, SUCH
 STOCKHOLDER MUST DELIVER THE REQUIRED CERTIFICATION REGARDING
 SUCH STOCKHOLDER S STATUS AS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
 PROVIDER OR AFFILIATE OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER.
 IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT A REPURCHASE BY US OF SHARES OF
 OUR CAPITAL STOCK CAUSES ANY STOCKHOLDER TO VIOLATE THE
 RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER CONTAINED IN OUR
 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, THAT STOCKHOLDER WILL BE SUBJECT
 TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PROHIBITED OWNERS,
 INCLUDING REQUIRED DIVESTITURE AND LOSS OF VOTING RIGHTS.

THESE RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS MAY:

DISCOURAGE INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS THAT MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN
 INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING US FROM MAKING A TENDER OFFER OR
 PROPOSING SOME OTHER FORM OF TRANSACTION THAT COULD INVOLVE A
 PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR SHARES OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST
 INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS; AND

DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN US BY OTHER INVESTORS WHO ARE
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS OR WHO MAY BE DEEMED TO BE
 AFFILIATES OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER.

THE STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER ARE ESTABLISHED
 BY THE FCC. IN GENERAL, A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER IS
 AN ENTITY THAT OFFERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC
 AT LARGE, AND IS, THEREFORE, PROVIDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICES ON A COMMON CARRIER BASIS. MOREOVER, A PARTY WILL BE
 DEEMED TO BE AN AFFILIATE OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
 PROVIDER IF THAT PARTY CONTROLS, IS CONTROLLED BY, OR IS UNDER
 COMMON CONTROL WITH, A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER. A
 PARTY IS DEEMED TO CONTROL ANOTHER IF THAT PARTY, DIRECTLY OR
 INDIRECTLY:

OWNS 10 OR MORE OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF THE OTHER
 PARTY;

HAS THE POWER TO VOTE 10 OR MORE OF THE SECURITIES HAVING
 ORDINARY VOTING POWER FOR THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTORS OR
 MANAGEMENT OF THE OTHER PARTY; OR

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT OR CAUSE THE DIRECTION OF THE MANAGEMENT
 AND POLICIES OF THE OTHER PARTY.

THE STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER OR AN AFFILIATE OF A
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER AND THE RULES APPLICABLE TO
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES ARE
 COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. EACH STOCKHOLDER IS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING US IF IT IS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE PROVIDER OR AN AFFILIATE OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
 PROVIDER.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

BEFORE INVESTING IN ANY OF OUR SECURITIES, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THESE RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES TO DECLINE. YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS 

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY ASSESS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESSES THAT WE INSURE OR REINSURE. WE ESTABLISH LOSS RESERVES TO COVER OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO PREMIUMS EARNED ON THE POLICIES THAT WE WRITE. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY. RATHER, LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE EXPECT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON ACTUARIAL AND STATISTICAL PROJECTIONS AND ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DATA, AS WELL AS ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, JUDICIAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE REFINED CONTINUALLY IN AN ONGOING PROCESS AS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS. MOREOVER, THESE UNCERTAINTI
ES ARE GREATER FOR COMPANIES LIKE US THAN FOR THOSE WITH A LONGER OPERATING HISTORY BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET HAVE AN EXTENSIVE LOSS HISTORY. BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR RESERVES AT ANY GIVEN TIME WILL PROVE INADEQUATE. 

TO THE EXTENT WE DETERMINE THAT ACTUAL LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES EXCEED OUR EXPECTATIONS AND LOSS RESERVES RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMMEDIATELY INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES. THIS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL. 

AS A PROPERTY, AGRICULTURE AND CATASTROPHE INSURER AND REINSURER, WE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES. 

OUR PROPERTY, AGRICULTURE AND CATASTROPHE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE LINES EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS UNPREDICTABLE EVENTS, INCLUDING EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES, HAILSTORMS, DROUGHTS, SEVERE WEATHER, FLOODS, FIRES, TORNADOES, VOLCANO ERUPTIONS, EXPLOSIONS AND OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS. THE GLOBAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FOR NATURAL EVENTS OCCURRING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WINDSTORMS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, HURRICANES IN FLORIDA, THE GULF COAST AND THE ATLANTIC COAST REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, TYPHOONS AND EARTHQUAKES IN JAPAN, EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW MADRID REGION OF THE UNITED STATES AND DROUGHT AND FLOODING IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, PRIMARILY RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES, MAY BE INCREASING, OR MAY IN THE F
UTURE INCREASE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL CATASTROPHES, INCLUDING WEATHER EVENTS, AND MAY CREATE NEW TYPES OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES. WE EXPECT THAT INCREASES IN THE VALUES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF INSURED PROPERTY WILL INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF SUCH OCCURRENCES IN THE FUTURE. IN THE EVENT THAT WE EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHE LOSSES, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT OUR PREMIUMS WILL BE INADEQUATE TO COVER THESE RISKS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS DO NOT PERMIT INSURERS AND REINSURERS TO RESERVE FOR SUCH CATASTROPHIC EVENTS UNTIL THEY OCCUR, CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS ALSO COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. ALTHOUGH WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH EVENTS THROUGH THE USE OF UNDERWRITING CONTROLS AND THE PURCHASE OF THIRD-PARTY REINSURANCE, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNP
REDICTABLE AND THE ACTUAL NATURE OF SUCH EVENTS WHEN THEY OCCUR COULD BE MORE FREQUENT OR SEVERE THAN CONTEMPLATED IN OUR PRICING AND RISK MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT UNDERWRITING RISK MANAGEMENT.

 AS A PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURER AND REINSURER, WE COULD FACE LOSSES FROM WAR, TERRORISM AND POLITICAL UNREST. 

WE MAY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF WAR, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THESE RISKS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, ALTHOUGH RECENT EVENTS MAY LEAD TO INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR OCCURRENCE WITH STATISTICAL CERTAINTY OR TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF LOSS AN OCCURRENCE WILL GENERATE. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR LOSS RESERVES WILL BE INADEQUATE TO COVER THESE RISKS. WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE AMOUNT AND TYPES OF COVERAGE WE PROVIDE FOR TERRORISM RISK UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE TREATIES. WE OFTEN SEEK TO EXCLUDE TERRORISM WHEN WE CANNOT REASONABLY EVALUATE THE RISK OF LOSS OR CHARGE AN APPROPRIATE PREMIUM FOR SUCH RISK. EVEN IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE DELIBERATELY SOUGHT TO EXCLUDE COVERAGE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE COMPLETELY OUR EXPOSURE TO TERRORIST ACTS, AND THUS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE ACTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE UNDERWRITING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

BECAUSE WE PARTICIPATE IN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE MARKETS, THE SUCCESS OF OUR UNDERWRITING EFFORTS DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON THE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND EXPERTISE OF THE CEDING COMPANIES MAKING THE ORIGINAL UNDERWRITING DECISIONS. WE FACE THE RISK THAT THESE CEDING COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO ACCURATELY ASSESS THE RISKS THAT THEY ASSUME INITIALLY, WHICH, IN TURN, MAY LEAD US TO INACCURATELY ASSESS THE RISKS WE ASSUME. IF WE FAIL TO ESTABLISH AND RECEIVE APPROPRIATE PREMIUM RATES, WE COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS. 

IF ACTUAL RENEWALS OF OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS DO NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS, OUR GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN FUTURE YEARS AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR TERM. IN OUR FINANCIAL FORECASTING PROCESS, WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE RENEWAL OF OUR PRIOR YEAR S CONTRACTS. IF ACTUAL RENEWALS DO NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS, OUR GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN FUTURE YEARS AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THIS RISK IS ESPECIALLY PREVALENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR U.S.-BASED INSURANCE OPERATIONS IS SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISK FROM CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. 

EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE MAY BE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS WRITTEN BY OUR U.S.-BASED INSURANCE OPERATIONS. EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE COVERS RISKS THAT ARE TYPICALLY MORE COMPLEX AND UNUSUAL THAN STANDARD RISKS AND REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF SPECIALIZED UNDERWRITING. AS A RESULT, EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES RISKS DO NOT OFTEN FIT THE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA OF STANDARD INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE BUSINESS FILLS THE INSURANCE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED HIGHER RISK THAN THOSE IN THE STANDARD MARKET. IF OUR UNDERWRITING STAFF INADEQUATELY JUDGES AND PRICES THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. 

FURTHER, THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET IN GENERAL. THIS CYCLICALITY CAN BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS MARKET THAN IN THE STANDARD INSURANCE MARKET. DURING TIMES OF HARD MARKET CONDITIONS (WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE MORE FAVORABLE TO INSURERS), AS RATES INCREASE AND COVERAGE TERMS BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE, BUSINESS TENDS TO MOVE FROM THE ADMITTED MARKET TO THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET AND GROWTH IN THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS MARKET CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RAPID THAN GROWTH IN THE STANDARD INSURANCE MARKET. WHEN SOFT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PREVALENT (WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE TO INSURERS), STANDARD INSURANCE CARRIERS TEND TO LOOSEN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND EXPAND MARKET SHARE BY MOVING INTO BUSINESS LINES TRADITIONALLY CHARACTERIZED AS EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES, EXACERBATING THE EFFECT OF RATE DECREASES. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THE CYCLIC
AL NATURE AND VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUES AND PROFIT WE GENERATE IN THE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

 THE FAILURE OF ANY OF THE LOSS LIMITATION METHODS WE EMPLOY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE SEEK TO LIMIT OUR LOSS EXPOSURE BY WRITING MANY OF OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ON AN EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS, ADHERING TO MAXIMUM LIMITATIONS ON POLICIES WRITTEN IN DEFINED GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES, LIMITING PROGRAM SIZE FOR EACH CLIENT, ESTABLISHING PER RISK AND PER OCCURRENCE LIMITATIONS FOR EACH EVENT AND FOLLOWING PRUDENT UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES FOR EACH PROGRAM WRITTEN. IN THE CASE OF PROPORTIONAL TREATIES, WE SEEK PER OCCURRENCE LIMITATIONS OR LOSS RATIO CAPS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF LOSSES FROM ANY ONE EVENT. MOST OF OUR DIRECT LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES INCLUDE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIMITATIONS. WE ALSO SEEK TO LIMIT OUR LOSS EXPOSURE THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. GEOGRAPHIC ZONE LIMITATIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT UNDERWRITING JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE AREA OF THE ZONES AND WHETHER A POLICY FALLS WITHIN PARTICULAR ZONE LIMITS. DISPUTES RELATING TO COVERAGE AND CHOICE OF LEGAL FORUM MAY ALSO ARISE. AS A RESULT, VARIOUS PROVISIONS 
OF OUR POLICIES, SUCH AS LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE OR CHOICE OF FORUM, MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN THE MANNER WE INTEND AND SOME OR ALL OF OUR OTHER LOSS LIMITATION METHODS MAY PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE. UNDERWRITING IS A MATTER OF JUDGMENT, INVOLVING IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE AND BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND FOR WHICH HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROBABILITY ANALYSIS MAY NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE. ONE OR MORE FUTURE CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER EVENTS COULD RESULT IN CLAIMS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, POSSIBLY TO THE EXTENT OF ELIMINATING OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PURCHASE REINSURANCE AND OUR NET INCOME COULD BE REDUCED OR WE COULD INCUR A NET LOSS IN THE EVENT OF AN UNUSUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. 

WE PURCHASE REINSURANCE IF IT IS DEEMED PRUDENT FROM A RISK MITIGATION PERSPECTIVE OR IF IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A FAVORABLE COST/BENEFIT RELATIONSHIP RELATIVE TO OUR RETAINED RISK PORTFOLIO. CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, MAY REDUCE TO SOME EXTENT OUR ABILITY TO USE REINSURANCE TO BALANCE EXPOSURES ACROSS OUR REINSURANCE OR INSURANCE OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OUR DESIRED AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE. IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH REINSURANCE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE TERMS THAT WE DEEM APPROPRIATE OR ACCEPTABLE OR OBTAIN SUCH REINSURANCE FROM ENTITIES WITH SATISFACTORY CREDITWORTHINESS. 

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR REINSURERS BECAUSE THE TRANSFER OF RISK TO A REINSURER DOES NOT RELIEVE US OF OUR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, REINSURERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO PAY US EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO. THE FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE OUR REINSURERS TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION WOULD IMPACT OUR CASH FLOW AND REDUCE OUR NET INCOME AND, DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE WE HAVE PURCHASED, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR A SIGNIFICANT LOSS. 

SINCE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY EXECUTIVES, THE LOSS OF ANY OF THESE EXECUTIVES OR OUR INABILITY TO RETAIN OTHER KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR SUCCESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES AND UPON THE ABILITY OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES IN THE BUSINESS LINES IN WHICH WE COMPETE. WE RELY SUBSTANTIALLY UPON THE SERVICES OF KENNETH J. LESTRANGE, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MICHAEL J. MCGUIRE, OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, MICHAEL E. ANGELINA, OUR CHIEF ACTUARY AND RISK OFFICER, DAVID S. CASH, OUR CHIEF UNDERWRITING OFFICER, MICHAEL P. FUJII, THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF OUR WORLDWIDE INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND WILLIAM M. JEWETT, THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF OUR WORLDWIDE REINSURANCE OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING KEY PERSONNEL SINCE OUR INCEPTION. THE LOSS OF ANY OF THEIR SERVICES OR THE SERVICE
S OF OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OTHER TALENTED PERSONNEL COULD IMPEDE THE FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

 OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY BERMUDA EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. 

WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO HIRE EMPLOYEES TO WORK IN BERMUDA. UNDER BERMUDA LAW, NON-BERMUDIANS (OTHER THAN SPOUSES OF BERMUDIANS) MAY NOT ENGAGE IN ANY GAINFUL OCCUPATION IN BERMUDA WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL WORK PERMIT. WORK PERMITS MAY BE GRANTED OR EXTENDED BY THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT UPON SHOWING THAT, AFTER PROPER PUBLIC ADVERTISEMENT IN MOST CASES, NO BERMUDIAN (OR SPOUSE OF A BERMUDIAN) IS AVAILABLE WHO MEETS THE MINIMUM STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ADVERTISED POSITION. CURRENT BERMUDA LAW LIMITS THE DURATION OF WORK PERMITS TO SIX YEARS, WITH CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR KEY EMPLOYEES. ALL OF OUR 50 BERMUDA-BASED PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES WHO REQUIRE WORK PERMITS, INCLUDING MESSRS. LESTRANGE, MCGUIRE AND ANGELINA, HAVE BEEN GRANTED PERMITS BY THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT. THE TERMS OF SUCH PERMITS USUALLY RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS AT THE TIME OF GRANT DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD LOSE THE SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY E
MPLOYEES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW THEIR WORK PERMITS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD AFFECT OUR STANDING AMONG BROKERS AND CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE OUR PREMIUMS AND EARNINGS TO DECREASE. 

RATINGS HAVE BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES. WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN AN A.M. BEST FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING OF A (EXCELLENT) WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND AN S P FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING OF A (STRONG) WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, OTHER THAN ARMTECH. WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN AN A.M. BEST FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING OF B++ WITH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON ARMTECH. IF OUR RATINGS ARE REDUCED FROM THEIR CURRENT LEVEL BY A.M. BEST OR S P, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRY WOULD SUFFER. SUCH A DOWNGRADE MAY HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PORTFOLIO AND RENEW OUR EXISTING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES AND AGREEMENTS, REQUIRE US TO ESTABLISH TRUSTS OR POST LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR CEDING COMPANY CLIENTS, AND COULD TRIGGER PROVISIONS ALLOWING SOME CEDING
 COMPANY CLIENTS TO TERMINATE THEIR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH US ON TERMS DISADVANTAGEOUS TO US. IN ADDITION, A DOWNGRADE OF OUR A.M. BEST RATING BELOW B++ (TWO LEVELS BELOW OUR CURRENT RATING) WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER OUR BANK CREDIT FACILITY. EACH OF THE EFFECTS OF A DOWNGRADE OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE OR OTHERWISE DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE IN CERTAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE WOULD OTHERWISE DESIRE TO OPERATE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, WE COULD SUFFER A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING ANY ORDINARY SHARES, COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE AND CERTAIN REGULATORY AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, AS SUCH, HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONS OF ITS OWN. DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PERMITTED DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET ONGOING CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS AND OTHER EXPENSES, AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO SHAREHOLDERS. BERMUDA LAW AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BERMUDA INSURANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICT THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND THE MAKING OF DISTRIBUTIONS BY ENDURANCE BERMUDA UNLESS CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. THE INABILITY OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS TO MEET ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS U.S. AND U.K. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS LIMITING THE
IR ABILITY TO DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS. WE THEREFORE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE MATERIAL DIVIDENDS FROM THESE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS SUBJECT TO BERMUDA REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAT WILL AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS ORDINARY SHARES, CLASS A SHARES AND 7.75 NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARES, SERIES A (THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES ), AND MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS. UNDER THE BERMUDA COMPANIES ACT 1981, AS AMENDED (THE COMPANIES ACT ), ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MAY DECLARE OR PAY A DIVIDEND OR

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

MAKE A DISTRIBUTION OUT OF RETAINED EARNINGS OR CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS ONLY IF IT HAS REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT IT IS, OR WOULD AFTER THE PAYMENT BE, ABLE TO PAY ITS LIABILITIES AS THEY BECOME DUE AND IF THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS WOULD THEREBY NOT BE LESS THAN THE AGGREGATE OF ITS LIABILITIES AND ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY PROHIBIT ENDURANCE HOLDINGS FROM DECLARING OR PAYING ANY DIVIDENDS IF A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AT THE TIME OF SUCH DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OR WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH DECLARATION OR PAYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE TERMS OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES PROHIBIT THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON OUR ORDINARY SHARES UNLESS DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES HAVE BEEN DECLARED AND PAID. PREFERENCE SHARES, INCLUDING THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES, MAY ALSO NOT BE REDEEMED IF AS A RESULT OF THE REDEMPTION, OUR ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL WOULD BE REDUCED BELOW THE MINIMUM CA
PITAL SPECIFIED IN THE MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, SEE ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. 

THE COST OF REINSURANCE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR MARGINS. 

AS A BERMUDA REINSURER, ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL SECURITY WITH RESPECT TO REINSURANCE LIABILITIES IT ASSUMES FROM CEDING INSURERS DOMICILED IN THE U.S. THE POSTING OF COLLATERAL SECURITY IS GENERALLY REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR U.S. CEDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN CREDIT ON THEIR U.S. STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO REINSURANCE LIABILITIES CEDED TO UNLICENSED OR UNACCREDITED REINSURERS, SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA. UNDER APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROVISIONS, THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, REINSURANCE TRUSTS MAINTAINED BY THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES OR FUNDS-WITHHELD ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE TRUSTEED ASSETS ARE HELD BY THE CEDING COMPANY. ENDURANCE BERMUDA HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO 1.175 BILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER OUR LETTER OF CREDIT AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES ON MAY 8, 2012. IF THIS FACILITY IS NOT SUFFICIENT OR IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO RENEW THIS FACILITY OR IS UN
ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR OTHER TYPES OF SECURITY ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS, THE ABILITY OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA TO PROVIDE REINSURANCE TO U.S.-BASED CLIENTS MAY BE SEVERELY LIMITED. 

SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS MAY SUBJECT OUR ASSETS TO SECURITY INTERESTS AND/OR REQUIRE THAT A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS BE PLEDGED TO, OR OTHERWISE HELD BY, THIRD PARTIES. ALTHOUGH THE INVESTMENT INCOME DERIVED FROM OUR ASSETS WHILE HELD IN TRUST TYPICALLY ACCRUES TO OUR BENEFIT, THE INVESTMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS GOVERNED BY THE INVESTMENT REGULATIONS OF THE STATE OF DOMICILE OF THE CEDING INSURER, WHICH MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE INVESTMENT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO US UNDER BERMUDA LAW. THE RESTRICTIONS MAY RESULT IN LOWER INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THESE ASSETS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. 

PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INFLATION. 

THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION COULD CAUSE THE COST OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHES OR OTHER EVENTS TO RISE IN THE FUTURE. OUR RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE PAYMENTS FOR SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIMS HANDLING EXPENSES, SUCH AS MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND LITIGATION COSTS. TO THE EXTENT INFLATION CAUSES THESE COSTS TO INCREASE ABOVE RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR THESE CLAIMS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE OUR LOSS RESERVES WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN OUR NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEFICIENCY IS IDENTIFIED. 

OUR INVESTMENT LIQUIDITY AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. 

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCOME FROM OUR INVESTED ASSETS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND IN PART ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED MATURITIES. OUR INCOME DERIVED FROM OUR INVESTED ASSETS (INCLUDING NET REALIZED LOSSES) WAS 263.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATING TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET VOLATILITY, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT AND DEFAULT RISK. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO PRE-PAYMENT OR REINVESTMENT RISK AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS OR SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 WITH RESPECT TO OUR LIABILITIES, WE STRIVE TO STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENTS IN A MANNER THAT RECOGNIZES THEIR CASH FLOW PROFILE AND OUR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IN THAT REGARD, WE ATTEMPT TO CORRELATE THE MATURITY AND DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO OUR LIABILITY PROFILE. HOWEVER, IF OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS OR LIABILITY PROFILE UNEXPECTEDLY CHANGE, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN CONTINUING TO STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THAT MANNER. THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS DEPENDING ON CHANGES IN VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING INTEREST RATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CORRELATING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITH OUR LIABILITIES, WE MAY BE FORCED TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENTS AT TIMES AND PRICES THAT ARE NOT OPTIMAL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. 

AT DECEMBER 2007, THE LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS WAS LOW COMPARED TO HISTORICAL STANDARDS. THE DECREASE IN LIQUIDITY COULD RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES IF THE COMPANY WAS FORCED TO IMMEDIATELY SELL SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. 

INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE MEASURES TO ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN A CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MITIGATE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY EFFECTIVELY. OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS INCLUDE MAINTAINING A HIGH QUALITY PORTFOLIO WITH A RELATIVELY SHORT DURATION TO REDUCE THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON BOOK VALUE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MATURES EACH YEAR, ALLOWING FOR REINVESTMENT AT CURRENT MARKET RATES. THE PORTFOLIO IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, AND TRADES ARE MADE TO BALANCE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BOOK VALUE. 

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. 

WE HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE CAPITALIZATION OF ENDURANCE U.K., WHICH IS DENOMINATED IN BRITISH STERLING. IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO REINSURANCE AND INSURANCE CONTRACTS WHERE WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY LOSSES IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 16 OF OUR GROSS PREMIUMS, PRIOR TO DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, WERE WRITTEN IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. A PORTION OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS AND LOSS RESERVES ARE ALSO DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DENOMINATED IN EUROS, BRITISH STERLING, CANADIAN DOLLARS, JAPANESE YEN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCE LOSSES FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUES OF THESE AND OTHER NON-U.S. CURRENCIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE PERIODICALLY BUY AND SELL CURRENCIES OR INVESTMENT SECURITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. DOLLARS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MATCH OUR NON-U.S. DOLLAR ASSETS TO OUR RELATED NON-U.S. DOLLAR LIABILITIES. WE HAVE NO CURRENCY HEDGES IN PLACE; HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR MATCHING STRATEGY, WE CONSIDER THE USE OF HEDGES WHEN WE BECOME AWARE OF PROBABLE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES THAT WILL BE PAID IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT SUCCESSFULLY MATCH OUR EXPOSURES OR STRUCTURE THE HEDGES SO AS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE RISKS. 

WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR ONLY AVAILABLE ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS. 

OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY, TO ESTABLISH PREMIUM RATES AND RESERVES AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO COVER LOSSES, AND TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RATING AGENCY RATINGS. WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH FINANCINGS OR CURTAIL OUR GROWTH AND REDUCE OUR ASSETS. ANY EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE AT ALL, MAY BE ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. IN THE CASE OF EQUITY FINANCINGS, DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COULD RESULT, AND IN ANY CASE SUCH SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES THAT ARE SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR ALREADY OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 SINCE WE DEPEND ON A FEW BROKERS FOR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROVIDED BY ANY ONE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE WORLDWIDE PRIMARILY THROUGH INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BROKERS. IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR TOP FOUR BROKERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 60.9 OF OUR GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN BEFORE DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS DISTRIBUTION. LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE BROKERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR RELIANCE ON BROKERS SUBJECTS US TO THEIR CREDIT RISK. 

IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WE FREQUENTLY PAY AMOUNTS OWED ON CLAIMS UNDER OUR INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS TO BROKERS, AND THESE BROKERS, IN TURN, PAY THESE AMOUNTS TO THE CLIENTS THAT HAVE PURCHASED INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE FROM US. IF A BROKER FAILS TO MAKE SUCH A PAYMENT, IN A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BUSINESS THAT WE WRITE, IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT WE WILL BE LIABLE TO THE CLIENT FOR THE DEFICIENCY BECAUSE OF LOCAL LAWS OR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. LIKEWISE, WHEN THE CLIENT PAYS PREMIUMS FOR THESE POLICIES TO BROKERS FOR PAYMENT OVER TO US, THESE PREMIUMS ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN PAID AND, IN MOST CASES, THE CLIENT WILL NO LONGER BE LIABLE TO US FOR THOSE AMOUNTS, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE PREMIUMS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH BROKERS AROUND THE WORLD WITH RESPECT TO MOST OF OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS. TO DATE WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY LOSSES RELATED TO SUCH CREDIT RISKS. 

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN. 

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIMS AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, THESE CHANGES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER A CONTRACT IS ISSUED. 

RECENT EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE: 

LARGER SETTLEMENTS AND JURY AWARDS FOR PROFESSIONALS AND CORPORATE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS COVERED BY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE; 

A GROWING TREND OF PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS RELATING TO CLAIMS-HANDLING, INSURANCE SALES PRACTICES AND OTHER PRACTICES RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; 

INCREASED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY INVOLVEMENT IN THE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT PROCESS FROM CLAIMS ARISING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA; AND 

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH LIABILITY COVERAGES RELATED TO SUB PRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURES. 

THE EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING MARGINS. 

THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE WITH MAJOR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INSURERS AND REINSURERS, INCLUDING OTHER BERMUDA-BASED INSURERS AND REINSURERS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. A NUMBER OF NEWLY-ORGANIZED, BERMUDA-BASED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE ENTITIES COMPETE IN THE SAME MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT MAY BE PLANNING TO ENTER THE SEGMENTS OF THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE MARKET IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR OF 
 
 24 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

EXISTING COMPANIES THAT MAY BE PLANNING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. INCREASING COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN FEWER SUBMISSIONS, LOWER PREMIUM RATES AND LESS FAVORABLE POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. 

FURTHER, INSURANCE/RISK-LINKED SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE AND OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL RISK TRANSFER MECHANISMS AND VEHICLES ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND OFFERED BY OTHER PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-INSURANCE COMPANY ENTITIES, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR TRADITIONAL INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE. A NUMBER OF NEW, PROPOSED OR POTENTIAL INDUSTRY OR LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS COULD FURTHER INCREASE COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. NEW COMPETITION FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD CAUSE THE DEMAND FOR INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE TO FALL OR THE EXPENSE OF CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION TO INCREASE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. 

THE HISTORICAL CYCLICALITY OF THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE INDUSTRY MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR RESULTS. 

HISTORICALLY, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS AND REINSURERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS DUE TO COMPETITION, FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OR SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, LEVELS OF CAPACITY, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. DEMAND FOR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE IS INFLUENCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY PREVAILING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND, IN THE CASE OF REINSURANCE, THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS OF PRIMARY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS. THE SUPPLY OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE IS RELATED TO PREVAILING PRICES, THE LEVELS OF INSURED LOSSES AND THE LEVELS OF INDUSTRY SURPLUS WHICH, IN TURN, MAY FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN RATES OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS BEING EARNED IN THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A CYCLICAL INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION DUE TO EXCESSIVE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AS WELL AS PERIODS WHEN SHORTAG
ES OF CAPACITY PERMITTED FAVORABLE PREMIUM LEVELS. THE RECENT INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE AS A RESULT OF CAPITAL PROVIDED BY NEW ENTRANTS AND BY THE COMMITMENT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BY EXISTING REINSURERS, HAS CAUSED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRICES IN MANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE TO DECREASE SINCE 2006. 

ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE OR MAY MAKE COULD TURN OUT TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL. 

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE HAVE PURSUED AND MAY CONTINUE TO PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND/OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NEW BUSINESSES. THE NEGOTIATION OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OR NEW PERSONNEL COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES OR NEW PERSONNEL INTO OUR EXISTING RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ANY REGULATORY ISSUES CREATED BY OUR ENTRY INTO NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND OTHER OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESS OR NEW PERSONNEL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED WILL PROVE TO BE PROFITABLE OR SUSTAINABLE. THE FAILURE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY OR TO MANAGE THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED
 BY THE INTEGRATION PROCESS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACQUISITIONS COULD INVOLVE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL RISKS SUCH AS POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM UNANTICIPATED LITIGATION OR LEVELS OF CLAIMS AND INABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET ACQUISITION COSTS. 

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING THESE RISKS. ANY FAILURE BY US TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT OUR ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE REGULATORY SYSTEM UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES THERETO, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES, PERMITS, AUTHORIZATIONS OR ACCREDITATIONS, OR MAY BE ABLE TO DO SO ONLY AT GREAT COST. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLY FULLY WITH, OR OBTAIN APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS FROM, THE WIDE 
 
 25 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE COMPANIES OR HOLDING COMPANIES. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OR TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAWS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN ONE OR MORE OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND FINES AND OTHER SANCTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. LASTLY, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE, SUCH AS THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR INSURANCE RATES AND FORMS, THE U.S. MULTIPLE PERIL CROP INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THE PURCHASE OF REINSURANCE BY PROPERTY INSURERS IN FLORIDA, COULD BE REVISED IN A MANNER MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. SEE REGULATORY MATTERS BELOW. 

THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS THAT MAY REDUCE OR INCREASE THE VOTING RIGHTS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. 

THE BYE-LAWS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT ANY SHAREHOLDER OWNING, DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY OR, IN THE CASE OF ANY U.S. PERSON, BY ATTRIBUTION, MORE THAN 9.5 OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES WILL HAVE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS REDUCED SO THAT THEY MAY NOT EXERCISE MORE THAN 9.5 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS CONFERRED BY OUR ORDINARY SHARES. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS LIMITED TO LESS THAN ONE VOTE PER SHARE, WHILE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE VOTING RIGHTS IN EXCESS OF ONE VOTE PER SHARE. MOREOVER, THESE PROVISIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE VOTES OF CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT TO THE 9.5 LIMITATION BY VIRTUE OF THEIR DIRECT SHARE OWNERSHIP. THE BYE-LAWS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS PROVIDE THAT SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THEIR VOTING INTERESTS PRIOR TO ANY VOTE TO BE TAKEN BY THE SHAREHOLDERS. 

AS A RESULT OF ANY REALLOCATION OF VOTES, YOUR VOTING RIGHTS MIGHT INCREASE ABOVE 5 OF THE AGGREGATE VOTING POWER OF THE OUTSTANDING ORDINARY SHARES, THEREBY POSSIBLY RESULTING IN YOUR BECOMING A REPORTING PERSON SUBJECT TO SCHEDULE 13D OR 13G FILING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT ). IN ADDITION, THE REALLOCATION OF YOUR VOTES COULD RESULT IN YOUR BECOMING SUBJECT TO FILING REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 16 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. 

WE ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST INFORMATION FROM ANY SHAREHOLDER FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER A SHAREHOLDER S VOTING RIGHTS ARE TO BE REALLOCATED PURSUANT TO THE BYE-LAWS. IF A SHAREHOLDER FAILS TO RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM US OR SUBMITS INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE INFORMATION (AFTER A REASONABLE CURE PERIOD) IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST, WE MAY, IN OUR REASONABLE DISCRETION, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE SHAREHOLDER S VOTING RIGHTS. 

PROVISIONS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS BYE-LAWS MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER SHARES OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DECLINE TO REGISTER A TRANSFER OF ANY ORDINARY SHARES IF THE RELEVANT INSTRUMENT OF TRANSFER (IF ANY) IS IN FAVOR OF FIVE PERSONS OR MORE JOINTLY OR IS NOT PROPERLY EXECUTED, THE TRANSFERRED SHARES ARE NOT FULLY PAID SHARES OR IF THE TRANSFEROR FAILS TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE TRANSFER. 

A SHAREHOLDER MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ITS SHARES OF ENDURANCE. 

THE BYE-LAWS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS PROVIDE THAT WE HAVE THE OPTION, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO REQUIRE A SHAREHOLDER TO SELL ITS ORDINARY SHARES FOR THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE TO US, TO OTHER SHAREHOLDERS OR TO THIRD PARTIES IF WE DETERMINE, BASED ON THE WRITTEN ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, THAT FAILURE TO EXERCISE OUR OPTION WOULD RESULT IN NON-DE MINIMIS ADVERSE TAX, LEGAL OR REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES TO US OR CERTAIN U.S. PERSONS AS TO WHICH THE SHARES HELD BY SUCH SHAREHOLDER CONSTITUTE CONTROLLED SHARES. IN THE LATTER CASE, OUR RIGHT TO REQUIRE A SHAREHOLDER TO SELL ITS ORDINARY SHARES TO US WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE OF A NUMBER OF ORDINARY SHARES THAT WILL PERMIT AVOIDANCE OF THOSE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES.

 A SHAREHOLDER MAY BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ANY TAX LIABILITY THAT RESULTS FROM THE ACTS OF THAT SHAREHOLDER. 

THE BYE-LAWS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS PROVIDE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS AGAINST ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO US RESULTING FROM LAWS THAT APPLY TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. IF A SHAREHOLDER S DEATH OR NON-PAYMENT OF ANY TAX OR DUTY PAYABLE BY THE SHAREHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER ACT OR THING INVOLVING THE SHAREHOLDER, CAUSES ANY ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO US, (I) THE SHAREHOLDER (OR HIS EXECUTOR OR ADMINISTRATOR) IS REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ANY TAX LIABILITY THAT WE INCUR AS A RESULT, (II) WE WILL HAVE A LIEN ON ANY DIVIDENDS OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDER BY US TO THE EXTENT OF THE TAX LIABILITY AND (III) IF ANY AMOUNTS NOT COVERED BY OUR LIEN ON DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS ARE OWED TO US BY THE SHAREHOLDER AS A RESULT OF OUR TAX LIABILITY, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO REGISTER ANY TRANSFER OF THE SHAREHOLDER S SHARES. 

THERE ARE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON THE OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. 

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT FSMA REGULATES THE ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF ANY U.K. INSURANCE COMPANY AUTHORIZED UNDER FSMA. ANY COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL THAT (TOGETHER WITH ITS OR HIS ASSOCIATES) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ACQUIRES 10 OR MORE OF THE SHARES OF A U.K. AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY, OR IS ENTITLED TO EXERCISE OR CONTROL THE EXERCISE OF 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER IN SUCH AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY, WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL FOR THE PURPOSES OF FSMA, AS WOULD A PERSON WHO HAD SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF SUCH AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY BY VIRTUE OF HIS SHAREHOLDING OR VOTING POWER IN EITHER. A PURCHASER OF MORE THAN 10 OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES WOULD THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF ENDURANCE U.K. UNDER THE FSMA, ANY PERSON PROPOSING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OVER A U.K. AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COM
PANY MUST NOTIFY THE FSA OF HIS INTENTION TO DO SO AND OBTAIN THE FSA S PRIOR APPROVAL. THE FSA WOULD THEN HAVE THREE MONTHS TO CONSIDER THAT PERSON S APPLICATION TO ACQUIRE CONTROL. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPROVE SUCH APPLICATION, THE FSA MUST BE SATISFIED BOTH THAT THE ACQUIRER IS A FIT AND PROPER PERSON TO HAVE SUCH CONTROL AND THAT THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS WOULD NOT BE THREATENED BY SUCH ACQUISITION OF CONTROL. FAILURE TO MAKE THE RELEVANT PRIOR APPLICATION WOULD CONSTITUTE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. 

STATE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICES OR REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL OF CHANGES IN CONTROL OF AN INSURER OR ITS HOLDING COMPANY. THE INSURANCE LAWS OF THE DOMICILIARY STATE PROVIDE THAT NO CORPORATION OR OTHER PERSON EXCEPT AN AUTHORIZED INSURER MAY ACQUIRE CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE COMPANY UNLESS IT HAS GIVEN NOTICE TO SUCH COMPANY AND OBTAINED PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OF THE DOMICILIARY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. ANY PURCHASER OF 10 OR MORE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO SUCH REGULATIONS AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO FILE CERTAIN NOTICES AND REPORTS WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS OF THE DOMICILIARY STATES OF OUR OPERATING COMPANIES. 

U.S. PERSONS WHO OWN OUR ORDINARY SHARES MAY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PROTECTING THEIR INTERESTS THAN U.S. PERSONS WHO ARE SHAREHOLDERS OF A U.S. CORPORATION. 

THE COMPANIES ACT, WHICH APPLIES TO ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA, DIFFERS IN CERTAIN MATERIAL RESPECTS FROM LAWS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO U.S. CORPORATIONS AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. THESE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THE MANNER IN WHICH DIRECTORS MUST DISCLOSE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN INTEREST, THE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS AND THE SCOPE OF INDEMNIFICATION AVAILABLE TO DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. 

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR BYE-LAWS COULD IMPEDE AN ATTEMPT TO REPLACE OR REMOVE OUR DIRECTORS, WHICH COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS BYE-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY ENTRENCH DIRECTORS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REPLACE DIRECTORS EVEN IF THE SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDER IT BENEFICIAL TO DO SO. IN ADDITION, THESE PROVISIONS COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL THAT A SHAREHOLDER MIGHT CONSIDER FAVORABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE PROVISIONS MAY PREVENT A SHAREHOLDER FROM RECEIVING THE BENEFIT FROM ANY PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES OFFERED BY A BIDDER IN A

POTENTIAL TAKEOVER. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ATTEMPT TO EFFECT A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT OR A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT, THESE PROVISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES IF THEY ARE VIEWED AS DISCOURAGING CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AND TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS IN THE FUTURE. 

IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS AGAINST US AND OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS A BERMUDA COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE RESIDENTS OF JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, AT ANY ONE TIME, ARE OR MAY BE LOCATED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES ON OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OR TO ENFORCE AGAINST US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS JUDGMENTS OF U.S. COURTS PREDICATED UPON CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. 

WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY APPLEBY, OUR BERMUDA COUNSEL, THAT THERE IS NO TREATY IN FORCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BERMUDA PROVIDING FOR THE RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS IN CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MATTERS. AS A RESULT, WHETHER A UNITED STATES JUDGMENT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE IN BERMUDA AGAINST US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE U.S. COURT THAT ENTERED THE JUDGMENT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE BERMUDA COURT AS HAVING JURISDICTION OVER US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO BERMUDA CONFLICT OF LAW RULES. 

IN ADDITION TO AND IRRESPECTIVE OF JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES, THE BERMUDA COURTS WILL NOT ENFORCE A UNITED STATES FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW THAT IS EITHER PENAL OR CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY. IT IS THE ADVICE OF APPLEBY THAT AN ACTION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO A PUBLIC OR PENAL LAW, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS THE ENFORCEMENT OF A SANCTION, POWER OR RIGHT AT THE INSTANCE OF THE STATE IN ITS SOVEREIGN CAPACITY, WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED BY A BERMUDA COURT. CERTAIN REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REMEDIES UNDER U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNDER BERMUDA LAW OR ENFORCEABLE IN A BERMUDA COURT, AS THEY WOULD BE CONTRARY TO BERMUDA PUBLIC POLICY. FURTHER, NO CLAIM MAY BE BROUGHT IN BERMUDA AGAINST US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR VIOLATION OF U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BECAUSE THESE LAWS HAVE NO EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION UNDER BERMUDA LAW AND DO NOT HAVE FORCE OF LAW IN BERMUDA. A BERMUDA C
OURT MAY, HOWEVER, IMPOSE CIVIL LIABILITY ON US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IF THE FACTS ALLEGED IN A COMPLAINT CONSTITUTE OR GIVE RISE TO A CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER BERMUDA LAW. 

RISKS RELATED TO TAXATION 

WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO TAXES IN BERMUDA AFTER MARCH 28, 2016, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

THE BERMUDA MINISTER OF FINANCE, UNDER THE EXEMPTED UNDERTAKINGS TAX PROTECTION ACT 1966, AS AMENDED, OF BERMUDA, HAS GIVEN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA AN ASSURANCE THAT IF ANY LEGISLATION IS ENACTED IN BERMUDA THAT WOULD IMPOSE TAX COMPUTED ON PROFITS OR INCOME OR COMPUTED ON ANY CAPITAL ASSET, GAIN OR APPRECIATION, OR ANY TAX IN THE NATURE OF ESTATE DUTY OR INHERITANCE TAX, THEN THE IMPOSITION OF ANY SUCH TAX WILL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OPERATIONS, SHARES, DEBENTURES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNTIL MARCH 28, 2016. GIVEN THE LIMITED DURATION OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE S ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AFTER MARCH 28, 2016 WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO BERMUDA TAXES. 

WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAX WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA ARE BERMUDA COMPANIES AND ENDURANCE U.K. IS AN ENGLISH COMPANY. ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND ENDURANCE U.K. EACH INTEND TO OPERATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NONE OF THESE COMPANIES WILL BE DEEMED TO BE ENGAGED IN THE CONDUCT OF A TRADE OR BUSINESS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE DEFINITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES WHICH CONSTITUTE BEING ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CODE, REGULATIONS OR COURT DECISIONS, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IRS MIGHT SUCCESSFULLY CONTEND THAT ANY OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND/OR ENDURANCE U.K. ARE/IS ENGAGED

IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. IF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND/OR ENDURANCE U.K. WERE ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IF ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA WERE TO QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS UNDER THE APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES, BUT SUCH TRADE OR BUSINESS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES (OR IN THE CASE OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA, WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENT INCOME, ARGUABLY EVEN IF SUCH INCOME WERE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ), ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE U.K. AND/OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES ON THE INCOME THAT IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH THE U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 30 BRANCH PROFITS TAX IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, IN WHICH CASE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND YOUR INVESTMENT COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSEL
Y AFFECTED. 

HOLDERS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WHO OWN 10 OR MORE OF OUR VOTING POWER MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION UNDER THE CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION CFC RULES. 

CERTAIN 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDERS OF A FOREIGN CORPORATION THAT IS CONSIDERED A CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION (A CFC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES MUST INCLUDE IN GROSS INCOME SUCH 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER S PRO RATA SHARE OF THE CFC S SUBPART F INCOME, EVEN IF THE SUBPART F INCOME IS NOT DISTRIBUTED. SEE MATERIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS UNITED STATES TAXATION OF HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE U.S. PERSONS CLASSIFICATION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA AS A CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION. DUE TO THE DISPERSION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS SHARE OWNERSHIP AMONG HOLDERS, ITS BYE-LAW PROVISIONS THAT IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE CONCENTRATION OF VOTING POWER OF ITS
 SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE AND AUTHORIZE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS TO PURCHASE SUCH SHARES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AND OTHER FACTORS, NO U.S. PERSON THAT OWNS SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO TREATMENT AS A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OF A CFC. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS COULD CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROVISIONS AND THAT A COURT COULD SUSTAIN SUCH A CHALLENGE. ACCORDINGLY, INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE CFC RULES TO AN INVESTMENT IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. 

U.S. PERSONS WHO HOLD ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON THEIR PRO RATA SHARE OF OUR RELATED PARTY INSURANCE INCOME RPII ). 

THE CFC RULES APPLY TO CERTAIN INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES THAT EARN RPII. IF THE RPII RULES WERE TO APPLY TO ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA, A U.S. PERSON WHO OWNS ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES ON THE LAST DAY OF THE TAXABLE YEAR WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE IN ITS INCOME FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THE SHAREHOLDER S PRO RATA SHARE OF ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S RPII FOR THE ENTIRE TAXABLE YEAR, DETERMINED AS IF SUCH RPII WERE DISTRIBUTED PROPORTIONATELY TO SUCH U.S. SHAREHOLDERS AT THAT DATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH INCOME IS DISTRIBUTED. IN ADDITION, ANY RPII THAT IS INCLUDIBLE IN THE INCOME OF A U.S. TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION WOULD BE TREATED AS UNRELATED BUSINESS TAXABLE INCOME. ALTHOUGH ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA INTEND TO GENERALLY OPERATE IN A MANNER SO AS TO QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE RPII RULES, T
HERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE EXCEPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT U.S. PERSONS WHO OWN ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE GROSS INCOME INCLUSIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RPII. SEE MATERIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS UNITED STATES TAXATION OF HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE U.S. PERSONS RPII COMPANIES; RPII EXCEPTIONS. 

THE RPII RULES PROVIDE THAT IF A SHAREHOLDER WHO IS A U.S. PERSON DISPOSES OF SHARES IN A FOREIGN INSURANCE CORPORATION THAT HAS RPII AND IN WHICH U.S. PERSONS COLLECTIVELY OWN 25 OR MORE OF THE SHARES, ANY GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION WILL GENERALLY BE TREATED AS ORDINARY INCOME TO THE EXTENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER S SHARE OF THE CORPORATION S UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AND PROFITS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE SHAREHOLDER OWNED THE SHARES (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EARNINGS AND PROFITS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO RPII). IN ADDITION, SUCH A SHAREHOLDER WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN REPORTING 
 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REQUIREMENTS, REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF SHARES OWNED BY THE SHAREHOLDER. THESE RULES SHOULD NOT APPLY TO DISPOSITIONS OF ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES BECAUSE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS WILL NOT ITSELF BE DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. THE RPII PROVISIONS, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS OR THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, AND REGULATIONS INTERPRETING THE RPII PROVISIONS OF THE CODE EXIST ONLY IN PROPOSED FORM. ACCORDINGLY, THE IRS MIGHT INTERPRET THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND THE APPLICABLE PROPOSED REGULATIONS MAY BE PROMULGATED IN FINAL FORM IN A MANNER THAT WOULD CAUSE THESE RULES TO APPLY TO DISPOSITIONS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES.

PREFERRED SHARES; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE APPLICATION OF RPII. 

U.S. PERSONS WHO HOLD ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES IF WE ARE CONSIDERED A PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY (A PFIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. 

WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A PFIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME PURPOSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. MOREOVER, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO CONDUCT OUR ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO BECOME A PFIC IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE THIS POSITION OR THAT A COURT WILL NOT SUSTAIN SUCH CHALLENGE. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD BE DEEMED A PFIC BY THE IRS OR A COURT FOR THE 2007 YEAR OR ANY FUTURE YEAR. IF WE WERE CONSIDERED A PFIC, IT COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR AN INVESTOR THAT IS SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION, INCLUDING SUBJECTING THE INVESTOR TO A GREATER TAX LIABILITY THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE APPLY OR SUBJECTING THE INVESTOR TO TAX ON AMOUNTS IN ADVANCE OF WHEN TAX WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSED. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO REGULATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE PFIC PROVISIONS TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY. NEW REGULATIONS OR PRONOUNCEMENTS INTERPRE
TING OR CLARIFYING THESE RULES MAY BE FORTHCOMING. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, SUCH GUIDANCE WOULD HAVE ON A SHAREHOLDER THAT IS SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION.

REGULATORY MATTERS 

GENERAL 

THE BUSINESS OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE IS REGULATED IN MOST COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH THE DEGREE AND TYPE OF REGULATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER. REINSURERS ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO LESS DIRECT REGULATION THAN PRIMARY INSURERS. 

BERMUDA 

THE INSURANCE ACT 1978 OF BERMUDA AND RELATED REGULATIONS, AS AMENDED (THE INSURANCE ACT ), REGULATES THE INSURANCE BUSINESS OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND PROVIDES THAT NO PERSON MAY CARRY ON ANY INSURANCE BUSINESS IN OR FROM WITHIN BERMUDA UNLESS REGISTERED AS AN INSURER BY THE BERMUDA MONETARY AUTHORITY BMA UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT. ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS REGISTERED AS A CLASS 4 INSURER BY THE BMA; HOWEVER, AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS NOT SUBJECT TO BERMUDA INSURANCE REGULATIONS. INSURANCE, AS WELL AS REINSURANCE, IS REGULATED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT. THE BMA, IN DECIDING WHETHER TO GRANT REGISTRATION, HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO ACT AS IT THINKS FIT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE BMA IS REQUIRED BY THE INSURANCE ACT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS A FIT AND PROPER BODY TO BE ENGAGED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND, IN PARTICULAR, WHETHER (A) IT HAS FULFILLED THE MINIMUM CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO THE
 BODY CORPORATE, (B) IT HAS, OR HAS AVAILABLE TO IT, ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO OPERATE AN INSURANCE BUSINESS AND (C) THE PREMISES INTENDED TO BE USED IN THE BUSINESS ARE ADEQUATE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS. THE CONTINUED REGISTRATION OF AN APPLICANT AS AN INSURER IS SUBJECT TO IT COMPLYING WITH THE TERMS OF ITS REGISTRATION AND SUCH OTHER CONDITIONS AS THE BMA MAY IMPOSE FROM TIME TO TIME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 AN INSURANCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE BERMUDA MINISTER OF FINANCE (THE MINISTER ADVISES THE BMA ON MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE DISCHARGE OF THE BMA S FUNCTIONS. SUB-COMMITTEES OF THE INSURANCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SUPERVISE AND REVIEW THE LAW AND PRACTICE OF INSURANCE IN BERMUDA, INCLUDING REVIEWS OF ACCOUNTING AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. THE DAY-TO-DAY SUPERVISION OF INSURERS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BMA. 

THE INSURANCE ACT ALSO IMPOSES ON BERMUDA INSURANCE COMPANIES SOLVENCY AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS AND AUDITING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND GRANTS THE BMA POWERS TO SUPERVISE, INVESTIGATE, REQUIRE INFORMATION AND THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE BERMUDA INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE SET FORTH BELOW. 

THE BMA UTILIZES A RISK BASED APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO LICENSING AND SUPERVISING INSURANCE COMPANIES IN BERMUDA. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BMA S RISK BASED APPROACH WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ENDURANCE BERMUDA S OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THE BMA S RISK BASED SYSTEM, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INHERENT RISKS WITHIN EACH PARTICULAR CLASS OF INSURER IS UTILIZED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO DETERMINE THE LIMITATIONS AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED. THEREAFTER THE BMA KEEPS ITS ANALYSIS OF RELATIVE RISK WITHIN INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER REVIEW ON AN ONGOING BASIS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE SCRUTINY OF REGULAR AUDITED STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MEETING WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT DURING ONSITE VISITS. THE INITIAL MEETINGS WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ANY PROPOSED ONSITE VISIT WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS UPON COMPANIES THAT ARE LICENSED AS CLASS 3 AND CLASS 4 INSURERS. THE BMA HAS ALSO RECENTLY ADOPTED GUIDANCE NOTES, OR THE GUIDANCE N
OTES, AND STATEMENTS OF PRINCIPLES, OR THE PRINCIPLES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THOSE OPERATING IN BERMUDA HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF, AND THE BMA S APPROACH IN IMPLEMENTING, THE INSURANCE ACT. THE BMA ALSO INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT A CODE OF CONDUCT, OR THE CODE OF CONDUCT, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FORGOING. 

CLASSIFICATION OF INSURERS 

THE INSURANCE ACT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN INSURERS CARRYING ON LONG-TERM BUSINESS AND INSURERS CARRYING ON GENERAL BUSINESS. THERE ARE FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS OF INSURERS CARRYING ON GENERAL BUSINESS, WITH CLASS 4 INSURERS SUBJECT TO THE STRICTEST REGULATION. ENDURANCE BERMUDA, WHICH IS INCORPORATED TO CARRY ON GENERAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS, IS REGISTERED AS A CLASS 4 INSURER IN BERMUDA AND IS REGULATED AS SUCH UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT. ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS NOT LICENSED TO CARRY ON LONG-TERM BUSINESS. 

CANCELLATION OF INSURER S REGISTRATION 

AN INSURER S REGISTRATION MAY BE CANCELED BY THE BMA ON CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN THE INSURANCE ACT, INCLUDING FAILURE OF THE INSURER TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT OR IF, IN THE OPINION OF THE BMA, THE INSURER HAS NOT BEEN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOUND INSURANCE PRINCIPLES. 

PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE 

AN INSURER IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A PRINCIPAL OFFICE IN BERMUDA AND TO APPOINT AND MAINTAIN A PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE IN BERMUDA. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE INSURANCE ACT, ENDURANCE BERMUDA S PRINCIPAL OFFICE IS ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN PEMBROKE, BERMUDA. MICHAEL J. MCGUIRE HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA S PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BMA. WITHOUT A REASON ACCEPTABLE TO THE BMA, AN INSURER MAY NOT TERMINATE THE APPOINTMENT OF ITS PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE, AND THE PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY NOT CEASE TO ACT AS SUCH, UNLESS 30 DAYS NOTICE IN WRITING TO BMA IS GIVEN OF THE INTENTION TO DO SO. A PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE SHALL FORTHWITH NOTIFY THE BMA, IN SUCH A MANNER AS IT MAY DIRECT, ON HIS REACHING A VIEW THAT THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD OF THE INSURER FOR WHICH HE ACTS BECOMING INSOLVENT OR CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS SET FORTH IN THE INSURANCE ACT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FAILURE BY THE INSURER TO 
COMPLY SUBSTANTIALLY WITH A CONDITION IMPOSED UPON THE INSURER BY THE BMA RELATING TO A SOLVENCY MARGIN OR LIQUIDITY OR OTHER RATIO WOULD BE A REPORTABLE EVENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 INDEPENDENT APPROVED AUDITOR 

EVERY REGISTERED INSURER MUST APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR WHO WILL AUDIT AND REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN OF THE INSURER, BOTH OF WHICH, IN THE CASE OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA, ARE REQUIRED TO BE FILED ANNUALLY WITH THE BMA. ENDURANCE BERMUDA S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BMA AND MAY BE THE SAME PERSON OR FIRM THAT AUDITS ENDURANCE HOLDINGS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORTS FOR PRESENTATION TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. 

LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST 

AS A REGISTERED CLASS 4 INSURER, ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN OPINION OF ITS APPROVED LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST WITH ITS STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN IN RESPECT OF ITS LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES PROVISIONS. THE LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST, WHO WILL NORMALLY BE A QUALIFIED CASUALTY ACTUARY, MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BMA. MICHAEL E. ANGELINA, CHIEF ACTUARY AND RISK OFFICER FOR THE COMPANY, HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BMA TO ACT AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA S LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST. 

STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

AN INSURER MUST PREPARE ANNUAL STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE INSURANCE ACT PRESCRIBES RULES FOR THE PREPARATION AND SUBSTANCE OF THESE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (WHICH INCLUDE, IN STATUTORY FORM, A BALANCE SHEET, AN INCOME STATEMENT, A STATEMENT OF CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AND NOTES THERETO). THE INSURER IS REQUIRED TO GIVE DETAILED INFORMATION AND ANALYSES REGARDING PREMIUMS, CLAIMS, REINSURANCE AND INVESTMENTS. THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP AND ARE DISTINCT FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE INSURER S SHAREHOLDERS UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN THE CASE OF THE COMPANY, WILL BE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. AS A GENERAL BUSINESS INSURER, ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE ANNUAL STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF THE ANNUAL STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN. THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN DO
 NOT FORM PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS MAINTAINED BY BMA. 

IT SHOULD BE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE BMA IS SEEKING TO MOVE CLOSER TO COMPLYING WITH THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS INSURANCE BY PROPOSING THAT CLASS 4 INSURERS, SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA, FILE AUDITED GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH THE BMA TO BE PUBLISHED PUBLICLY. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE AUDITED GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BE FILED WITH THE ANNUAL STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN. ENDURANCE BERMUDA, ALONG WITH MOST CLASS 4 INSURERS, HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE BMA TO VOLUNTARILY FILE ITS AUDITED GAAP FINANCIALS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 WITH THE BMA AND PROVIDE THE BMA WITH A RELEASE TO MAKE SUCH STATEMENTS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. ENDURANCE BERMUDA INTENDS TO ACCOMMODATE BOTH REQUESTS. 

ANNUAL STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN 

ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS REQUIRED TO FILE WITH THE BMA A STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN NO LATER THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER ITS FINANCIAL YEAR END (UNLESS SPECIFICALLY EXTENDED UPON APPLICATION TO THE BMA). THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN FOR A CLASS 4 INSURER INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, A REPORT OF THE APPROVED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR ON THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE INSURER, SOLVENCY CERTIFICATES, THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE OPINION OF THE LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST AND A SCHEDULE OF REINSURANCE CEDED. THE SOLVENCY CERTIFICATES MUST BE SIGNED BY THE PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE AND AT LEAST TWO DIRECTORS OF THE INSURER CERTIFYING THAT THE MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN HAS BEEN MET AND WHETHER THE INSURER COMPLIED WITH THE CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO ITS CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION. THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR IS REQUIRED TO STATE WHETHER, IN ITS OPINION, IT WAS REASONABLE FOR THE DIRECTORS TO MAKE THESE CERTIFICATIONS. IF AN INSURER S ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR 
ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INSURANCE ACT, A STATEMENT TO THAT EFFECT MUST BE FILED WITH THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL RETURN.

 MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 

UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT, THE VALUE OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS ASSETS OF A CLASS 4 INSURER, SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA, MUST EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF ITS GENERAL BUSINESS LIABILITIES BY AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE PRESCRIBED MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN. 

ENDURANCE BERMUDA: 

1. 
 IS REQUIRED, WITH RESPECT TO ITS GENERAL BUSINESS, TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF: 

A. 
 100,000,000; 

B. 
 50 OF NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN (BEING GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN LESS ANY PREMIUMS CEDED BY ENDURANCE BERMUDA, BUT ENDURANCE BERMUDA MAY NOT DEDUCT MORE THAN 25 OF GROSS PREMIUMS WHEN COMPUTING NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN); OR 

C. 
 15 OF NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES; 

2. 
 IS PROHIBITED FROM DECLARING OR PAYING ANY DIVIDENDS DURING ANY FINANCIAL YEAR IF IT IS IN BREACH OF ITS MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN OR MINIMUM LIQUIDITY RATIO OR IF THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS WOULD CAUSE IT TO FAIL TO MEET SUCH MARGIN OR RATIO (AND IF IT HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN OR MINIMUM LIQUIDITY RATIO ON THE LAST DAY OF ANY FINANCIAL YEAR, ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL BE PROHIBITED, WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE BMA, FROM DECLARING OR PAYING ANY DIVIDENDS DURING THE NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR); 

3. 
 IS PROHIBITED FROM DECLARING OR PAYING IN ANY FINANCIAL YEAR DIVIDENDS OF MORE THAN 25 OF ITS TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS (AS SHOWN ON ITS PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR S STATUTORY BALANCE SHEET) UNLESS IT FILES WITH THE BMA (AT LEAST 7 DAYS BEFORE PAYMENT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS) AN AFFIDAVIT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THE REQUIRED MARGINS; 

4. 
 IS PROHIBITED, WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE BMA, FROM REDUCING BY 15 OR MORE ITS TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AS SET OUT IN ITS PREVIOUS YEAR S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND ANY APPLICATION FOR SUCH APPROVAL MUST INCLUDE AN AFFIDAVIT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THE REQUIRED MARGINS; AND 

5. 
 IS REQUIRED, AT ANY TIME IT FAILS TO MEET ITS SOLVENCY MARGIN, WITHIN 30 DAYS (45 DAYS WHERE TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS FALLS TO 75 MILLION OR LESS) AFTER BECOMING AWARE OF THAT FAILURE OR HAVING REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH FAILURE HAS OCCURRED, TO FILE WITH THE BMA A WRITTEN REPORT CONTAINING CERTAIN INFORMATION. 

ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA MAY ONLY DECLARE OR PAY A DIVIDEND IF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA, AS THE CASE MAY BE, HAS NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT IT IS, OR WOULD AFTER THE PAYMENT BE, UNABLE TO PAY ITS LIABILITIES AS THEY BECOME DUE, OR IF THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS WOULD NOT BE LESS THAN THE AGGREGATE OF ITS LIABILITIES AND ITS ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNTS. 

THE BMA HAS PROPOSED AMENDING THE MINIMUM SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASS 4 INSURERS SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA AS THE BMA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CURRENT SOLVENCY MARGIN CALCULATION DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT CERTAIN LINES OR CLASSES OF BUSINESS ARE INHERENTLY RISKIER THAN OTHERS. IN AN AIM TO ENSURE THAT MAXIMUM PROTECTION IS AFFORDED TO POLICYHOLDERS, THE BMA INTENDS TO INTRODUCE A RISK-BASED CAPITAL MODEL (BERMUDA SOLVENCY CAPITAL REQUIREMENT OR BSCR) AS A TOOL TO ASSIST BOTH IN MEASURING RISK AND DETERMINING APPROPRIATE CAPITALIZATION OF AN INSURER. THE BMA HAS STATED ITS INTENT TO PROPOSE TO THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT THAT FORMAL LEGISLATION BE ADOPTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 TO APPLY THE BSCR STANDARDS TO CLASS 4 INSURERS, TO COME INTO FORCE FOR THE YEAR-END 2008 FILINGS. 

THE BMA HAS RECENTLY REQUIRED MOST CLASS 4 INSURERS INCLUDING, ENDURANCE BERMUDA, TO FILE THE BSCR FOR ITS 2007 YEAR-END.

 MINIMUM LIQUIDITY RATIO 

THE INSURANCE ACT PROVIDES A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY RATIO FOR GENERAL BUSINESS INSURERS, LIKE ENDURANCE BERMUDA. AN INSURER ENGAGED IN GENERAL BUSINESS IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF ITS RELEVANT ASSETS AT NOT LESS THAN 75 OF THE AMOUNT OF ITS RELEVANT LIABILITIES. RELEVANT ASSETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CASH AND TIME DEPOSITS, QUOTED INVESTMENTS, UNQUOTED BONDS AND DEBENTURES, FIRST LIENS ON REAL ESTATE, INVESTMENT INCOME DUE AND ACCRUED, ACCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE, REINSURANCE BALANCES RECEIVABLE AND FUNDS HELD BY CEDING REINSURERS. THERE ARE CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF ASSETS WHICH, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED BY THE BMA, DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY AS RELEVANT ASSETS, SUCH AS UNQUOTED EQUITY SECURITIES, INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES AND REAL ESTATE AND COLLATERAL LOANS. THE RELEVANT LIABILITIES ARE TOTAL GENERAL BUSINESS INSURANCE RESERVES AND TOTAL OTHER LIABILITIES LESS DEFERRED INCOME TAX AND SUNDRY LIABILITIES (BY INTERPRETATION
, THOSE NOT SPECIFICALLY DEFINED), LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES. 

SUPERVISION, INVESTIGATION AND INTERVENTION 

THE BMA MAY APPOINT AN INSPECTOR WITH EXTENSIVE POWERS TO INVESTIGATE THE AFFAIRS OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA IF THE BMA BELIEVES THAT SUCH AN INVESTIGATION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ITS POLICYHOLDERS OR PERSONS WHO MAY BECOME POLICYHOLDERS. IN ORDER TO VERIFY OR SUPPLEMENT INFORMATION OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO THE BMA, THE BMA MAY DIRECT ENDURANCE BERMUDA TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS OR INFORMATION RELATING TO MATTERS CONNECTED WITH ITS BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE BMA HAS THE POWER TO REQUIRE THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM ANY PERSON WHO APPEARS TO BE IN POSSESSION OF SUCH DOCUMENTS. FURTHER, THE BMA HAS THE POWER, IN RESPECT OF A PERSON REGISTERED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT, TO APPOINT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON TO PREPARE A REPORT ON ANY ASPECT OF ANY MATTER ABOUT WHICH THE BMA HAS REQUIRED OR COULD REQUIRE INFORMATION. IF IT APPEARS TO THE BMA TO BE DESIRABLE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE CLIENTS OF A PERSON REGISTERED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT, THE BMA MAY ALSO EXERCISE THESE POWERS IN RE
LATION TO ANY COMPANY WHICH IS OR HAS AT ANY RELEVANT TIME BEEN (A) A PARENT COMPANY, SUBSIDIARY COMPANY OR RELATED COMPANY OF THAT REGISTERED PERSON, (B) A SUBSIDIARY COMPANY OF A PARENT COMPANY OF THAT REGISTERED PERSON, (C) A PARENT COMPANY OF A SUBSIDIARY COMPANY OF THAT REGISTERED PERSON OR (D) A COMPANY IN THE CASE OF WHICH A SHAREHOLDER CONTROLLER OF THAT REGISTERED PERSON, EITHER ALONE OR WITH ANY ASSOCIATE OR ASSOCIATES, HOLDS 50 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE SHARES OR IS ENTITLED TO EXERCISE, OR CONTROL THE EXERCISE, OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTING POWER AT A GENERAL MEETING. 

IF IT APPEARS TO THE BMA THAT THERE IS A RISK OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA BECOMING INSOLVENT, OR THAT ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS IN BREACH OF THE INSURANCE ACT OR ANY CONDITIONS IMPOSED UPON ITS REGISTRATION, THE BMA MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DIRECT ENDURANCE BERMUDA (I) NOT TO EFFECT FURTHER CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE, OR ANY CONTRACT OF INSURANCE OF A SPECIFIED DESCRIPTION; (II) TO LIMIT THE AGGREGATE OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE WRITTEN BY IT DURING A SPECIFIED PERIOD BEGINNING NOT EARLIER THAN 28 DAYS AFTER THE DIRECTION IS GIVEN; (III) NOT TO VARY ANY CONTRACT OF INSURANCE IN FORCE WHEN THE DIRECTION IS GIVEN, IF THE EFFECT OF THE VARIATION WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE LIABILITIES OF THE INSURER; (IV) NOT TO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT OF A SPECIFIED CLASS; (V) BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF A SPECIFIED PERIOD (OR SUCH LONGER PERIOD AS THE BMA MAY ALLOW) TO REALIZE ANY EXISTING INVESTMENT OF A SPECIFIED CLASS; (VI) NOT TO DECLARE OR PAY ANY DIVIDENDS OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS, OR TO RESTRICT THE MA
KING OF SUCH PAYMENTS TO SUCH EXTENT AS THE BMA THINKS FIT; (VII) NOT TO ENTER INTO ANY SPECIFIED TRANSACTION WITH ANY SPECIFIED PERSON OR PERSONS OF A SPECIFIED CLASS; (VIII) TO PROVIDE SUCH WRITTEN PARTICULARS RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INSURER AS THE BMA THINKS FIT; AND (IX) TO OBTAIN THE OPINION OF A LOSS RESERVE SPECIALIST WITH RESPECT TO GENERAL BUSINESS, OR AN ACTUARIAL OPINION WITH RESPECT TO LONG-TERM BUSINESS, AND TO SUBMIT IT TO THE BMA WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME. 

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 

IN ADDITION TO POWERS UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT TO INVESTIGATE THE AFFAIRS OF AN INSURER, THE BMA MAY REQUIRE CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM AN INSURER (OR CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS) TO BE PRODUCED TO THEM. FURTHER, THE BMA HAS BEEN GIVEN POWERS TO ASSIST OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WITH THEIR INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

COMPANIES IN BERMUDA BUT SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BMA MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THE ASSISTANCE BEING REQUESTED IS IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISCHARGE OF REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FURTHER, THE BMA MUST CONSIDER WHETHER COOPERATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE GROUNDS FOR DISCLOSURE ARE LIMITED AND THE INSURANCE ACT PROVIDES SANCTIONS FOR BREACH OF THE STATUTORY DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY. 

UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, THE MINISTER HAS BEEN GIVEN POWERS TO ASSIST A FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY WHICH HAS REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH ENQUIRIES BEING CARRIED OUT BY IT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. THE MINISTER S POWERS INCLUDE REQUIRING A PERSON TO FURNISH HIM WITH INFORMATION, TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS TO HIM, TO ATTEND AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND TO GIVE ASSISTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH ENQUIRIES. THE MINISTER MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THE ASSISTANCE REQUESTED BY THE FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ITS REGULATORY FUNCTIONS AND THAT THE REQUEST IS IN RELATION TO INFORMATION IN BERMUDA WHICH A PERSON HAS IN HIS POSSESSION OR UNDER HIS CONTROL. THE MINISTER MUST CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO GIVE THE INFORMATION SOUGHT. 

BERMUDA GUIDANCE NOTES 

THE BMA HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE NOTES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE INSURANCE ACT IN RESPECT OF THE DUTIES, REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS TO BE COMPLIED WITH BY PERSONS REGISTERED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT OR OTHERWISE REGULATED UNDER IT AND THE PROCEDURES AND SOUND PRINCIPLES TO BE OBSERVED BY SUCH PERSONS AND BY AUDITORS, PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVES AND LOSS RESERVE SPECIALISTS. IN MARCH 2005, THE BMA ISSUED THE GUIDANCE NOTES THROUGH ITS WEB SITE AT WWW.BMA.BM, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ROLES OF THE PRINCIPAL REPRESENTATIVE, APPROVED AUDITOR, AND APPROVED ACTUARY AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR BERMUDA INSURERS. THE BMA HAS STATED THAT THE GUIDANCE NOTES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS REFLECTING THE MINIMUM STANDARD THAT THE BMA EXPECTS INSURERS SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES TO OBSERVE AT ALL TIMES. 

BERMUDA STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES 

IN JUNE 2007, THE BMA PURSUANT TO SECTION 2A OF THE INSURANCE ACT INTRODUCED THE PRINCIPLES. THE PRINCIPLES RELATE TO THE BMA S DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO REGISTER AN ENTITY, TO CANCEL THE REGISTRATION OF A REGISTERED ENTITY, TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS UPON A REGISTRATION, OR TO GIVE CERTAIN DIRECTIONS TO A REGISTERED ENTITY. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE OF GENERAL APPLICATION AND SEEK TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE WIDE DIVERSITY OF REGISTERED ENTITIES THAT MAY BE LICENSED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT, AS WELL AS RELEVANT INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS. 

CODE OF CONDUCT 

THE BMA PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT A CODE OF CONDUCT WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE STANDARDS, DUTIES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT A REGISTERED PERSON S (WHICH INCLUDES AN INSURER) INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MUST PROVIDE FOR IN RELATION TO MATTERS SUCH AS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, RISK ASSESSMENT, RISK AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET CONDUCT. THE BMA WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHETHER A RELEVANT INSURER SUCH AS ENDURANCE BERMUDA COMPLIES WITH THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND AS SUCH IS INDEED CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS IN A PRUDENT MANNER AS REQUIRED UNDER THE INSURANCE ACT. THE BMA HAS PUBLISHED ITS PROPOSED APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR REGISTERED PERSONS ON ITS WEBSITE AT WWW.BMA.BM. 

CONTROLLER NOTIFICATION 

EACH SHAREHOLDER OR PROSPECTIVE SHAREHOLDER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE BMA IN WRITING WITHIN 45 DAYS OF HIS BECOMING A CONTROLLER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF 10 , 20 , 33 OR 50 OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ULTIMATELY ENDURANCE BERMUDA. THE BMA MAY SERVE A NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON ANY CONTROLLER OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA IF IT APPEARS TO THE BMA THAT THE PERSON IS NO LONGER FIT AND PROPER TO BE SUCH A CONTROLLER. ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE BMA OF THE FACT THAT ANY PERSON HAS BECOME OR CEASES TO BE 10 , 20 , 33 OR 50 CONTROLLER OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA. THE NOTICE HAS TO BE GIVEN WITHIN 45 DAYS OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA BECOMING AWARE OF THE RELEVANT FACTS.

 CERTAIN OTHER BERMUDA LAW CONSIDERATIONS 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL EACH ALSO NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANIES ACT REGULATING THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND MAKING OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS. A COMPANY IS PROHIBITED FROM DECLARING OR PAYING A DIVIDEND, OR MAKING A DISTRIBUTION OUT OF CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS, IF THERE ARE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT: (A) THE COMPANY IS, OR WOULD AFTER THE PAYMENT BE, UNABLE TO PAY ITS LIABILITIES AS THEY BECOME DUE; OR (B) THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COMPANY S ASSETS WOULD THEREBY BE LESS THAN THE AGGREGATE OF ITS LIABILITIES AND ITS ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNTS. 

ALTHOUGH ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS INCORPORATED IN BERMUDA, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A NON-RESIDENT OF BERMUDA FOR EXCHANGE CONTROL PURPOSES BY THE BMA. PURSUANT TO ITS NON-RESIDENT STATUS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA MAY ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN BERMUDA DOLLARS AND THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS (OTHER THAN FUNDS DENOMINATED IN BERMUDA DOLLARS) IN AND OUT OF BERMUDA OR TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS WHO ARE HOLDERS OF ITS ORDINARY SHARES. 

UNDER BERMUDA LAW, EXEMPTED COMPANIES ARE COMPANIES FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS OUTSIDE BERMUDA FROM A PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN BERMUDA. AS EXEMPTED COMPANIES, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA MAY NOT, WITHOUT THE EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION OF THE BERMUDA LEGISLATURE OR UNDER A LICENSE OR CONSENT GRANTED BY THE MINISTER, PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING: (1) THE ACQUISITION OR HOLDING OF LAND IN BERMUDA (EXCEPT THAT HELD BY WAY OF LEASE OR TENANCY AGREEMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR ITS BUSINESS AND HELD FOR A TERM NOT EXCEEDING 50 YEARS, OR WHICH IS USED TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION OR RECREATIONAL FACILITIES FOR ITS OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES AND HELD WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MINISTER, FOR A TERM NOT EXCEEDING 21 YEARS); (2) THE TAKING OF MORTGAGES ON LAND IN BERMUDA TO SECURE AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF 50,000; (3) TO ACQUIRE ANY BONDS OR DEBENTURES SECURED ON ANY LAND IN BERMUDA EXCEPT BONDS OR DEB
ENTURES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA OR A PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR (4) THE CARRYING ON OF BUSINESS OF ANY KIND FOR WHICH IT IS NOT LICENSED IN BERMUDA, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS DOING BUSINESS WITH ANOTHER EXEMPTED UNDERTAKING IN FURTHERANCE OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS BUSINESS OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S BUSINESS (AS THE CASE MAY BE) CARRIED ON OUTSIDE BERMUDA. ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS A LICENSED INSURER IN BERMUDA, AND SO MAY CARRY ON ACTIVITIES FROM BERMUDA THAT ARE RELATED TO AND IN SUPPORT OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS. 

SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN BERMUDA ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE INVESTMENT BUSINESS ACT 2003, AND EXCHANGE CONTROL ACT 1972, AND RELATED REGULATIONS OF BERMUDA WHICH REGULATE THE SALE OF SECURITIES IN BERMUDA. IN ADDITION, SPECIFIC PERMISSION IS REQUIRED FROM THE BMA, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXCHANGE CONTROL ACT 1972 AND RELATED REGULATIONS, FOR ALL ISSUANCES AND TRANSFERS OF SECURITIES OF BERMUDA COMPANIES, OTHER THAN IN CASES WHERE THE BMA HAS GRANTED A GENERAL PERMISSION. THE BMA, IN ITS POLICY DATED JUNE 1, 2005, PROVIDES THAT WHERE ANY EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE OUR ORDINARY SHARES, OF A BERMUDA COMPANY ARE LISTED ON AN APPOINTED STOCK EXCHANGE (THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE IS DEEMED TO BE AN APPOINTED STOCK EXCHANGE UNDER BERMUDA LAW), GENERAL PERMISSION IS HEREBY GIVEN FOR THE ISSUE AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER OF ANY SECURITIES OF A COMPANY FROM AND/OR TO A NON RESIDENT, FOR AS LONG AS ANY EQUITY SECUR
ITIES OF THE COMPANY REMAIN SO LISTED. 

NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE GENERAL PERMISSION, THE BMA HAS GRANTED US PERMISSION TO, SUBJECT TO OUR ORDINARY OR VOTING SHARES BEING LISTED ON AN APPOINTED STOCK EXCHANGE, ISSUE, GRANT, CREATE, SELL AND TRANSFER ANY OF OUR SHARES, STOCK, BONDS, NOTES (OTHER THAN PROMISSORY NOTES), DEBENTURES, DEBENTURE STOCK, UNITS UNDER A UNIT TRUST SCHEME, SHARES IN AN OIL ROYALTY, OPTIONS, WARRANTS, COUPONS, RIGHTS AND DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS, COLLECTIVELY, THE SECURITIES , TO AND AMONG PERSONS WHO ARE EITHER RESIDENT OR NON-RESIDENT OF BERMUDA FOR EXCHANGE CONTROL PURPOSES, WHETHER OR NOT THE SECURITIES (EXCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, OUR ORDINARY OR VOTING SHARES) ARE LISTED ON AN APPOINTED STOCK EXCHANGE. 

THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN EXEMPTED ENTITIES LIKE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA THAT ARE BASED IN BERMUDA, BUT DO NOT OPERATE IN COMPETITION WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES. AS WELL AS HAVING NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE DEGREE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA ARE NOT CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO TAXES COMPUTED

ON PROFITS OR INCOME OR COMPUTED ON ANY CAPITAL ASSET, GAIN OR APPRECIATION, OR ANY TAX IN THE NATURE OF ESTATE DUTY OR INHERITANCE TAX OR TO ANY FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN BERMUDA. SEE MATERIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS CERTAIN BERMUDA TAX CONSIDERATIONS. 

UNDER BERMUDA LAW, NON-BERMUDIANS (OTHER THAN SPOUSES OF BERMUDIANS OR PERMANENT RESIDENT CARD PRC HOLDERS) MAY NOT ENGAGE IN ANY GAINFUL OCCUPATION IN BERMUDA WITHOUT A WORK PERMIT ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION. WORK PERMITS MAY BE GRANTED OR EXTENDED BY THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT UPON SHOWING THAT, AFTER PROPER PUBLIC ADVERTISEMENT IN MOST CASES, NO BERMUDIAN (OR SPOUSE OF A BERMUDIAN OR PRC HOLDER) IS AVAILABLE WHO MEETS THE MINIMUM STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ADVERTISED POSITION. IN APRIL 2001, THE BERMUDA GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A POLICY THAT PLACES SIX-YEAR TERM LIMITS ON INDIVIDUALS WORK, WITH CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR KEY EMPLOYEES. 

U.K. REGULATION 

GENERAL 

ON DECEMBER 1, 2001, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY FSA ASSUMED ITS FULL POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE SINGLE STATUTORY REGULATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RESPECT OF THE CARRYING ON OF REGULATED ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING DEPOSIT TAKING, INSURANCE, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND MOST OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS BY WAY OF BUSINESS IN THE U.K.), WITH THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING CONFIDENCE IN THE U.K. FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PROVIDING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM, SECURING THE PROPER DEGREE OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS AND HELPING TO REDUCE FINANCIAL CRIME. IT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE FOR ANY PERSON TO CARRY ON A REGULATED ACTIVITY IN THE U.K. UNLESS THAT PERSON IS AUTHORIZED BY THE FSA AND HAS BEEN GRANTED PERMISSION TO CARRY ON THAT REGULATED ACTIVITY OR FALLS UNDER AN EXEMPTION. 

INSURANCE BUSINESS (WHICH INCLUDES REINSURANCE BUSINESS) IS AUTHORIZED AND SUPERVISED BY THE FSA. INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO MAIN CATEGORIES: LONG-TERM INSURANCE (WHICH IS PRIMARILY INVESTMENT-RELATED) AND GENERAL INSURANCE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO BE AUTHORIZED IN BOTH LONG-TERM AND GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS. THESE TWO CATEGORIES ARE BOTH DIVIDED INTO CLASSES (FOR EXAMPLE: PERMANENT HEALTH AND PENSION FUND MANAGEMENT ARE TWO CLASSES OF LONG-TERM INSURANCE; DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND MOTOR VEHICLE LIABILITY ARE TWO CLASSES OF GENERAL INSURANCE). UNDER THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT 2000, EFFECTING OR CARRYING OUT CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE, WITHIN A CLASS OF GENERAL OR LONG-TERM INSURANCE, BY WAY OF BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSTITUTES A REGULATED ACTIVITY REQUIRING INDIVIDUAL AUTHORIZATION. AN AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY MUST HAVE PERMISSION FOR EACH CLASS OF INSURA
NCE BUSINESS IT INTENDS TO WRITE. 

ENDURANCE U.K. HAS RECEIVED AUTHORIZATION FROM THE FSA TO EFFECT AND CARRY OUT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE IN ALL CLASSES OF GENERAL BUSINESS (LIMITED IN THE CASE OF CREDIT AND SURETY TO REINSURANCE ONLY) EXCEPT LEGAL EXPENSES AND ASSISTANCE BUSINESS. ON JANUARY 14, 2005, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION BY THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT OF THE INSURANCE MEDIATION DIRECTIVE (2002/92/EC) VARIOUS ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN UNREGULATED, FELL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FSA REGULATION. 

ENDURANCE U.K. HAS ACCORDINGLY RECEIVED AUTHORIZATION FROM THE FSA TO CONDUCT THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL REGULATED ACTIVITIES: ARRANGING (BRINGING ABOUT) DEALS IN INVESTMENTS AND MAKING ARRANGEMENTS WITH A VIEW TO TRANSACTIONS IN INVESTMENTS. IN BOTH CASES, THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE RESTRICTED TO NON-INVESTMENT INSURANCE CONTRACTS. 

AS AN AUTHORIZED INSURER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ENDURANCE U.K. WOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE THROUGHOUT THE E.U., SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE FSA AND IN SOME CASES, CERTAIN LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AN INSURANCE COMPANY WITH FSA AUTHORIZATION TO WRITE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM CAN SEEK CONSENT FROM THE FSA TO ALLOW IT TO PROVIDE CROSS-BORDER SERVICES IN OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE E.U. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, FSA CONSENT MAY BE OBTAINED TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH OFFICE WITHIN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE. 

AS AN FSA AUTHORIZED INSURER, THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES OF ENDURANCE U.K. ARE SUBJECT TO CLOSE SUPERVISION BY THE FSA. THE FSA HAS IMPLEMENTED SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SENIOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES UNDER ITS JURISDICTION, WHICH PLACE A STRONG EMPHASIS ON RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT IN RELATION TO THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. 

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FSA PROMPTED A MARKET INITIATIVE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO RESOLVE PERCEIVED PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM CONTRACT UNCERTAINTY, WHICH MAY EXIST WHERE THE FULL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CONTRACT OF INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ARE NOT ESTABLISHED AT OR BEFORE THE TIME WHEN THE CONTRACT COMES INTO FORCE. THE FSA S STATED PREFERRED OUTCOME WAS THAT A MARKET SOLUTION SHOULD BE PRODUCED WHICH MET THE REGULATOR S MAIN CONCERNS, WHICH WERE THAT POLICYHOLDERS SHOULD KNOW PRECISELY WHAT PROTECTION THEY HAVE BOUGHT; AND THAT INSURERS, REINSURERS AND BROKERS SHOULD HAVE A CLEARER VIEW, AT THE TIME OF INCEPTION OF A CONTRACT OF THE RELEVANT LEGAL, FIDUCIARY, OPERATIONAL AND UNDERWRITING RISKS TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT. ON JANUARY 24, 2007, THE FSA ANNOUNCED THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAD MET THE CHALLENGE LAID DOWN BY THE REGULATOR TO ACHIEVE A SOLUTION TO CONTRACT CERTAINTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ACCORDINGLY, THE F
SA DOES NOT, AT PRESENT, INTEND TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THE FSA ALSO STATED THAT CONTRACT CERTAINTY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A SUPERVISORY PRIORITY IN 2007 AND THAT, IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT BELIEVES THAT FIRMS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND THE REST OF THE MARKET IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE MARKET S CONTRACT CERTAINTY STANDARDS, IT WOULD CONSIDER REGULATORY ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS. THIS ACTION MIGHT INCLUDE INCREASES IN REQUIRED REGULATORY CAPITAL OR THE COMMENCEMENT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION. 

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FSA PUBLISHED ITS NEW INSURANCE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS SOURCEBOOK ICOBS WHICH SETS OUT THE STANDARDS OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERAL INSURANCE FIRMS ON HOW THEY DEAL WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE NEW GENERAL INSURANCE REGIME CAME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 6, 2008 WITH FIRMS BEING ALLOWED A SIX MONTH TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR IMPLEMENTATION. ALL FIRMS ARE EXPECTED TO MEET THE REQUESTED STANDARDS BY JULY 6, 2008. ICOBS CONTINUES THE FSA S MOVE TO MORE PRINCIPLES BASED REGULATION. 

SUPERVISION 

THE FSA CARRIES OUT THE PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM STATISTICAL RETURNS, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTANTS REPORTS, VISITS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REGULAR FORMAL INTERVIEWS. 

THE FSA HAS ADOPTED A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO THE SUPERVISION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE FSA PERFORMS A FORMAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OR GROUPS CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN THE U.K. PERIODICALLY, WHICH VARIES IN LENGTH ACCORDING TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE INSURER. THE FSA PERFORMS THE RISK ASSESSMENT BY ANALYZING INFORMATION WHICH IT RECEIVES DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS SUPERVISION, SUCH AS REGULAR PRUDENTIAL RETURNS ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY, OR WHICH IT ACQUIRES THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY. AFTER EACH RISK ASSESSMENT, THE FSA WILL INFORM THE INSURER OF ITS VIEWS ON THE INSURER S RISK PROFILE. THIS WILL INCLUDE DETAILS OF ANY REMEDIAL ACTION THAT THE FSA REQUIRES AND THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES IF THIS ACTION IS NOT TAKEN. 

SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS 

THE FSA S GENERAL PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOK AND PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOK FOR INSURERS (TOGETHER, THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS REQUIRE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES MAINTAIN A MARGIN OF SOLVENCY AT ALL TIMES IN RESPECT OF ANY GENERAL INSURANCE UNDERTAKEN BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY, THE CALCULATION OF WHICH IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE DEPENDS ON THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS A COMPANY WRITES. THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE SOLVENCY MARGIN IS SET OUT IN THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS, AND FOR THESE PURPOSES, ALL INSURER S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC VALUATION RULES WHICH ARE SET OUT IN THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED SOLVENCY MARGIN IS ONE OF THE GROUNDS ON WHICH WIDE POWERS OF INTERVENTION CONFERRED UPON THE FSA MAY BE EXERCISED. FOR FINANCIAL YEARS ENDING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2004, THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED MARGIN OF SOLVENCY HAS BEEN AMENDED AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEME
NTATION OF THE E.U. SOLVENCY I DIRECTIVES. IN RESPECT OF LIABILITY BUSINESS ACCEPTED, 150 OF THE ACTUAL PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND CLAIMS INCURRED MUST BE INCLUDED

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

IN THE CALCULATION, WHICH HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE REQUIRED MINIMUM MARGIN OF SOLVENCY OF ENDURANCE U.K.. ENDURANCE U.K. CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS ITS SOLVENCY CAPITAL POSITION AND MAINTAINS CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE REQUIRED MINIMUM MARGIN OF SOLVENCY. EACH INSURANCE COMPANY WRITING VARIOUS CLASSES OF BUSINESS IS ALSO REQUIRED BY THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS TO MAINTAIN EQUALIZATION PROVISIONS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOK FOR INSURERS. 

INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE AN ENHANCED CAPITAL REQUIREMENT ECR IN ADDITION TO THEIR REQUIRED MINIMUM SOLVENCY MARGIN AND TO REPORT IT TO THE FSA (THOUGH THE ECR IS NOT PART OF THE FORMAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS). THIS REPRESENTS A MORE RISK-BASED CALCULATION THAN THE STATUTORY SOLVENCY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS DERIVED FROM THE E.U. DIRECTIVES. THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT FOR INSURERS TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHICH ARE ADEQUATE, BOTH AS TO AMOUNT AND QUALITY, TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT ITS LIABILITIES CANNOT BE MET AS THEY COME DUE. IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE ASSESSMENT AS TO THE NECESSARY FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT ARE REQUIRED, AN INSURER IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR SOURCES OF RISK TO ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS LIABILITIES AS THEY COME DUE, AND TO CARRY OUT STRESS AND SCENARIO TESTS TO IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE RANGE OF REALISTIC ADVERSE SCENARIOS IN WHICH THE RISK CRYSTAL
LIZES AND TO ESTIMATE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED IN EACH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, THE FSA GIVES INDIVIDUAL CAPITAL GUIDANCE ICG REGULARLY TO INSURERS AND REINSURERS FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF INDIVIDUAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENTS, PREPARED BY FIRMS THEMSELVES. THE FSA S GUIDANCE MAY BE THAT A COMPANY SHOULD HOLD MORE OR LESS THAN ITS THEN CURRENT LEVEL OF REGULATORY CAPITAL, OR THAT THE COMPANY S REGULATORY CAPITAL SHOULD REMAIN UNALTERED. ENDURANCE U.K. HAS SUBMITTED AN INDIVIDUAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENT SOLVENCY CALCULATION TO THE FSA AND HAS AGREED WITH THE FSA THE BASES AND METHODOLOGY FOR THIS CALCULATION. THIS CALCULATION IS USED ALONG WITH OTHER TOOLS BY THE FSA TO HELP ESTABLISH THE ICG. ENDURANCE U.K. IS CURRENTLY CALCULATING THE ECR FOR DECEMBER 31, 2007. SHOULD ENDURANCE U.K. NOT MEET THIS TEST, ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY BE REQUIRED. 

IN ADDITION, AN INSURER (OTHER THAN A PURE REINSURER) THAT IS PART OF A GROUP, IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM AND SUBMIT TO THE FSA A SOLVENCY MARGIN CALCULATION RETURN IN RESPECT OF ITS ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FSA S RULES. THIS RETURN IS NOT PART OF AN INSURER S OWN SOLVENCY RETURN AND HENCE WILL NOT BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE PARENT UNDERTAKING SOLVENCY CALCULATION TO SHOW A POSITIVE RESULT, THE FSA MAY TAKE ACTION WHERE IT CONSIDERS THAT THE SOLVENCY OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS OR MAY BE JEOPARDIZED DUE TO THE GROUP SOLVENCY POSITION. FURTHER, AN INSURER IS REQUIRED TO REPORT IN ITS ANNUAL RETURNS TO THE FSA ALL MATERIAL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (E.G., INTRA GROUP REINSURANCE, WHOSE VALUE IS MORE THAN 5 OF THE INSURER S GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS AMOUNT). 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, JOINTLY WITH MEMBER STATES, IS CARRYING OUT A FUNDAMENTAL REVIEW OF THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REGIME OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY (THE SOLVENCY II PROJECT). ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A SOLVENCY SYSTEM THAT IS BETTER MATCHED TO THE TRUE RISKS OF INSURERS ENABLING SUPERVISORS TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS INTERESTS AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMON PRINCIPLES ACROSS THE EU. ENDURANCE U.K. IS MONITORING THE ONGOING CONSULTATION FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE SOLVENCY II FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE. 

RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS 

U.K. COMPANY LAW PROHIBITS ENDURANCE U.K. FROM DECLARING A DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS IT HAS PROFITS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A COMPANY HAS PROFITS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS BASED ON ITS ACCUMULATED REALIZED PROFITS LESS ITS ACCUMULATED REALIZED LOSSES. WHILE THE UNITED KINGDOM INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS IMPOSE NO STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS ON A GENERAL INSURER S ABILITY TO DECLARE A DIVIDEND, THE FSA STRICTLY CONTROLS THE MAINTENANCE OF EACH INSURANCE COMPANY S SOLVENCY MARGIN WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION. THE FSA S RULES REQUIRE ENDURANCE U.K. TO NOTIFY THE FSA OF ANY PROPOSED OR ACTUAL PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND. ANY SUCH PAYMENT OR PROPOSAL COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION, THE FSA REQUIRES AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANIES TO NOTIFY THE FSA IN ADVANCE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT DIVIDEND PAYMENT. 

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 

U.K. INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST PREPARE THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT OF 1985 (AS AMENDED), WHICH REQUIRES THE FILING WITH COMPANIES HOUSE OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 39 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AND RELATED REPORTS. IN ADDITION, U.K. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO FILE WITH THE FSA REGULATORY RETURNS, WHICH INCLUDE A REVENUE ACCOUNT, A PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT AND A BALANCE SHEET IN PRESCRIBED FORMS. UNDER THE INTERIM PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOK FOR INSURERS, AUDITED REGULATORY RETURNS MUST BE FILED WITH THE FSA WITHIN TWO MONTHS AND 15 DAYS (OR THREE MONTHS WHERE THE DELIVERY OF THE RETURN IS MADE ELECTRONICALLY). 

SUPERVISION OF MANAGEMENT 

THE FSA CLOSELY SUPERVISES THE MANAGEMENT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES THROUGH THE APPROVED PERSONS REGIME, BY WHICH ANY APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS TO PERFORM CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONTROLLED FUNCTIONS WITHIN A REGULATED ENTITY, MUST BE APPROVED BY THE FSA. 

CHANGE OF CONTROL 

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET ACT (THE FSMA REGULATES THE ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF ANY U.K. INSURANCE COMPANY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE FSMA. ANY COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL THAT (TOGETHER WITH ITS OR HIS ASSOCIATES) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ACQUIRES 10 OR MORE OF THE SHARES IN A U.K. AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY, OR IS ENTITLED TO EXERCISE OR CONTROL THE EXERCISE OF 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER IN SUCH AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY, WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION, AS WOULD A PERSON WHO HAD SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF SUCH AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY BY VIRTUE OF HIS SHAREHOLDING OR VOTING POWER IN EITHER. A PURCHASER OF 10 OR MORE OF THE ORDINARY SHARES WOULD THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF ENDURANCE U.K. 

UNDER THE FSMA, ANY PERSON PROPOSING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OVER A U.K. AUTHORIZED INSURANCE COMPANY MUST GIVE PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO THE FSA OF HIS INTENTION TO DO SO. THE FSA WOULD THEN HAVE THREE MONTHS TO CONSIDER THAT PERSON S APPLICATION TO ACQUIRE CONTROL. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPROVE SUCH APPLICATION, THE FSA MUST BE SATISFIED THAT BOTH THE ACQUIRER IS A FIT AND PROPER PERSON TO HAVE SUCH CONTROL AND THAT THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS WOULD NOT BE THREATENED BY SUCH ACQUISITION OF CONTROL. FAILURE TO MAKE THE RELEVANT PRIOR APPLICATION COULD RESULT IN ACTION BEING TAKEN AGAINST THE COMPANY BY THE FSA. 

INTERVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT 

THE FSA HAS EXTENSIVE POWERS TO INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIRS OF AN AUTHORIZED PERSON, CULMINATING IN THE ULTIMATE SANCTION OF THE REMOVAL OF AUTHORIZATION TO CARRY ON A REGULATED ACTIVITY. FSMA IMPOSES ON THE FSA STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY FSMA, AND TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF FSMA RELATED RULES MADE BY THE FSA. THE FSA HAS POWER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO ENFORCE AND TAKE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES IN RESPECT OF BREACHES OF BOTH THE PRUDENTIAL SOURCEBOOKS AND BREACHES OF THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO AUTHORIZED PERSONS. THE FSA ALSO HAS THE POWER TO PROSECUTE CRIMINAL OFFENCES ARISING UNDER FSMA, AND TO PROSECUTE INSIDER DEALING UNDER PART V OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1993, AND BREACHES OF MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS. THE FSA S STATED POLICY IS TO PURSUE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN ALL APPROPRIATE CASES. 

PASSPORTING 

EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ALLOW ENDURANCE U.K. TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN EUROPEAN UNION STATES OTHER THAN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SCOPE OF PERMISSION GRANTED THESE COMPANIES BY THE FSA WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF ADDITIONAL LICENSING OR AUTHORIZATION IN OTHER EUROPEAN UNION JURISDICTIONS. THIS ABILITY TO OPERATE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE BASIS OF HOME STATE AUTHORIZATION AND SUPERVISION IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS PASSPORTING. INSURERS MAY OPERATE OUTSIDE THEIR HOME MEMBER STATE EITHER ON A SERVICES BASIS OR ON AN ESTABLISHMENT BASIS. OPERATING ON A SERVICES BASIS MEANS THAT THE COMPANY CONDUCTS PERMITTED BUSINESSES IN THE HOST STATE WITHOUT HAVING A PHYSICAL PRESENCE THERE, WHILE OPERATING ON AN ESTABLISHMENT BASIS MEANS THE COMPANY HAS A BRANCH OR PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE HOST STATE. 

IN BOTH CASES, A COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY ITS HOME REGULATOR, AND NOT BY LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY NONETHELESS MAY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN LOCAL RULES.

IN ADDITION TO EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES, NORWAY, ICELAND AND LIECHTENSTEIN (MEMBERS OF THE BROADER EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA) ARE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THIS PASSPORTING FRAMEWORK APPLIES. 

U.S. REGULATION 

ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE WAS ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF NEW YORK ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2002. ON DECEMBER 18, 2002, ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE RECEIVED A LICENSE TO WRITE CERTAIN LINES OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. ON AUGUST 1, 2005, ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE ACQUIRED ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, A DELAWARE INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH TRANSACTS BUSINESS ON A SURPLUS LINES BASIS. ON JUNE 5, 2006, ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE ACQUIRED ENDURANCE AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY, A DELAWARE INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH TRANSACTS BUSINESS ON AN ADMITTED BASIS. ON JUNE 8, 2007, ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE ACQUIRED AMERICAN MERCHANTS CASUALTY COMPANY, AN OHIO INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH TRANSACTS BUSINESS ON A SURPLUS LINES BASIS. ON DECEMBER 7, 2007, ENDURANCE U.S. HOLDINGS CORP. ACQUIRED AMERICAN AGRI-BUSINESS INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARMTECH INSURANCE SERVICES, INC
., EACH A TEXAS COMPANY. ON JANUARY 30, 2008, ENDURANCE REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA COMPLETED ITS REDOMESTICATION FROM NEW YORK TO DELAWARE AND IS CURRENTLY REGULATED BY THE DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. 

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS 

ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ENDURANCE U.S. HOLDINGS CORP., AS PARENT COMPANIES OF THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING COMPANIES, ARE SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF THE STATES OF DELAWARE, TEXAS AND OHIO, THE STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES ARE ORGANIZED AND DOMICILED. THESE LAWS GENERALLY REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH INSURANCE COMPANY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWNED BY THE HOLDING COMPANY TO REGISTER WITH THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMICILIARY STATES AND TO FURNISH ANNUALLY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. GENERALLY, ALL MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AMONG COMPANIES IN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM INVOLVING THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING SALES, LOANS, REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, MUST BE FAIR AND, IF MATERIAL OR OF A SPECIFIED CATEGORY, REQUIRE
 PRIOR NOTICE AND APPROVAL OR NON-DISAPPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE REGULATOR OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE INVOLVED U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARY IS DOMICILED. 

CHANGES OF CONTROL 

BEFORE A PERSON CAN ACQUIRE CONTROL OF A U.S. DOMESTIC INSURER (OR REINSURER), PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE WHERE THE INSURER (OR REINSURER) IS DOMICILED. PRIOR TO GRANTING APPROVAL OF AN APPLICATION TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER (OR REINSURER), THE DOMICILIARY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WILL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE PROPOSED ACQUIROR, THE INTEGRITY AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIROR S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE ACQUIROR S PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE DOMESTIC INSURER AND ANY ANTI-COMPETITIVE RESULTS THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION OF CONTROL. GENERALLY, STATE INSURANCE STATUTES PROVIDE THAT CONTROL OVER A DOMESTIC INSURER IS PRESUMED TO EXIST IF ANY PERSON, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OWNS, CONTROLS, HOLDS WITH THE POWER TO VOTE, OR HOLDS PROXIES REPRESENTING, TEN PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF
 THE DOMESTIC INSURER. BECAUSE A PERSON ACQUIRING TEN PERCENT OR MORE OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS ORDINARY SHARES WOULD INDIRECTLY ACQUIRE THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF COMMON STOCK OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, THE U.S. INSURANCE CHANGE OF CONTROL LAWS WILL LIKELY APPLY TO SUCH A TRANSACTION. THESE LAWS MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAY DELAY, DETER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, INCLUDING THROUGH TRANSACTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR UNSOLICITED TRANSACTIONS, THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE DESIRABLE 

STATE INSURANCE REGULATION OF THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES 

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY ANY U.S. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT WITH RESPECT TO RATES OR POLICY TERMS UNLIKE PRIMARY INSURANCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AGREEMENTS, THE RATES AND POLICY TERMS OF WHICH ARE GENERALLY CLOSELY REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, HOWEVER, THE RATES CHARGED BY PRIMARY INSURERS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE RATES THAT CAN BE CHARGED BY REINSURERS. 

STATE INSURANCE AUTHORITIES HAVE BROAD REGULATORY POWERS WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH INCLUDING: LICENSING TO TRANSACT BUSINESS, ADMITTANCE OF ASSETS TO STATUTORY SURPLUS, REGULATING UNFAIR TRADE AND CLAIMS PRACTICES, ESTABLISHING RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AND SOLVENCY STANDARDS, AND REGULATING INVESTMENTS AND DIVIDENDS. WITH RESPECT TO DIRECT INSURANCE BUSINESS, STATES MAY ALSO REGULATE RATES AND FORMS USED BY INSURERS ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITHIN A GIVEN STATE JURISDICTION. STATE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS TO FILE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS EVERYWHERE IT IS LICENSED, AUTHORIZED OR ACCREDITED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE BUSINESS; AND THE OPERATIONS OF ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE 
AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS AT ANY TIME. ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH PREPARE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED OR PERMITTED BY THESE DEPARTMENTS. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BOOKS AND RECORDS, FINANCIAL REPORTING, POLICY FILINGS AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES DOMICILED OR AUTHORIZED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THEIR STATES, GENERALLY ONCE EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS. EXAMINATIONS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION WITH THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF OTHER STATES UNDER GUIDELINES PROMULGATED BY THE NAIC. 

UNDER DELAWARE, TEXAS AND OHIO INSURANCE LAWS, ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH MAY ONLY PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANIES OUT OF EARNED SURPLUS. IN DELAWARE, TEXAS AND OHIO, EARNED SURPLUS IS DEFINED AS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE UNASSIGNED FUNDS OF AN INSURER AS SET FORTH IN THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE INSURER SUBMITTED TO THE APPLICABLE STATE INSURANCE REGULATOR, INCLUDING ALL OR PART OF THE SURPLUS ARISING FROM UNREALIZED CAPITAL GAINS OR REVALUATION OF ASSETS. 

IN ADDITION, THE ABILITY OF ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH TO DECLARE OR PAY ANY DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED OR DISTRIBUTED BY IT WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF: 

1. 
 TEN PERCENT OF ITS POLICYHOLDERS SURPLUS AS OF THE 31 ST DAY OF DECEMBER OF THE PRECEDING YEAR; OR 

2. 
 THE STATUTORY NET INCOME, NOT INCLUDING REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDING, FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR (THE 31 ST DAY OF DECEMBER NEXT PRECEDING) 

WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE STATE INSURANCE REGULATOR. ANY DIVIDEND PAID BY ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY, AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH MUST FIRST BE PAID TO ITS PARENT COMPANY. IF THE PARENT COMPANY IS ALSO AN INSURER, AS IS THE CASE WITH ENDURANCE AMERICAN, ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY AND AMERICAN MERCHANTS, THE PARENT COMPANY OR COMPANIES MUST ALSO MEET THEIR OWN DIVIDEND ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH ABOVE IN ORDER TO PASS ALONG ANY DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM SUBSIDIARY INSURANCE COMPANIES 

THE DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY DELAWARE, TEXAS AND OHIO INSURANCE LAWS IS BASED ON THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES DETERMINED BY USING STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES WHICH DIFFER IN CERTAIN RESPECTS FROM ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP. THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES RELATE TO DEFERRED ACQUISITION EXPENSES, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, REQUIRED INVESTMENT RESERVES, RESERVE CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS AND SURPLUS NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 OF THE COMPANY S U.S. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ONLY AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH HAD EARNED SURPLUS, AND THEREFORE, ONLY AMERICAN MERCHANTS AND ARMTECH COULD DECLARE OR DISTRIBUTE A DIVIDEND IN 2008 WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.

 RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS 

THE INSURANCE LAWS OF DELAWARE, OHIO AND TEXAS REQUIRE THAT INSURERS REPORT THEIR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RBC BASED ON A FORMULA CALCULATED BY APPLYING FACTORS TO VARIOUS ASSET, PREMIUM AND RESERVE ITEMS. THE FORMULA TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURER, INCLUDING ASSET RISK, INSURANCE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND BUSINESS RISK. THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF DELAWARE, OHIO AND TEXAS USE THE FORMULA ONLY AS AN EARLY WARNING REGULATORY TOOL TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLY INADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURERS FOR PURPOSES OF INITIATING REGULATORY ACTION, AND NOT AS A MEANS TO RANK INSURERS GENERALLY. INSURANCE LAWS IMPOSE BROAD CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS ON THOSE ENGAGED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS (INCLUDING INSURERS, AGENTS, BROKERS AND OTHERS) AND ON THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AS TO THE USE AND PUBLICATION OF RBC DATA. THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF DELAWARE, OHIO AND TEXAS HAVE EXPLICIT REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE VA
RIOUS ACTIONS BY, OR TAKE VARIOUS ACTIONS AGAINST, INSURERS WHOSE TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL DOES NOT EXCEED CERTAIN RBC LEVELS. 

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES 

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES, OR SAP, ARE A BASIS OF ACCOUNTING DEVELOPED TO ASSIST U.S. INSURANCE REGULATORS IN MONITORING AND REGULATING THE SOLVENCY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. IT IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH MEASURING AN INSURER S SURPLUS TO POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, STATUTORY ACCOUNTING FOCUSES ON VALUING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF INSURERS AT FINANCIAL REPORTING DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROPRIATE INSURANCE LAW AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS APPLICABLE IN EACH INSURER S DOMICILIARY STATE. 

U.S. GAAP CONCERNS AN INSURER S SOLVENCY, BUT IT ALSO CONCERNS OTHER FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS INCOME AND CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, U.S. GAAP GIVES MORE CONSIDERATION TO APPROPRIATE MATCHING OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES AND ACCOUNTING FOR MANAGEMENT S STEWARDSHIP OF ASSETS THAN DOES SAP. AS A DIRECT RESULT, DIFFERENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WILL BE REFLECTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP AS OPPOSED TO SAP. 

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ESTABLISHED BY THE NAIC AND ADOPTED, IN PART, BY THE DELAWARE, OHIO AND TEXAS INSURANCE REGULATORS, DETERMINE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE AMOUNT OF STATUTORY SURPLUS AND STATUTORY NET INCOME OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS U.S. INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES AND THUS DETERMINE, IN PART, THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANIES. 

OPERATIONS OF ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA 

ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA ARE NOT ADMITTED TO DO BUSINESS IN ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. INSURANCE LAWS OF EACH STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF MANY OTHER COUNTRIES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE SALE OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS BY NON-ADMITTED ALIEN INSURERS AND REINSURERS SUCH AS ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA. 

IN ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE LICENSED, REINSURERS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN VARIOUS STATES OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNING CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE WHICH ARE IMPOSED ON THEIR CEDING COMPANIES. IN GENERAL, A CEDING COMPANY THAT OBTAINS REINSURANCE FROM A REINSURER THAT IS LICENSED, ACCREDITED OR APPROVED BY THE JURISDICTION OR STATE IN WHICH THE REINSURER FILES STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS PERMITTED TO REFLECT IN ITS STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A CREDIT IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LIABILITY FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS (WHICH ARE THAT PORTION OF WRITTEN PREMIUMS WHICH APPLIES TO THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE POLICY PERIOD) AND LOSS RESERVES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES CEDED TO THE REINSURER. AS STATED ABOVE, ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA ARE NOT LICENSED, ACCREDITED OR APPROVED IN ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE GREAT 
MAJORITY OF STATES, HOWEVER, PERMIT A CREDIT TO STATUTORY SURPLUS RESULTING FROM REINSURANCE OBTAINED FROM A NON-LICENSED OR NON-ACCREDITED REINSURER TO BE OFFSET TO THE EXTENT THAT THE REINSURER PROVIDES A LETTER OF CREDIT OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE SECURITY ARRANGEMENT. A FEW STATES DO NOT ALLOW CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE CEDED TO NON-LICENSED OR NON-ACCREDITED REINSURERS EXCEPT IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHERS IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BECOME ACCREDITED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA ARE IN VIOLATION OF INSURANCE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE HOWEVER, THAT INQUIRIES OR CHALLENGES TO ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE RAISED IN THE FUTURE. 

MATERIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

CERTAIN BERMUDA TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO BERMUDA INCOME, CORPORATION OR PROFITS TAX, WITHHOLDING TAX, CAPITAL GAINS TAX, CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX, ESTATE DUTY OR INHERITANCE TAX PAYABLE BY US OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, OTHER THAN SHAREHOLDERS ORDINARILY RESIDENT IN BERMUDA, IF ANY. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO BERMUDA WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAX ON PRINCIPAL INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS PAID TO HOLDERS OF THE ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES, OTHER THAN HOLDERS ORDINARILY RESIDENT IN BERMUDA, IF ANY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY SUCH TAX IN THE FUTURE. 

ENDURANCE BERMUDA HAS RECEIVED WRITTEN ASSURANCE DATED DECEMBER 7, 2001 AND ENDURANCE HOLDINGS HAS RECEIVED WRITTEN ASSURANCE DATED JULY 18, 2002 FROM THE MINISTER UNDER THE EXEMPTED UNDERTAKINGS TAX PROTECTION ACT 1966 OF BERMUDA, AS AMENDED, THAT IF THERE IS ENACTED IN BERMUDA ANY LEGISLATION IMPOSING TAX COMPUTED ON PROFITS OR INCOME, OR COMPUTED ON ANY CAPITAL ASSET, GAIN OR APPRECIATION, OR ANY TAX IN THE NATURE OF ESTATE DUTY OR INHERITANCE TAX, THEN THE IMPOSITION OF THAT TAX WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO ENDURANCE BERMUDA OR ENDURANCE HOLDINGS OR TO ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OPERATIONS, SHARES, DEBENTURES OR OBLIGATIONS UNTIL MARCH 28, 2016; PROVIDED, THAT THE ASSURANCE IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITION THAT IT WILL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF SUCH TAX TO PEOPLE ORDINARILY RESIDENT IN BERMUDA, OR TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF ANY TAXES PAYABLE BY ENDURANCE BERMUDA OR ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IN RESPECT OF REAL PROPERTY OR 
LEASEHOLD INTERESTS IN BERMUDA HELD BY THEM. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY SUCH TAX AFTER MARCH 28, 2016. 

CERTAIN UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

ENDURANCE U.K. IS A COMPANY INCORPORATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IS, THEREFORE, RESIDENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR UNITED KINGDOM CORPORATION TAX PURPOSES AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO UNITED KINGDOM CORPORATION TAX ON ITS WORLDWIDE PROFITS. THE CURRENT RATE OF UNITED KINGDOM CORPORATION TAX IS GENERALLY 30 ON PROFITS OF WHATEVER DESCRIPTION. THE CORPORATION TAX RATE WILL DECREASE TO 28 EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2008. CURRENTLY, NO UNITED KINGDOM WITHHOLDING TAX APPLIES TO DIVIDENDS PAID BY ENDURANCE U.K. 

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ITS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES IN BERMUDA, THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. 

THIS SUMMARY IS BASED UPON THE CODE, THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, RULINGS AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY THE IRS, JUDICIAL DECISIONS, THE TAX TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BERMUDA (THE BERMUDA TREATY AND THE TAX TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (THE U.K. TREATY ), ALL AS CURRENTLY IN EFFECT, AND ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OR TO CHANGE, POSSIBLY WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE IRS WOULD ASSERT, OR THAT A COURT WOULD NOT SUSTAIN, A POSITION CONTRARY TO ANY OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES DESCRIBED BELOW. NO ADVANCE RULING HAS BEEN OR WILL BE SOUGHT FROM THE IRS REGARDING ANY MATTER DISCUSSED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY, AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR IN LIGHT OF
 SUCH INVESTOR S INVESTMENT OR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES, OR TO INVESTORS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL TAX RULES, SUCH AS TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS, DEALERS IN SECURITIES, BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, PERSONS THAT HOLD ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES THAT ARE A HEDGE OR THAT ARE HEDGED AGAINST INTEREST RATE OR INSURANCE RISKS OR THAT ARE PART OF A STRADDLE OR CONVERSION

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

TRANSACTION, OR PERSONS WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. THIS SUMMARY ASSUMES THAT AN INVESTOR WILL HOLD OUR ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES AS CAPITAL ASSETS, WHICH GENERALLY MEANS AS PROPERTY HELD FOR INVESTMENT. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE CONSEQUENCES, IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, OF THE OWNERSHIP OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES UNDER U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX LAWS. 

FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, A U.S. PERSON MEANS (I) A CITIZEN OR RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, (II) A CORPORATION, OR OTHER ENTITY TREATED AS A CORPORATION FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, OR A PARTNERSHIP, OR OTHER ENTITY TREATED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR U.S FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, IN EACH CASE CREATED OR ORGANIZED IN THE UNITED STATES OR UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY OF ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, (III) AN ESTATE THE INCOME OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS SOURCE OR (IV) A TRUST IF EITHER (A) A COURT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES IS ABLE TO EXERCISE PRIMARY SUPERVISION OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST AND ONE OR MORE U.S. PERSONS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL ALL SUBSTANTIAL DECISIONS OF THE TRUST OR (B) THE TRUST HAS A VALID ELECTION IN EFFECT TO BE TREATED AS A U.S. PERSON FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. A NON-U.S. PERSON IS A NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUAL, OR A CORPORATION, ESTATE OR TRUST THAT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON. 

IF A PARTNERSHIP OWNS ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES, THE TAX TREATMENT OF A PARTNER WILL GENERALLY DEPEND UPON THE STATUS OF THE PARTNER AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. IF YOU ARE A PARTNER OF A PARTNERSHIP THAT OWNS ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR. 

UNITED STATES TAXATION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ITS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES 

WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND ENDURANCE U.K. IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE CONDUCTING BUSINESS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FOR PURPOSES OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION. WHETHER BUSINESS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES IS AN INHERENTLY FACTUAL DETERMINATION. BECAUSE THE CODE, REGULATIONS AND COURT DECISIONS FAIL TO IDENTIFY DEFINITIVELY ACTIVITIES THAT CONSTITUTE BEING ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CONTEND SUCCESSFULLY THAT ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND/OR ENDURANCE U.K. ARE OR WILL BE ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. A FOREIGN CORPORATION DEEMED TO BE SO ENGAGED WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX (AT A CURRENT MAXIMUM RATE OF 35 ), AS WELL AS A 30 BRANCH PROFITS TAX IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ON ITS INCOME WHICH IS TREATED AS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THAT TRADE
 OR BUSINESS UNLESS THE CORPORATION IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT PROVISION OF AN APPLICABLE TAX TREATY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. SUCH INCOME TAX, IF IMPOSED, WOULD BE BASED ON EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED INCOME COMPUTED IN A MANNER GENERALLY ANALOGOUS TO THAT APPLIED TO THE INCOME OF A U.S. CORPORATION, EXCEPT THAT A FOREIGN CORPORATION IS ENTITLED TO DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS ONLY IF IT TIMELY FILES A U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND ENDURANCE U.K. INTEND TO FILE PROTECTIVE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS ON A TIMELY BASIS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO CLAIM INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS IF IT IS EVER DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX. 

IF ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS UNDER THE BERMUDA TREATY, IT WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON ANY INCOME FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH A U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS UNLESS THAT TRADE OR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED THROUGH A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. WHETHER BUSINESS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IS AN INHERENTLY FACTUAL DETERMINATION. ENDURANCE BERMUDA INTENDS TO CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES SO AS NOT TO HAVE A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL ACHIEVE THIS RESULT. AN INSURANCE ENTERPRISE RESIDENT IN BERMUDA GENERALLY WILL BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE BERMUDA TREATY IF (I) MORE THAN 50 OF ITS SHARES ARE OWNED BENEFICIALLY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OR BERMUDA OR U.S. CITIZENS AND (II) ITS INCOME IS NOT USED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO MAKE DISPRO
PORTIONATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO, OR TO MEET CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF, PERSONS WHO ARE NEITHER RESIDENTS OF EITHER THE UNITED STATES OR BERMUDA NOR U.S. CITIZENS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT CONDUCT AN INSURANCE BUSINESS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST MAINTAIN A CERTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME, DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A FORMULA THAT DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. RISK INSURED OR REINSURED BY SUCH COMPANIES. IF ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS CONSIDERED TO BE ENGAGED IN THE CONDUCT OF AN INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE BERMUDA TREATY, EITHER BECAUSE IT FAILS TO SATISFY ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON BERMUDA TREATY BENEFITS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR BECAUSE ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE A U.S. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA S PREMIUM AND INVESTMENT INCOME COULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE BERMUDA TREATY CLEARLY APPLIES TO PREMIUM INCOME, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT APPLIES TO OTHER INCOME, SUCH AS INVESTMENT INCOME. IF ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS CONSIDERED TO
 BE ENGAGED IN THE CONDUCT OF AN INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE BERMUDA TREATY, BUT THE BERMUDA TREATY IS INTERPRETED SO AS NOT TO APPLY TO INVESTMENT INCOME, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ENDURANCE BERMUDA S INVESTMENT INCOME COULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX EVEN IF ENDURANCE BERMUDA DOES NOT MAINTAIN A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. 

UNDER THE U.K. TREATY, ENDURANCE U.K., IF ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE U.K. TREATY, WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON ANY INCOME FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH A U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS UNLESS THAT TRADE OR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED THROUGH A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. ENDURANCE U.K. INTENDS TO CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER SO THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS RESULT. ENDURANCE U.K. WILL BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE U.K. TREATY IF (I) DURING AT LEAST HALF OF THE DAYS DURING THE RELEVANT TAXABLE PERIOD, AT LEAST 50 OF ENDURANCE U.K. S STOCK IS BENEFICIALLY OWNED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY CITIZENS OR RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND LESS THAN 50 OF ENDURANCE U.K. S GROSS INCOME FOR THE RELEVANT TAXABLE PERIOD IS PAID OR ACCRUED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO PERSONS WHO ARE NOT U.S. O
R U.K. RESIDENTS IN THE FORM OF PAYMENTS THAT ARE DEDUCTIBLE FOR PURPOSES OF U.K. TAXATION OR (II) WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC ITEMS OF INCOME, PROFIT OR GAIN DERIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, IF SUCH INCOME, PROFIT OR GAIN IS CONSIDERED TO BE DERIVED IN CONNECTION WITH, OR INCIDENTAL TO, ENDURANCE U.K. S BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. 

FOREIGN CORPORATIONS NOT ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NONETHELESS SUBJECT TO U.S. WITHHOLDING TAX AT A RATE OF 30 OF THE GROSS AMOUNT OF CERTAIN FIXED OR DETERMINABLE ANNUAL OR PERIODICAL GAINS, PROFITS AND INCOME DERIVED FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES (SUCH AS DIVIDENDS AND CERTAIN INTEREST ON INVESTMENTS), SUBJECT TO REDUCTION BY APPLICABLE TREATIES. 

THE UNITED STATES ALSO IMPOSES AN EXCISE TAX ON INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PREMIUMS PAID TO FOREIGN INSURERS OR REINSURERS WITH RESPECT TO RISKS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RATE OF TAX APPLICABLE TO PREMIUMS PAID TO ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS 4 FOR CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND 1 FOR REINSURANCE PREMIUMS. THE EXCISE TAX WILL NOT APPLY TO PREMIUMS PAID TO ENDURANCE U.K. IF ENDURANCE U.K. IS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF THE U.K. TREATY, AND CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. 

ENDURANCE U.S. REINSURANCE, ENDURANCE AMERICAN AND ENDURANCE AMERICAN SPECIALTY ARE DELAWARE CORPORATIONS, AMERICAN MERCHANTS IS AN OHIO CORPORATION AND ARMTECH IS A TEXAS CORPORATION. EACH WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES. DIVIDENDS PAID BY ENDURANCE U.S. HOLDINGS CORP. TO ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. WITHHOLDING TAX AT THE RATE OF 30 . 

UNITED STATES TAXATION OF HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES 

SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE U.S. PERSONS 

DIVIDENDS. DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES (INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, IN THE CASE OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES) WILL BE TREATED AS ORDINARY DIVIDEND INCOME TO THE EXTENT OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS CURRENT OR ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS AS DETERMINED FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, SUBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF THE CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION, RELATED PERSON INSURANCE INCOME AND PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY RULES. THESE DIVIDENDS SHOULD CONSTITUTE 
 
 46 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1(H)(11)(B) OF THE CODE AND, THUS, SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE 15 PREFERENTIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE APPLICABLE TO QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2011 BY CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS (SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS), PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN HOLDING PERIOD REQUIREMENTS ARE SATISFIED AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET, AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT WE ARE NOT CONSIDERED A PFIC. 

DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ENDURANCE HOLDINGS ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTION ALLOWED TO U.S. CORPORATIONS UNDER THE CODE. THE AMOUNT OF ANY DISTRIBUTION IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS WILL FIRST BE APPLIED TO REDUCE A HOLDER S TAX BASIS IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF TAX BASIS WILL BE TREATED AS GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SUCH HOLDER S SHARES. 

CLASSIFICATION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA AS A CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION. EACH 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OF A FOREIGN CORPORATION THAT IS A CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION CFC FOR AN UNINTERRUPTED PERIOD OF 30 DAYS OR MORE DURING A TAXABLE YEAR, AND WHO OWNS SHARES IN THE CFC DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES, IN SUCH CORPORATION ON THE LAST DAY, IN SUCH YEAR, IN WHICH SUCH CORPORATION IS A CFC MUST INCLUDE IN ITS GROSS INCOME FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES ITS PRO RATA SHARE OF THE CFC S SUBPART F INCOME, EVEN IF THE SUBPART F INCOME IS NOT DISTRIBUTED. A FOREIGN CORPORATION IS CONSIDERED A CFC IF 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDERS OWN (DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES OR C
ONSTRUCTIVELY PURSUANT TO THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES) MORE THAN 50 OF THE TOTAL COMBINED VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF VOTING STOCK OF SUCH FOREIGN CORPORATION, OR THE TOTAL VALUE OF ALL STOCK OF SUCH CORPORATION. A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER IS A U.S. PERSON WHO OWNS AT LEAST 10 OF THE TOTAL COMBINED VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE OF THE FOREIGN CORPORATION. THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED VOTING STOCK FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER A U.S. PERSON WOULD BE A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER UNLESS AND UNTIL THERE EXISTS A NONPAYMENT EVENT WHICH TRIGGERS THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ELECT TWO ADDITIONAL DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. IN SUCH CASE, THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES SHOULD BE TREATED AS VOTING STOCK FOR AS LONG AS SUCH RIGHT CONTINUES. 

FOR PURPOSES OF TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INSURANCE INCOME, A CFC ALSO INCLUDES A FOREIGN CORPORATION IN WHICH MORE THAN 25 OF THE TOTAL COMBINED VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF STOCK (OR MORE THAN 25 OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE STOCK) IS OWNED (DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES OR CONSTRUCTIVELY PURSUANT TO THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES) BY 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDERS, ON ANY DAY DURING THE TAXABLE YEAR OF SUCH CORPORATION, IF THE GROSS AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR THE REINSURANCE OR THE ISSUING OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS EXCEEDS 75 OF THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ALL PREMIUMS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION IN RESPECT OF ALL RISKS. DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED DISPERSION OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS SHARE OWNERSHIP AMONG HOLDERS, ITS BYE-LAW PROVISIONS THAT IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE CONCENTRATION OF VOTING POWER OF ANY SHARES THAT ARE ENTITLED TO VOTE AND AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO REPURCHASE SUCH SHARES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER FACTORS
, NO U.S. PERSON THAT OWNS SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO TREATMENT AS A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OF A CFC. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROVISIONS FOR PURPOSES OF PREVENTING 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER STATUS AND THAT A COURT WILL NOT SUSTAIN SUCH CHALLENGE. 

RPII COMPANIES. THE CFC RULES ALSO APPLY TO CERTAIN INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT EARN RELATED PERSON INSURANCE INCOME. FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE CFC RULES TO FOREIGN CORPORATIONS THAT EARN RPII, A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, APPLIES. 

RPII IS DEFINED AS ANY INSURANCE INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO POLICIES OF INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THE PERSON (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) INSURED IS A RPII SHAREHOLDER OF THE FOREIGN CORPORATION OR A RELATED PERSON TO SUCH RPII SHAREHOLDER. IN GENERAL, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, INSURANCE INCOME IS INCOME (INCLUDING PREMIUM AND INVESTMENT INCOME) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ISSUING OF ANY INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE CONTRACT WHICH WOULD BE TAXED UNDER THE PORTIONS OF THE CODE RELATING TO INSURANCE COMPANIES IF THE INCOME WERE THE INCOME OF A DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY. 
 
 47 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
 FOR PURPOSES OF THE RPII RULES, RELATED PERSON MEANS SOMEONE WHO CONTROLS OR IS CONTROLLED BY THE RPII SHAREHOLDER OR SOMEONE WHO IS CONTROLLED BY THE SAME PERSON OR PERSONS WHICH CONTROL THE RPII SHAREHOLDER. CONTROL IS MEASURED BY EITHER MORE THAN 50 IN VALUE OR MORE THAN 50 IN VOTING POWER OF STOCK, APPLYING CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP PRINCIPLES. A CORPORATION S PENSION PLAN IS ORDINARILY NOT A RELATED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO THE CORPORATION UNLESS THE PENSION PLAN OWNS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES, MORE THAN 50 , MEASURED BY VOTE OR VALUE, OF THE STOCK OF THE CORPORATION. 

FOR PURPOSES OF INCLUSION OF ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S RPII IN THE INCOME OF A RPII SHAREHOLDER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED UNDER THE RPII RULES, THE TERM RPII SHAREHOLDER MEANS ANY U.S. PERSON WHO OWNS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES, ANY AMOUNT (RATHER THAN STOCK POSSESSING 10 OR MORE OF THE TOTAL COMBINED VOTING POWER) OF ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S STOCK. ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL BE TREATED AS A CFC FOR RPII PURPOSES IF SUCH PERSONS COLLECTIVELY OWN DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY THROUGH FOREIGN ENTITIES OR BY APPLICATION OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES 25 OR MORE OF THE STOCK OF ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA BY VOTE OR VALUE. 

RPII EXCEPTIONS. THE SPECIAL RPII RULES DO NOT APPLY IF (I) DIRECT OR INDIRECT INSUREDS AND PERSONS RELATED TO SUCH INSUREDS, WHETHER OR NOT U.S. PERSONS, OWN, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, LESS THAN 20 OF THE VOTING POWER AND LESS THAN 20 OF THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA, AS APPLICABLE (THE 20 OWNERSHIP EXCEPTION ), (II) RPII, DETERMINED ON A GROSS BASIS, IS LESS THAN 20 OF ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S GROSS INSURANCE INCOME FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR, AS APPLICABLE (THE 20 GROSS INCOME EXCEPTION ), (III) ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA ELECTS TO BE TAXED ON ITS RPII AS IF THE RPII WERE EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH THE CONDUCT OF A U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS AND TO WAIVE ALL TREATY BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO RPII AND MEETS CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS 
OR (IV) ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA ELECTS TO BE TREATED AS A U.S. CORPORATION. ENDURANCE BERMUDA AND ENDURANCE U.K. INTEND TO OPERATE IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT EACH QUALIFIES FOR THE 20 GROSS INCOME EXCEPTION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NEITHER ENDURANCE BERMUDA NOR ENDURANCE U.K. WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN QUALIFYING UNDER THIS EXCEPTION. 

IF NONE OF THESE EXCEPTIONS APPLIES, EACH U.S. PERSON WHO OWNS SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS (AND THEREFORE, INDIRECTLY IN ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA) ON THE LAST DAY OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS TAXABLE YEAR, WILL BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE IN ITS GROSS INCOME FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES ITS SHARE OF RPII OF ENDURANCE U.K. AND/OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA FOR THE ENTIRE TAXABLE YEAR. THIS INCLUSION WILL BE DETERMINED AS IF SUCH RPII WERE DISTRIBUTED PROPORTIONATELY ONLY TO SUCH U.S. PERSONS HOLDING SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AT THAT DATE. THE INCLUSION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE CURRENT-YEAR EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA, AS APPLICABLE, REDUCED BY THE SHAREHOLDER S PRO RATA SHARE, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR DEFICITS IN EARNINGS AND PROFITS. 

COMPUTATION OF RPII. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH RPII EACH OF ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA HAS EARNED IN EACH TAXABLE YEAR, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS INTENDS TO OBTAIN AND RELY UPON INFORMATION FROM ENDURANCE U.K. S AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA S INSUREDS AND REINSUREDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF THE INSUREDS, REINSUREDS OR OTHER PERSONS RELATED TO SUCH INSUREDS OR REINSUREDS OWN SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AND ARE U.S. PERSONS. ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF THE UNDERLYING INSUREDS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO WHICH ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA PROVIDE INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ARE U.S. SHAREHOLDERS OR RELATED PERSONS TO SUCH SHAREHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ACCURATELY THE GROSS AMOUNT OF RPII EARNED BY ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA IN A GIVEN TAXA
BLE YEAR. FOR ANY TAXABLE YEAR IN WHICH ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S GROSS RPII IS 20 OR MORE OF ITS GROSS INSURANCE INCOME FOR THE YEAR, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MAY ALSO SEEK INFORMATION FROM ITS SHAREHOLDERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERS OF SHARES IN ENDURANCE HOLDINGS AT THE END OF THE YEAR ARE U.S. PERSONS SO THAT THE RPII MAY BE DETERMINED AND APPORTIONED AMONG SUCH PERSONS. TO THE EXTENT ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNER OF SHARES IS A U.S. PERSON, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS MAY ASSUME THAT SUCH OWNER IS NOT A U.S. PERSON, THEREBY INCREASING THE PER SHARE RPII AMOUNT FOR ALL SHAREHOLDERS IDENTIFIED AS U.S. PERSONS.

 BASIS ADJUSTMENTS. A RPII SHAREHOLDER S TAX BASIS IN ITS ENDURANCE HOLDINGS ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES, AS THE CASE MAY BE, WILL BE INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT OF ANY RPII THAT THE SHAREHOLDER INCLUDES IN INCOME. ANY DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY ENDURANCE HOLDINGS OUT OF PREVIOUSLY TAXED RPII INCOME WILL BE EXEMPT FROM FURTHER TAX IN THE HANDS OF THE RPII SHAREHOLDER. THE RPII SHAREHOLDER S TAX BASIS IN ITS ENDURANCE HOLDINGS SHARES WILL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF ANY DISTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM INCOME UNDER THIS RULE. 

INFORMATION REPORTING. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, U.S. PERSONS OWNING STOCK IN A FOREIGN CORPORATION ARE REQUIRED TO FILE IRS FORM 5471 WITH THEIR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS. GENERALLY, INFORMATION REPORTING ON IRS FORM 5471 IS REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO (I) A PERSON WHO IS TREATED AS A RPII SHAREHOLDER, (II) A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OF A FOREIGN CORPORATION THAT IS A CFC FOR AN UNINTERRUPTED PERIOD OF 30 DAYS OR MORE DURING ANY TAX YEAR OF THE FOREIGN CORPORATION, AND WHO OWNED THE STOCK ON THE LAST OF THAT YEAR AND (III) UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A U.S. PERSON WHO ACQUIRES STOCK IN A FOREIGN CORPORATION, AND AS A RESULT THEREOF OWNS 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OR VALUE OF SUCH FOREIGN CORPORATION, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH FOREIGN CORPORATION IS A CFC. FOR ANY TAXABLE YEAR IN WHICH ENDURANCE HOLDINGS DETERMINES THAT GROSS RPII CONSTITUTES 20
 OR MORE OF ENDURANCE U.K. S OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA S GROSS INSURANCE INCOME AND THE 20 OWNERSHIP EXCEPTION DOES NOT APPLY, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS INTENDS TO MAIL TO ALL U.S. PERSONS REGISTERED AS HOLDERS OF ITS ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES IRS FORM 5471, COMPLETED WITH INFORMATION FROM ENDURANCE HOLDINGS, FOR ATTACHMENT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS OF SUCH SHAREHOLDERS. A TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION THAT IS TREATED AS A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OR A RPII SHAREHOLDER ALSO MUST FILE IRS FORM 5471 IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE. FAILURE TO FILE IRS FORM 5471 MAY RESULT IN PENALTIES. 

TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. TAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO TREAT CERTAIN SUBPART F INSURANCE INCOME, INCLUDING RPII, THAT IS INCLUDIBLE IN INCOME BY THE TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AS UNRELATED BUSINESS TAXABLE INCOME. 

DISPOSITIONS OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. SUBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW RELATING TO THE REDEMPTION OF SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES OR THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF CODE SECTION 1248 OR THE PFIC RULES, ANY GAIN OR LOSS REALIZED BY A U.S. PERSON ON THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION AS CAPITAL GAIN OR LOSS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT REALIZED UPON SUCH SALE OR EXCHANGE AND SUCH PERSON S TAX BASIS IN THE SHARES. IF THE HOLDING PERIOD FOR THESE SHARES EXCEEDS ONE YEAR AT THE TIME OF THE DISPOSITION, ANY GAIN WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAX AT A CURRENT MAXIMUM MARGINAL TAX RATE OF 15 FOR INDIVIDUALS AND 35 FOR CORPORATIONS. MOREOVER, GAIN, IF ANY, GENERALLY WILL BE U.S. SOURCE GAIN AND GEN
ERALLY WILL CONSTITUTE PASSIVE INCOME FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDIT LIMITATION PURPOSES. 

CODE SECTION 1248 PROVIDES THAT IF A U.S. PERSON SELLS OR EXCHANGES STOCK IN A FOREIGN CORPORATION AND SUCH PERSON OWNED DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY THROUGH CERTAIN FOREIGN ENTITIES OR CONSTRUCTIVELY 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE CORPORATION AT ANY TIME DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF DISPOSITION WHEN THE CORPORATION WAS A CFC, ANY GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF THE SHARES WILL BE TREATED AS ORDINARY INCOME TO THE EXTENT OF THE CFC S EARNINGS AND PROFITS (DETERMINED UNDER U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PRINCIPLES) DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE SHAREHOLDER HELD THE SHARES AND WHILE THE CORPORATION WAS A CFC (WITH CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS). A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER MAY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BE REQUIRED TO REPORT A DISPOSITION OF SHARES OF A CFC BY ATTACHING IRS FORM 5471 TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR INFORMATION RETURN THAT IT WOULD NORMALLY FILE FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR IN WHICH THE DISPOSITION OCCURS. FOR THESE PURPOSES, THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHA
RES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING VOTING POWER UNLESS AND UNTIL THERE EXISTS A NONPAYMENT EVENT WHICH TRIGGERS THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ELECT TWO ADDITIONAL DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS. IN SUCH CASE, THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES SHOULD BE TREATED AS VOTING STOCK FOR AS LONG AS SUCH RIGHT CONTINUES. 

SECTION 1248 ALSO APPLIES TO THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SHARES IN A FOREIGN CORPORATION IF THE FOREIGN CORPORATION WOULD BE TREATED AS A CFC FOR RPII PURPOSES AND WOULD BE TAXED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY IF IT WERE A DOMESTIC CORPORATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE SHAREHOLDER IS A 10 U.S. SHAREHOLDER OR WHETHER THE 20 GROSS INCOME EXCEPTION OR THE 20 OWNERSHIP EXCEPTION APPLIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REGULATIONS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS WHETHER OR HOW CODE SECTION 1248 WOULD APPLY TO DISPOSITIONS OF SHARES OF STOCK IN A FOREIGN CORPORATION THAT IS NOT A CFC AND DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, BUT HAS A SUBSIDIARY THAT IS A CFC AND THAT WOULD BE TAXED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY IF IT WERE A DOMESTIC CORPORATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICATION OF CODE SECTION 1248 UNDER THE RPII RULES SHOULD NOT APPLY TO THE DISPOSITION OF ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES BECAUSE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS IS NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT INTERPRET THE REGULATIONS IN A CONTRARY MANNER OR THAT THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT WILL NOT AMEND THE REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE THAT THESE RULES WILL APPLY TO DISPOSITIONS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF THESE RULES ON A DISPOSITION OF OUR SHARES. 

UNCERTAINTY AS TO APPLICATION OF RPII. REGULATIONS INTERPRETING THE RPII PROVISIONS OF THE CODE EXIST ONLY IN PROPOSED FORM. IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER THESE REGULATIONS WILL BE ADOPTED IN THEIR PROPOSED FORM OR WHAT CHANGES MIGHT ULTIMATELY BE MADE OR WHETHER ANY SUCH CHANGES, AS WELL AS ANY INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THE RPII RULES BY THE IRS, THE COURTS OR OTHERWISE, MIGHT HAVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT. ACCORDINGLY, THE MEANING OF THE RPII PROVISIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA IS UNCERTAIN. THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDE THE GRANT OF AUTHORITY TO THE U.S. TREASURY TO PRESCRIBE SUCH REGULATIONS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBSECTION, INCLUDING REGULATIONS PREVENTING THE AVOIDANCE OF THIS SUBSECTION THROUGH CROSS INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, THE
RE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE ANY DETERMINATIONS BY ENDURANCE U.K. OR ENDURANCE BERMUDA AS TO THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF RPII THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDIBLE IN INCOME OR THAT THE AMOUNTS OF THE RPII INCLUSIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON SUBSEQUENT IRS EXAMINATION. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE EFFECTS OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES. 

REDEMPTION OF SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. SUBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION HEREIN RELATING TO THE APPLICATION OF THE RPII AND PFIC RULES, UNDER SECTION 302 OF THE CODE, A REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL BE TREATED AS A DIVIDEND TO THE EXTENT OF OUR CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS, UNLESS SUCH REDEMPTION SATISFIES THE TESTS SET FORTH UNDER SECTION 302(B) OF THE CODE, WHICH WOULD TREAT THE REDEMPTION AS A SALE OR EXCHANGE SUBJECT TO TAXATION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER DISPOSITIONS OF ORDINARY SHARES AND SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. A REDEMPTION WILL BE TREATED AS A SALE OR EXCHANGE IF: (I) IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY DISPROPORTIONATE, (II) CONSTITUTES A COMPLETE TERMINATION OF THE HOLDER S STOCK INTEREST IN US, OR (III) IS NOT ESSENTIALL
Y EQUIVALENT TO A DIVIDEND , EACH WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 302(B) OF THE CODE. IN DETERMINING WHETHER ANY OF THESE TESTS ARE SATISFIED, SHARES CONSIDERED TO BE OWNED BY A U.S. PERSON BY REASON OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES SET FORTH IN THE CODE, AS WELL AS SHARES ACTUALLY OWNED, MUST GENERALLY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVE TESTS OF SECTION 302(B) OF THE CODE IS SATISFIED WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AS OF THE TIME THE DETERMINATION IS MADE, U.S. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS, AT SUCH TIME, TO DETERMINE THEIR TAX TREATMENT IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANIES. IN GENERAL, A FOREIGN CORPORATION WILL BE A PFIC DURING A GIVEN YEAR IF (I) 75 OR MORE OF ITS GROSS INCOME CONSTITUTES PASSIVE INCOME OR (II) 50 OR MORE OF ITS ASSETS PRODUCE PASSIVE INCOME. 

IF ENDURANCE HOLDINGS WERE CHARACTERIZED AS A PFIC DURING A GIVEN YEAR, U.S. PERSONS OWNING ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A PENALTY TAX AT THE TIME OF THE SALE AT A GAIN OF, OR RECEIPT OF AN EXCESS DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO, THEIR SHARES, UNLESS SUCH SHAREHOLDERS MADE A QUALIFIED ELECTING FUND ELECTION OR MARK-TO-MARKET ELECTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN THAT ENDURANCE HOLDINGS WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ITS SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR A U.S. PERSON TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS. IN GENERAL, A SHAREHOLDER RECEIVES AN EXCESS DISTRIBUTION IF THE AMOUNT OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS MORE THAN 125 OF THE AVERAGE DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES DURING THE THREE PRECEDING TAXABLE YEARS (OR SHORTER PERIOD DURING WHICH THE TAXPAYER HELD THE SHARES). IN GENERAL, THE PENALTY TAX IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INTEREST CHARGE ON TAXE
S THAT ARE DEEMED DUE DURING THE PERIOD THE SHAREHOLDER OWNED THE SHARES, COMPUTED BY ASSUMING THAT THE EXCESS DISTRIBUTION OR GAIN (IN THE CASE OF A SALE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES WAS TAXED IN EQUAL PORTIONS AT THE 
 
 50 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

HIGHEST APPLICABLE TAX RATE ON ORDINARY INCOME THROUGHOUT THE SHAREHOLDER S PERIOD OF OWNERSHIP. THE INTEREST CHARGE IS EQUAL TO THE APPLICABLE RATE IMPOSED ON UNDERPAYMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX FOR SUCH PERIOD. 

FOR THE ABOVE PURPOSES, PASSIVE INCOME GENERALLY INCLUDES INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, ANNUITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENT INCOME. THE PFIC STATUTORY PROVISIONS, HOWEVER, CONTAIN AN EXPRESS EXCEPTION FOR INCOME DERIVED IN THE ACTIVE CONDUCT OF AN INSURANCE BUSINESS BY A CORPORATION WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY ENGAGED IN AN INSURANCE BUSINESS. 

THIS EXCEPTION IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT INCOME DERIVED BY A BONA FIDE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT TREATED AS PASSIVE INCOME, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH INCOME IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FINANCIAL RESERVES IN EXCESS OF THE REASONABLE NEEDS OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. ENDURANCE HOLDINGS EXPECTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE PFIC RULES THAT EACH OF ENDURANCE U.K. AND ENDURANCE BERMUDA WILL BE PREDOMINANTLY ENGAGED IN AN INSURANCE BUSINESS AND IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE FINANCIAL RESERVES IN EXCESS OF THE REASONABLE NEEDS OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER EXPECTS TO BE TREATED AS A PFIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. THE PFIC STATUTORY PROVISIONS CONTAIN A LOOK-THROUGH RULE STATING THAT, FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER A FOREIGN CORPORATION IS A PFIC, SUCH FOREIGN CORPORATION SHALL BE TREATED AS IF IT RECEIVED DIRECTLY ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME . . . AND AS IF IT HELD ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ASSETS . . . OF ANY OTHER CORPORATION IN WHICH IT OWNS AT LEAST 25 BY VALUE OF THE SHARES. WHILE NO EXPLICIT GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED BY THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE, UNDER THIS LOOK-THROUGH RULE ENDURANCE HOLDINGS SHOULD BE DEEMED TO OWN THE ASSETS AND TO HAVE RECEIVED THE INCOME OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DIRECTLY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER IT QUALIFIES FOR THE INSURANCE EXCEPTION. CONSEQUENTLY, ENDURANCE HOLDINGS DOES NOT EXPECT TO BE TREATED AS A PFIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE LOOK-THROUGH RULE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENTION GENERALLY TO EXCLUDE BONA FIDE INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM THE APPLICATION OF PFIC PROVISION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE THIS POSITION OR THAT A COURT WILL NOT SUSTAIN SUCH CHALLENGE. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE EFFECTS OF THE PFIC RULES. 

OTHER. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING, DIVIDENDS PAID BY ENDURANCE HOLDINGS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. WITHHOLDING TAX. 

INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING. INFORMATION RETURNS MAY BE FILED WITH THE IRS IN CONNECTION WITH PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS WITH RESPECT TO OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES AND THE PROCEEDS FROM A SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES UNLESS THE SHAREHOLDER ESTABLISHES AN EXEMPTION FROM THE INFORMATION REPORTING RULES. A U.S. PERSON HOLDING OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES THAT DOES NOT ESTABLISH SUCH AN EXEMPTION MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX ON THESE PAYMENTS IF THE HOLDER FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH THE BACKUP WITHHOLDING RULES. THE AMOUNT OF ANY BACKUP WITHHOLDING FROM A PAYMENT TO A U.S. PERSON WILL BE ALLOWED AS A CREDIT AGAINST THE U.S. PERSON S U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY AND MAY ENTITLE SUCH PERSON TO A REFUND, PROVIDED 
THAT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IS FURNISHED TO THE IRS. 

SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE NON-U.S. PERSONS 

DIVIDENDS AND DISPOSITION. IN GENERAL (AND SUBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW UNDER INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING ), A NON-U.S. PERSON WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME OR WITHHOLDING TAX WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS ON, OR GAIN UPON THE DISPOSITION OF, OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES UNLESS (I) THE DIVIDENDS OR GAIN IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH THE CONDUCT BY THE NON-U.S. PERSON OF A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES OR (II) IN THE CASE OF GAIN UPON THE DISPOSITION OF SHARES, THE NON-U.S. PERSON IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 183 DAYS OR MORE IN THE TAXABLE YEAR AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET. NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. ESTATE TAX WITH RESPECT TO OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. 

DIVIDENDS OR GAIN THAT IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH THE CONDUCT BY A NON-U.S. PERSON OF A TRADE OR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY WILL BE SUBJECT TO REGULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF IT WERE REALIZED BY A U.S. PERSON. IN ADDITION, IF SUCH NON-US. PERSON IS A NON-US.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CORPORATION, SUCH DIVIDENDS OR GAIN MAY BE SUBJECT TO A BRANCH PROFITS TAX AT A RATE OF 30 (OR SUCH LOWER RATE AS IS PROVIDED BY AN APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY). 

INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING. IF OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES ARE HELD BY A NON-U.S. PERSON THROUGH A NON-U.S. (AND NON-U.S. RELATED) BROKER OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING GENERALLY WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED. INFORMATION REPORTING, AND POSSIBLY BACKUP WITHHOLDING, MAY APPLY IF THE SHARES ARE HELD BY A NON-U.S. PERSON THROUGH A U.S. (OR U.S. RELATED) BROKER OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THE NON-U.S. PERSON FAILS TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION. NON-U.S. PERSONS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING RULES. 

PROPOSED U.S. TAX LEGISLATION. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN PERCEIVED TAX ADVANTAGES OF COMPANIES (INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES) THAT HAVE LEGAL DOMICILES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BUT HAVE CERTAIN U.S. CONNECTIONS. WHILE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY PENDING LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS WHICH, IF ENACTED, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BROADER BASED LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS COULD EMERGE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON US OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

RISK FACTORS 
 
 IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THAT WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
 OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC . 
 THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CREATED UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DISRUPTIONS THAT HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED, INCLUDING THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC. 
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE CARES ACT, WHICH ALLOWS BORROWERS WITH FEDERALLY-BACKED LOANS TO REQUEST TEMPORARY PAYMENT FORBEARANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASED BORROWER HARDSHIPS RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE INITIAL FORBEARANCE PERIOD IS UP TO 180 DAYS, SUBJECT TO A FURTHER EXTENSION OF UP TO 180 DAYS. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2021 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL EXTENSION OF THREE TO SIX MONTHS DEPENDING ON LOAN TYPE. AS A RESULT OF THE CARES ACT FORBEARANCE REQUIREMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED CONTINUED ELEVATED DELINQUENCIES IN OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO FINANCE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ADVANCES OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE HOLDERS OF THE SECURITIES HOLDING THOSE LOANS, AS WELL AS ADVANCES OF PROPERTY TAXES, INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND OTHER EXPENSES TO PROTECT INVESTORS INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTIES SECURING THE LOANS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, ELEVATED PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY WAS SUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENT ADVANCES REQUIRED UNDER THE CARES ACT, HOWEVER, IN THE FUTURE ELEVATED PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER REQUIRED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ADVANCES. WE ALSO EXPECT THE EFFECTS OF THE CARES ACT FORBEARANCE REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE OUR SERVICING FEE INCOME AND INCREASE OUR SERVICING EXPENSES DUE TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF DELINQUENT LOANS AND SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF FORBEARANCE THAT WE HAVE GRANTED AND CONTINUE TO GRANT, AS WELL AS THE RESOLUTION OF LOANS THAT WE EXPECT TO ULTIMATELY DEFAULT AS THE RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2.1 OF THE LOANS IN OUR MSR PORTFOLIO WERE IN COVID-19 RELATED FORBEARANCE PLANS AND DELINQUENT RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF SERVICING ADVANCES WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE DUE TO BORROWER DELINQUENCIES. 
 FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY AND REDUCED LIQUIDITY, RESULTING IN UNPRECEDENTED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO LOWER THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE TO NEAR ZERO AND SUPPORT MARKET LIQUIDITY BY PURCHASING ASSETS IN MANY FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES MARKET. THE CARES ACT FORBEARANCE REQUIREMENTS AND THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EARLY 2020 HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SERVICING ASSETS AND CRT ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CARES ACT FORBEARANCE REQUIREMENTS AND THE DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS LINKED TO CONSUMER CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN EARLY 2020 CAUSED US TO REPORT MATERIAL LOSSES. 
 FURTHER MARKET VOLATILITY OR ECONOMIC WEAKNESS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR CREDIT ASSETS AND MAKE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OPTIMIZE OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. ALSO, OUR LIQUIDITY AND/OR REGULATORY CAPITAL COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAIL TO MEET OR SATISFY ANY OF THE COVENANTS IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE WOULD BE IN DEFAULT UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CROSS-DEFAULT OR CROSS-ACCELERATION UNDER OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AND OUR LENDERS COULD ELECT TO DECLARE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE (OR SUCH AMOUNTS MAY AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE), TERMINATE THEIR COMMITMENTS, REQUIRE THE POSTING OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND ENFORCE THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERESTS AGAINST EXISTING COLLATERAL. 
 WE MAY ALSO HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, OR AT ALL, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS OR ADDRESS MATURING LIABILITIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES RENEWALS OF OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR LENDERS WHO MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE VOLATILITY AND DISLOCATIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND MAY NOT BE WILLING OR ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND US CREDIT ON THE SAME TERMS, OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. 
 IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE DISRUPTED IF OUR MANAGER IS UNABLE TO OPERATE DUE TO CHANGING GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS TRAVEL BANS AND QUARANTINES PLACED OR REINSTITUTED ON ITS EMPLOYEES OR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING SUCCESSFULLY OPERATING ITS AND OUR BUSINESS FROM REMOTE LOCATIONS, ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF ITS EMPLOYEES HEALTH, AND MAINTAINING ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RESPONSES TO THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING, MAY BE INCONSISTENT AND CONFLICT IN SCOPE OR APPLICATION, AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE. THESE REGULATORY RESPONSES MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS, MAY EXTEND EXISTING CARES ACT FORBEARANCE REQUIREMENTS AND DELAY OUR LICENSING EFFORTS, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE CARES ACT AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION GIVEN THE EXISTING AMBIGUITIES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FUTURE CLASS ACTION AND OTHER LITIGATION RISK. 
 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND SUPPORT THE ECONOMY INCLUDING PROVIDING MONETARY RELIEF AND EXTENDING FORECLOSURE AND EVICTION MORATORIA . THE OUTCOME OF THESE MEASURES ARE UNKNOWN AND THEY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT MARKET DISLOCATIONS OR AVERT SEVERE AND PROLONGED REDUCTIONS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. WE MAY ALSO FACE INCREASED RISKS OF DISPUTES WITH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE EFFICACY OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS IT ARE CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. EVEN AFTER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SUBSIDES, THE ECONOMY MAY NOT FULLY RECOVER FOR SOME TIME AND WE MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A PROLONGED RECESSION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. 
 TO THE EXTENT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IT MAY ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF HEIGHTENING MANY OF THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED IN THIS ITEM 1A. 
 THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE CARES ACT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BORROWERS WHO ARE IN FORBEARANCE WHOSE LOANS ARE IN OUR CRT ARRANGEMENTS WHICH MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT FUTURE CREDIT OR FAIR VALUE LOSSES. 
 ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE CARES ACT, WHICH ALLOWS BORROWERS WITH FEDERALLY-BACKED LOANS TO REQUEST TEMPORARY PAYMENT FORBEARANCE IF THEY ATTEST THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY EXPERIENCING ANY FINANCIAL HARDSHIP RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE INITIAL FORBEARANCE PERIOD IS UP TO 180 DAYS, SUBJECT TO FURTHER EXTENSION OF UP TO 180 DAYS. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2021 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL EXTENSION OF THREE TO SIX MONTHS DEPENDING ON LOAN TYPE. 
 THE CARES ACT ALSO PRECLUDES LOAN SERVICERS LIKE US FROM REPORTING BORROWERS SUBJECT TO FORBEARANCE PLANS AS DELINQUENT TO THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERALLY-BACKED LOANS MAY STILL BE CHARACTERIZED AS DELINQUENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR CRT ARRANGEMENTS WITH FANNIE MAE. OUR CRT ARRANGEMENTS ARE STRUCTURED SUCH THAT WE RETAIN A PORTION OF THE CREDIT RISK AND AN INTEREST-ONLY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE REFERENCE LOANS AND, UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR CRT AGREEMENTS, MAY BE REQUIRED TO REALIZE LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A LOAN DELINQUENCY OF 180 DAYS OR MORE EVEN WHERE THERE IS ULTIMATELY NO LOSS REALIZED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN (E.G., AS A RESULT OF A BORROWER S RE-PERFORMANCE). 
 ALTHOUGH THESE CRT AGREEMENTS WERE AMENDED IN 2018 TO ENSURE THAT FORBEARANCES RESULTING FROM HURRICANE HARVEY AND HURRICANE IRMA WERE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE DELINQUENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE 180 DAY DELINQUENCY FIXED LOSS SEVERITY SCHEDULE, FANNIE MAE AND ITS REGULATOR, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY, ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NOT PROVIDE SIMILAR TREATMENT FOR FORBEARANCES RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR CERTAIN OF OUR CRT AGREEMENTS. 
 GIVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MANDATE TO APPROVE REQUESTED FORBEARANCES UPON THE REQUEST OF A BORROWER AND SUBJECT ONLY TO HIS OR HER ATTESTATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT, WE EXPECT THE NUMBER OF FORBEARANCES REQUESTED AND APPROVED UNDER OUR CRT ARRANGEMENTS WILL RESULT IN CREDIT LOSSES AND FAIR VALUE LOSSES THAT MAY BE MATERIAL AND THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THE EVENT OF A FORECLOSURE, THE PROCEEDS UPON THE SALE OF SUCH UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE BORROWER S MORTGAGE LOAN OBLIGATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSSES TO OUR CRT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO US. ANY SUCH LOSSES WE INCUR MAY REDUCE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND THE CONTINUALLY CHANGING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING BUSINESSES. THESE REGULATIONS DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND REQUIRE CONSTANT COMPLIANCE, MONITORING AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS. PLS AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IT USES, INCLUDING OUTSIDE COUNSEL RETAINED TO PROCESS FORECLOSURES AND BANKRUPTCIES, MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH SOME OF THESE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. 
 OUR FAILURE OR THE FAILURE OF PLS TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES COULD SUBJECT US TO LAWSUITS OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE OR THE FAILURE OF PLS TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, REDUCED PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS, MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF LOANS, PERMANENT 
 20 

FORGIVENESS OF DEBT, DELAYS IN THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, INCREASED SERVICING ADVANCES, LITIGATION, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AND REPURCHASE AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. 
 
 THE FAILURE OF OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS TO COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY ALSO RESULT IN THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. PLS HAS IN PLACE A DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ASSESS AREAS OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO LOANS WE ACQUIRE FROM SUCH CORRESPONDENT SELLERS. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT DETECT EVERY VIOLATION OF LAW AND, TO THE EXTENT ANY CORRESPONDENT SELLERS, THIRD PARTY ORIGINATORS, SERVICERS OR BROKERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND ANY OF THEIR LOANS OR MSRS BECOME PART OF OUR ASSETS, IT COULD SUBJECT US, AS AN ASSIGNEE OR PURCHASER OF THE RELATED LOANS OR MSRS, TO MONETARY PENALTIES OR OTHER LOSSES. WHILE WE MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO SEEK INDEMNITY OR REPURCHASE FROM CERTAIN OF THESE LENDERS, THIRD PARTY ORIGINATORS, SERVICERS OR BROKERS, IF ANY OF THEM ARE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR INDEMNITY OR REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS TO US TO A MATERIAL EXTENT, OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER VENDORS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO OPERATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES. OUR FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER VENDORS TO MITIGATE RISKS OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS MAY ALSO HAVE THESE NEGATIVE RESULTS. 
 
 THE RECENT OUTCOME OF THE 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL AND CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES OR REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY IN OUR INDUSTRY AND MAY RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN AND WHETHER SIGNIFICANT POLICY OR REGULATORY CHANGES WOULD OCCUR, ANY SUCH CHANGES ON THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES, THE AVAILABILITY OF MORTGAGE FINANCING, INTEREST RATES, CONSUMER SPENDING, THE ECONOMY AND THE GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION TAKES ACTION BY PROPOSING AND/OR PASSING REGULATORY POLICIES THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR INDUSTRY, SUCH ACTIONS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH STATE REGULATORS IMPOSE NEW MINIMUM NET WORTH, CAPITAL RATIO AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT ARE OVERLY BURDENSOME, SUCH ACTIONS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL FSOC AND CONFERENCE OF STATE BANK SUPERVISORS CSBS HAVE BEEN REVIEWING WHETHER STATE CHARTERED NONBANK MORTGAGE SERVICERS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO "SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS" STANDARDS SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, EVEN THOUGH NONBANK MORTGAGE SERVICERS DO NOT HOLD ANY FUNDS IN FEDERALLY INSURED DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2020, THE CSBS, RELEASED PROPOSED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR STATE OVERSIGHT OF NONBANK MORTGAGE SERVICERS. THE PROPOSED CSBS PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WOULD INCLUDE REVISED MINIMUM NET WORTH, CAPITAL RATIO AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS SIMILAR TO EXISTING FHFA REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD REQUIRE SERVICERS TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ALLOWABLE ASSETS TO COVER NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED FOR SERVICING EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, THE FSOC HAS ENCOURAGED STATE REGULATORS TO WORK TO DEVELOP PRUDENTIAL AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS FOR NONBANK MORTGAGE SERVICERS AND HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE DESCRIBING THE PROCESS FSOC WOULD FOLLOW IF IT WERE TO CONSIDER MAKING A DETERMINATION TO SUBJECT A NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANY TO SUPERVISION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS. 
 NEW CFPB AND STATE RULES AND REGULATIONS OR MORE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS BY THE CFPB OR STATE REGULATORS COULD RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES, PENALTIES AND THE INHERENT REPUTATIONAL HARM THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH ACTIONS. 
 
 THE CFPB HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, IMPOSE MONETARY PENALTIES, REQUIRE REMEDIATION OF PRACTICES, PURSUE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS OR LITIGATION, AND OBTAIN CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS FOR VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A DECLINE IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY THE CFPB UNDER THE PRIOR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, EXAMINATIONS BY STATE REGULATORS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND SERVICING SECTORS BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE INCREASED AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE CFPB AND STATE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, WHETHER ACTUAL OR ALLEGED, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR OR PLS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, WHETHER ACTUAL OR ALLEGED, WOULD EXPOSE US OR PLS TO FINES, PENALTIES OR POTENTIAL LITIGATION LIABILITIES, INCLUDING COSTS, SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OR PLS BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 21 

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND ANY CHANGES IN THESE ENTITIES, THEIR CURRENT ROLES OR THE LEADERSHIP AT SUCH ENTITIES OR THEIR REGULATORS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH LOAN SALES DEPENDS ON PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE AGENCIES AND OTHERS THAT FACILITATE THE ISSUANCE OF MBS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. PRESENTLY, ALMOST ALL OF THE NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE FROM MORTGAGE LENDERS THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES QUALIFY UNDER EXISTING STANDARDS FOR INCLUSION IN MORTGAGE SECURITIES BACKED BY THE AGENCIES. WE ALSO DERIVE OTHER MATERIAL FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM THESE RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO AVOID CERTAIN LOAN INVENTORY FINANCE COSTS THROUGH STREAMLINED LOAN FUNDING AND SALE PROCEDURES. 
 A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN RECENT YEARS THAT WOULD WIND DOWN OR PHASE OUT THE GSES, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL BY THE PRIOR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TO END THE CONSERVATORSHIP AND PRIVATIZE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. ON NOVEMBER 18, 2020, THE FHFA FINALIZED NEW REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES FOR FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC THAT REQUIRES THEM TO INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL TO 280 BILLION. THE FHFA DID NOT SPECIFY HOW THE NEW REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL BE ACHIEVED OR A TIMEFRAME FOR MEETING THE CAPITAL TARGET, HOWEVER, ANY INCREASE IN GUARANTY FEES OR OTHER COSTS IMPOSED BY FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MORTGAGE MARKET AND COULD REDUCE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC S FUTURE ROLE IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE WITH RESPECT TO THE GSES. ANY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AND THEIR REGULATORS OR THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND ANY CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP AT ANY OF THESE ENTITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. ANY DISCONTINUATION OF, OR SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN, THE OPERATION OF FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR ANY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, FINANCIAL CONDITION, ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE PRIMARY OR SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKETS OR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 ELIMINATION OF THE TRADITIONAL ROLES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, OR ANY CHANGES TO THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF THE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC OR THE FEES, TERMS AND GUIDELINES THAT GOVERN OUR SELLING AND SERVICING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM COULD ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SELL AND SECURITIZE LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, AND THE PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. MOREOVER, ANY CHANGES TO THE NATURE OF THE GSES OR THEIR GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS COULD REDEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES AN AGENCY MBS AND COULD HAVE BROAD ADVERSE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKET AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IS ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE FACT THAT THE AGENCIES HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED SUCH LOANS DIRECTLY FROM MORTGAGE LENDERS, BUT HAVE INSTEAD RELIED ON BANKS AND NON-BANK AGGREGATORS SUCH AS US TO ACQUIRE, AGGREGATE AND SECURITIZE OR OTHERWISE SELL SUCH LOANS TO INVESTORS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. CERTAIN OF THE AGENCIES HAVE APPROVED NEW AND SMALLER LENDERS THAT TRADITIONALLY MAY NOT HAVE QUALIFIED FOR SUCH APPROVALS. TO THE EXTENT THAT MORTGAGE LENDERS CHOOSE TO SELL DIRECTLY TO THE AGENCIES RATHER THAN THROUGH LOAN AGGREGATORS LIKE US, THIS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF LOANS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE, AND IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SIMILARLY, TO THE EXTENT THE AGENCIES INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PURCHASES AND SALES FOR THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE CFPB S FINAL GENERAL QUALIFIED MORTGAGE QM LOAN RULE FOR CERTAIN GSE ELIGIBLE LOANS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO REPAY RULES. 
 THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVIDES THAT A LENDER MUST MAKE A REASONABLE, GOOD FAITH DETERMINATION OF EACH BORROWER S ABILITY TO REPAY A LOAN, BUT MAY PRESUME THAT A BORROWER WILL BE ABLE TO REPAY A LOAN IF SUCH LOAN HAS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT MEET THE QM DEFINITION. THE CFPB ADOPTED ITS QM DEFINITION THAT ESTABLISHES RIGOROUS UNDERWRITING AND PRODUCT FEATURE REQUIREMENTS FOR A LOAN TO BE DEEMED A QM. WITHIN THOSE REGULATIONS, THE CFPB CREATED A SPECIAL EXEMPTION FOR THE GSES THAT IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS THE QM PATCH, WHICH ALLOWS ANY GSE-ELIGIBLE LOAN TO BE DEEMED A QM. THE QM PATCH EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES QM DESIGNATION FOR GSE ELIGIBLE LOANS THAT HAVE A DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO IN EXCESS OF 43 , WHICH REPRESENTS A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF THE LOANS CURRENTLY PURCHASED BY THE GSES. WITHOUT THE QM PATCH OR AN ALTERNATIVE, LOANS WITH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS ABOVE 43 WOULD NOT BE DESIGNATED AS QMS UNLESS THEY WERE INSURED BY A FEDERAL AGENCY SUCH AS THE FHA OR VA, WHICH HAVE EACH ADOPTED THEIR OWN QM DEFINITION THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO LIMITATION. IN OCTOBER 2020, THE CFPB ISSUED A RULE PROVIDING THAT THE QM PATCH WILL EXPIRE ON THE EARLIER OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FINAL AMENDMENT REVISING THE GENERAL QM LOAN DEFINITION OR UPON THE DATE THAT THE GSES EXIT CONSERVATORSHIP. ON DECEMBER 11, 2020, THE CFPB ISSUED FINAL GENERAL QM LOAN RULES REPLACING THE DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO LIMITATIONS WITH A PRICE-BASED APPROACH, WHICH MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. HOUSING AND MORTGAGE MARKET SINCE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THE CREDIT MARKETS AND BORROWERS WILL RESPOND TO THE NEW REGULATIONS. FAILURE TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL 
 22 

PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH THE FINAL GENERAL QM LOAN RULES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE AND/OR PLS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE VARIOUS AGENCY APPROVALS AND STATE LICENSES IN ORDER TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE AND/OR PLS WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THOSE AGENCY APPROVALS OR STATE LICENSES. 
 BECAUSE WE AND PLS ARE NOT FEDERALLY CHARTERED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, NEITHER WE NOR PLS BENEFITS FROM EXEMPTIONS TO STATE MORTGAGE LENDING, LOAN SERVICING OR DEBT COLLECTION LICENSING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, PLS IS LICENSED, OR IS TAKING STEPS TO BECOME LICENSED, IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, AND FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES, WHERE IT IS REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED AND BELIEVES IT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE TO BECOME LICENSED. 
 OUR FAILURE OR THE FAILURE BY PLS TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY LICENSES, COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LICENSING LAWS OR SATISFY THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN THEM OVER TIME COULD RESTRICT OUR DIRECT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, RESULT IN LITIGATION OR CIVIL AND OTHER MONETARY PENALTIES, OR CAUSE US TO DEFAULT UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR LENDING ARRANGEMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE AND PLS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO HOLD THE AGENCY APPROVALS IN ORDER TO SELL LOANS TO THE AGENCIES AND SERVICE SUCH LOANS ON THEIR BEHALF. OUR FAILURE, OR THE FAILURE OF PLS, TO SATISFY THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN SUCH AGENCY APPROVALS OVER TIME WOULD ALSO RESTRICT OUR DIRECT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 
 IN ADDITION, WE AND PLS ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN INCREASES IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND WE OR PLS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THESE REGULATORS DUE TO COMPLIANCE ERRORS, OR WE OR PLS MAY LOSE OUR LICENSES. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR FINES AND PENALTIES INCURRED IN ONE JURISDICTION MAY CAUSE INVESTIGATIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS BY REGULATORS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 
 OUR OR PLS INABILITY TO MEET CERTAIN NET WORTH AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE AGENCIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. 
 WE AND OUR SERVICERS ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY MORTGAGE SELLERS/SERVICERS AND MBS ISSUERS, AS APPLICABLE. THESE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ALIGN THE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MORTGAGE SELLERS/SERVICERS AND MBS ISSUERS TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE AGENCIES. THESE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES , INCLUDE NET WORTH, CAPITAL RATIO AND/OR LIQUIDITY CRITERIA IN ORDER TO SET A MINIMUM LEVEL OF CAPITAL NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY ABSORB POTENTIAL LOSSES AND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY NEEDED TO SERVICE AGENCY LOANS AND MBS AND COVER THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND RISKS. 
 IN ORDER TO MEET THESE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, WE AND PLS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN RATHER THAN SPEND OR INVEST, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN AMOUNTS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OR ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THIS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDE US AND PLS, AS NON-BANK MORTGAGE LENDERS, FROM GROWING OUR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IN RELATION TO FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET, THE AGENCIES MAY SUSPEND OR TERMINATE AGENCY APPROVAL OR CERTAIN AGREEMENTS WITH US OR PLS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US OR PLS TO CROSS DEFAULT UNDER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 MARKET AND FINANCIAL RISKS 
 A PROLONGED ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, RECESSION OR DECLINING REAL ESTATE VALUES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INVESTMENTS ARE MORE ACUTE DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION, ESPECIALLY IF THESE PERIODS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND DECLINING REAL ESTATE VALUES. THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A WEAKENING ECONOMY, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND DECLINING REAL ESTATE VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT BORROWERS WILL DEFAULT ON THEIR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND THAT WE WILL INCUR LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT ON A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL WE FORECLOSE UPON MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF SUCH INVESTMENT OR MAY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO REALIZE. THESE FACTORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RE-DEFAULT RATES EVEN AFTER WE HAVE COMPLETED LOAN MODIFICATIONS. ANY PERIOD OF INCREASED PAYMENT DELINQUENCIES, FORECLOSURES OR LOSSES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NET INTEREST INCOME GENERATED FROM OUR PORTFOLIO AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE AND FINANCE FUTURE INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 23 

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE MORTGAGE, REAL ESTATE AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. 
 THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE MORTGAGE MARKETS, THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. CONTINUING CONCERNS OVER FACTORS INCLUDING THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, INFLATION, DEFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, PERSONAL AND BUSINESS INCOME TAXES, HEALTHCARE, ENERGY COSTS, DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES, CLIMATE CHANGE, THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE MORTGAGE MARKETS AND THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED VOLATILITY AND UNCLEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND MARKETS GOING FORWARD. THE MORTGAGE MARKETS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LENDING LANDSCAPE, DEFAULTS, CREDIT LOSSES AND SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY CONCERNS. A DESTABILIZATION OF THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS OR DETERIORATION IN THESE MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, REDUCE OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUME, LOWER OUR MARGINS, REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF SERVICING MORTGAGES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE, EITHER AT A PROFIT OR AT ALL. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 A DISRUPTION IN THE MBS MARKET COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 IN OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WE DELIVER NEWLY ORIGINATED AGENCY-ELIGIBLE LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE TO FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC TO BE POOLED INTO AGENCY MBS SECURITIES OR TRANSFER GOVERNMENT LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE TO PLS, WHICH POOLS THEM INTO GINNIE MAE MBS SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ENACTED MONETARY POLICIES TO PURCHASE MBS ON THE OPEN MARKET THAT HAS AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE MBS MARKET. ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR PERIOD OF ILLIQUIDITY IN THE GENERAL MBS MARKET WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY BECAUSE NO EXISTING ALTERNATIVE SECONDARY MARKET WOULD LIKELY BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ON A TIMELY BASIS THE VOLUME OF LOANS THAT WE TYPICALLY ACQUIRE AND SELL IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, IF THE MBS MARKET EXPERIENCES A PERIOD OF ILLIQUIDITY, WE MIGHT BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING THE LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT FAVORABLE PRICES OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE DEBT SECURING THESE ASSETS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 
 WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES, EXPOSE US TO SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN COSTS DUE TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF DEFAULT UNDER OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT TO FUND FUTURE NEEDS. 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD 8.7 BILLION OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING (APPROXIMATELY 8.5 BILLION OF WHICH WAS SECURED) AND UP TO 4.6 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL CAPACITY UNDER OUR SECURED BORROWINGS AND OTHER SECURED DEBT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THIS SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS AND ANY FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS WE INCUR COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES AND, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD: 

REQUIRE US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING INDEBTEDNESS WE MAY INCUR IN THE FUTURE, THEREBY REDUCING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES 

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF ANY OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING ANY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS WHICH, IF NOT CURED OR WAIVED, COULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS 

SUBJECT US TO INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO INTEREST RATE INCREASES 

MAKE US MORE VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, ADVERSE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS OR CATASTROPHIC EXTERNAL EVENTS, INCLUDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES 

REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR RESPONDING TO CHANGING BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO CARRY ON ACTIVITIES IMPORTANT TO OUR GROWTH AND/OR 

PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO COMPETITORS THAT HAVE RELATIVELY LESS DEBT THAN WE HAVE. 

 IN ADDITION, OUR SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, PERFORMANCE AND MANY OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. 
 24 

WE FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS WITH BORROWINGS, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS AND MAY REDUCE CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE CURRENTLY LEVERAGE AND, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE, INTEND TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH BORROWINGS, THE LEVEL OF WHICH MAY VARY BASED ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS AND MARKET CONDITIONS. WE GENERALLY FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS WITH RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM FACILITIES UNTIL A SUFFICIENT PORTFOLIO IS ACCUMULATED OR LONGER-TERM FINANCING BECOMES AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUITABLE NON-RECOURSE LONG-TERM FINANCING OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, DURING THE PERIOD THAT ANY SHORT-TERM FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE, SUFFICIENT ELIGIBLE ASSETS OR SECURITIES TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF A SECURITIZATION. WE ALSO BEAR THE RISK THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NEW SHORT-TERM FACILITIES OR TO RENEW ANY SHORT-TERM FACILITIES AFTER THEY EXPIRE SHOULD WE NEED MORE TIME TO OBTAIN LONG-TERM FINANCING OR SEEK AND ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT ELIGIBLE ASSETS OR SECURITIES FOR A SECURITIZATION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AND RENEW SHORT-TERM FACILITIES OR TO CONSUMMATE SECURITIZATIONS TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SEEK OTHER FORMS OF POTENTIALLY LESS ATTRACTIVE FINANCING OR TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME OR UNFAVORABLE PRICE. 
 SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SELL SECURITIES (INCLUDING SECURITIES WE RETAIN THROUGH OUR CRT INVESTMENTS) OR LOANS TO LENDERS (I.E., REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COUNTERPARTIES) AND RECEIVE CASH FROM THE LENDERS. WE CURRENTLY FINANCE OUR CRT INVESTMENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TERM NOTES AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. UNLIKE MBS AND OTHER SECURITIES WE FINANCE UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OUR CRT INVESTMENT IS ILLIQUID IN NATURE AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE. FURTHER, THE SIZE OF OUR CRT INVESTMENT MAKES IT A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT ANY MARGIN CALL COULD BE MATERIAL IN NATURE, AND OUR INABILITY TO SATISFY ANY SUCH MARGIN CALL OR LIQUIDATE THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. 
 WE ALSO CURRENTLY FINANCE CERTAIN OF OUR MSRS AND ESS UNDER SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. OUR FREDDIE MAC MSRS ARE PLEDGED TO SECURE BORROWINGS UNDER A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, WHILE OUR FANNIE MAE MSRS ARE PLEDGED TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH FANNIE MAE MSRS AND REPAID THROUGH THE CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PMC. OUR GINNIE MAE ESS IS SOLD UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TO PLS AS PART OF A STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTION. PLS, IN TURN, PLEDGES SUCH ESS ALONG WITH ALL OF ITS GINNIE MAE MSRS UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH GINNIE MAE ASSETS. THE NOTES ARE REPAID THROUGH THE CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER ITS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PLS, WHICH, IN TURN, RECEIVES CASH FLOWS FROM US UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT SECURED BY THE GINNIE MAE ESS. IN EACH CASE, A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE PLEDGED COLLATERAL CAN RESULT IN A MARGIN CALL. ANY SUCH MARGIN CALL MAY REQUIRE THAT WE LIQUIDATE ASSETS AT A DISADVANTAGEOUS TIME OR PROVIDE THAT THE SECURED PARTIES MAY SELL THE COLLATERAL, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. EACH OF THE SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE FINANCE MSRS AND ESS IS FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC OR GINNIE MAE, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO WHICH OUR AND THE SECURED PARTIES RIGHTS ARE SUBORDINATE IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE APPLICABLE AGENCY. ANY EXTINGUISHMENT OF OUR AND THE SECURED PARTIES RIGHTS IN THE RELATED COLLATERAL COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. 
 WE MAY IN THE FUTURE UTILIZE OTHER SOURCES OF BORROWINGS, INCLUDING TERM LOANS, BANK CREDIT FACILITIES AND STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHERS. THE AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE WE EMPLOY VARIES DEPENDING ON THE ASSET CLASS BEING FINANCED, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND ACCESS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH LENDERS AND THE LENDERS AND RATING AGENCIES ESTIMATE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE STABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO S CASH FLOW. 
 OUR RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE REDUCED TO THE EXTENT THAT CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FINANCING RELATIVE TO THE INCOME THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED. OUR DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS ALSO REDUCE CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, WE RISK THE LOSS OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR ASSETS TO FORECLOSURE OR SALE TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS. 
 OUR FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES. 
 THE LENDERS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US AND/OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH, PROFITABILITY AND OUR RATIO OF TOTAL LIABILITIES TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH. OUR LENDERS ALSO REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN A SPECIFIED LIQUIDITY POSITION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE LIQUIDITY LEVELS, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SELL ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AT A LOSS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD DETERIORATE RAPIDLY. 
 OUR EXISTING FINANCING AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT IMPACT OUR FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE OUR OPERATING POLICIES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. IF WE DEFAULT ON OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER A CREDIT OR FINANCING AGREEMENT, FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS OR BREACH OUR REPRESENTATIONS AND ARE UNABLE TO CURE, THE LENDER MAY BE ABLE TO TERMINATE THE TRANSACTION OR ITS COMMITMENTS, ACCELERATE ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR REPURCHASE THE ASSETS, AND/OR CEASE ENTERING INTO ANY OTHER CREDIT TRANSACTIONS WITH US. 
 25 

BECAUSE OUR FINANCING AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS, A DEFAULT THAT OCCURS UNDER ANY ONE AGREEMENT COULD ALLOW THE LENDERS UNDER OUR OTHER AGREEMENTS TO ALSO DECLARE A DEFAULT, THEREBY EXPOSING US TO A VARIETY OF LENDER REMEDIES, SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING THEREFROM. ANY LOSSES THAT WE INCUR ON OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 AS THE SERVICER OF THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PLS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH, LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND ITS RATIO OF TOTAL LIABILITIES TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH. PLS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE COVENANTS WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN A SERVICER TERMINATION EVENT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THUS, IN ADDITION TO RELYING UPON PCM TO MANAGE OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WE RELY UPON PLS TO MANAGE ITS OWN FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL. A SERVICER TERMINATION EVENT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT RESULTING FROM PLS BREACH OF ITS FINANCIAL OR OTHER COVENANTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIRED TO FINANCE OUR ASSETS AND GROW OUR BUSINESSES. 
 THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESSES REQUIRES CONTINUED ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT THE DESIRED TIMES, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING MSRS AND ESS, FOR WHICH FINANCING HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN DEBT FINANCING FOR MSRS AND ESS COULD REQUIRE US TO SEEK EQUITY CAPITAL THAT MAY BE MORE COSTLY OR UNAVAILABLE TO US. 
 WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT EXTEND US CREDIT ON TERMS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE. THESE BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN REGULATORY SUPERVISION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS AND RISK THRESHOLDS AND TOLERANCES, ANY OF WHICH MAY CHANGE MATERIALLY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO EXTEND CREDIT TO US SPECIFICALLY OR MORTGAGE LENDERS AND SERVICERS GENERALLY. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND LIMIT OR OTHERWISE ELIMINATE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL, IN WHICH CASE OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE ESS RELATING TO GINNIE MAE MSRS IS CURRENTLY DEPENDENT ON PASS THROUGH FINANCING WE OBTAIN THROUGH PLS, WHICH RETAINS THE MSRS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESS WE ACQUIRE. AFTER OUR INITIAL ACQUISITION OF ESS, WE THEN FINANCE THE ACQUIRED ESS WITH PLS UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND PLS, IN TURN, RE-PLEDGES THE ESS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED MSRS IT RETAINS) UNDER A MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH GINNIE MAE MSRS AND ESS AND REPAID THROUGH THE CASH RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PLS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THIS PASS THROUGH FINANCING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US. 
 THIS FINANCING ARRANGEMENT ALSO SUBJECTS US TO THE CREDIT RISK OF PLS. TO THE EXTENT PLS DOES NOT APPLY OUR PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TO THE ALLOCABLE PORTION OF ITS BORROWINGS UNDER THE MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, OR TO THE EXTENT PLS OTHERWISE DEFAULTS UNDER THE MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, OUR ESS WOULD BE AT A RISK OF TOTAL LOSS. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE A GUARANTEE FOR THE AMOUNT OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT ARE ALLOCABLE TO THE PASS THROUGH FINANCING OF OUR ESS. IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GUARANTY FOLLOWING A DEFAULT BY PLS, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO DEFAULT UNDER OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ANY DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT THE DESIRED TIMES, OR AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL OR OBTAIN FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. 
 IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO 300 MILLION OF OUR COMMON SHARES PURSUANT TO A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD 46.1 MILLION REMAINING UNDER THE CURRENT BOARD OF TRUSTEES AUTHORIZATION, AND WE MAY CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE SHARES TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE IT IS IN THE COMPANY S BEST INTEREST TO DO SO. INCREASED ACTIVITY IN OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, MARKET VALUE AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ASSESSMENT BY OUR LENDERS, CREDIT PROVIDERS OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES REGARDING OUR NET WORTH AND, THEREFORE, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE NEW CAPITAL. 
 INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. 
 INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY AND TAX POLICIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS PRESENT A VARIETY OF RISKS TO OUR 
 26 

OPERATIONS. OUR PRIMARY INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES RELATE TO THE YIELD ON OUR INVESTMENTS, THEIR FAIR VALUES AND THE FINANCING COST OF OUR DEBT, AS WELL AS ANY DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE UTILIZE FOR HEDGING PURPOSES. 
 CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AFFECT OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTEREST INCOME WE EARN ON OUR INTEREST EARNING INVESTMENTS AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE WE INCUR IN FINANCING THESE INVESTMENTS. INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS RESULTING IN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE EXCEEDING INTEREST INCOME MAY RESULT IN OPERATING LOSSES FOR US. AN INCREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VOLUME OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGES AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. 
 CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES ALSO MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING OUR PIPELINE OF LOAN COMMITMENTS) AND ANY RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE VALUE OF NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS ACQUIRED THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION SEGMENT, AND OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE GAINS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY ALSO AFFECT BORROWER DEFAULT RATES AND MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE OR MODIFY LOANS AND/OR TO SELL REO. DECREASING INTEREST RATES MAY CAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF BORROWERS TO REFINANCE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF MORTGAGE SERVICING BUSINESS AND WRITE-DOWNS OF THE ASSOCIATED MSRS AND ESS. ANY SUCH SCENARIO COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPECTED DISCONTINUATION OF LIBOR. 
 
 IN JULY 2017, THE HEAD OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY FCA ), WHICH REGULATES THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR, ANNOUNCED THE PHASE OUT OF THE USE OF LIBOR BY THE END OF 2021. HOWEVER, FOR U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, IT NOW APPEARS THAT THE RELEVANT DATE MAY BE DEFERRED TO JUNE 30, 2023 FOR THE MOST COMMON RATES (OVERNIGHT AND ONE, THREE, SIX AND 12 MONTHS). THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR HAS PUBLISHED A CONSULTATION REGARDING ITS INTENTION TO CEASE PUBLICATION OF U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (INSTEAD OF DECEMBER 31, 2021, AS PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED) BASED ON CONTINUED RATE SUBMISSIONS FROM BANKS. THE FCA AND OTHER REGULATORS HAVE STATED THAT THEY WELCOME THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR S ACTION. AN EXTENSION TO 2023 WOULD MEAN THAT MANY LEGACY U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR CONTRACTS WOULD TERMINATE BEFORE RELATED LIBOR RATES CEASE TO BE PUBLISHED. HOWEVER, THE SAME REGULATORS EMPHASIZED THAT, DESPITE ANY CONTINUED PUBLICATION OF U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023, NO NEW CONTRACTS USING U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2021. MOREOVER, THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR S CONSULTATION ALSO RELATES TO THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR S INTENTION TO CEASE PUBLICATION OF NON-U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2021. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT LIBOR WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUBLISHED UNTIL ANY PARTICULAR DATE. 
 TO IDENTIFY A SET OF ALTERNATIVE INTEREST REFERENCE RATES TO LIBOR, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHED THE ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES COMMITTEE ARRC ), A U.S. BASED WORKING GROUP COMPOSED OF LARGE U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ARRC HAS IDENTIFIED THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE AS ITS PREFERRED REPLACEMENT FOR LIBOR, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THEIR PREFERENCE MAY IMPACT THE RISKS WE MAINTAIN TO THE CESSATION OF LIBOR, OR IF OTHER BENCHMARKS MAY EMERGE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR LIBOR. 
 
 THE EXPECTED AND ACTUAL DISCONTINUATION OF LIBOR COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE RELY ON FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER WHICH OUR COST OF BORROWING IS BASED ON LIBOR. WE ALSO HOLD ASSETS AND INSTRUMENTS USED TO HEDGE THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS THAT DEPEND FOR THEIR VALUE ON LIBOR. WE ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS IT RELATES TO THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM LIBOR FOR ALL OF OUR LIBOR-BASED ASSETS, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AND LIABILITIES, REGARDLESS WHETHER THEIR MATURITY DATES FALL BEFORE OR AFTER THE ANTICIPATED DISCONTINUATION DATE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2021 OR JUNE 30, 2023, AS APPLICABLE. THESE CHALLENGES WILL INCLUDE, BUT WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO, AMENDING AGREEMENTS UNDERLYING OUR EXISTING AND/OR NEW LIBOR-BASED ASSETS, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AND LIABILITIES WITH APPROPRIATE FALLBACK LANGUAGE PRIOR TO THE DISCONTINUATION OF LIBOR, AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT LIBOR MAY DETERIORATE AS A VIABLE BENCHMARK TO ENSURE A FAIR COST OF FUNDS FOR OUR LIBOR-LINKED LIABILITIES, INTEREST INCOME FOR OUR LIBOR-LINKED ASSETS, AND/OR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND HEDGES USING LIBOR AS A BENCHMARK RATE OR USED TO DEVELOP A MARKET DISCOUNT RATE. IN ADDITION, THE TRANSITION TO USING ANY NEW BENCHMARK RATE OR OTHER FINANCIAL METRIC MAY REQUIRE CHANGES TO EXISTING TRANSACTION DATA, PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS, MODELS, OPERATIONS AND PRICING PROCESSES. 
 
 WE ALSO ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL RISKS TO OUR CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AS THEY RELATE TO THE DISCONTINUATION OF LIBOR. WE SERVICE LIBOR-BASED ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES ARMS FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE NOTES INCORPORATE FALLBACK PROVISIONS, BUT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE THE RESPONSE OF OUR BORROWERS OR NOTE HOLDERS TO SUCH RISKS. WE ALSO RELY ON FINANCIAL MODELS THAT INCORPORATE LIBOR INTO THEIR METHODOLOGIES FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND REPORTING. 
 
 DUE TO THESE RISKS, WE EXPECT BOTH THE IMPENDING AND ACTUAL DISCONTINUATION OF LIBOR COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND EARNINGS, OUR COST OF CAPITAL, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS WE USE TO HEDGE THEIR VALUE. FOR THE SAME REASON, WE ALSO CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR HEDGE INSTRUMENTS WILL EFFECTIVELY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HEDGE. FURTHERMORE, THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM WIDELY USED BENCHMARK RATES LIKE LIBOR COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMERS OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS CHALLENGING THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR INTEREST PAYMENTS, DISPUTING THE INTERPRETATIONS OR IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTRACT FALLBACK PROVISIONS AND OTHER TRANSITION RELATED CHANGES. OUR INABILITY TO MANAGE THESE RISKS EFFECTIVELY MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 27 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET RISK AND DECLINES IN CREDIT QUALITY AND CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT INVESTMENT INCOME AND CAUSE REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES. 
 WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT MARKETS AND SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE WILL INCUR LOSSES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS. ADVERSE CHANGES TO THESE SPREADS MAY OCCUR DUE TO CHANGES IN FISCAL POLICY, THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE, THE LIQUIDITY OF A MARKET OR MARKET SEGMENT, INSOLVENCY OR FINANCIAL DISTRESS OF KEY MARKET MAKERS OR PARTICIPANTS, OR CHANGES IN MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF CREDIT WORTHINESS AND/OR RISK TOLERANCE. 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL DECLINES IN OUR CREDIT QUALITY, CREDIT QUALITY RELATED TO SPECIFIC ISSUERS OR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, AND A GENERAL WEAKENING IN THE ECONOMY, ALL OF WHICH ARE TYPICALLY REFLECTED THROUGH CREDIT SPREADS. CREDIT SPREAD IS THE ADDITIONAL YIELD ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE (TYPICALLY REFERENCED AS THE YIELD ON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES) THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS REQUIRE TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR ASSUMING CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND/OR PREPAYMENT RISKS. CREDIT SPREADS VARY (I.E., INCREASE OR DECREASE) IN RESPONSE TO THE MARKET S PERCEPTION OF RISK AND LIQUIDITY IN A SPECIFIC ISSUER OR SPECIFIC SECTOR AND ARE INFLUENCED BY THE CREDIT RATINGS, AND THE RELIABILITY OF THOSE RATINGS, PUBLISHED BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES. A DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE COULD CAUSE ADDITIONAL REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENTS. 
 A DECLINE IN CREDIT SPREADS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AS WE INVEST CASH IN NEW INVESTMENTS THAT MAY EARN LESS THAN THE PORTFOLIO S AVERAGE YIELD. AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY DECREASING THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CREDIT SENSITIVE INVESTMENTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. ANY SUCH SCENARIO COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 HEDGING AGAINST INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 WE PURSUE HEDGING STRATEGIES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. THE STRATEGIES ARE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS AT OUR TRS AS WELL AS DEBT USED TO ACQUIRE OR CARRY REAL ESTATE ASSETS AT ENTITIES OTHER THAN OUR TRS. TO MANAGE THIS PRICE RISK, WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED WITH THE INTENTION OF MODERATING THE RISK THAT CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES WILL RESULT IN UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, PRIMARILY PREPAYMENT EXPOSURE ON OUR MSR INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS IRLCS AND OUR INVENTORY OF LOANS HELD FOR SALE AS WELL AS MBS AND CRTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO OUR IRLCS AND INVENTORY OF LOANS HELD FOR SALE, WE MAY USE MBS FORWARD SALE CONTRACTS TO LOCK IN THE PRICE AT WHICH WE WILL SELL THE MORTGAGE LOANS OR RESULTING MBS, AND MBS PUT OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF OUR IRLCS NOT CLOSING AT THE RATE WE EXPECT. IN ADDITION, WITH RESPECT TO OUR MSRS, WE MAY USE MBS FORWARD PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACTS TO ADDRESS EXPOSURES TO SMALLER INTEREST RATE SHIFTS WITH TREASURY AND INTEREST RATE SWAP FUTURES, AND USE OPTIONS AND SWAPTIONS TO ACHIEVE TARGET COVERAGE LEVELS FOR LARGER INTEREST RATE SHOCKS. 
 OUR HEDGING ACTIVITY WILL VARY IN SCOPE BASED ON THE RISKS BEING MITIGATED, THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES, THE TYPE OF INVESTMENTS HELD, AND OTHER CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS SUCH AS THOSE RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. HEDGING INSTRUMENTS INVOLVE RISK BECAUSE THEY OFTEN ARE NOT TRADED ON REGULATED EXCHANGES, GUARANTEED BY AN EXCHANGE OR ITS CLEARING HOUSE, OR REGULATED BY ANY U.S. OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

INTEREST RATE HEDGING CAN BE EXPENSIVE, PARTICULARLY DURING PERIODS OF RISING AND VOLATILE INTEREST RATES 

AVAILABLE INTEREST RATE HEDGING MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK FOR WHICH PROTECTION IS SOUGHT 

THE DURATION OF THE HEDGE MAY NOT MATCH THE DURATION OF THE RELATED LIABILITY OR ASSET 

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE HEDGING COUNTERPARTY OWING MONEY ON THE HEDGE MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR ASSIGN OUR SIDE OF THE HEDGING TRANSACTION AND 

THE HEDGING COUNTERPARTY OWING THE MONEY IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION MAY DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY. 

THE FEDERAL TAX REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO REITS LIMIT OUR HEDGE ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THE TRS TO HEDGING INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS WITH RESPECT TO DEBT USED TO ACQUIRE OR CARRY REAL ESTATE ASSETS. 

 IN ADDITION, WE MAY FAIL TO RECALCULATE, RE ADJUST AND EXECUTE HEDGES IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. ANY HEDGING ACTIVITY, WHICH IS INTENDED TO LIMIT LOSSES, MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THEREFORE, WHILE WE MAY ENTER INTO SUCH TRANSACTIONS SEEKING TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE RISK, UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY RESULT IN WORSE OVERALL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE THAN IF WE HAD NOT ENGAGED IN ANY SUCH HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. A LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET MAY NOT EXIST FOR A HEDGING INSTRUMENT PURCHASED OR SOLD, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A POSITION UNTIL EXERCISE OR EXPIRATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN PRICE MOVEMENTS OF THE INSTRUMENTS USED IN HEDGING STRATEGIES AND PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE PORTFOLIO POSITIONS OR LIABILITIES BEING HEDGED MAY VARY MATERIALLY. MOREOVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, WE MAY NOT ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SUCH HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND THE PORTFOLIO POSITIONS OR LIABILITIES BEING HEDGED. ANY 
 28 

SUCH INEFFECTIVE CORRELATION MAY PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING THE INTENDED HEDGE AND EXPOSE US TO RISK OF LOSS. NUMEROUS REGULATIONS CURRENTLY APPLY TO HEDGING AND ANY NEW REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN EXISTING REGULATIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR COMPLIANCE COSTS. OUR DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR THE DAILY MARK TO MARKET OF OUR HEDGE EXPOSURES. IF A HEDGE COUNTERPARTY DETERMINES THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO US EXCEEDS ITS EXPOSURE THRESHOLD, IT MAY INITIATE A MARGIN CALL AND REQUIRE US TO POST COLLATERAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY A MARGIN CALL, WE WOULD BE IN DEFAULT OF OUR AGREEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE UTILIZE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO RISK OF LOSS. 
 WE UTILIZE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FUTURES. HOWEVER, THE PRICES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING FUTURES AND OPTIONS, ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE, AS ARE PAYMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO SWAP AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE COST OF UTILIZING DERIVATIVES MAY REDUCE OUR INCOME THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT WE UTILIZE MAY FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR POSITIONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH REGARD TO THE COUNTERPARTIES INVOLVED IN THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. 
 THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND OTHER FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE COMPLEX, COMPLIANCE WITH THEM MAY BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING, AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO LAWSUITS OR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE MAY CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT, AND THIS MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 PCM IS AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FOLLOW VERY BROAD INVESTMENT POLICIES AND, THEREFORE, IT HAS GREAT LATITUDE IN DETERMINING THE TYPES OF ASSETS THAT ARE PROPER INVESTMENTS FOR US, AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IN THE FUTURE, PCM MAY MAKE INVESTMENTS WITH LOWER RATES OF RETURN THAN THOSE ANTICIPATED UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND/OR MAY MAKE INVESTMENTS WITH GREATER RISKS TO ACHIEVE THOSE ANTICIPATED RETURNS. OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES WILL PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES AND OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BUT WILL NOT REVIEW OR APPROVE EACH PROPOSED INVESTMENT BY PCM UNLESS IT FALLS OUTSIDE OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES OR CONSTITUTES A RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION. 
 IN ADDITION, IN CONDUCTING PERIODIC REVIEWS, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES WILL RELY PRIMARILY ON INFORMATION PROVIDED TO IT BY PCM. FURTHERMORE, PCM MAY USE COMPLEX STRATEGIES, AND TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY PCM MAY BE COSTLY, DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO UNWIND BY THE TIME THEY ARE REVIEWED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WE ALSO MAY CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES AND TARGETED ASSET CLASSES AT ANY TIME WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THIS COULD RESULT IN OUR MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN TYPE FROM, AND POSSIBLY RISKIER THAN OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS OR THE INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED. CHANGES IN OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES AND TARGETED ASSET CLASSES MAY EXPOSE US TO NEW RISKS OR INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, COUNTERPARTY RISK, DEFAULT RISK AND REAL ESTATE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, AND THIS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED RISK OF LOSS. 
 IN OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WE ACQUIRE NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS FROM MORTGAGE LENDERS AND SELL OR SECURITIZE THOSE LOANS TO OR THROUGH THE AGENCIES OR OTHER THIRD PARTY INVESTORS. WE ALSO SELL THE RESULTING SECURITIES INTO THE MBS MARKETS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PLS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OPERATING THIS BUSINESS ON OUR BEHALF OR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE COMMITTED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO COMMIT, CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO THIS OPERATION HOWEVER, PLS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SOURCE SUFFICIENT ASSET ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES TO JUSTIFY THE EXPENDITURE OF SUCH CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES. IN THE EVENT THAT PLS IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SOURCE SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS OPERATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH ASSETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, OR THAT SUCH ASSETS, IF ACQUIRED, WOULD BE PROFITABLE TO US. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF THESE ASSETS AND/OR MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THE RESULTING MBS IN THE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED LOANS MAY DECREASE PRIOR TO THEIR DISPOSITION. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE RISKS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 29 

THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES WILL DEPEND, IN PART, UPON PLS ABILITY TO ADAPT TO AND IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND PROTECT ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. 
 OUR SUCCESS IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF OUR SERVICER, PLS, TO ADAPT TO CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, SUCCESSFULLY ENHANCE ITS CURRENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THROUGH THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, AND INTRODUCE NEW SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES THAT MORE EFFICIENTLY ADDRESS OUR NEEDS. 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON THE ABILITY OF PLS TO EFFECTIVELY INTERFACE WITH OUR MORTGAGE LENDERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS LOAN FUNDINGS AND CLOSINGS. THE CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION PROCESS IS BECOMING MORE DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, AND OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS EXPECT AND REQUIRE CERTAIN CONVENIENCES AND SERVICE LEVELS. IN THIS REGARD, PLS HAS TRANSITIONED TO A WORKFLOW-DRIVEN, CLOUD-BASED LOAN ACQUISITION PLATFORM. WHILE WE ANTICIPATE THAT PLS CLOUD-BASED SYSTEM WILL INCREASE SCALABILITY AND PRODUCE OTHER EFFICIENCIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PLS CLOUD-BASED SYSTEM WILL PROVE TO BE EFFECTIVE OR THAT SUCH CORRESPONDENT SELLERS WILL EASILY ADAPT TO PLS CLOUD-BASED SYSTEM. ANY FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY OR TIMELY TRANSITION TO THE NEW SYSTEM AND MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND PROTECTION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND BECOMING MORE PROFICIENT WITH IT MAY ALSO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY PLS. AS THESE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, PLS WILL NEED TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND INVEST IN THESE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. MOREOVER, LITIGATION HAS BECOME REQUIRED FOR PLS TO PROTECT ITS TECHNOLOGIES AND SUCH LITIGATION IS EXPECTED TO BE TIME CONSUMING AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF PLS RESOURCES. ANY FAILURE OF PLS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, EXECUTE OR MAINTAIN ITS TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES AND ANY LITIGATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROTECTION OF ITS TECHNOLOGIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PLS AND ITS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY PERFORM ITS LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES ON OUR BEHALF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ARE NOT AN APPROVED GINNIE MAE ISSUER AND AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OR AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LOANS WE ACQUIRE COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 GOVERNMENT-INSURED OR GUARANTEED LOANS THAT ARE TYPICALLY SECURITIZED THROUGH THE GINNIE MAE PROGRAM ACCOUNTED FOR 37 OF OUR PURCHASES IN 2020. WE ARE NOT APPROVED AS A GINNIE MAE ISSUER AND RELY HEAVILY ON PLS TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS FROM US. AS A RESULT, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRODUCE OR OWN GINNIE MAE MSRS AND WE EARN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INCOME IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF GOVERNMENT LOANS AS OPPOSED TO CONVENTIONAL LOANS. FURTHER, MARKET DEMAND FOR GOVERNMENT LOANS OVER CONVENTIONAL LOANS MAY INCREASE OR PLS MAY OFFER PRICING TO OUR APPROVED CORRESPONDENT SELLERS FOR GOVERNMENT LOANS THAT IS MORE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET THAN PRICING FOR CONVENTIONAL LOANS, THE RESULT OF WHICH MAY BE OUR ACQUISITION OF A GREATER PROPORTION OR AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LOANS. ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OR AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LOANS WE ACQUIRE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS 
 OUR RETENTION OF CREDIT RISK UNDERLYING LOANS WE SELL TO THE GSES IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND EXPOSES US TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LOSS. 
 IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT BUSINESS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CRT ARRANGEMENTS WITH FANNIE MAE, WHEREBY WE SELL POOLS OF LOANS INTO FANNIE MAE-GUARANTEED SECURITIZATIONS WHILE RETAINING A PORTION OF THE CREDIT RISK AND AN INTEREST-ONLY IO OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SUCH LOANS OR PURCHASING AGENCY SECURITIES THAT ABSORB LOSSES INCURRED BY SUCH LOANS. OUR RETENTION OF CREDIT RISK SUBJECTS US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DELINQUENCY AND FORECLOSURE SIMILAR TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING THE UNDERLYING LOANS, AND EXPOSES US TO RISK OF LOSS GREATER THAN THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING THE LOANS TO FANNIE MAE WITHOUT THE RETENTION OF SUCH CREDIT RISK. DELINQUENCY CAN RESULT FROM MANY FACTORS INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT, WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR REAL ESTATE VALUES, OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS MAN-MADE OR NATURAL DISASTER, THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WAR OR TERRORIST ATTACK. FURTHER, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DELINQUENCY AND FORECLOSURE MAY IN SOME INSTANCES BE GREATER THAN THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING THE UNDERLYING LOANS BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF CERTAIN OF THE CRT AGREEMENTS PROVIDES THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REALIZE LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF DELINQUENCY OR FORECLOSURE EVEN WHERE THERE IS ULTIMATELY NO LOSS REALIZED WITH RESPECT TO THE UNDERLYING LOAN (E.G., AS A RESULT OF A BORROWER S RE-PERFORMANCE). WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK AND, AS A RESULT OF PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS OR THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CHANGES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CRT AGREEMENTS. ANY LOSS WE INCUR MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND MAY REDUCE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY FHFA HAS INSTRUCTED GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES TO GRADUALLY WIND DOWN NEW LENDER RISK SHARE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS CRT INVESTMENTS AS OF THE END OF 2020. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE 
 30 

INVESTMENT TO INVESTING IN CRTS WITH SIMILAR RETURNS, OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY FHFA HAS INSTRUCTED GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES TO GRADUALLY WIND DOWN NEW LENDER RISK SHARE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS CRT INVESTMENTS AS OF THE END OF 2020 AND ACCORDINGLY WE DO NOT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY NEW CRT INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE CONTINUED TO HOLD NET CRT-RELATED INVESTMENTS (COMPRISED OF DEPOSITS SECURING CRT ARRANGEMENTS, CRT DERIVATIVES, CRT STRIPS, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITY PAYABLE) TOTALING 2.6 BILLION . IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS COMPARABLE TO CRTS, OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS IN THE FORM OF LOANS, AND THE LOANS IN WHICH WE INVEST SUBJECT US TO COSTS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM DELINQUENCY AND FORECLOSURE, AS WELL AS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSSES TO US. 
 WE HAVE INVESTED IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING RESIDENTIAL LOANS AND, THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION BUSINESS, NEWLY ORIGINATED PRIME CREDIT QUALITY RESIDENTIAL LOANS. RESIDENTIAL LOANS ARE TYPICALLY SECURED BY SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DELINQUENCY AND FORECLOSURE AND THE RESULTING RISKS OF LOSS. 
 OUR INVESTMENTS IN LOANS ALSO SUBJECT US TO THE RISKS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS: (I) DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE (II) RISKS RELATED TO GENERAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC (III) LACK OF AVAILABLE MORTGAGE FUNDING FOR BORROWERS TO REFINANCE OR SELL THEIR HOMES (IV) OVERBUILDING (V) INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAXES AND OPERATING EXPENSES (VI) CHANGES IN ZONING LAWS (VII) COSTS RESULTING FROM THE CLEAN-UP OF, AND LIABILITY TO THIRD PARTIES FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM, ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS INDOOR MOLD (VIII) CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION LOSSES (IX) UNINSURED DAMAGES FROM FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS (X) LIMITATIONS ON AND VARIATIONS IN RENTS (XI) FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES (XII) FRAUD BY BORROWERS, ORIGINATORS AND/OR SELLERS OF LOANS (XIII) UNDETECTED DEFICIENCIES AND/OR INACCURACIES IN UNDERLYING LOAN DOCUMENTATION AND CALCULATIONS AND (XIV) FAILURE OF THE BORROWER TO ADEQUATELY MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY. TO THE EXTENT THAT ASSETS UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED GEOGRAPHICALLY, BY PROPERTY TYPE OR IN CERTAIN OTHER RESPECTS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OF THE FOREGOING RISKS TO A GREATER EXTENT. 
 ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO FORECLOSE ON A LOAN AND SUCH ACTIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO GREATER CONCENTRATION OF THE RISKS OF THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND RISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF REAL PROPERTY. IN THE EVENT OF A FORECLOSURE, WE MAY ASSUME DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE. THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF SUCH REAL ESTATE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER OUR INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN, RESULTING IN A LOSS TO US. IN ADDITION, THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS MAY BE LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE, AND ANY DELAYS OR COSTS INVOLVED IN THE EFFECTUATION OF A FORECLOSURE OF THE LOAN OR A LIQUIDATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY MAY FURTHER REDUCE THE PROCEEDS AND THUS INCREASE THE LOSS. 
 IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF A LOAN BORROWER, THE LOAN TO SUCH BORROWER WILL BE DEEMED TO BE SECURED ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AT THE TIME OF BANKRUPTCY (AS DETERMINED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT), AND THE LIEN SECURING THE LOAN WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE AVOIDANCE POWERS OF THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE OR DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION TO THE EXTENT THE LIEN IS UNENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW. 
 OUR ACQUISITION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS EXPOSES US TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS. 
 MSRS ARISE FROM CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND THE INVESTORS (OR THEIR AGENTS) IN MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND LOANS THAT WE SERVICE ON THEIR BEHALF. WE GENERALLY ACQUIRE MSRS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SALE OF LOANS TO THE AGENCIES WHERE WE ASSUME THE OBLIGATION TO SERVICE SUCH LOANS ON THEIR BEHALF. ANY MSRS WE ACQUIRE ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE NUMEROUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH MSRS BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING INTEREST RATES AS WELL AS THE PREPAYMENT RATES, DELINQUENCIES AND FORECLOSURE RATES OF THE UNDERLYING SERVICED LOANS AS WELL AS THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THE MSRS MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE VALUES OF SUCH MSRS AS MAY BE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE. THE USE OF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE VALUATION OF THESE ASSETS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FAIR VALUES FOR SUCH ASSETS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY MSRS WE ACQUIRE. 
 PREPAYMENT SPEEDS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT MSRS. PREPAYMENT SPEED IS THE MEASUREMENT OF HOW QUICKLY BORROWERS PAY DOWN THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THEIR LOANS OR HOW QUICKLY LOANS ARE OTHERWISE BROUGHT CURRENT, MODIFIED, LIQUIDATED OR CHARGED OFF. WE BASE THE PRICE WE PAY FOR MSRS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR PROJECTION OF THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED POOL OF LOANS. OUR EXPECTATION OF PREPAYMENT SPEEDS IS A SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTION UNDERLYING THOSE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. IF PREPAYMENT SPEED EXPECTATIONS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS COULD DECLINE AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A NON-CASH CHARGE, 
 31 

WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREPAYMENT SPEEDS COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE THE ULTIMATE CASH FLOWS WE RECEIVE FROM MSRS, AND WE COULD ULTIMATELY RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN WHAT WE PAID FOR SUCH ASSETS. MOREOVER, DELINQUENCY RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE VALUATION OF ANY MSRS. AN INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES GENERALLY RESULTS IN LOWER REVENUE BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE ONLY COLLECT SERVICING FEES FROM AGENCIES OR MORTGAGE OWNERS FOR PERFORMING LOANS. OUR EXPECTATION OF DELINQUENCIES IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTION UNDERLYING OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. IF DELINQUENCIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN WE EXPECT, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS COULD BE DIMINISHED. WHEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS REDUCED, WE COULD SUFFER A LOSS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ARE A KEY DRIVER OF THE PERFORMANCE OF MSRS. HISTORICALLY, THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS HAS INCREASED WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE AND DECREASED WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE DUE TO THE EFFECT THOSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES HAVE ON PREPAYMENT ESTIMATES. WE MAY PURSUE, IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, VARIOUS HEDGING STRATEGIES TO SEEK TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. OUR HEDGING ACTIVITY WILL VARY IN SCOPE BASED ON THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, THE TYPE OF ASSETS HELD AND OTHER CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. INTEREST RATE HEDGING MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT UTILIZE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF MSRS OR THE DERIVATIVES WE USE IN OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES DO NOT PERFORM AS EXPECTED, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF, OR CASH FLOWS FROM, MSRS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. FURTHERMORE, MSRS AND THE RELATED SERVICING ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS IMPOSING VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE CARES ACT, WHICH ALLOWS BORROWERS WITH FEDERALLY-BACKED LOANS TO REQUEST TEMPORARY PAYMENT FORBEARANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASED BORROWER HARDSHIPS RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. 
 OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY, OR THE FAILURE OF THE SERVICER TO COMPLY, WITH THE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE OR THEY ARE SUBJECT BY VIRTUE OF OWNERSHIP OF MSRS, WHETHER ACTUAL OR ALLEGED, COULD EXPOSE US TO FINES, PENALTIES OR POTENTIAL LITIGATION LIABILITIES, INCLUDING COSTS, SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR ACQUISITION OF EXCESS SERVICING SPREAD ESS HAS EXPOSED US TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS. 
 WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED FROM PLS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN ESS ARISING FROM MSRS OWNED OR ACQUIRED BY PLS. THE ESS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLS CONTRACTUAL SERVICING FEE WITH THE APPLICABLE AGENCY AND A BASE SERVICING FEE THAT PLS RETAINS AS COMPENSATION FOR SERVICING OR SUBSERVICING THE RELATED LOANS PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CONTRACT. 
 BECAUSE THE ESS IS A COMPONENT OF THE RELATED MSR, THE RISKS OF OWNING THE ESS ARE SIMILAR TO THE RISKS OF OWNING AN MSR. WE ALSO RECORD OUR ESS ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON MANY OF THE SAME ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE OUR MSR ASSETS, THEREBY CREATING THE SAME POTENTIAL FOR MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE ESS AND THE ACTUAL VALUE THAT IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED. ALSO, THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ESS ASSETS ARE IMPACTED BY THE SAME DRIVERS AS OUR MSR ASSETS, NAMELY INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DELINQUENCY RATES AND THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE IMPACT OF THE DRIVERS, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ESS WE ACQUIRE, AND THIS COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 FURTHER, AS A CONDITION TO OUR PURCHASE OF THE ESS, WE WERE REQUIRED TO SUBORDINATE OUR INTERESTS TO THOSE OF THE APPLICABLE AGENCY. TO THE EXTENT PLS FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS AGENCY APPROVALS, SUCH FAILURE COULD RESULT IN PLS LOSS OF THE APPLICABLE MSR IN ITS ENTIRETY, THEREBY EXTINGUISHING OUR INTEREST IN THE RELATED ESS. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ESS RELATING TO PLS GINNIE MAE MSRS, WE SOLD OUR INTEREST IN SUCH ESS TO PLS UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND PLS, IN TURN, PLEDGED SUCH ESS ALONG WITH ITS INTEREST IN ALL OF ITS GINNIE MAE MSRS TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH GINNIE MAE ASSETS AND REPAID THROUGH THE CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PLS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR INTEREST IN THE GINNIE MAE ESS IS ALSO SUBORDINATED TO THE RIGHTS OF AN INDENTURE TRUSTEE ON BEHALF OF THE NOTE HOLDERS TO WHICH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY ISSUES ITS VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES UNDER AN INDENTURE, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE HAS A BLANKET LIEN ON ALL OF PLS GINNIE MAE MSRS (INCLUDING THE ESS WE ACQUIRED). THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE, ON BEHALF OF THE NOTE HOLDERS, MAY LIQUIDATE OUR GINNIE MAE ESS ALONG WITH THE RELATED MSRS TO THE EXTENT THERE EXISTS AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE. IN THE EVENT OUR ESS IS LIQUIDATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF PLS, WE MAY BE ENTITLED TO SEEK INDEMNITY UNDER THE APPLICABLE SPREAD ACQUISITION AGREEMENT HOWEVER, THIS WOULD BE AN UNSECURED CLAIM. IN EITHER SITUATION, OUR LOSS OF THE ESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 32 

WE CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY PROTECT OUR MSR OR ESS ASSETS FROM BORROWER REFINANCING AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLS TO DO SO FOR OUR BENEFIT. 
 WHILE PLS HAS AGREED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF AN MSR RECAPTURE AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER CASH TO US IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO A TIERED RECAPTURE FEE RANGING FROM 30 TO 40 OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS RELATING TO LOANS IT REFINANCES, WE ARE NOT INDEPENDENTLY CAPABLE OF PROTECTING OUR MSR ASSETS FROM BORROWER REFINANCING THROUGH TARGETED SOLICITATIONS TO, AND ORIGINATION OF, REFINANCE LOANS FOR BORROWERS IN OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO. ACCORDINGLY, UNLIKE TRADITIONAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATORS AND MANY SERVICERS, WE MUST RELY UPON PLS TO REFINANCE LOANS IN OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE TARGETED BY OTHER LENDERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PLS WILL EITHER HAVE OR ALLOCATE THE TIME AND RESOURCES REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY PROTECT OUR MSR ASSETS. ITS FAILURE TO DO SO, OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR MSR RECAPTURE AGREEMENT, COULD RESULT IN ACCELERATED RUNOFF OF OUR MSR ASSETS, DECREASING ITS FAIR VALUE AND ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 SIMILARLY, WHILE PLS HAS AGREED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR SPREAD ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS TO TRANSFER TO US A PORTION OF THE ESS RELATING TO LOANS IT REFINANCES, WE ARE NOT INDEPENDENTLY CAPABLE OF PROTECTING OUR ESS ASSETS FROM BORROWER REFINANCING BY OTHER LENDERS THROUGH TARGETED SOLICITATIONS TO, AND ORIGINATION OF, REFINANCE LOANS FOR BORROWERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF ESS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MUST ALSO RELY UPON PLS TO REFINANCE THESE LOANS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE TARGETED BY OTHER LENDERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PLS WILL EITHER HAVE OR ALLOCATE THE REQUIRED TIME AND RESOURCES OR OTHERWISE BE CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY SOLICITING THESE LOANS. ITS FAILURE TO DO SO, OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR SPREAD ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS, COULD RESULT IN ACCELERATED REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS UNDERLYING OUR ESS ASSETS, DECREASING THEIR VALUE AND ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 INVESTMENTS IN SUBORDINATED LOANS AND SUBORDINATED MBS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED RISK OF LOSSES. 
 OUR INVESTMENTS IN SUBORDINATED LOANS OR SUBORDINATED MBS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED RISK OF LOSSES. IN THE EVENT A BORROWER DEFAULTS ON A SUBORDINATED LOAN AND LACKS SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO SATISFY SUCH LOAN, WE MAY LOSE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. IN THE EVENT A BORROWER BECOMES SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS, IF ANY, OF THE BORROWER THAT ARE NOT PLEDGED TO SECURE OUR LOAN. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS ON OUR SUBORDINATED LOAN OR ON ITS SENIOR DEBT (I.E., A FIRST-LIEN LOAN), OR IN THE EVENT OF A BORROWER BANKRUPTCY, OUR SUBORDINATED LOAN WILL BE SATISFIED ONLY AFTER ALL SENIOR DEBT IS PAID IN FULL. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT RECOVER ALL OR EVEN A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSSES. 
 IN GENERAL, LOSSES ON AN ASSET SECURING A LOAN INCLUDED IN A SECURITIZATION WILL BE BORNE FIRST BY THE EQUITY HOLDER OF THE PROPERTY, THEN BY A CASH RESERVE FUND OR LETTER OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE BORROWER, IF ANY, AND THEN BY THE FIRST LOSS SUBORDINATED SECURITY HOLDER AND THEN BY THE SECOND LOSS SUBORDINATED SECURITY HOLDER. IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT AND THE EXHAUSTION OF ANY EQUITY SUPPORT, RESERVE FUND, LETTER OF CREDIT AND ANY CLASSES OF SECURITIES JUNIOR TO THOSE IN WHICH WE INVEST, WE MAY NOT RECOVER ALL OR EVEN A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSSES. 
 IN ADDITION, IF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN SERVICED INEFFECTIVELY BY THE LOAN SERVICER OR OVERVALUED BY THE ORIGINATOR, OR IF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINE AND, AS A RESULT, LESS COLLATERAL IS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DUE ON THE RELATED MBS, THE SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. THE PRICES OF THESE TYPES OF LOWER CREDIT QUALITY INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY MORE SENSITIVE TO ADVERSE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS OR INDIVIDUAL ISSUER DEVELOPMENTS THAN MORE HIGHLY RATED INVESTMENTS. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR A PROJECTION OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF LOWER CREDIT QUALITY INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE ABILITY OF OBLIGORS TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS OR TO REFINANCE MAY BE IMPAIRED. 
 THE FAILURE OF PLS OR ANY OTHER SERVICER TO EFFECTIVELY SERVICE OUR PORTFOLIO OF MSRS AND LOANS WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 PURSUANT TO OUR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT, PLS PROVIDES US WITH PRIMARY AND SPECIAL SERVICING. PLS LOAN SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND ESCROW ACCOUNT PAYMENTS, IF ANY, WITH RESPECT TO LOANS, AS WELL AS MANAGING LOSS MITIGATION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COLLECTION ACTIVITIES, LOAN WORKOUTS, MODIFICATIONS, FORECLOSURES, SHORT SALES AND SALES OF REO. THE ABILITY OF PLS OR ANY OTHER SERVICER OR SUBSERVICER TO EFFECTIVELY SERVICE OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, PARTICULARLY GIVEN OUR LARGE INVESTMENT IN MSRS AND OUR STRATEGY OF MAXIMIZING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DISTRESSED LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE THROUGH PROPRIETARY LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, SPECIAL SERVICING AND OTHER INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON KEEPING BORROWERS IN THEIR HOMES OR IN THE CASE OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, EFFECTING PROPERTY RESOLUTIONS IN A TIMELY, ORDERLY AND ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT MANNER. THE FAILURE OF PLS OR ANY OTHER SERVICER OR SUBSERVICER TO EFFECTIVELY SERVICE OUR PORTFOLIO OF MSRS AND LOANS WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 33 

IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY, THROUGH PLS, TO PROMPTLY FORECLOSE UPON DEFAULTED LOANS AND LIQUIDATE THE UNDERLYING REAL PROPERTY PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR VALUATION OF THE ASSETS IN WHICH WE INVEST AND OUR EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY, THROUGH PLS, TO FORECLOSE UPON A LOAN AND LIQUIDATE THE REAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES WE MODEL AS PART OF OUR VALUATION PROCESS OR WITHIN THE STATUTES OF LIMITATION UNDER APPLICABLE STATE LAW, AND THIS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND/OR DIMINISH THE EXPECTED RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

 POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUDING RISING SEA LEVELS AND INCREASED INTENSITY OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, COULD SIMILARLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR PROPERTIES AND THE LOCAL ECONOMIES OF CERTAIN AREAS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

 CERTAIN TYPES OF LOSSES, GENERALLY OF A CATASTROPHIC NATURE, THAT RESULT FROM EVENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, HURRICANES, TORNADOS, TERRORISM, ACTS OF WAR AND PANDEMICS, SUCH AS COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MAY ALSO BE UNINSURABLE OR NOT ECONOMICALLY INSURABLE. INFLATION, CHANGES IN BUILDING CODES AND ORDINANCES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING TERRORISM OR ACTS OF WAR, ALSO MIGHT MAKE THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS INSUFFICIENT TO REPAIR OR REPLACE A PROPERTY IF IT IS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS RECEIVED MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE TO RESTORE OUR ECONOMIC POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE AFFECTED REAL PROPERTY. ANY UNINSURED LOSS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CASH FLOW FROM, AND THE ASSET VALUE OF, THE AFFECTED PROPERTY, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS. 
 OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE GREATER LOS ANGELES METROPOLITAN AREA AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE AND PROPERTY LOSS DUE TO A SERIES OF LARGE WILDFIRES IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. CALIFORNIA AND THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO PRONE TO OTHER TYPES OF NATURAL DISASTERS. IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, HURRICANE, OR CATASTROPHIC EVENT SUCH AS FIRE, FLOOD, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, CYBER ATTACK, PANDEMIC, WAR, OR TERRORIST ATTACK, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AND MAY ENDURE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, REPUTATIONAL HARM, DELAYS IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS AND WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS, INTERRUPTIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS, BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY, AND LOSS OF CRITICAL DATA, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. 
 MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE UNRATED OR, WHERE ANY CREDIT RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED TO OUR INVESTMENTS, THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONGOING EVALUATIONS AND REVISIONS AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THOSE RATINGS WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED. 
 MANY OF OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS ARE NOT, AND MANY OF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENTS WILL NOT BE, RATED BY ANY RATING AGENCY. THEREFORE, PCM S ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE AND PRICING OF OUR INVESTMENTS MAY BE DIFFICULT AND THE ACCURACY OF SUCH ASSESSMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS MAY BE RATED. IF RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN A LOWER-THAN EXPECTED RATING OR REDUCE OR WITHDRAW, OR INDICATE THAT THEY MAY REDUCE OR WITHDRAW, THEIR RATINGS OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND COULD RESULT IN LOSSES UPON DISPOSITION OR THE FAILURE OF BORROWERS TO SATISFY THEIR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS TO US. 
 34 

WE MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS AFFECTING BORROWERS OR THE ASSET OR PROPERTY TYPES IN WHICH OUR INVESTMENTS MAY BE CONCENTRATED AT ANY GIVEN TIME, AS WELL AS FROM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE RELATED GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. 
 OUR ASSETS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY GEOGRAPHIC, DIVERSIFICATION OR CONCENTRATION LIMITATIONS EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE CONCENTRATED IN MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE CONCENTRATED BY GEOGRAPHY, ASSET, PROPERTY TYPE AND/OR BORROWER, INCREASING THE RISK OF LOSS TO US IF THE PARTICULAR CONCENTRATION IN OUR PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO GREATER RISKS OR IS UNDERGOING ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE AREAS WHERE THE PROPERTIES SECURING OR OTHERWISE UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENTS ARE LOCATED (INCLUDING BUSINESS LAYOFFS OR DOWNSIZING, INDUSTRY SLOWDOWNS, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER FACTORS) AND LOCAL REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS (SUCH AS OVERSUPPLY OR REDUCED DEMAND) MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. A MATERIAL DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR REAL ESTATE IN THESE AREAS MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. CONCENTRATION OR A LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION CAN INCREASE THE CORRELATION OF NON-PERFORMANCE AND FORECLOSURE RISKS AMONG OUR INVESTMENTS. 
 MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ILLIQUID AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADJUST OUR PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS. 
 OUR INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED LOANS, MSRS, ESS, CRT ARRANGEMENTS, SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD IN A CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY MAY BE ILLIQUID. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN OR VALIDATE THIRD-PARTY PRICING ON THE INVESTMENTS WE PURCHASE. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE GREATER PRICE VOLATILITY, AS A READY MARKET DOES NOT EXIST, AND CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE. THE CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OR THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL SUCH INVESTMENTS IF THE NEED OR DESIRE ARISES, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY MARGIN CALLS OR CERTAIN REIT TESTS. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO LIQUIDATE ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO QUICKLY, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE RECORDED VALUE, OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS AT ALL, THUS EXPOSING US TO A MATERIAL OR TOTAL LOSS. 
 FAIR VALUES OF MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATES AND THE REALIZATION OF REDUCED VALUES FROM OUR RECORDED ESTIMATES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT PERIODIC REPORTED RESULTS AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY, WHICH MAY REDUCE EARNINGS AND, IN TURN, CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 THE FAIR VALUES OF SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE NOT READILY DETERMINABLE. WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS MONTHLY, BUT THE FAIR VALUE AT WHICH OUR ASSETS ARE RECORDED MAY DIFFER FROM THE VALUES WE ULTIMATELY REALIZE. ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET DEPENDS TO A GREAT EXTENT ON ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT CHANGE DURING THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH THE INVESTMENT IS HELD AND ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF PCM, US OR OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES. FURTHER, FAIR VALUE IS ONLY AN ESTIMATE BASED ON GOOD FAITH JUDGMENT OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN INVESTMENT CAN BE SOLD SINCE TRANSACTED PRICES OF INVESTMENTS CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY NEGOTIATION BETWEEN A WILLING BUYER AND SELLER. 
 IN CERTAIN CASES, PCM S ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDES INPUTS PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY DEALERS AND PRICING SERVICES, AND VALUATIONS OF CERTAIN SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND ARE SUBJECT TO JUDGMENTS THAT MAY VARY AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THOSE ASSETS ARE DIRECTLY CHARGED OR CREDITED TO EARNINGS FOR THE PERIOD. IF WE WERE TO LIQUIDATE A PARTICULAR ASSET, THE REALIZED VALUE MAY BE MORE THAN OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT AT WHICH SUCH ASSET WAS RECORDED. ACCORDINGLY, IN EITHER EVENT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, AND SUCH VALUATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. 
 PCM UTILIZES ANALYTICAL MODELS AND DATA IN CONNECTION WITH THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS, AND ANY INCORRECT, MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION USED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH WOULD SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL RISKS. 
 GIVEN THE ILLIQUIDITY AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIES, PCM MUST RELY HEAVILY ON MODELS AND DATA, INCLUDING ANALYTICAL MODELS (BOTH PROPRIETARY MODELS DEVELOPED BY PCM AND THOSE SUPPLIED BY THIRD PARTIES) AND INFORMATION AND DATA SUPPLIED BY THIRD PARTIES. IF ANY THIRD PARTY INFORMATION IS INTENTIONALLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISREPRESENTED AND NOT DETECTED, THEN OUR MODEL AND DATA RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. MODELS AND DATA ARE USED TO VALUE INVESTMENTS OR POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS AND ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH HEDGING OUR INVESTMENTS. IN THE EVENT MODELS AND DATA PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE, ANY DECISIONS MADE IN RELIANCE THEREON EXPOSE US TO POTENTIAL RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, BY RELYING ON INCORRECT MODELS AND DATA, ESPECIALLY VALUATION MODELS, PCM MAY BE INDUCED TO BUY CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE TOO HIGH, TO SELL CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE TOO LOW OR TO MISS FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES ALTOGETHER. SIMILARLY, ANY HEDGING BASED ON FAULTY MODELS AND DATA MAY PROVE TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL. 
 LIABILITY RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN OR THAT UNDERLIE OUR INVESTMENTS. 
 UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL PROPERTY MAY BECOME LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RELEASED ON ITS PROPERTY. THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR OPERATOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, OR AWARE OF, THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES 
 35 

MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT AN OWNER S ABILITY TO SELL REAL ESTATE, BORROW USING THE REAL ESTATE AS COLLATERAL OR MAKE DEBT PAYMENTS TO US. IN ADDITION, IF WE TAKE TITLE TO A PROPERTY, THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL THE PROPERTY, AND WE MAY BECOME LIABLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR TO THIRD PARTIES FOR VARIOUS FINES, DAMAGES OR REMEDIATION COSTS. ANY OF THESE LIABILITIES OR EVENTS MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT ASSET AND/OR OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE DEPEND ON THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION ABOUT BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND ANY MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WE MAY RELY ON INFORMATION FURNISHED BY OR ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION. WE ALSO MAY RELY ON REPRESENTATIONS OF BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THAT INFORMATION AND, WITH RESPECT TO AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS. IF ANY OF THIS INFORMATION IS INTENTIONALLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISREPRESENTED AND SUCH MISREPRESENTATION IS NOT DETECTED PRIOR TO LOAN FUNDING, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOAN MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN EXPECTED. OUR CONTROLS AND PROCESSES MAY NOT HAVE DETECTED OR MAY NOT DETECT ALL MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION IN OUR LOAN ACQUISITIONS OR FROM OUR BUSINESS CLIENTS. ANY SUCH MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO COUNTERPARTY RISK AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SEEK INDEMNITY OR REQUIRE OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO REPURCHASE LOANS IF THEY BREACH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER LOSSES. 
 WHEN WE PURCHASE MORTGAGE ASSETS, OUR COUNTERPARTY TYPICALLY MAKES CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO US ABOUT SUCH ASSETS. OUR RESIDENTIAL LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENTS MAY ENTITLE US TO SEEK INDEMNITY OR DEMAND REPURCHASE OR SUBSTITUTION OF THE LOANS IN THE EVENT OUR COUNTERPARTY BREACHES A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY GIVEN TO US. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO DEMAND REPURCHASE OR SUBSTITUTION, OR THAT OUR COUNTERPARTY WILL REMAIN SOLVENT OR OTHERWISE BE WILLING AND ABLE TO HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN INDEMNITY OR REQUIRE REPURCHASE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LOANS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS OR INDEMNIFY INVESTORS IF WE BREACH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. 
 WHEN WE SELL LOANS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ABOUT SUCH LOANS TO THE LOAN PURCHASER. AS PART OF OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, PLS RE-UNDERWRITES A PERCENTAGE OF THE LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRE, AND WE RELY UPON PLS TO ENSURE QUALITY UNDERWRITING BY OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS, ACCURATE THIRD-PARTY APPRAISALS, AND STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT WE REQUIRE FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS AND THAT ARE REQUIRED FROM US BY OUR INVESTORS. 
 OUR RESIDENTIAL LOAN SALE AGREEMENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE OR SUBSTITUTE LOANS OR INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST FUTURE LOSSES IN THE EVENT WE BREACH A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY GIVEN TO THE LOAN PURCHASER OR IN THE EVENT OF AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT ON A LOAN. THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCIES, OTHER PURCHASERS AND INSURERS OF LOANS MAY BE BROADER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE TO US AGAINST THE ORIGINATOR OR CORRESPONDENT LENDER, AND IF A PURCHASER OR INSURER ENFORCES ITS REMEDIES AGAINST US, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE REMEDIES WE HAVE AGAINST THE SELLERS. THE REPURCHASED LOANS TYPICALLY CAN ONLY BE FINANCED AT A STEEP DISCOUNT TO THEIR REPURCHASE PRICE, IF AT ALL. REPURCHASED LOANS ARE ALSO TYPICALLY SOLD AT A DISCOUNT TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE, WHICH IN SOME CASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. SIGNIFICANT REPURCHASE ACTIVITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SERVICING ADVANCES THAT CAN BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS IN RECOVERY OR MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 DURING ANY PERIOD IN WHICH A BORROWER IS NOT MAKING PAYMENTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED UNDER OUR SERVICING AGREEMENTS IN RESPECT OF OUR MSRS TO ADVANCE OUR OWN FUNDS TO PASS THROUGH SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE MBS INTO WHICH THE LOANS ARE SOLD, PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE PREMIUMS, LEGAL EXPENSES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE ADVANCES. WE ALSO ADVANCE FUNDS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN, REPAIR AND MARKET REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. AS HOME VALUES CHANGE, WE MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER CERTAIN OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING OUR DECISIONS TO MAKE ADVANCES AND, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADVANCES FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT BE REIMBURSED. IN ADDITION, IF A LOAN SERVICED BY US IS IN DEFAULT OR BECOMES DELINQUENT, THE REPAYMENT TO US OF THE ADVANCE MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE LOAN IS REPAID OR REFINANCED OR A LIQUIDATION OCCURS. 
 FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATORY ACTIONS MAY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SERVICING ADVANCES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE, LENGTHEN THE TIME IT TAKES FOR US TO BE REIMBURSED FOR SUCH ADVANCES AND INCREASE THE COSTS INCURRED WHILE THE LOAN IS DELINQUENT. THE FEDERAL 
 36 

GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE CARES ACT, WHICH ALLOWS BORROWERS WITH FEDERALLY-BACKED LOANS TO REQUEST TEMPORARY PAYMENT FORBEARANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASED BORROWER HARDSHIPS RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC . 
 A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ADVANCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, AND OUR INABILITY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ADVANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MANAGER AND ITS AFFILIATES 
 WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON PCM AND PLS AND THEIR RESOURCES AND MAY NOT FIND SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS IF ANY OF OUR SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH PCM OR PLS ARE TERMINATED. 
 WE ARE EXTERNALLY ADVISED AND MANAGED BY PCM, WHICH, PURSUANT TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, MAKES ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT, FINANCING AND RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND HAS SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPERATING POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. UNDER OUR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT WITH PLS, PLS PROVIDES PRIMARY SERVICING AND SPECIAL SERVICING FOR OUR PORTFOLIOS OF LOANS AND MSRS, AND UNDER OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH PLS, PLS PROVIDES FULFILLMENT AND DISPOSITION-RELATED SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION BUSINESS. THE COSTS OF THESE SERVICES INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME, BUT WE RELY ON PCM AND PLS TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE FEW EMPLOYEES AND LIMITED IN-HOUSE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY. 
 NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE STRATEGIES OF PCM, PLS OR THEIR AFFILIATES UNDER ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, THAT ANY OF THEM WILL CONDUCT COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DUE DILIGENCE OR PROVIDE SOUND ADVICE, OR THAT ANY OF THEM WILL ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLOCATION OF THEIR RESOURCES TO OUR BUSINESS. THE FAILURE OF ANY OF THEM TO DO ANY OF THE ABOVE, CONDUCT THE BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR HOLD ALL LICENSES OR REGISTRATIONS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS AS CURRENTLY OPERATED WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 
 IN ADDITION, THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS EXTEND UNTIL JUNE 30, 2025, SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR ADDITIONAL 18-MONTH PERIODS, BUT ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED EARLIER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHERWISE NON-RENEWED. SEE TERMINATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY BELOW. IF ANY AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED OR NOT RENEWED AND NOT REPLACED BY A NEW AGREEMENT, IT WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 
 IF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED OR NOT RENEWED, WE WILL HAVE TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SERVICE PROVIDER. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THESE SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. WITH RESPECT TO OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PLS ARE INHERENTLY UNIQUE AND NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE, IF AT ALL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A GINNIE MAE LICENSED ISSUER, YET WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIRE GOVERNMENT LOANS FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLERS THAT WE KNOW WILL ULTIMATELY BE PURCHASED FROM US BY PLS. WHILE WE GENERALLY HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THESE SERVICES FROM PLS DURING THE TERM OF OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT, IN THE EVENT OF A TERMINATION WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THESE SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, AND WE ULTIMATELY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPETE AGAINST PLS AS IT RELATES TO OUR CORRESPONDENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. 
 THE MANAGEMENT FEE STRUCTURE COULD CAUSE DISINCENTIVE AND/OR CREATE GREATER INVESTMENT RISK. 
 PURSUANT TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, PCM IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS BASED ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS DEFINED IN OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT) AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT BASE MANAGEMENT FEES WOULD BE PAYABLE TO PCM FOR A GIVEN QUARTER EVEN IF WE EXPERIENCE A NET LOSS DURING THAT QUARTER. PCM S RIGHT TO NON-PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION MAY NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVE TO PCM TO DEVOTE ITS TIME AND EFFORT TO SOURCE AND MAXIMIZE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WHICH COULD, IN TURN, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND/OR OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 CONVERSELY, PCM IS ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE IN EACH QUARTER. IN EVALUATING INVESTMENTS AND OTHER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION BASED ON OUR NET INCOME MAY LEAD PCM TO PLACE UNDUE EMPHASIS ON HIGHER YIELDING INVESTMENTS AND THE MAXIMIZATION OF SHORT-TERM INCOME AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER CRITERIA, SUCH AS PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MAINTENANCE OF SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND/OR MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. INVESTMENTS WITH HIGHER YIELD POTENTIAL ARE GENERALLY RISKIER AND MORE SPECULATIVE. 
 37 

THE SERVICING FEE STRUCTURE COULD CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
 FOR ITS SERVICES UNDER OUR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT, PLS IS ENTITLED TO SERVICING FEES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE COMPETITIVE WITH THOSE CHARGED BY PRIMARY SERVICERS AND SPECIALTY SERVICERS AND INCLUDE FIXED PER-LOAN MONTHLY AMOUNTS BASED ON THE DELINQUENCY, BANKRUPTCY AND/OR FORECLOSURE STATUS OF THE SERVICED LOAN OR THE REO, AS WELL AS ACTIVITY FEES THAT GENERALLY ARE FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNTS. PLS IS ALSO ENTITLED TO CUSTOMARY ANCILLARY INCOME AND CERTAIN MARKET-BASED FEES AND CHARGES, INCLUDING BOARDING AND DEBOARDING FEES, LIQUIDATION AND DISPOSITION FEES, AND ASSUMPTION, MODIFICATION AND ORIGINATION FEES. BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THESE FEES ARE EARNED UPON REACHING A SPECIFIC MILESTONE, THIS FEE STRUCTURE MAY PROVIDE PLS WITH AN INCENTIVE TO FORECLOSE MORE AGGRESSIVELY OR LIQUIDATE ASSETS FOR LESS THAN THEIR FAIR VALUE. 
 ON OUR BEHALF, PLS ALSO REFINANCES PERFORMING LOANS AND ORIGINATES NEW LOANS TO FACILITATE THE DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE THAT WE ACQUIRE THROUGH FORECLOSURE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PLS WITH AN INCENTIVE TO PRODUCE SUCH LOANS, PLS IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ORIGINATION FEES AND OTHER COMPENSATION BASED ON MARKET-BASED PRICING AND TERMS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRICING AND TERMS OFFERED BY PLS TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES ON A RETAIL BASIS. THIS MAY PROVIDE PLS WITH AN INCENTIVE TO REFINANCE A GREATER PROPORTION OF OUR LOANS THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD AND/OR TO REFINANCE LOANS ON OUR BEHALF INSTEAD OF ARRANGING THE REFINANCINGS WITH A THIRD PARTY LENDER, EITHER OF WHICH MIGHT GIVE RISE TO A POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
 TERMINATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY. 
 IT IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO TERMINATE, WITHOUT CAUSE, OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT IT MAY BE TERMINATED BY US WITHOUT CAUSE UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE PAYMENT TO PCM OF A SIGNIFICANT TERMINATION FEE. THE COST TO US OF TERMINATING OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DESIRE OR ABILITY TO TERMINATE OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH PCM WITHOUT CAUSE. PCM MAY ALSO TERMINATE OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT UPON AT LEAST 60 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE IF WE DEFAULT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY MATERIAL TERM OF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE DEFAULT CONTINUES FOR A PERIOD OF 30 DAYS AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE TO US, OR WHERE WE TERMINATE OUR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT, OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT OR CERTAIN OTHER OF OUR RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS WITH PCM OR PLS WITHOUT CAUSE (AT ANY TIME OTHER THAN AT THE END OF THE CURRENT TERM OR ANY AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERM), WHEREUPON IN ANY CASE WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO PCM A SIGNIFICANT TERMINATION FEE. AS A RESULT, OUR DESIRE OR ABILITY TO TERMINATE ANY OF OUR RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMINATION WOULD TRIGGER THE RIGHT OF PCM TO TERMINATE THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY PCM A SIGNIFICANT TERMINATION FEE. 
 EXISTING OR FUTURE ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY PCM MAY COMPETE WITH US FOR, OR MAY PARTICIPATE IN, INVESTMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 
 ALTHOUGH OUR AGREEMENTS WITH PCM AND PLS PROVIDE US WITH CERTAIN EXCLUSIVITY AND OTHER RIGHTS AND WE AND PCM HAVE ADOPTED AN ALLOCATION POLICY TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONFLICTS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE MEASURES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE CONFLICTS THAT MAY ARISE OR WILL ADDRESS SUCH CONFLICTS IN A MANNER THAT IS FAVORABLE TO US. CERTAIN OF THE FUNDS THAT PCM MAY ADVISE IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES THAT OVERLAP WITH OURS, INCLUDING FUNDS WHICH HAVE DIFFERENT FEE STRUCTURES, AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS MAY ARISE WITH RESPECT TO DECISIONS REGARDING HOW TO ALLOCATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AMONG THOSE FUNDS AND US. WE ARE ALSO LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT QUALIFYING REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND/OR REAL ESTATE RELATED ASSETS, WHEREAS OTHER ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS THAT PCM MAY MANAGE IN THE FUTURE MAY NOT BE SO LIMITED. IN ADDITION, PCM AND THE OTHER ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY PCM IN THE FUTURE MAY PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY NOT BE THE RESULT OF ARM S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS AND MAY INVOLVE OR LATER RESULT IN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN OUR INTERESTS IN THE INVESTMENTS AND THOSE OF PCM OR SUCH OTHER ENTITIES. 
 WE MAY ENCOUNTER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN OUR MANAGER S EFFORTS TO APPROPRIATELY ALLOCATE ITS TIME AND SERVICES BETWEEN ITS OWN ACTIVITIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF US, AND THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF OUR MANAGER S MANAGEMENT TEAM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 PURSUANT TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, PCM IS OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE US WITH THE SERVICES OF ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, AND THE MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM ARE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE SUCH TIME TO US AS IS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE, COMMENSURATE WITH OUR LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. THE MEMBERS OF PCM S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY HAVE CONFLICTS IN ALLOCATING THEIR TIME AND SERVICES BETWEEN THE OPERATIONS OF PFSI AND OUR ACTIVITIES, AND OTHER ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS THAT THEY MAY MANAGE IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 OUR FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS VARIOUS ISSUES THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD CAUSE HARM TO OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL RISKS. IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO ADDRESS VARIOUS ISSUES THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK, WE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. SUCH ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, VIOLATIONS OF LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY OF THE OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN THIS ITEM 1A. SIMILARLY, MARKET RUMORS AND ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED ASSOCIATION WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHOSE OWN REPUTATIONS ARE UNDER QUESTION COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 
 38 

AS WE EXPAND THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE CONFRONT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MANAGED BY PCM. THE SEC AND CERTAIN OTHER REGULATORS CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, AND AS WE EXPAND THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ADDRESS ANY CONFLICTS BETWEEN OUR INTERESTS AND THOSE OF PFSI. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN REAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISE, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO THE DISSATISFACTION OF, OR LITIGATION BY, OUR INVESTORS OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. REGULATORY SCRUTINY, LITIGATION OR REPUTATIONAL RISK INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. REPUTATIONAL RISK INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS, STRAIN OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH REGULATORS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTION, IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, TRADING COUNTERPARTIES, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 
 REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE CAN RESULT FROM OUR ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING LENDING AND DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE ACTIVITIES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND MEDIA COVERAGE, WHETHER ACCURATE OR NOT. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PRIVATE THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED RATINGS PROCESSES FOR EVALUATING COMPANIES ON THEIR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ESG MATTERS. THESE THIRD PARTY ESG RATINGS MAY BE USED BY SOME INVESTORS TO ASSIST WITH THEIR INVESTMENT AND VOTING DECISIONS. ANY UNFAVORABLE ESG RATINGS MAY LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT AMONG OUR INVESTORS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THESE FACTORS COULD IMPAIR OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INVESTORS, EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, TRADING COUNTERPARTIES AND EMPLOYEES, SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR STOCK PRICE AND ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 PCM AND PLS BOTH HAVE LIMITED LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY RIGHTS. 
 OUR AGREEMENTS WITH PCM AND PLS PROVIDE THAT PCM AND PLS WILL NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT FURTHER PROVIDES THAT PCM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN FOLLOWING OR DECLINING TO FOLLOW ITS ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ADDITION, EACH OF PCM AND PLS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, INCLUDING EACH SUCH ENTITY S MANAGERS, OFFICERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS, WILL BE HELD HARMLESS FROM, AND INDEMNIFIED BY US AGAINST, CERTAIN LIABILITIES ON CUSTOMARY TERMS. AS A RESULT, TO THE EXTENT WE ARE DAMAGED THROUGH CERTAIN ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF PCM OR PLS, OUR RECOURSE IS LIMITED AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR LOSSES. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE 
 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW, OUR STAGGERED BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST COULD EACH INHIBIT A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL. 
 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW (THE MGCL APPLICABLE TO A MARYLAND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF INHIBITING A THIRD PARTY FROM MAKING A PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE US OR OF IMPEDING A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OTHERWISE COULD PROVIDE THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE A PREMIUM OVER THE THEN PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF SUCH COMMON SHARES. 
 IN ADDITION, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES IS DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES OF TRUSTEES. TRUSTEES OF EACH CLASS WILL BE ELECTED FOR THREE-YEAR TERMS UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR CURRENT TERMS, AND EACH YEAR ONE CLASS OF TRUSTEES WILL BE ELECTED BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE STAGGERED TERMS OF OUR TRUSTEES MAY REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF A TENDER OFFER OR AN ATTEMPT AT A CHANGE IN CONTROL, EVEN THOUGH A TENDER OFFER OR CHANGE IN CONTROL MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 FURTHER, OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST AUTHORIZES US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED COMMON SHARES AND PREFERRED SHARES. OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES MAY, WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, INCREASE THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES OR THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF ANY CLASS OR SERIES THAT WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AND CLASSIFY OR RECLASSIFY ANY UNISSUED COMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES AND MAY SET THE PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND OTHER TERMS OF THE CLASSIFIED OR RECLASSIFIED SHARES. AS A RESULT, OUR BOARD MAY ESTABLISH A CLASS OR SERIES OF COMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST OUR TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS ARE LIMITED, WHICH COULD LIMIT SHAREHOLDER RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF ACTIONS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF OUR PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS TO US AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS FOR MONEY DAMAGES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER MARYLAND LAW. UNDER CURRENT MARYLAND LAW, OUR PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO US OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS FOR MONEY DAMAGES OTHER THAN LIABILITY RESULTING FROM EITHER (A) ACTUAL 
 39 

RECEIPT OF AN IMPROPER BENEFIT OR PROFIT IN MONEY, PROPERTY OR SERVICES OR (B) ACTIVE AND DELIBERATE DISHONESTY BY THE TRUSTEE OR OFFICER THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY A FINAL JUDGMENT AND IS MATERIAL TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION. 
 OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST AUTHORIZES US TO INDEMNIFY OUR PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY THEM IN THOSE CAPACITIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY MARYLAND LAW. OUR BYLAWS REQUIRE US TO INDEMNIFY EACH PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEE OR OFFICER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY MARYLAND LAW, IN THE DEFENSE OF ANY PROCEEDING TO WHICH HE OR SHE IS MADE, OR THREATENED TO BE MADE, A PARTY BY REASON OF HIS OR HER SERVICE TO US. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PAY OR REIMBURSE THE EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS WITHOUT REQUIRING A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION OF THEIR ULTIMATE ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION. AS A RESULT, WE AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED RIGHTS AGAINST OUR PRESENT AND FORMER TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE EXIST ABSENT THE CURRENT PROVISIONS IN OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST AND BYLAWS OR THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH OTHER COMPANIES, WHICH COULD LIMIT SHAREHOLDER RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF ACTIONS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT MAKE REMOVAL OF OUR TRUSTEES DIFFICULT, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO EFFECT CHANGES TO OUR MANAGEMENT. 
 OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST PROVIDES THAT, SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF ANY SERIES OF PREFERRED SHARES, A TRUSTEE MAY BE REMOVED ONLY FOR CAUSE (AS DEFINED IN OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST), AND THEN ONLY BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST GENERALLY IN THE ELECTION OF TRUSTEES. VACANCIES GENERALLY MAY BE FILLED ONLY BY A MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING TRUSTEES IN OFFICE, EVEN IF LESS THAN A QUORUM, FOR THE FULL TERM OF THE CLASS OF TRUSTEES IN WHICH THE VACANCY OCCURRED. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE OUR MANAGEMENT BY REMOVING AND REPLACING TRUSTEES AND MAY PREVENT A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL THAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR BYLAWS INCLUDE AN EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION THAT COULD LIMIT OUR SHAREHOLDERS ABILITY TO OBTAIN A JUDICIAL FORUM VIEWED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AS MORE FAVORABLE FOR DISPUTES WITH US OR OUR TRUSTEES OR OFFICERS. 
 OUR BYLAWS PROVIDE THAT THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, MARYLAND, OR, IF THAT COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE DIVISION, IS THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR ANY DERIVATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT ON OUR BEHALF ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM OF BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST US ARISING PURSUANT TO ANY PROVISION OF THE MARYLAND REIT LAW OR ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST US THAT IS GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE. THIS EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION MAY LIMIT A SHAREHOLDER S ABILITY TO BRING A CLAIM IN A JUDICIAL FORUM THAT IT FINDS FAVORABLE FOR DISPUTES WITH US OR OUR TRUSTEES OR OFFICERS, WHICH MAY DISCOURAGE SUCH LAWSUITS AGAINST US AND OUR TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS. ALTERNATIVELY, IF A COURT WERE TO FIND THE CHOICE OF FORUM PROVISION CONTAINED IN OUR BYLAWS TO BE INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE IN AN ACTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING SUCH ACTION IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN EXEMPTIONS OR EXCLUSIONS FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 
 BECAUSE WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A HOLDING COMPANY THAT CONDUCTS BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGH PENNYMAC OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, OUR STATUS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, OR THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE STATUS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WHICH, AS A HOLDING COMPANY, IN TURN, WILL HAVE ITS STATUS DETERMINED BY THE STATUS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FAIL TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXCEPTIONS OR EXCLUSIONS FROM THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND WE DO NOT HAVE AVAILABLE TO US ANOTHER BASIS ON WHICH WE MAY AVOID REGISTRATION, WE MAY HAVE TO REGISTER UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THIS COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE (INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO USE LEVERAGE), MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT), PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSIFICATION AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION, AND OTHER MATTERS. IT COULD ALSO CAUSE THE BREACH OF COVENANTS WE OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, ACCELERATION OF DEBT AND/OR TERMINATION. 
 THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT STATUS OF REITS, INCLUDING GUIDANCE AND INTERPRETATIONS FROM THE DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE SEC REGARDING THE EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS THEREFROM, WILL NOT CHANGE IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR OPERATIONS. IF THE SEC TAKES ACTION THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN EXCEPTION OR EXCLUSION FROM THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT, WE COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE REQUIRED TO (A) RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS TO AVOID BEING REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, (B) EFFECT SALES OF OUR ASSETS IN A MANNER THAT, OR AT A TIME WHEN, WE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE CHOOSE TO DO SO OR (C) REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WOULD REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH THE LEVERAGE CONSTRAINTS APPLICABLE TO INVESTMENT COMPANIES), ANY OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES, THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 FURTHER, A LOSS OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT EXCEPTIONS OR EXCLUSIONS WOULD ALLOW PCM TO TERMINATE OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH US, AND OUR LOAN SERVICING AGREEMENT WITH PLS IS SUBJECT TO EARLY TERMINATION IN THE EVENT OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON. IF EITHER OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS TERMINATED, WE WILL HAVE TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES ON OUR OWN, AND WE MAY 
 40 

NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THESE SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. THIS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND WOULD LIKELY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 
 THE FAILURE OF PENNYMAC CORP. TO AVAIL ITSELF OF AN APPROPRIATE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WE INTEND TO OPERATE SO THAT WE AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUBSIDIARY, PENNYMAC CORP. PMC ), QUALIFIES FOR ONE OR MORE EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT COMPOSITION OF ITS ASSETS AND INCOME HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPOSITION OF PMC S ASSETS AND INCOME WILL REMAIN THE SAME OVER TIME SUCH THAT ONE OR MORE EXEMPTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE APPLICABLE. 
 
 IF PMC IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A VARIETY OF SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT THAT IMPOSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS: LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL STRUCTURE RESTRICTIONS ON SPECIFIED INVESTMENTS PROHIBITIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES COMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING, RECORD KEEPING, VOTING AND PROXY DISCLOSURE AND, OTHER RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. FURTHER, IF PMC WAS OR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, PMC WOULD BE IN BREACH OF VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ITS CREDIT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS RESULTING IN A DEFAULT AS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS AND OBLIGATIONS. THIS COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL ACTIONS OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, OR RESULT IN A COURT APPOINTED RECEIVER TO TAKE CONTROL OF US AND LIQUIDATE OUR BUSINESS, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 
 RAPID CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION OR EXCLUSION FROM THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. 
 IF THE FAIR VALUE OR INCOME POTENTIAL OF OUR RESIDENTIAL LOANS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED ASSETS DECLINES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES OR OTHER FACTORS, WE MAY NEED TO INCREASE CERTAIN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND INCOME AND/OR LIQUIDATE OUR NON-QUALIFYING ASSETS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION OR EXCLUSION FROM THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. IF THE DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUES AND/OR INCOME OCCURS QUICKLY, THIS MAY BE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE ILLIQUID NATURE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENTS AT A DISADVANTAGEOUS TIME OR ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT MAKE ABSENT OUR REIT AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT CONSIDERATIONS, AND SUCH LIQUIDATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS . 
 RISKS RELATED TO TAXATION 
 OUR FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER TAXES AND REDUCED CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ARE ORGANIZED AND OPERATE IN A MANNER SO AS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT DEPENDS ON OUR SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN ASSET, INCOME, ORGANIZATIONAL, DISTRIBUTION, SHAREHOLDER OWNERSHIP AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ON A CONTINUING BASIS. IF WE WERE TO LOSE OUR REIT STATUS IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR, CORPORATE-LEVEL INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, WOULD APPLY TO ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AT FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATES, AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WOULD NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE BY US IN COMPUTING OUR TAXABLE INCOME. ANY SUCH CORPORATE TAX LIABILITY COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IN TURN WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. UNLESS WE WERE ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER CERTAIN INTERNAL REVENUE CODE PROVISIONS, WE ALSO WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM TAXATION AS A REIT FOR THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR DURING WHICH WE CEASED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. 
 EVEN IF WE QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE FACE TAX LIABILITIES THAT REDUCE OUR CASH FLOW, AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCOME MAY BE EARNED THROUGH TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES, OR TRSS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION 
 EVEN IF WE QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS A REIT, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ON OUR INCOME AND ASSETS, INCLUDING TAXES ON ANY UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME, TAXES ON INCOME FROM SOME ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED AS A RESULT OF A FORECLOSURE, AND STATE OR LOCAL INCOME, PROPERTY AND TRANSFER TAXES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE RECORDING TAXES. ANY OF THESE TAXES WOULD DECREASE CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ALSO ENGAGE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONDUCTED IN A TRS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, OR TO AVERT THE IMPOSITION OF A 100 TAX THAT APPLIES TO CERTAIN GAINS DERIVED BY A REIT FROM DEALER PROPERTY OR 
 41 

INVENTORY, WE HOLD A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS THROUGH, AND DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND GAINS IN, A TRS, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATION THAT SECURITIES IN TRSS MAY NOT REPRESENT MORE THAN 20 OF OUR ASSETS IN ORDER FOR US TO REMAIN QUALIFIED AS A REIT. ALL TAXABLE INCOME AND GAINS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS HELD FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR TRS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR CORPORATE INCOME TAXATION. 
 THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR ASSETS REPRESENTED BY A TRS AND THE AMOUNT OF OUR INCOME THAT WE CAN RECEIVE IN THE FORM OF TRS DIVIDENDS ARE SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMITATIONS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR REIT STATUS. 
 CURRENTLY, NO MORE THAN 20 OF THE VALUE OF A REIT S ASSETS MAY CONSIST OF STOCK OR SECURITIES OF ONE OR MORE TRSS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. WE MAY POTENTIALLY HAVE TO MODIFY OUR ACTIVITIES OR THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THOSE TRSS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THIS LIMITATION AND MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. WHILE WE INTEND TO MANAGE OUR AFFAIRS SO AS TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN ALL MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO DO SO, COMPLIANCE WITH THIS RULE MAY REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH A TRS IS SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX ON ITS TAXABLE INCOME, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME NEED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUCH AFTER-TAX INCOME IN ORDER TO KEEP THE VALUE OF OUR TRS BELOW 20 OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF ONE OF THE TESTS WE MUST SATISFY TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AT LEAST 75 OF OUR GROSS INCOME MUST IN EACH TAXABLE YEAR GENERALLY BE FROM REAL ESTATE ASSETS. WHILE WE MONITOR OUR COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH THIS INCOME TEST AND THE LIMITATION ON THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR ASSETS REPRESENTED BY TRS SECURITIES, THE TWO MAY AT TIMES BE IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY WISH TO DISTRIBUTE A DIVIDEND FROM A TRS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR TRS BELOW 20 OF THE REQUIRED PERCENTAGE OF OUR ASSETS, BUT BE UNABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT VIOLATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT 75 OF OUR GROSS INCOME IN THE TAXABLE YEAR BE DERIVED FROM REAL ESTATE ASSETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH EITHER OR BOTH OF THESE TESTS IN ALL MARKET CONDITIONS. OUR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH BOTH OF THESE TESTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, QUALIFICATION AS A REIT AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 ORDINARY DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY REITS DO NOT GENERALLY QUALIFY FOR THE REDUCED TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN CORPORATE DIVIDENDS. 
 THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE PROVIDES FOR A 20 MAXIMUM FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FOR DIVIDENDS PAID BY REGULAR UNITED STATES CORPORATIONS TO ELIGIBLE DOMESTIC SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE INDIVIDUALS, TRUSTS OR ESTATES. DIVIDENDS PAID BY REITS ARE GENERALLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THESE REDUCED RATES. H.R. 1, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOB ACT (THE TAX ACT ), WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, GENERALLY MAY ALLOW DOMESTIC SHAREHOLDERS TO DEDUCT FROM THEIR TAXABLE INCOME ONE-FIFTH OF THE REIT ORDINARY DIVIDENDS PAYABLE TO THEM FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2026. TO QUALIFY FOR THIS DEDUCTION, THE SHAREHOLDER RECEIVING SUCH DIVIDEND MUST HOLD THE DIVIDEND-PAYING REIT SHARES FOR AT LEAST 46 DAYS (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CERTAIN SPECIAL HOLDING PERIOD RULES) OF THE 91-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING 45 DAYS BEFORE THE SHARES BECOME EX-DIVIDEND, AND CANNOT BE UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE RELATED PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO A POSITION IN SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR OR RELATED PROPERTY. HOWEVER, EVEN IF A DOMESTIC SHAREHOLDER QUALIFIES FOR THIS DEDUCTION, THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR SUCH REIT DIVIDENDS STILL REMAINS HIGHER THAN RATES FOR REGULAR CORPORATE DIVIDENDS PAID TO HIGH-TAXED INDIVIDUALS. THE MORE FAVORABLE RATES APPLICABLE TO REGULAR CORPORATE DIVIDENDS COULD CAUSE INVESTORS WHO ARE INDIVIDUALS, TRUSTS AND ESTATES TO PERCEIVE INVESTMENTS IN REITS TO BE RELATIVELY LESS ATTRACTIVE AS A FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTER THAN INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCKS OF NON-REIT CORPORATIONS THAT PAY DIVIDENDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF REITS, INCLUDING OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN CRT AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE REIT ASSETS AND WE HAVE THEREFORE HELD SUCH INVESTMENTS IN OUR TRS, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCOME FROM THESE INVESTMENTS BEING SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXATION IN ORDER NOT TO JEOPARDIZE OUR REIT STATUS. 
 OUR NEW INVESTMENTS IN CRT SECURITIES ARE STRUCTURED WITH THE INTENTION OF SATISFYING OUR REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, IN GENERAL WE EXPECT TO HOLD INVESTMENTS IN SUCH CRT SECURITIES IN THE REIT BASED ON THE ADVICE OF OUR TAX ADVISORS. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN CRT AGREEMENTS, THE REIT ELIGIBILITY OF THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO THE CRT AGREEMENTS AND THE INCOME RELATING THERETO REMAINS UNCERTAIN. ACCORDINGLY, IN GENERAL WE CURRENTLY HOLD SUCH INVESTMENTS IN OUR TRS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ON OCCASION BASED ON THE ADVICE OF TAX ADVISORS HELD SUCH POSITIONS IN THE REIT AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, DEPENDING ON THE PRECISE STRUCTURE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS AND OUR LEVEL OF CERTAINTY THAT SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE IN A FORM CONSISTENT WITH THEIR CHARACTERIZATION AS QUALIFYING ASSETS FOR A REIT. IF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IRS WERE TO TAKE A POSITION ADVERSE TO OUR INTERPRETATION, THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACTION COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PAYMENT LEVEL AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FUTURE AT CURRENT LEVELS OR AT ALL. 
 WE ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT LEAST 90 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME EACH YEAR FOR US TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WHICH REQUIREMENT WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO SATISFY. TO THE EXTENT WE SATISFY THE 90 
 42 

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BUT DISTRIBUTE LESS THAN 100 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX ON OUR UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME. WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PAYMENT LEVEL, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT AND ANY SUBSEQUENT QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE, AND ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO MAKE, QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS THE SOLE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE TIMING, FORM AND AMOUNT OF ANY FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND SUCH DETERMINATION WILL DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY, MAINTENANCE OF OUR REIT QUALIFICATION AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND OTHER EXPENSE OBLIGATIONS, DEBT COVENANTS, CONTRACTUAL PROHIBITIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS AND APPLICABLE LAW AND SUCH OTHER MATTERS AS OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES MAY DEEM RELEVANT FROM TIME TO TIME. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS ARE: 

OUR INABILITY TO INVEST THE NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR EQUITY OFFERINGS 

OUR INABILITY TO MAKE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS ON OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS 

NON-CASH EARNINGS OR UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES THAT REDUCE OUR CASH FLOW 

DEFAULTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR DECREASES IN ITS VALUE 

REDUCED CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY DELAYS IN REPAYMENT OR LIQUIDATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND 

THE FACT THAT ANTICIPATED OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS MAY NOT PROVE ACCURATE, AS ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM ESTIMATES. 

 AS A RESULT, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FUTURE OR THAT THE LEVEL OF ANY FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS WILL ACHIEVE A MARKET YIELD OR INCREASE OR EVEN BE MAINTAINED OVER TIME, OR THAT FUTURE DIVIDENDS MIGHT NOT BE A COMBINATION OF STOCK AND CASH, AS PERMITTED UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE GUIDELINES, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 THE REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES. 
 WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND TO AVOID PAYING CORPORATE INCOME TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF TAXABLE INCOME AND THE ACTUAL RECEIPT OF CASH COULD REQUIRE US TO SELL ASSETS, BORROW FUNDS ON A SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASIS, OR ISSUE EQUITY TO MEET THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ASSETS IN WHICH WE INVEST AND MAY INVEST AND TO OUR ACCOUNTING ELECTIONS FOR SUCH ASSETS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE TAXABLE INCOME FROM THOSE ASSETS IN ADVANCE OF OUR RECEIPT OF CASH FLOW ON OR PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITION OF SUCH ASSETS. 
 IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE TAX ACT, WE GENERALLY WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN INCOME NO LATER THAN THE TIME SUCH AMOUNTS ARE REFLECTED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC. THE APPLICATION OF THIS RULE MAY REQUIRE THE ACCRUAL OF INCOME WITH RESPECT TO LOANS, MBS, AND OTHER TYPES OF DEBT SECURITIES OR INTERESTS IN DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY US, SUCH AS ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT OR MARKET DISCOUNT, EARLIER THAN WOULD BE THE CASE UNDER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, ALTHOUGH THE PRECISE APPLICATION OF THIS RULE TO OUR BUSINESS IS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME IN VARIOUS RESPECTS. 
 AS A RESULT, TO THE EXTENT SUCH INCOME IS NOT REALIZED WITHIN A TRS, THE REQUIREMENT TO DISTRIBUTE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME COULD CAUSE US TO: (I) SELL ASSETS IN ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS, (II) BORROW ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, (III) DISTRIBUTE AMOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVESTED IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR (IV) MAKE A TAXABLE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR SHARES AS PART OF A DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE SHARES OR (SUBJECT TO A LIMIT MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL DISTRIBUTION) CASH, IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH REIT REQUIREMENTS. 
 WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TAXABLE INCOME EARLY IN OUR HOLDING PERIOD FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN EXCESS OF THE ECONOMIC INCOME WE ULTIMATELY REALIZE FROM THEM. 
 WE ACQUIRE AND/OR EXPECT TO ACQUIRE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY FOR LESS THAN THEIR FACE AMOUNT, MBS ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, MBS ACQUIRED AT A MARKET DISCOUNT, OR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR MBS THAT ARE DELINQUENT AS TO MANDATORY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. IN EACH CASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPORT INCOME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CORRESPONDING CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED OR ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. IF WE EVENTUALLY COLLECT LESS THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS INCOME, THERE MAY BE A BAD DEBT DEDUCTION AVAILABLE TO US AT THAT TIME OR WE MAY RECORD A CAPITAL LOSS IN A DISPOSITION OF SUCH ASSET, BUT OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM THAT BAD DEBT DEDUCTION WOULD DEPEND ON OUR HAVING TAXABLE INCOME OR CAPITAL GAINS, RESPECTIVELY, IN THAT LATER TAXABLE YEAR OR A SUBSEQUENT TAXABLE YEAR. THIS POSSIBLE INCOME EARLY, LOSSES LATER PHENOMENON COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS IF IT WERE PERSISTENT AND IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS.

THE SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMITS APPLICABLE TO US THAT ARE IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE FOR REITS AND OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST MAY RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS COMBINATION OPPORTUNITIES. 
 IN ORDER FOR US TO MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, NOT MORE THAN 50 IN VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES MAY BE OWNED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY FIVE OR FEWER INDIVIDUALS (AS DEFINED IN THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE TO INCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES) AT ANY TIME DURING THE LAST HALF OF EACH TAXABLE YEAR FOLLOWING OUR FIRST YEAR. OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE TO PRESERVE OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. UNDER OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST, NO PERSON MAY OWN MORE THAN 9.8 BY VOTE OR VALUE, WHICHEVER IS MORE RESTRICTIVE, OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OR MORE THAN 9.8 BY VOTE OR VALUE, WHICHEVER IS MORE RESTRICTIVE, OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST. OUR BOARD MAY GRANT AN EXEMPTION TO THE SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMITS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS. THESE SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMITS ARE BASED UPON DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP BY INDIVIDUALS, WHICH TERM INCLUDES CERTAIN ENTITIES. 
 OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS ARE COMMON IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF REITS AND ARE INTENDED, AMONG OTHER PURPOSES, TO PROVIDE ADDED ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE TAX LAW REQUIREMENTS AND TO MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS. HOWEVER, OUR SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMITS MIGHT ALSO DELAY OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES OR OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 COMPLYING WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS CAN BE DIFFICULT AND MAY CAUSE US TO FOREGO OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES OR LIQUIDATE OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS. 
 TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, WE MUST CONTINUALLY SATISFY TESTS CONCERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SOURCES OF OUR INCOME, THE NATURE AND DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR ASSETS, THE AMOUNTS WE DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR SHARES. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT DISADVANTAGEOUS TIMES OR WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDS READILY AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. THUS, COMPLIANCE WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS OR REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE FROM OUR PORTFOLIO OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS. IF WE ARE COMPELLED TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS, ULTIMATELY JEOPARDIZING OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, OR WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A 100 TAX ON ANY RESULTANT GAIN IF WE SELL ASSETS THAT ARE TREATED AS DEALER PROPERTY OR INVENTORY. THESE ACTIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING OUR INCOME AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 COMPLYING WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EFFECTIVELY. 
 THE REIT PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE OUR ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS. UNDER CURRENT LAW, ANY INCOME FROM A HEDGING TRANSACTION WE ENTER INTO EITHER (I) TO MANAGE RISK OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO BORROWINGS MADE OR TO BE MADE TO ACQUIRE OR CARRY REAL ESTATE ASSETS, (II) TO MANAGE RISK OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS OF INCOME THAT QUALIFY FOR PURPOSES OF THE REIT 75 OR 95 GROSS INCOME TESTS OR ASSETS THAT GENERATE SUCH INCOME, OR (III) TO HEDGE ANOTHER INSTRUMENT THAT HEDGES RISKS DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (I) OR (II) FOR A PERIOD FOLLOWING THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE LIABILITY OR THE DISPOSITION OF THE ASSET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY HEDGED BY THE INSTRUMENT, PROVIDED, THAT, IN EACH CASE, SUCH INSTRUMENT IS PROPERLY IDENTIFIED UNDER APPLICABLE TREASURY REGULATIONS, WILL NOT BE TREATED AS QUALIFYING INCOME FOR PURPOSES OF THE REIT GROSS INCOME TESTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE RULES, WE MAY HAVE TO LIMIT OUR USE OF HEDGING TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ADVANTAGEOUS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN GREATER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE OR OTHER CHANGES THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT TO. 
 THE TAX ON PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN METHODS OF SECURITIZING LOANS THAT WOULD BE TREATED AS SALES FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. 
 A REIT S NET INCOME FROM PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS IS SUBJECT TO A 100 TAX. IN GENERAL, PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS ARE SALES OR OTHER DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTY, OTHER THAN FORECLOSURE PROPERTY, BUT INCLUDING LOANS, HELD PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS TAX IF WE WERE TO SELL LOANS THAT WE HELD PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION EFFECTED THROUGH THE REIT. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO AVOID THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS TAX, WE ENGAGE IN SUCH SALES OF LOANS THROUGH THE TRS. WE MAY HOLD A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS IN ONE OR MORE TRSS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CORPORATE INCOME TAX ON ITS EARNINGS, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE AGGREGATE, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 THE TAXABLE MORTGAGE POOL TMP RULES MAY INCREASE THE TAXES THAT WE OR OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY INCUR, AND MAY LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE EFFECT FUTURE SECURITIZATIONS. 
 CERTAIN OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS THAT INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE OF INDEBTEDNESS RATHER THAN SALES MAY LIKELY BE CONSIDERED TO RESULT IN THE CREATION OF TMPS FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. A TMP IS ALWAYS CLASSIFIED AS A CORPORATION FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. HOWEVER, AS LONG AS A REIT OWNS 100 OF A TMP, SUCH CLASSIFICATION GENERALLY DOES NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF CORPORATE INCOME TAX, BECAUSE THE TMP IS A QUALIFIED REIT SUBSIDIARY. 
 44 

IN THE CASE OF SUCH WHOLLY-REIT OWNED TMPS, CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, SUCH AS FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR TREATY BENEFITS, SHAREHOLDERS WITH NET OPERATING LOSSES, AND TAX EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNRELATED BUSINESS INCOME TAX, COULD BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED TAXES ON A PORTION OF THEIR DIVIDEND INCOME RECEIVED FROM US THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TMP , OR EXCESS INCLUSION INCOME. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE OWNED IN RECORD NAME BY TAX EXEMPT DISQUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN GOVERNMENT-RELATED ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TAX ON UNRELATED BUSINESS INCOME, WE MAY INCUR A CORPORATE LEVEL TAX ON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF EXCESS INCLUSION INCOME FROM SUCH A WHOLLY-REIT OWNED TMP. IN THAT CASE AND TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE, WE MAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO ANY DISQUALIFIED ORGANIZATION WHOSE SHARE OWNERSHIP GAVE RISE TO THE TAX, OR WE MAY BEAR SUCH TAX AS A GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR SHARES OWNED BY DISQUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS ARE HELD IN RECORD NAME BY A BROKER/DEALER OR OTHER NOMINEE, THE BROKER/DEALER OR OTHER NOMINEE WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE CORPORATE LEVEL TAX ON THE PORTION OF OUR EXCESS INCLUSION INCOME ALLOCABLE TO THE SHARES HELD BY THE BROKER/DEALER OR OTHER NOMINEE ON BEHALF OF DISQUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS. WHILE WE INTEND TO ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THE PORTION OF OUR DISTRIBUTIONS THAT IS SUBJECT TO THESE RULES, THE LAW IS UNCLEAR CONCERNING COMPUTATION OF EXCESS INCLUSION INCOME, AND ITS AMOUNT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. 
 IN THE CASE OF ANY TMP THAT WOULD BE TAXABLE AS A DOMESTIC CORPORATION IF IT WERE NOT WHOLLY-REIT OWNED, WE WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM SELLING EQUITY INTERESTS IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS TO OUTSIDE INVESTORS, OR SELLING ANY DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SECURITIZATIONS THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED TO BE EQUITY INTERESTS FOR TAX PURPOSES. THIS MARKETING LIMITATION MAY PREVENT US FROM SELLING MORE JUNIOR OR NON-INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT SECURITIES IN SUCH SECURITIZATIONS AND MAXIMIZING OUR PROCEEDS REALIZED IN THOSE OFFERINGS. 
 NEW LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL ACTION, IN EACH INSTANCE POTENTIALLY WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT, COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. 
 THE RULES DEALING WITH FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION, INCLUDING THE PRESENT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF REITS, MAY BE MODIFIED, POSSIBLY WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT, BY LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AT ANY TIME, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON SHARES. CHANGES TO THE TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX RULES THAT AFFECT REITS, ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER REVIEW BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, THE IRS AND THE U.S. TREASURY, WHICH RESULTS IN STATUTORY CHANGES AS WELL AS FREQUENT REVISIONS TO TREASURY REGULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS. REVISIONS IN U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE ALSO MAY ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WHERE THE REIT ELIGIBILITY OF THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS IS UNCERTAIN. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE APPLICATION OF THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR INVESTMENTS IS NOT CLEAR, WE MAY HAVE TO INTERPRET THEM AND THEIR APPLICATION TO US. IF THE IRS WERE TO TAKE A POSITION ADVERSE TO OUR INTERPRETATION, THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACTION COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 AN IRS ADMINISTRATIVE PRONOUNCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY REITS IN DISTRESSED DEBT SECURED BY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY, IF INTERPRETED ADVERSELY TO US, COULD CAUSE US TO PAY PENALTY TAXES OR POTENTIALLY TO LOSE OUR REIT STATUS. 
 MOST OF THE DISTRESSED LOANS THAT WE HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED WERE ACQUIRED BY US AT A DISCOUNT FROM THEIR OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, BECAUSE OUR PRICING WAS GENERALLY BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE THAT SECURES THOSE LOANS. 
 TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.856-5(C) (THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION PROVIDES RULES FOR DETERMINING WHAT PORTION OF THE INTEREST INCOME FROM LOANS THAT ARE SECURED BY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY IS TREATED AS INTEREST ON OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY OR ON INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY. UNDER THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION, IF A MORTGAGE COVERS BOTH REAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPERTY, A REIT IS REQUIRED TO APPORTION ITS ANNUAL INTEREST INCOME TO THE REAL PROPERTY SECURITY BASED ON A FRACTION, THE NUMERATOR OF WHICH IS THE VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING THE LOAN, DETERMINED WHEN THE REIT COMMITS TO ACQUIRE THE LOAN, AND THE DENOMINATOR OF WHICH IS THE HIGHEST PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN DURING THE YEAR. THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16, WHICH CONTAINS AN EXAMPLE REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION. THE EXAMPLE INTERPRETS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN TO BE THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DESPITE THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REQUIRING TAXPAYERS TO TREAT ANY MARKET DISCOUNT, THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LOAN AND ITS FACE AMOUNT, FOR ALL PURPOSES (OTHER THAN CERTAIN WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING PURPOSES) AS INTEREST RATHER THAN PRINCIPAL. 
 THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION APPLIES ONLY IF THE DEBT IN QUESTION IS SECURED BOTH BY REAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL PROPERTY. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE LOANS THAT WE ACQUIRED AT A DISCOUNT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONTEMPLATED BY REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16 ARE SECURED ONLY BY REAL PROPERTY AND NO OTHER PROPERTY VALUE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN OUR UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION DOES NOT APPLY TO OUR PORTFOLIO. 
 NEVERTHELESS, IF THE IRS WERE TO ASSERT SUCCESSFULLY THAT OUR LOANS WERE SECURED BY PROPERTY OTHER THAN REAL ESTATE, THAT THE INTEREST APPORTIONMENT REGULATION APPLIED FOR PURPOSES OF OUR REIT TESTING, AND THAT THE POSITION TAKEN IN REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16 
 45 

SHOULD BE APPLIED TO OUR PORTFOLIO, THEN DEPENDING UPON THE VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING OUR LOANS AND THEIR FACE AMOUNT, AND THE SOURCES OF OUR GROSS INCOME GENERALLY, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE 75 REIT GROSS INCOME TEST, AND POSSIBLY THE ASSET TESTS APPLICABLE TO REITS. IF WE DID NOT MEET THIS TEST, WE COULD POTENTIALLY EITHER LOSE OUR REIT STATUS OR BE REQUIRED TO PAY A TAX PENALTY TO THE IRS. 
 WITH RESPECT TO THE 75 REIT ASSET TEST, REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR UNDER WHICH THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE A REIT S TREATMENT OF A LOAN AS BEING A REAL ESTATE ASSET IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (1) THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING THE LOAN DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE THE REIT COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE THE LOAN OR (2) THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE LOAN ON THE DATE OF THE RELEVANT QUARTERLY REIT ASSET TESTING DATE. THIS SAFE HARBOR, IF IT APPLIED TO US, WOULD HELP US COMPLY WITH THE REIT ASSET TESTS FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF DISTRESSED DEBT IF THE VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING THE LOAN WERE TO SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINE. HOWEVER, IF THE VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING THE LOAN WERE TO INCREASE, THE SAFE HARBOR RULE OF REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16, READ LITERALLY, COULD HAVE THE PECULIAR EFFECT OF CAUSING THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE LOAN TO NOT BE TREATED AS A REAL ESTATE ASSET. WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS THE INTENDED RESULT IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE VALUE OF A LOAN HAS INCREASED BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE REAL PROPERTY SECURING THE LOAN HAS INCREASED, OR THAT THIS SAFE HARBOR RULE APPLIES TO DEBT THAT IS SECURED SOLELY BY REAL PROPERTY. HOWEVER, FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2015, INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 856(C)(9) WAS ADDED AND CLARIFIES REVENUE PROCEDURE 2011-16. SUBPARAGRAPH (B) OF SECTION 856(C)(9) ALLOWS A REIT TO TREAT PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT IS SECURED BY A MORTGAGE ON BOTH REAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AS A REAL ESTATE ASSET, AND THE INTEREST INCOME AS DERIVED FROM A MORTGAGE SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY, IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY DOES NOT EXCEED FIFTEEN PERCENT 15 OF THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY SECURED BY THE MORTGAGE. NEVERTHELESS, IF THE IRS TOOK THE POSITION THAT THE SAFE HARBOR RULE APPLIED IN THESE SCENARIOS, THEN WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE VARIOUS QUARTERLY REIT ASSET TESTS IF THE VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE SECURING OUR LOANS INCREASED, AND THUS THE VALUE OF OUR LOANS INCREASED BY A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT. IF WE DID NOT MEET ONE OR MORE OF THESE TESTS, THEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY EITHER LOSE OUR REIT STATUS OR BE REQUIRED TO PAY A TAX PENALTY TO THE IRS. 
 GENERAL RISKS 
 THE RISK MANAGEMENT EFFORTS OF OUR MANAGER MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE. 
 WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES AND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED IF OUR MANAGER IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY, MANAGE, MONITOR, AND MITIGATE FINANCIAL RISKS, SUCH AS CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PREPAYMENT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OTHER MARKET-RELATED RISKS, AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OTHER LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES THAT ARE NOT INDUSTRY SPECIFIC, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR MANAGER S RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED, MITIGATE THE RISKS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED, OR IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT IN THE FUTURE. EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO RESULT IN OUR BEING EXPOSED TO RISKS TO WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPOSED OR MAY INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN TYPES OF RISKS, AND OUR MANAGER MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY, MANAGE, MONITOR, AND MITIGATE THESE RISKS AS OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY CHANGES OR INCREASES. 
 WE COULD BE HARMED BY MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT. 
 WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS RELATING TO MISCONDUCT BY OUR EMPLOYEES, EMPLOYEES OF PENNYMAC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, CONTRACTORS WE USE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH EMPLOYEES COULD EXECUTE UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS, USE OUR ASSETS IMPROPERLY OR WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, PERFORM IMPROPER ACTIVITIES, USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES, OR MISRECORD OR OTHERWISE TRY TO HIDE IMPROPER ACTIVITIES FROM US. THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT COULD ALSO RELATE TO OUR ASSETS MANAGED BY PCM. THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND IF NOT PREVENTED OR DETECTED COULD RESULT IN CLAIMS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST US OR LOSSES. ACCORDINGLY, MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF PENNYMAC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, CONTRACTORS, OR OTHERS COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES OR REGULATORY SANCTIONS AND SERIOUSLY HARM OUR REPUTATION. OUR CONTROLS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. 
 IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD. 
 EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO PROVIDE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE DISCOVER AREAS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE AND REPORT ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND HAVE OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ANNUALLY ATTEST TO OUR EVALUATION, AS WELL AS ISSUE THEIR OWN OPINION ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. WHILE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN SUBSTANTIAL WORK TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 404, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING ADEQUATE CONTROL OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FINANCIAL PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CREATED UNIQUE CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEES WORKING REMOTELY. 
 46 

FURTHERMORE, AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL BECOME MORE COMPLEX, AND WE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES TO ENSURE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS REMAIN EFFECTIVE. 
 IF WE OR OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS DISCOVER A MATERIAL WEAKNESS, THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT FACT, EVEN IF QUICKLY REMEDIED, COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR LENDING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXISTENCE OF ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY COULD REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO REMEDIATE ANY SUCH MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY, AND MANAGEMENT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMEDIATE ANY SUCH MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR AT ALL. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD RESULT IN MISSTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR RESTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 CYBERSECURITY RISKS, CYBER INCIDENTS AND TECHNOLOGY FAILURES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY CAUSING A DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS, A COMPROMISE OR CORRUPTION OF OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 A CYBER INCIDENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE ANY ADVERSE EVENT THAT THREATENS THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR INFORMATION RESOURCES. THESE INCIDENTS MAY BE AN INTENTIONAL ATTACK OR AN UNINTENTIONAL EVENT AND COULD INVOLVE GAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR PURPOSES OF THEFT OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS, MISAPPROPRIATING ASSETS, STEALING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, CORRUPTING DATA OR CAUSING OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION. THE RESULT OF THESE INCIDENTS MAY INCLUDE DISRUPTED OPERATIONS, MISSTATED OR UNRELIABLE FINANCIAL DATA, LIABILITY FOR STOLEN ASSETS OR INFORMATION, INCREASED CYBERSECURITY PROTECTION AND INSURANCE COSTS, LITIGATION AND DAMAGE TO OUR INVESTOR RELATIONSHIPS. 
 AS OUR RELIANCE ON RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES HAS INCREASED, SO HAVE THE RISKS POSED TO OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, BOTH INTERNAL AND THOSE PROVIDED TO US BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS CLOUD-BASED COMPUTING SERVICE PROVIDERS. SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS AND FAILURES CAUSED BY FIRE, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, UNAUTHORIZED INTRUSION, COMPUTER VIRUSES AND DISABLING DEVICES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS MAY INTERRUPT OR DELAY OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. 
 DESPITE EFFORTS BY PCM TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ITS SYSTEMS, ITS INVESTMENT IN SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL SECURITY MEASURES, EMPLOYEE TRAINING, CONTRACTUAL PRECAUTIONS AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO HELP MITIGATE CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND CYBER INTRUSIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH CYBER INTRUSIONS WILL NOT OCCUR OR, IF THEY DO OCCUR, THAT THEY WILL BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. WE ALSO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE METHODS OF ATTACK CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE SECURITY ATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS PERSONS INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ARE ALSO HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ACTIONS AND INACTIONS OF OUR THIRD-PARTY VENDORS REGARDING CYBERSECURITY AND OTHER CONSUMER-RELATED MATTERS. 
 ANY OF THE FOREGOING EVENTS COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO US OR TO OUR CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, ADDITIONAL REGULATORY SCRUTINY, SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION EXPOSURE AND HARM TO OUR REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND IS LIKELY TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, AND OUR INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY OR DECREASED MARGINS RESULTING FROM INCREASED COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY THAT COULD BECOME EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE AS A RESULT OF ECONOMIC, LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. WE COMPETE IN OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER MORTGAGE REITS, SPECIALTY FINANCE COMPANIES, PRIVATE FUNDS, BANKS, MORTGAGE BANKERS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BODIES AND OTHER ENTITIES, MANY OF WHICH FOCUS ON ACQUIRING MORTGAGE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS AND SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER INDEPENDENT MORTGAGE LENDERS AND SERVICERS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE IN THE ACQUISITION OF NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS. MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER US, INCLUDING SIZE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, COST OF FUNDS, FEDERAL PRE-EMPTION AND HIGHER RISK TOLERANCE. ADDITIONALLY, OUR EXISTING AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS MAY DECIDE TO MODIFY THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO COMPETE MORE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION BUSINESS. COMPETITION MAY RESULT IN FEWER INVESTMENTS, HIGHER PRICES, ACCEPTANCE OF GREATER RISK, LOWER YIELDS AND A NARROWER SPREAD OF YIELDS OVER OUR FINANCING COSTS. MOREOVER, IF MORE NON-BANK ENTITIES ENTER THESE MARKETS AND AS MORE COMMERCIAL BANKS AGGRESSIVELY COMPETE, OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES MAY GENERATE LOWER VOLUMES AND/OR MARGINS. 
 47 

FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH WOULD RANK SENIOR TO OUR COMMON SHARES, AND FUTURE ISSUANCES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE HOLDINGS OF OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS AND MAY BE SENIOR TO OUR COMMON SHARES, MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY RELY ON ADDITIONAL COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY ISSUANCES, WHICH MAY RANK SENIOR AND/OR BE DILUTIVE TO OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS, OR ON LESS EFFICIENT FORMS OF DEBT FINANCING THAT RANK SENIOR TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND REQUIRE A LARGER PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, THEREBY REDUCING FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR OUR OPERATIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER PURPOSES. 
 DURING MARCH 2017, WE ISSUED 4.6 MILLION OF 8.125 SERIES A FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES AND, IN JULY 2017, WE ALSO ISSUED 7.8 MILLION OF 8.00 SERIES B FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES. OUR OUTSTANDING PREFERRED SHARES HAVE PREFERENCES ON DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS, TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 DURING NOVEMBER 2019, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, PMC, ISSUED 210 MILLION OF EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES, THE 2024 NOTES, THAT ARE EXCHANGEABLE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR OUR COMMON SHARES. UPON LIQUIDATION, HOLDERS OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER LOANS WOULD RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION OF OUR AVAILABLE ASSETS BEFORE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND HOLDERS OF THE 2024 NOTES COULD RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION OF PMC S AVAILABLE ASSETS BEFORE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES. WE ALSO ISSUED A TOTAL OF 33.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES PURSUANT TO UNDERWRITTEN EQUITY OFFERINGS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019. 
 SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS THE AUTHORITY, WITHOUT FURTHER SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL DEBT, COMMON SHARES AND PREFERRED SHARES ON THE TERMS AND FOR THE CONSIDERATION IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE ISSUED, AND/OR INTEND TO ISSUE, ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES AND SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO, OR EXCHANGEABLE OR EXERCISABLE FOR, COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN. WE HAVE ALSO FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, FROM WHICH WE HAVE ISSUED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ISSUE ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THROUGH OUR AT-THE-MARKET EQUITY PROGRAM AND AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 74.4 MILLION OF COMMON SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THAT PROGRAM. 
 WE ALSO MAY ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH PORTFOLIO OR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND MAY GRANT DEMAND OR PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ISSUANCES. BECAUSE OUR DECISION TO ISSUE SECURITIES IN ANY FUTURE OFFERING WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECT, IF ANY, OF FUTURE ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON SHARES, PREFERRED SHARES OR OTHER EQUITY-BASED SECURITIES OR THE PROSPECT OF SUCH ISSUANCES ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. ISSUANCES OF A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SECURITIES, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH ISSUANCES MIGHT OCCUR, COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES. 
 THUS, HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES BEAR THE RISK THAT OUR FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES OR OTHER BORROWINGS WILL REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND DILUTE THEIR OWNERSHIP IN US. 
 INITIATING NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING EXISTING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES MAY EXPOSE US TO NEW RISKS AND INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. 
 INITIATING NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING EXISTING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, ARE WAYS TO GROW OUR BUSINESSES AND RESPOND TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR INDUSTRY HOWEVER, THEY MAY EXPOSE US TO NEW RISKS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED AND ANY REVENUES WE EARN FROM ANY NEW OR EXPANDED BUSINESS INITIATIVE OR INVESTMENT STRATEGY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE INITIAL AND ONGOING COSTS OF THAT INITIATIVE, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THAT INITIATIVE OR STRATEGY. 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS OR GENERATE SUFFICIENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO MAKE OR SUSTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
 THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH TO PAY OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE OR SUSTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT SATISFY OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND OUR SUCCESS IN IDENTIFYING AND CONSUMMATING THEM ON FAVORABLE TERMS, THE LEVEL AND EXPECTED MOVEMENT OF HOME PRICES, THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, READILY ACCESSIBLE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, AND CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, REAL ESTATE MARKET AND THE ECONOMY, AS TO WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN. 
 WE ALSO FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN ACQUIRING ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. WHILE WE TRY TO DIVERSIFY OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG VARIOUS TYPES OF MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, THE 
 48 

COMPETITION FOR SUCH ASSETS MAY COMPRESS MARGINS AND REDUCE YIELDS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS WITH ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION OUT OF INVESTMENTS PRODUCING LOWER RETURNS INTO INVESTMENTS THAT PRODUCE BETTER RETURNS, OR THAT WE WILL NOT SEEK INVESTMENTS WITH GREATER RISK TO OBTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF RETURNS. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS TO DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS .

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT TO OUR BUSINESS. THE
MATERIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE BELIEVE AFFECT US ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.
SEE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF
OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

FLUCTUATIONS
IN INTEREST RATES COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR
ASSETS LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST
RATE RISK. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME IS NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST EARNED ON LOANS AND LEASES AND INVESTMENTS, AND
INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL PERIODICALLY
EXPERIENCE IMBALANCES IN THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITIES OF OUR ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES AND THE RELATIONSHIPS OF VARIOUS INTEREST RATES TO EACH OTHER. OVER
ANY DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, OUR INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS MAY BE MORE SENSITIVE TO
CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES THAN OUR INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES, OR
VICE-VERSA. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET INTEREST RATES UNDERLYING OUR
LOAN AND LEASE AND DEPOSIT PRODUCTS MAY NOT CHANGE TO THE SAME DEGREE OVER A
GIVEN TIME PERIOD. IN ANY EVENT, IF MARKET INTEREST RATES SHOULD MOVE CONTRARY
TO OUR POSITION, EARNINGS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION,
LOAN AND LEASE VOLUME AND QUALITY AND DEPOSIT VOLUME AND MIX CAN BE AFFECTED BY
MARKET INTEREST RATES AS CAN THE BUSINESSES OF OUR CLIENTS. CHANGES IN LEVELS OF
MARKET INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR NET INTEREST
SPREAD, ASSET QUALITY, ORIGINATION VOLUME, AND OVERALL
PROFITABILITY. 

MARKET
INTEREST RATES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND THEY FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO GENERAL
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE POLICIES OF VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY
AGENCIES, IN PARTICULAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. CHANGES IN MONETARY POLICY,
INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
ORIGINATE LOANS AND LEASES, THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE
GAINS FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS, ALL OF WHICH ULTIMATELY COULD AFFECT OUR
EARNINGS.

FUTURE
EXPANSION INVOLVES RISKS IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR PART OF
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WE MAY ESTABLISH DE NOVO BRANCH OFFICES. THERE
COULD BE CONSIDERABLE COSTS INVOLVED IN EXECUTING OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. FOR
INSTANCE, NEW BRANCHES GENERALLY REQUIRE A PERIOD OF TIME TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT
REVENUES TO OFFSET THEIR COSTS, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE AN
ESTABLISHED PRESENCE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY NEW BRANCH EXPANSION COULD BE EXPECTED TO
NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE BRANCH REACHES
CERTAIN ECONOMIES OF SCALE. ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF RISKS,
INCLUDING THE RISK THAT: 

WE
 MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING POTENTIAL
 ACQUISITIONS AND MERGER PARTNERS, OR IN EVALUATING NEW MARKETS, HIRING
 EXPERIENCED LOCAL MANAGERS, AND OPENING NEW OFFICES; 

OUR
 ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED TO EVALUATE CREDIT, OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT,
 AND MARKET RISKS RELATING TO TARGET INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT BE
 ACCURATE; 

THERE
 MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL LAG-TIME BETWEEN COMPLETING AN ACQUISITION OR OPENING A
 NEW OFFICE AND GENERATING SUFFICIENT ASSETS AND DEPOSITS TO SUPPORT COSTS
 OF THE EXPANSION; 

WE
 MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION, OR THE FINANCING WE OBTAIN MAY
 HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR DILUTION OF OUR
 EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS; 

THE
 ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT IN NEGOTIATING A TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATING
 THE OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL OF THE COMBINING BUSINESSES MAY BE DIVERTED
 FROM OUR EXISTING BUSINESS; 

ACQUISITIONS
 TYPICALLY INVOLVE THE PAYMENT OF A PREMIUM OVER BOOK AND MARKET VALUES
 AND; THEREFORE, SOME DILUTION OF OUR TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE AND NET INCOME
 PER COMMON SHARE MAY OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FUTURE
 TRANSACTION; 

WE
 MAY ENTER NEW MARKETS WHERE WE LACK LOCAL EXPERIENCE; 

WE
 MAY INCUR GOODWILL IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION, OR THE GOODWILL WE
 INCUR MAY BECOME IMPAIRED, WHICH RESULTS IN ADVERSE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON
 OUR OPERATING RESULTS; OR 

WE
 MAY LOSE KEY EMPLOYEES AND CLIENTS. 

COMPETITION
FROM OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS THE BANKING
AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE FACE COMPETITION IN
MAKING LOANS AND LEASES, ATTRACTING DEPOSITS AND PROVIDING INSURANCE,
INVESTMENT, TRUST, AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES. INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE
BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE, IMPAIR
OUR GROWTH OR CAUSE THE PRICES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES TO DECLINE. OUR
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN FUTURE PERIODS DEPENDING UPON
THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF COMPETITION WE ENCOUNTER IN OUR VARIOUS MARKET
AREAS. 

WE ARE
DEPENDENT UPON THE SERVICES OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM OUR FUTURE SUCCESS
AND PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR MANAGEMENT AND THE BANKING
ABILITIES OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL ALSO
DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED AND
QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT. WE ARE ESPECIALLY DEPENDENT ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY
MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, MANY OF WHOM DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH US.
THE LOSS OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND KEY
PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OTHER
OFFICERS MAY NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO READILY REPLACE THESE
INDIVIDUALS. MANY OF THESE SENIOR OFFICERS HAVE PRIMARY CONTACT WITH OUR CLIENTS
AND ARE IMPORTANT IN MAINTAINING PERSONALIZED RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CLIENT
BASE. THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE KEY EMPLOYEES
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND POSSIBLY RESULT IN
REDUCED REVENUES IF WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS PROMPTLY.
COMPETITION FOR SENIOR PERSONNEL IS INTENSE, AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL. CHANGES IN KEY PERSONNEL AND THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES MAY BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

TECHNOLOGY SECURITY BREACHES AND
CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ANY COMPROMISE OF OUR SECURITY ALSO COULD
DETER OUR CLIENTS FROM USING OUR INTERNET BANKING SERVICES THAT INVOLVE THE
TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WE RELY ON STANDARD INTERNET SECURITY
SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION NECESSARY TO EFFECT SECURE
TRANSMISSION OF DATA. THESE PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PROTECT OUR SYSTEMS FROM
COMPROMISES OR BREACHES OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES THAT COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO
OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS. 

THE
FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS CONSTANTLY UNDERGOING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
WITH FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE
EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY INCREASES EFFICIENCY AND ENABLES FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO BETTER SERVICE CLIENTS AND REDUCE COSTS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS
DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS BY USING
TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WILL SATISFY CLIENT DEMANDS, AS
WELL AS CREATE ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES WITHIN OUR OPERATIONS. MANY OF OUR
COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGICAL
IMPROVEMENTS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR BE SUCCESSFUL IN MARKETING THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
TO OUR CLIENTS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT
ON OUR BUSINESS AND, IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISKS
RELATING TO OUR LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIOS WE HAVE CERTAIN LENDING
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE LOAN AND LEASE
INCOME WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK. OUR MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND APPROVES
THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON A REGULAR BASIS. A REPORTING SYSTEM SUPPLEMENTS
THE REVIEW PROCESS BY PROVIDING OUR MANAGEMENT WITH FREQUENT REPORTS RELATED TO
LOAN AND LEASE PRODUCTION, LOAN QUALITY, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT, LOAN AND
LEASE DELINQUENCIES, AND NONPERFORMING AND POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS AND LEASES.
DIVERSIFICATION IN THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIOS IS A MEANS OF MANAGING RISK
ASSOCIATED WITH FLUCTUATIONS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 

WE
MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT LOAN REVIEW DEPARTMENT THAT REVIEWS AND VALIDATES THE
CREDIT RISK PROGRAM ON A PERIODIC BASIS. RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS ARE PRESENTED
TO OUR MANAGEMENT. THE LOAN AND LEASE REVIEW PROCESS COMPLEMENTS AND REINFORCES
THE RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT DECISIONS MADE BY LENDERS AND CREDIT
PERSONNEL, AS WELL AS OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. 

IN THE
FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK THAT CERTAIN BORROWERS MAY
NOT REPAY BORROWINGS. OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES MAY NOT BE
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY INCUR. IF WE
EXPERIENCE DEFAULTS BY BORROWERS IN ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR EARNINGS COULD BE
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. CHANGES IN LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
CREDIT QUALITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR LOCAL BUSINESS LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO.
CHANGES IN NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY
OF OUR LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO AND NEGATE, TO SOME EXTENT, THE BENEFITS OF
NATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION THROUGH OUR SPECIALTY FINANCE GROUP S
PORTFOLIO.

COMMERCIAL
AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS GENERALLY INVOLVE HIGHER CREDIT RISKS THAN
RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER LOANS. BECAUSE PAYMENTS ON LOANS SECURED BY
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE OR EQUIPMENT ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESSFUL
OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, REPAYMENT OF SUCH LOANS MAY
BE INFLUENCED TO A GREAT EXTENT BY CONDITIONS IN THE MARKET OR THE ECONOMY. WE
SEEK TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS THROUGH OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. WE OBTAIN
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PERFORM CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS ON OUR CUSTOMERS. CREDIT
CRITERIA MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ASSESSMENTS OF INCOME, CASH FLOWS,
AND NET WORTH; ASSET OWNERSHIP; BANK AND TRADE CREDIT REFERENCE; CREDIT BUREAU
REPORT; AND OPERATIONAL HISTORY. 

COMMERCIAL
REAL ESTATE OR EQUIPMENT LOANS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AFTER EVALUATING AND
UNDERSTANDING THE BORROWER'S ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY AND GENERATE POSITIVE
CASH FLOWS. OUR MANAGEMENT EXAMINES CURRENT AND PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OF THE
BORROWER TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF THE BORROWER TO REPAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS
AGREED. UNDERWRITING STANDARDS ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE RELATIONSHIP BANKING
RATHER THAN TRANSACTIONAL BANKING. MOST COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS ARE
SECURED BY THE ASSETS BEING FINANCED OR OTHER BUSINESS ASSETS; HOWEVER, SOME
LOANS MAY BE MADE ON AN UNSECURED BASIS. OUR CREDIT POLICY SETS DIFFERENT
MAXIMUM EXPOSURE LIMITS BOTH BY BUSINESS SECTOR AND OUR CURRENT AND HISTORICAL
RELATIONSHIP AND PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH EACH CUSTOMER. 

WE OFFER
BOTH FIXED-RATE AND ADJUSTABLE-RATE CONSUMER MORTGAGE LOANS SECURED BY
PROPERTIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN OUR PRIMARY MARKET AREA.
ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOANS HELP REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST
RATES; HOWEVER, DURING PERIODS OF RISING INTEREST RATES, THE RISK OF DEFAULT ON
ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOANS MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF REPRICING AND THE
INCREASED PAYMENTS REQUIRED FROM THE BORROWER. ADDITIONALLY, MOST RESIDENTIAL
MORTGAGES ARE SOLD INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET AND SERVICED BY OUR PRINCIPAL
BANKING SUBSIDIARY, 1ST SOURCE BANK. 

CONSUMER
LOANS ARE PRIMARILY ALL OTHER NON-REAL ESTATE LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS IN OUR
REGIONAL MARKET AREA. CONSUMER LOANS CAN ENTAIL RISK, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE
OF LOANS THAT ARE UNSECURED OR SECURED BY RAPIDLY DEPRECIATING ASSETS. IN THESE
CASES, ANY REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL MAY NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF
REPAYMENT OF THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE. THE REMAINING DEFICIENCY OFTEN DOES
NOT WARRANT FURTHER SUBSTANTIAL COLLECTION EFFORTS AGAINST THE BORROWER BEYOND
OBTAINING A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER LOAN COLLECTIONS ARE
DEPENDENT ON THE BORROWER S CONTINUING FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND THUS ARE MORE
LIKELY TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY JOB LOSS, DIVORCE, ILLNESS, OR PERSONAL
BANKRUPTCY. 

THE 1ST
SOURCE SPECIALTY FINANCE GROUP LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF COMMERCIAL
LOANS AND LEASES SECURED BY CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
AIRCRAFT, AUTOS, TRUCKS, AND VANS. FINANCE RECEIVABLES FOR THIS GROUP GENERALLY
PROVIDE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND MAY INCLUDE PREPAYMENT PENALTY
PROVISIONS. 

OUR
CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
BY SLOW DOWNS IN THE ECONOMY. CLIENTS WHO RELY ON THE USE OF ASSETS FINANCED
THROUGH THE SPECIALTY FINANCE GROUP TO PRODUCE INCOME COULD BE NEGATIVELY
AFFECTED, AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES. BY THE
NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES THESE CLIENTS OPERATE IN, WE COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY RAPID INCREASES OF FUEL COSTS. SINCE SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS IN
THESE INDUSTRIES ARE LARGE (UP TO 25 MILLION), A SLOW DOWN COULD HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR PERFORMANCE. 

OUR
CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED
BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS CAUSED BY HIGH FUEL COSTS, TERRORIST AND OTHER POTENTIAL
ATTACKS, AND OTHER DESTABILIZING EVENTS. THESE FACTORS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE
DETERIORATION OF THE QUALITY OF OUR LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO, AS THEY COULD HAVE
A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TRAVEL SENSITIVE BUSINESSES FOR WHICH OUR SPECIALTY
FINANCE BUSINESSES PROVIDE FINANCING. 

IN
ADDITION, OUR LEASING AND EQUIPMENT FINANCING ACTIVITY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF
CYCLICAL DOWNTURNS, INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION AND CLUMPING, AND OTHER ADVERSE
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THESE INDUSTRIES AND MARKETS. THIS AREA OF
LENDING, WITH TRANSPORTATION IN PARTICULAR, IS DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION, AND TRANSPORTATION
INDUSTRIES. 

THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS
ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR OTHER
RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES,
AND WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, BROKERS AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT
BANKS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO
CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY OUR COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN
ADDITION, OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US
CANNOT BE REALIZED OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL
AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE US. ANY SUCH LOSSES COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

ADVERSE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS COULD IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 WE ARE IMPACTED BY GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED
STATES AND ABROAD. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INTEREST
RATES, INFLATION, MONEY SUPPLY, POLITICAL ISSUES, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY
CHANGES, FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS, BROAD TRENDS IN
INDUSTRY AND FINANCE, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THE
LOCAL ECONOMIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. A
DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN LOAN
DELINQUENCIES AND NON-PERFORMING ASSETS, DECREASES IN LOAN COLLATERAL VALUES AND
A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO
EXTENSIVE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION. BANKING REGULATIONS ARE
PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS' FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS
AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, NOT SECURITY HOLDERS. THESE REGULATIONS
AFFECT OUR LENDING PRACTICES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, INVESTMENT PRACTICES, DIVIDEND
POLICY AND GROWTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS. CONGRESS AND FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES
CONTINUALLY REVIEW BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES FOR POSSIBLE CHANGE.
CHANGES TO STATUTES, REGULATIONS OR REGULATORY POLICIES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN
INTERPRETATION OR IMPLEMENTATION OF STATUTES, REGULATION OR POLICIES, COULD
AFFECT US IN SUBSTANTIAL AND UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. SUCH CHANGES COULD SUBJECT US
TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMIT THE TYPES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WE
MAY OFFER. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS OR POLICIES COULD RESULT IN
SANCTIONS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES AND/OR REPUTATION
DAMAGE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY SUCH VIOLATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH
VIOLATIONS WILL NOT OCCUR. 

WE RELY ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR
SUBSIDIARIES OUR PARENT COMPANY, 1ST SOURCE CORPORATION, RECEIVES
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REVENUE FROM DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THESE
DIVIDENDS ARE THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK
AND INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUR DEBT. VARIOUS FEDERAL AND/OR STATE LAWS AND
REGULATIONS LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO OUR
PARENT COMPANY. IN THE EVENT OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE UNABLE TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR
PARENT COMPANY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE DEBT, PAY OBLIGATIONS OR PAY
DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. THE INABILITY TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS FROM OUR
SUBSIDIARIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD
IMPACT REPORTED EARNINGS CURRENT ACCOUNTING AND TAX RULES, STANDARDS,
POLICIES AND INTERPRETATIONS INFLUENCE THE METHODS BY WHICH FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT BUSINESS, IMPLEMENT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND TAX
COMPLIANCE, AND GOVERN FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURES. THESE LAWS,
REGULATIONS, RULES, STANDARDS, POLICIES AND INTERPRETATIONS ARE CONSTANTLY
EVOLVING AND MAY CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME. EVENTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A
DIRECT IMPACT ON US, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OF MAJOR U.S. COMPANIES, HAVE RESULTED
IN LEGISLATORS, REGULATORS, AND AUTHORITATIVE BODIES, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, THE PUBLIC
COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD AND VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES, RESPONDING BY
ADOPTING AND/OR PROPOSING SUBSTANTIVE REVISION TO LAWS, REGULATIONS, RULES,
STANDARDS, POLICIES AND INTERPRETATIONS. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND
VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS HAVE OCCURRED AND MAY OCCUR
IN THE FUTURE. A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT REPORTED
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

NEW ECONOMIC STABILIZATION
LEGISLATION AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAMS COULD AFFECT US
ADVERSELY THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 (THE "EESA")
IS INTENDED TO STABILIZE AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS.
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, AS TO THE LONG TERM IMPACT THAT THE EESA AND
ITS REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS WILL HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL
MARKETS. THE FAILURE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO STABILIZE AND A WORSENING OF
CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROGRAMS
ESTABLISHED OR TO BE ESTABLISHED UNDER THE EESA AND TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF
PROGRAM MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON US. WE MAY FACE INCREASED REGULATION OF OUR
INDUSTRY. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATION MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND
LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. 

OUR
PARTICIPATION IN THE TREASURY S CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE RIGHTS OF OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS
 THE TERMS OF THE
 PREFERRED STOCK WE ISSUED UNDER THE TREASURY S CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM
COULD REDUCE INVESTMENT RETURNS TO OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY RESTRICTING
DIVIDENDS, DILUTING EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, AND RESTRICTING
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT OF THE TREASURY, WE WILL
BE PROHIBITED FROM INCREASING OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS
WHILE THE TREASURY HOLDS THE PREFERRED STOCK. 

ALSO, THE
PREFERRED STOCK REQUIRES QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID AT THE RATE OF 5 PER
ANNUM FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND 9 PER ANNUM THEREAFTER UNTIL THE STOCK IS
REDEEMED BY US. THE PAYMENTS OF THESE DIVIDENDS WILL DECREASE THE EXCESS CASH WE
OTHERWISE HAVE AVAILABLE TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND TO USE FOR
GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL. 

FINALLY,
WE WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM CONTINUING TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK
UNLESS WE HAVE FULLY PAID ALL REQUIRED DIVIDENDS ON THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED
TO THE TREASURY. ALTHOUGH WE FULLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL REQUIRED
DIVIDENDS ON THE PREFERRED STOCK (AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON
STOCK AT CURRENT LEVELS), THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN
THE FUTURE. 

OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS COULD
BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN THE FUTURE WHICH WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
FUTURE EARNINGS UNDER THE FEDERAL
DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT, THE FDIC, ABSENT EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, MUST
ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO RESTORE THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE RESERVE RATIO TO
1.15 OF INSURED DEPOSITS, OVER AN EIGHT-YEAR PERIOD, AT ANY TIME THAT THE
RESERVE RATIO FALLS BELOW 1.15 . THE FDIC EXPECTS A HIGHER RATE OF INSURED
INSTITUTION FAILURES IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A CONTINUED
DECLINE IN THE RESERVE RATIO. 

AS A
MEMBER INSTITUTION OF THE FDIC, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY SEMI-ANNUAL DEPOSIT
INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENTS TO THE FDIC. DUE TO THE CONTINUED FAILURES OF FDIC
INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED. WE
ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE,
PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE
EARNINGS.

ITEM 1. 
 
 BUSINESS 
 
 GENERAL 
 
 USA TRUCK IS THE NATION S TWENTY-SIXTH LARGEST TRUCKLOAD CARRIER BASED ON 2014 OPERATING REVENUE ACCORDING TO TRANSPORT TOPICS. IN 2015, THE COMPANY GENERATED 507.9 MILLION IN OPERATING REVENUE AND 23.1 MILLION IN OPERATING INCOME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY S FLEET OF 1,832 TRACTORS WAS COMPRISED OF 1,568 COMPANY TRACTORS AND 264 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TRACTORS. THE COMPANY OWNED 6,200 TRAILERS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. 
 
 THE COMPANY TRANSPORTS COMMODITIES THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND INTO AND OUT OF PORTIONS OF CANADA. USA TRUCK ALSO TRANSPORTS GENERAL COMMODITIES INTO AND OUT OF MEXICO BY ALLOWING THROUGH-TRAILER SERVICE FROM ITS TERMINAL IN LAREDO, TEXAS. IN ADDITION TO TRUCKLOAD AND DEDICATED FREIGHT SERVICE OFFERINGS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERINGS THROUGH ITS STRATEGIC CAPACITY SOLUTIONS SCS SEGMENT. USA TRUCK IS HEADQUARTERED IN VAN BUREN, ARKANSAS, WITH TERMINALS, OFFICES, AND STAGING FACILITIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. 
 
 THE COMPANY HAS TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: (I) TRUCKING, CONSISTING OF THE COMPANY S TRUCKLOAD AND DEDICATED FREIGHT SERVICE OFFERINGS AND (II) SCS, CONSISTING OF THE COMPANY S FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERINGS. BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF THE COMPANY S RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERING AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND RAIL INTERMODAL OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY AGGREGATES ITS FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERINGS INTO A SINGLE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. 
 
 TRUCKLOAD FREIGHT SERVICES UTILIZE COMPANY-OWNED EQUIPMENT OR EQUIPMENT OWNED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR THE PICK-UP AND DELIVERY OF FREIGHT. TRUCKLOAD SERVICES TRANSPORT FREIGHT OVER IRREGULAR ROUTES AS A MEDIUM-TO LONG-HAUL COMMON CARRIER. DEDICATED FREIGHT SERVICES PROVIDES SIMILAR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, BUT DOES SO PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WHEREBY THE COMPANY MAKES EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER FOR SHIPMENTS OVER PARTICULAR ROUTES AT SPECIFIED TIMES. 
 
 SCS PROVIDES SERVICES WHICH COMPLEMENT USA TRUCK S TRUCKING SERVICES, PRIMARILY TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS OF ITS TRUCKING SEGMENT. SCS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 30 , 30 , AND 25 OF USA TRUCK S CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE IN 2015, 2014, AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN 
 
 USA TRUCK S TOP PRIORITIES REMAIN IMPROVING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND INCREASING STOCKHOLDER VALUE. THE COMPANY S LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS: PROFITABLE REVENUE, OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. DURING 2015, PROGRESS IN EXECUTING THE COMPANY S TURNAROUND PLAN HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A 160 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN VERSUS 2014, POSITIVE CASH FLOW, AND OUR MOST PROFITABLE YEAR SINCE 2006. DURING 2014, THE COMPANY ACHIEVED A 470 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING MARGIN VERSUS 2013. 
 
 PROFITABLE REVENUE: THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS FREIGHT NETWORK TOWARD A MORE EFFICIENT MIX OF LANES AND MARKETS IN ITS TRUCKLOAD BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON BETTER UTILIZATION OF COMPANY TRACTORS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON KEY METRICS, SUCH AS MILES PER SEATED TRUCK PER WEEK AND BASE TRUCKING REVENUE PER SEATED TRUCK PER WEEK. BASE TRUCKING REVENUE PER SEATED TRUCK PER WEEK IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY 2.7 DURING 2015, COMPARED TO 2014. 
 
 OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. DURING 2015, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES FOR FUEL, MAINTENANCE, INTEREST AND DEBT COSTS, AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS REQUIRING COST CONTAINMENT. DURING 2015, THE COMPANY TOOK STEPS TO STREAMLINE AND SIMPLIFY ITS OPERATIONS TO BETTER ALIGN THE COMPANY S COST STRUCTURE AND BETTER SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS. IN THE COMPANY S TRUCKING SEGMENT, THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS MAINTENANCE FACILITIES IN DENTON, TEXAS AND CARLISLE, PENNSYLVANIA. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY BEGAN TO OUTSOURCE ITS ROAD ASSISTANCE FUNCTION TO A THIRD PARTY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015. THESE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE OPERATING PRODUCTIVITY AND ENHANCE CAPACITY UTILIZATION. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY 2.7 MILLION (PRETAX) IN RESTRUCTURING, SEVERANCE AND RELATED CHARGES. GOING FORWARD, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXECUTION INITIATIVES THAT IT BELIEVES WILL IMPROVE SAFETY PERFORMANCE, ASSET PRODUCTIVITY, DRIVER RETENTION, FUEL ECONOMY, MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN EXECUTING ITS TURNAROUND PLAN IN 2015. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY IS WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPLETE THE TURNAROUND PLAN OF ITS TRUCKING SEGMENT AND GENERATE LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY. TO INCREASE STOCKHOLDER VALUE IN 2016, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EVOLVE FROM THE STATED GOAL OF SUSTAINED PROFITABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND INCREASE THE COMPANY S RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. 
 
 OPERATIONS 
 
 THE COMPANY FOCUSES SIGNIFICANT MARKETING EFFORTS ON CUSTOMERS WITH PREMIUM SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND WHO HAVE CONSISTENT SHIPPING NEEDS WITHIN USA TRUCK S PRIMARY OPERATING AREAS WHICH ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOCATED IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY S SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE MARKETED TO CUSTOMERS, WITH OVER 90 OF THE COMPANY S TOP 100 CUSTOMERS UTILIZING MORE THAN ONE SERVICE IN 2015. THIS PERMITS THE STRATEGIC POSITIONING OF AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT AND ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE ITS CUSTOMERS WITH A FULL ARRAY OF TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION, USA TRUCK TEAM MEMBERS HAVE CULTIVATED A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF SHIPPERS IN KEY INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS HELPS IT DEVELOP LONG-TERM, SERVICE-ORIENTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. 
 
 USA TRUCK HAS A DIVERSIFIED FREIGHT AND CUSTOMER BASE. DURING 2015, THE COMPANY S LARGEST 5, 10, 25 AND 50 CUSTOMERS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 27 , 38 , 57 AND 71 OF ITS REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY. NO SINGLE CUSTOMER GENERATED MORE THAN 10 OF THE COMPANY S REVENUES IN 2015. THE COMPANY PROVIDED SERVICE TO MORE THAN 900 CUSTOMERS IN 2015 ACROSS ALL USA TRUCK SERVICE OFFERINGS. 
 
 WHILE THE COMPANY PREFERS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, OBTAINING SHIPMENTS THROUGH OTHER PROVIDERS OF TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES IS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY. SECURING FREIGHT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY ENABLES USA TRUCK TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR HIGH-VOLUME SHIPPERS TO WHICH IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE SHIPPERS REQUIRE THEIR CARRIERS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH THEIR DESIGNATED THIRD PARTY LOGISTICS PROVIDER. 
 
 CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED AT OR SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY AND, DURING 2015, RECEIVABLES COLLECTION AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 38 DAYS FROM THE BILLING DATE, COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 44 DAYS AND 40 DAYS DURING 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN DAYS TO COLLECTION HAS RESULTED FROM VARIOUS INITIATIVES INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE COMPANY S BILLING PROCEDURES, AN INCREASED FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS WITH AGED RECEIVABLES, IMPROVING COMMUNICATION WITH CUSTOMERS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN THE COMPANY S INTERNAL COLLECTION PROCESS. 
 
 THE COMPANY PRIMARILY OPERATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OPERATES IN MEXICO AND CANADA. MOST OF THE COMPANY S OPERATING REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013 APPROXIMATELY 8 , 10 AND 10 , RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY S OPERATING REVENUE WAS GENERATED IN MEXICO AND CANADA. ALL COMPANY TRACTORS ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT SEPARATELY TRACK DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LONG-LIVED ASSETS. PROVIDING SUCH INFORMATION WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL TO THE BUSINESS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY S LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE, AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
 THE COMPANY S TRUCKING SEGMENT IS SUPPORTED PRIMARILY BY DRIVER MANAGERS, LOAD PLANNERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES. THESE TEAMS MONITOR THE LOCATION OF EQUIPMENT AND DIRECT ITS MOVEMENT IN A SAFE, EFFICIENT AND PRACTICABLE MANNER. EACH DRIVER MANAGER SUPERVISES ASSIGNED DRIVERS AND IS THE PRIMARY CONTACT WITH THE DRIVERS. LOAD PLANNERS ASSIGN ALL AVAILABLE UNITS AND LOADS IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT AND MINIMIZE COSTS. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES WORK TO FULFILL SHIPPERS NEEDS, SOLICIT FREIGHT, AND ENSURE ON-TIME DELIVERY BY MONITORING LOADS. THE COMPANY MAKES TRUCKS AVAILABLE FOR DISPATCH, SELECTING PROFITABLE FREIGHT WITH A NETWORK AND YIELD MANAGEMENT FOCUS, AND EFFICIENTLY MATCHES THAT FREIGHT TO AVAILABLE TRUCK CAPACITY, ALL OF WHICH THE COMPANY STRIVES TO ACHIEVE WITHOUT SACRIFICING CUSTOMER SERVICE, EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION, DRIVER RETENTION OR SAFETY. 
 
 THE SCS SEGMENT HAS A NETWORK OF 13 BRANCH OFFICES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. THE BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT AROUND THE CAPABILITIES OF COMPANY TEAM MEMBERS TO MAKE AVAILABLE CONSISTENT SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. THE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS OF BRANCH OFFICES ARE SELECTED FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF TALENT IN THOSE MARKETS. SCS EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. MOST OF THE SCS TEAM INTERACTS DIRECTLY WITH CUSTOMERS, MATCHING CUSTOMERS FREIGHT NEEDS WITH AVAILABLE THIRD PARTY CAPACITY IN THE MARKETPLACE. SCS ALSO HAS STAFF THAT SCREEN AND SELECT THIRD PARTY CARRIERS THAT ARE USED TO TRANSPORT THE FREIGHT.

 EXCLUDES 264 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TRACTORS. 
 
 THE COMPANY S EQUIPMENT PURCHASE AND REPLACEMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING NEW EQUIPMENT PRICES, THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, DEMAND FOR FREIGHT SERVICES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, COST PER MILE, FUEL EFFICIENCY, EQUIPMENT DURABILITY, EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND DRIVER COMFORT. THEREFORE, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY MAY ACCELERATE OR DELAY THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF ITS TRACTORS OR TRAILERS FROM TIME TO TIME. GENERALLY, USA TRUCK S PRIMARY BUSINESS STRATEGY OF FULLY LEVERAGING THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE CURRENT FLEET OF TRACTORS AND TRAILERS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO STRIVE TO MAXIMIZE THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS EXISTING ASSETS BEFORE CONSIDERING A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE FLEET SIZE. 
 
 DURING 2015, THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK AN INITIATIVE TO DOWNSIZE THE TRACTOR FLEET, RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 400 TRACTORS AS THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON ITS NETWORK, CUSTOMER PROFITABILITY AND REDUCE ITS UNSENTED TRACTORS IN ITS TRUCKING SEGMENT. GOALS OF THIS INITIATIVE WERE TO FURTHER IMPROVE FUEL ECONOMY, REDUCE MAINTENANCE COSTS AND IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY S EQUIPMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS DRIVERS AND CUSTOMERS. 
 
 TO SIMPLIFY DRIVER AND MECHANIC TRAINING, CONTROL THE COST OF SPARE PARTS AND TIRE INVENTORY AND PROVIDE FOR A MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY PURCHASES TRACTORS AND TRAILERS MANUFACTURED TO ITS SPECIFICATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE EQUIPMENT DOWNTIME AND ENHANCE SALE OR TRADE-IN VALUES. 
 
 THE COMPANY FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT THROUGH ITS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, CAPITAL LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR MARKET VALUE LEASE AGREEMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OR TRADES OF USED EQUIPMENT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY S TRACTORS AND TRAILERS ARE PLEDGED TO SECURE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
 DURING 2015, ALL COMPANY AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TRACTORS WERE EQUIPPED WITH PEOPLENET IN-CAB TECHNOLOGY, ENABLING TWO-WAY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS DRIVERS, THROUGH BOTH STANDARDIZED AND FREEFORM MESSAGING, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC LOGGING. THIS ENABLES USA TRUCK TO DISPATCH DRIVERS EFFICIENTLY IN RESPONSE TO CUSTOMERS REQUESTS, TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INFORMATION TO CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THEIR SHIPMENTS AND TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTING VARIOUS ACCESSORIAL CHARGES. ACCESSORIAL COSTS ARE CHARGES TO CUSTOMERS FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES SUCH AS LOADING, UNLOADING OR EQUIPMENT DELAYS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES SATELLITE-BASED EQUIPMENT TRACKING DEVICES AND CARGO SENSORS ON VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS TRAILERS. THESE TRACKING DEVICES PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH VISIBILITY ON THE LOCATIONS AND LOAD STATUS OF ITS TRAILERS. 
 
 SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES SAFE WORK HABITS AS A CORE VALUE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION, AND PROVIDES PROACTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION RELATING TO SAFETY CONCEPTS, PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS PRE-EMPLOYMENT, RANDOM, REASONABLE SUSPICION AND POST-ACCIDENT ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DOT REGULATIONS AND THE COMPANY S OWN POLICIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

SAFETY TRAINING FOR NEW DRIVERS BEGINS IN ORIENTATION, WHEN NEWLY HIRED TEAM MEMBERS ARE TAUGHT SAFE DRIVING AND WORK TECHNIQUES THAT EMPHASIZE THE COMPANY S COMMITMENT TO SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF ORIENTATION, NEW STUDENT DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERGO ON-THE-ROAD TRAINING FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS WITH EXPERIENCED COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND COMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND WHO ARE TRAINED TO COMMUNICATE SAFE DRIVING TECHNIQUES TO NEW DRIVERS. NEW DRIVERS WHO GRADUATE FROM THE PROGRAM MUST ALSO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE POST-TRAINING CLASSROOM AND ROAD TESTING BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED TO THEIR OWN TRACTOR. ADDITIONALLY, ALL COMPANY DRIVERS PARTICIPATE IN ON-GOING TRAINING THAT FOCUSES ON COLLISION AND INJURY PREVENTION, AMONG OTHER SAFETY CONCEPTS. 
 
 THE PRIMARY RISKS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS INSURED ARE CARGO LOSS AND DAMAGE, LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE MEDICAL EXPENSES. USA TRUCK ALSO SELF-INSURES FOR A PORTION OF CLAIMS EXPOSURE IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. THE COMPANY S SELF-INSURANCE RETENTION LEVELS ARE 0.5 MILLION FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS PER OCCURRENCE, 0.05 MILLION FOR CARGO LOSS AND DAMAGE CLAIMS PER OCCURRENCE AND 1.0 MILLION FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS PER OCCURRENCE. FOR MEDICAL BENEFITS, THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES UP TO 0.25 MILLION PER PLAN PARTICIPANT PER YEAR WITH AN AGGREGATE CLAIM EXPOSURE LIMIT DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY S YEAR-TO-DATE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF COVERED TEAM MEMBERS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INSURANCE ABOVE THE AMOUNTS FOR WHICH IT SELF-INSURES, TO CERTAIN LIMITS, WITH LICENSED INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY HAS EXCESS GENERAL, AUTO AND EMPLOYER S LIABILITY COVERAGE IN AMOUNTS SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING MINIMUM LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY IS COMPLETELY SELF-INSURED FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO ITS OWN TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, EXCEPT THAT THE COMPANY CARRIES CATASTROPHIC PHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE TO PROTECT AGAINST NATURAL DISASTERS. 
 
 ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AGGREGATE INSURANCE LIMITS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER REASONABLY EXPECTED CLAIMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE CLAIMS COULD EXCEED THE COMPANY S AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS. AN UNEXPECTED LOSS OR CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE MARKET COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREMIUM LEVELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY S INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COULD INCREASE, OR USA TRUCK COULD RAISE ITS SELF-INSURED RETENTION OR DECREASE THE COMPANY S AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS WHEN ITS POLICIES ARE RENEWED OR REPLACED. IF THESE COSTS INCREASE, IF RESERVES ARE INCREASED, IF CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF COVERAGE LIMITS ARE EXPERIENCED, OR IF A CLAIM IS EXPERIENCED WHERE COVERAGE IS NOT PROVIDED, THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ANY ONE QUARTER OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 TEAM MEMBERS 
 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 2,300 TEAM MEMBERS, OF WHICH ABOUT 73 WERE COMPANY DRIVERS. NO TEAM MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO UNION CONTRACTS OR PART OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES TEAM MEMBER RELATIONS TO BE GOOD. 
 
 RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION OF A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER WORKFORCE, THE COMPANY S MOST VALUABLE ASSET, ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY S CONTINUED GROWTH AND MEETING THE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. USA TRUCK HIRES QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS WHO HOLD A VALID COMMERCIAL DRIVER S LICENSE, SATISFY APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE SAFETY PERFORMANCE AND MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS, AND MEET USA TRUCK S HIRING PARAMETERS. THESE GUIDELINES RELATE PRIMARILY TO SAFETY HISTORY, ROAD TEST EVALUATIONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER EVALUATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND MANDATORY DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING. IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SAFE DRIVERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SAFETY, THE COMPANY FOCUSES ITS OPERATIONS FOR DRIVERS AROUND A COLLABORATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE TEAM ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY PROVIDES COMFORTABLE, LATE MODEL EQUIPMENT, DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT, COMPETITIVE WAGES AND BENEFITS, AND OTHER INCENTIVES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE DRIVER SAFETY, RETENTION, AND LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT. THE COMPANY VALUES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DRIVERS AND STRUCTURES ITS DRIVER RETENTION MODEL WITH A FOCUS ON A LONG-TERM CAREER WITH USA TRUCK. DRIVERS ARE COMPENSATED ON A PER MILE BASIS, BASED ON THE LENGTH OF HAUL AND A PREDETERMINED NUMBER OF MILES. DRIVERS ARE ALSO COMPENSATED FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS. DRIVERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANY S 401(K) PROGRAM, AND COMPANY-SPONSORED HEALTH, LIFE, AND DENTAL PLANS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE FACTORS HELP IN ATTRACTING, RECRUITING, AND RETAINING PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS IN A COMPETITIVE DRIVER MARKET. 
 
 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 
 
 IN ADDITION TO COMPANY DRIVERS, USA TRUCK ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, WHO PROVIDE A TRACTOR AND A DRIVER AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OPERATING EXPENSES IN EXCHANGE FOR A FIXED PAYMENT PER MILE. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE USE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD CONTRACTS WITH 264 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 28 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

COMPETITION 
 
 THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY INCLUDES BOTH PRIVATE FLEETS AND FOR-HIRE CARRIERS. PRIVATE FLEETS CONSIST OF TRUCKS OWNED AND OPERATED BY SHIPPERS THAT MOVE THEIR OWN GOODS. FOR-HIRE CARRIERS INCLUDE BOTH TRUCKLOAD AND LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD OPERATIONS. THE FOR-HIRE SEGMENT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES THOUSANDS OF CARRIERS, NONE OF WHICH DOMINATES THE MARKET. THIS SEGMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY MANY SMALL CARRIERS HAVING REVENUES OF LESS THAN 1 MILLION PER YEAR AND AS FEW AS ONE TRUCK AND RELATIVELY FEW CARRIERS WITH REVENUES EXCEEDING 100 MILLION PER YEAR. 
 
 USA TRUCK COMPETES PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS, PRIVATE FLEETS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, RAILROADS AND LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS. A NUMBER OF TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES, OWN MORE REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND CARRY A LARGER VOLUME OF FREIGHT THAN USA TRUCK. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE TRUCKLOAD SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY ARE SERVICE AND PRICE, WITH RATE DISCOUNTING BECOMING PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. USA TRUCK S FOCUS IS TO DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF SERVICE RATHER THAN RATES. ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE MARKET WOULD BENEFIT ALL TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUCCESSFUL CARRIERS ARE LIKELY TO GROW BY OFFERING ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BASED ON CUSTOMER NEEDS AND ACQUIRING A GREATER MARKET SHARE. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
 
 EPA REGULATIONS LIMITING EXHAUST EMISSIONS BECAME MORE RESTRICTIVE IN 2010. IN 2010, AN EXECUTIVE MEMORANDUM WAS SIGNED DIRECTING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION NHTSA AND THE EPA TO DEVELOP NEW, STRICTER FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR HEAVY TRUCKS. IN 2011, THE NHTSA AND THE EPA ADOPTED FINAL RULES THAT ESTABLISHED THE FIRST-EVER FUEL ECONOMY AND GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS FOR MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES. THESE STANDARDS APPLY TO MODEL YEARS 2014 TO 2018, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE AN APPROXIMATE 20 PERCENT REDUCTION IN FUEL CONSUMPTION BY 2018, AND EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR GALLONS OF FUEL FOR EVERY 100 MILES TRAVELED. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2014, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL BEGIN DEVELOPING THE NEXT PHASE OF TIGHTER FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES AND DIRECTED THE EPA AND NHTSA TO DEVELOP NEW FUEL EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS BY MARCH 31, 2016. IN RESPONSE, IN JUNE 2015, THE EPA AND NHTSA JOINTLY PROPOSED NEW STRICTER STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO TRAILERS BEGINNING WITH MODEL YEAR 2018 AND TRACTORS BEGINNING WITH MODEL YEAR 2021. AFTER AN EXTENDED COMMENT PERIOD ENDING IN OCTOBER 2015, A FINAL RULE HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED. IF THIS RULE OR A SIMILAR RULE WAS ENACTED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED NEW TRACTOR PRICES AND ADDITIONAL PARTS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS INCURRED TO RETROFIT ITS TRACTORS WITH TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT OFFSET BY POTENTIAL FUEL SAVINGS. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT, HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH ITS OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE IMPACTED. 
 
 THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD CARB ALSO HAS ADOPTED EMISSION CONTROL REGULATIONS WHICH WILL BE APPLICABLE TO ALL HEAVY-DUTY TRACTORS THAT PULL 53-FOOT OR LONGER BOX-TYPE TRAILERS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE TRACTORS AND TRAILERS SUBJECT TO THESE REGULATIONS MUST BE EITHER EPA SMART WAY CERTIFIED OR EQUIPPED WITH LOW-ROLLING, RESISTANCE TIRES AND RETROFITTED WITH SMART WAY-APPROVED AERODYNAMIC TECHNOLOGIES. ENFORCEMENT OF THESE CARB REGULATIONS FOR MODEL YEAR 2011 EQUIPMENT BEGAN IN 2010 AND WILL BE PHASED IN OVER SEVERAL YEARS FOR OLDER EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY PURCHASES SMART WAY CERTIFIED EQUIPMENT IN ITS NEW TRACTOR AND TRAILER ACQUISITIONS. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWMAKERS ALSO HAVE PROPOSED POTENTIAL LIMITS ON CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF OTHER CLIMATE-CHANGE PROPOSALS. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF NEW TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, MAY REQUIRE USA TRUCK TO RETROFIT ITS EQUIPMENT, AND COULD IMPAIR EQUIPMENT PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASE THE COMPANY S OPERATING EXPENSES. THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS, COMBINED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE RELIABILITY OF THE NEWLY DESIGNED DIESEL ENGINES AND THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF THESE VEHICLES, COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE USA TRUCK S OPERATING EXPENSES OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS. 
 
 OTHER REGULATION 
 
 THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED AND LICENSED BY VARIOUS UNITED STATES FEDERAL AND STATE, CANADIAN PROVINCIAL, AND MEXICAN FEDERAL AGENCIES. INTERSTATE MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SAFETY REQUIREMENTS PRESCRIBED BY THE DOT. MATTERS SUCH AS WEIGHT AND EQUIPMENT DIMENSIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION AND CANADIAN PROVINCIAL REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE DOT, IN VARIOUS CANADIAN PROVINCES PURSUANT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE MINISTRIES OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS IN SUCH PROVINCES, AND WITHIN MEXICO PURSUANT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY SECRETARIA DE COMUNICACIONES Y TRANSPORTES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IT IS SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS UNITED STATES COMPANIES AND THEIR INTERMEDIARIES FROM BRIBING FOREIGN OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING FAVORABLE TREATMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE DOT, THROUGH THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (THE FMCSA ), IMPOSES SAFETY AND FITNESS REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS DRIVERS, INCLUDING RULES THAT RESTRICT DRIVER HOURS-OF-SERVICE. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FMCSA PUBLISHED ITS 2011 HOURS-OF-SERVICE FINAL RULE (THE 2011 RULE ). THE 2011 RULE REQUIRES DRIVERS TO TAKE 30-MINUTE BREAKS AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF CONSECUTIVE DRIVING AND REDUCES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS A DRIVER IS PERMITTED TO WORK DURING EACH WEEK FROM 82 HOURS TO 70 HOURS. THE 2011 RULE PROVIDES THAT THE 34-HOUR RESTART MAY ONLY BE USED ONCE PER WEEK AND MUST INCLUDE TWO REST PERIODS BETWEEN ONE A.M. AND FIVE A.M. (TOGETHER, THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS ). THESE RULE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2013. 
 
 IN DECEMBER 2014, THE 2015 OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEGISLATION PROVIDED TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS, AND ESSENTIALLY REVERTED BACK TO THE MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD 34-HOUR RESTART RULE THAT WAS IN EFFECT BEFORE THE 2011 RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE. IN 2016, CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO CONSIDER A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE FMCSA RELATED TO THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS. CONGRESSIONAL ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY COULD RESULT IN A REINSTATEMENT OR CONTINUED SUSPENSION OF THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS. IF THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS ARE REINSTATED, THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN PRODUCTION SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED DURING 2013 AND 2014 WHEN THE 2011 RESTART RESTRICTIONS WERE IN EFFECT. 
 
 THERE ARE TWO METHODS OF EVALUATING THE SAFETY AND FITNESS OF CARRIERS. THE FIRST METHOD IS THE APPLICATION OF A SAFETY RATING THAT IS BASED ON AN ONSITE INVESTIGATION AND AFFECTS A CARRIER S ABILITY TO OPERATE IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS A SATISFACTORY DOT SAFETY RATING UNDER THIS METHOD, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE RATING UNDER THE CURRENT SAFETY RATING SCALE. IF USA TRUCK WERE TO RECEIVE A CONDITIONAL OR UNSATISFACTORY DOT SAFETY RATING, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, AS SOME OF ITS EXISTING CUSTOMER CONTRACTS REQUIRE A SATISFACTORY DOT SAFETY RATING. IN JANUARY 2016, THE FMCSA PUBLISHED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING OUTLINING A REVISED SAFETY RATING MEASUREMENT SYSTEM, WHICH WOULD REPLACE THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULES, THE CURRENT THREE SAFETY RATINGS OF SATISFACTORY, CONDITIONAL, AND UNSATISFACTORY WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A SINGLE SAFETY RATING OF UNFIT. MOREOVER, DATA FROM ROADSIDE INSPECTIONS AND THE RESULTS FROM ALL INVESTIGATIONS WOULD BE USED TO DETERMINE A CARRIER S FITNESS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS WOULD REPLACE THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY OF DETERMINING A CARRIER S FITNESS BASED SOLELY ON INFREQUENT COMPREHENSIVE ONSITE REVIEWS. THE PROPOSED RULES WILL UNDERGO A 90-DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD, AFTER WHICH, A FINAL RULE COULD EITHER BE PUBLISHED OR BECOME SUBJECT TO FURTHER LEGISLATIVE REVIEWS AND DELAYS. THEREFORE, IT IS UNCERTAIN IF OR WHEN THESE PROPOSED RULES COULD TAKE EFFECT. 
 
 IN ADDITION TO THE SAFETY RATING SYSTEM, THE FMCSA HAS ADOPTED THE COMPLIANCE SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY PROGRAM CSA AS AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE MODEL THAT EVALUATES AND RANKS FLEETS ON CERTAIN SAFETY-RELATED STANDARDS. THE CSA PROGRAM ANALYZES DATA FROM ROADSIDE INSPECTIONS, MOVING VIOLATIONS, CRASH REPORTS FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND INVESTIGATION RESULTS. THE DATA IS ORGANIZED INTO SEVEN CATEGORIES. CARRIERS ARE GROUPED BY CATEGORY WITH OTHER CARRIERS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SAFETY EVENTS (E.G., CRASHES, INSPECTIONS, OR VIOLATIONS) AND CARRIERS ARE RANKED AND ASSIGNED A RATING PERCENTILE TO PRIORITIZE THEM FOR INTERVENTIONS IF THEY ARE ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. CURRENTLY, THESE SCORES DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON A CARRIER S SAFETY RATING. HOWEVER, THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFAVORABLE SCORES IN ONE OR MORE CATEGORIES MAY (I) AFFECT DRIVER RECRUITING AND RETENTION BY CAUSING HIGH-QUALITY DRIVERS TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT WITH OTHER CARRIERS, (II) CAUSE USA TRUCK S CUSTOMERS TO DIRECT THEIR BUSINESS AWAY FROM THE COMPANY AND TO CARRIERS WITH HIGHER FLEET SAFETY RANKINGS, (III) SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO AN INCREASE IN COMPLIANCE REVIEWS AND ROADSIDE INSPECTIONS, OR (IV) CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR GREATER THAN EXPECTED EXPENSES IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE UNFAVORABLE SCORES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 UNDER CSA, THESE SCORES WERE INITIALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN FIVE OF THE SEVEN CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, PURSUANT TO THE FAST ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER 2015, THE FMCSA IS REQUIRED TO REMOVE FROM PUBLIC VIEW THE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE CSA SCORES WHILE IT REVIEWS THE RELIABILITY OF THE SCORING SYSTEM. DURING THIS PERIOD OF REVIEW BY THE FMCSA, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ITS OWN SCORES AND WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO INTERVENTION BY THE FMCSA WHEN SUCH SCORES ARE ABOVE THE INTERVENTION THRESHOLDS. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING THE ESTABLISHED INTERVENTION THRESHOLDS IN ONE OF THE SEVEN CATEGORIES OF CSA, IN COMPARISON TO ITS PEER GROUP; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING WITH THE DOT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE IMPROVEMENT OF SCORES IN ALL SEVEN CATEGORIES WITH ONGOING REVIEWS OF ALL SAFETY-RELATED POLICIES, PROGRAMS AND PROCEDURES FOR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. 
 
 IN 2011, THE FMCSA ISSUED NEW RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE NEARLY ALL CARRIERS, INCLUDING USA TRUCK, TO INSTALL AND USE ELECTRONIC ON-BOARD RECORDING DEVICES EOBRS, NOW REFERRED TO AS ELECTRONIC LOGGING DEVICES, OR ELDS IN THEIR TRACTORS TO ELECTRONICALLY MONITOR TRUCK MILES AND ENFORCE HOURS-OF-SERVICE. THESE RULES, HOWEVER, WERE VACATED BY THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN AUGUST 2011. THE FINAL RULE RELATED TO MANDATORY USE OF ELDS WAS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2015, AND REQUIRES THE USE OF ELDS BY NEARLY ALL CARRIERS BY DECEMBER 10, 2017. THE COMPANY HAS PROACTIVELY INSTALLED ELDS ON 100 OF ITS TRACTOR FLEET.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS, FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT VARIOUS SECURITY MEASURES, INCLUDING CHECKPOINTS AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE TRUCKS. THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (THE TSA HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE DETERMINATION BY THE TSA THAT EACH DRIVER WHO APPLIES FOR OR RENEWS HIS LICENSE FOR CARRYING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IS NOT A SECURITY THREAT. THIS COULD REDUCE THE POOL OF QUALIFIED DRIVERS, WHICH COULD REQUIRE USA TRUCK TO INCREASE DRIVER COMPENSATION, LIMIT FLEET GROWTH, OR ALLOW TRUCKS TO SIT IDLE. THESE REGULATIONS ALSO COULD COMPLICATE THE SUCCESSFUL PAIRING OF AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SHIPMENTS, THEREBY INCREASING THE COMPANY S RESPONSE TIME AND DEADHEAD MILES ON CUSTOMER SHIPMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY MAY FAIL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MAY INCUR INCREASED EXPENSES. 
 
 IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FMCSA PUBLISHED ITS FINAL RULE RELATED TO DRIVER COERCION, WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY 29, 2016. UNDER THIS RULE, CARRIERS, SHIPPERS, RECEIVERS, OR TRANSPORTATION INTERMEDIARIES THAT ARE FOUND TO HAVE COERCED DRIVERS TO VIOLATE CERTAIN FMCSA REGULATIONS (INCLUDING HOURS-OF-SERVICE RULES) MAY BE FINED UP TO 16,000 FOR EACH OFFENSE. THE FMCSA AND CERTAIN LEGISLATORS HAVE PROPOSED OTHER RULES THAT MAY BE PUBLISHED AS EARLY AS 2016, INCLUDING (I) THE USE OF SPEED LIMITING DEVICES ON HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TO RESTRICT MAXIMUM SPEEDS, (II) THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE SO EMPLOYERS AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS COULD QUERY TO DETERMINE IF CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE DRIVERS HAVE HAD ANY DRUG/ALCOHOL POSITIVES OR REFUSALS, AND (III) AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWABLE LENGTH OF TWIN TRAILERS FROM 28 FEET TO 33 FEET. IF THESE RULES TAKE EFFECT, THEY COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN FLEET PRODUCTION, DRIVER AVAILABILITY, AND FREIGHT TONNAGE AVAILABLE TO FULL TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT USA TRUCK S BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS. 
 
 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, REFER TO THE RISK FACTORS SECTION UNDER PART 1, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, REVENUE HAS HISTORICALLY FOLLOWED A SEASONAL PATTERN FOR VARIOUS COMMODITIES AND CUSTOMER BUSINESSES. PEAK FREIGHT DEMAND HAS HISTORICALLY OCCURRED IN THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. AFTER THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON AND DURING THE REMAINING WINTER MONTHS, FREIGHT VOLUMES ARE TYPICALLY LOWER AS MANY CUSTOMERS REDUCE SHIPMENT LEVELS. OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN THE WINTER MONTHS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASED FUEL EFFICIENCY, INCREASED COLD WEATHER-RELATED MAINTENANCE COSTS OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND INCREASED INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO ADVERSE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ATTEMPTED AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF SEASONALITY THROUGH ITS DIVERSE CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS BY SEEKING ADDITIONAL FREIGHT FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS DURING TRADITIONALLY SLOWER SHIPPING PERIODS AND FOCUSING ON TRANSPORTING CONSUMER NONDURABLE PRODUCTS. REVENUE CAN AND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY WEATHER, HOLIDAYS AND THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS DAYS THAT OCCUR DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, AS REVENUE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AVAILABLE WORKING DAYS OF SHIPPERS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE HEREIN BECAUSE SUCH STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY TO THE DATE THEY WERE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION OR DUTY TO REVISE OR UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN TO REFLECT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS. ALSO REFER TO THE CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN PART I OF THIS FORM 10-K. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL ECONOMIC, CREDIT, AND BUSINESS FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT ARE LARGELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE FACTORS ARE ECONOMIC CHANGES THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN TRANSPORTATION MARKETS, INCLUDING RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC CYCLES, SUCH AS THE PERIOD FROM 2007 TO 2009, AND THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING SUCH SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN 2016; CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS INVENTORY LEVELS AND IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FOR THEIR WORKING CAPITAL; EXCESS TRACTOR CAPACITY IN COMPARISON WITH SHIPPING DEMAND; AND DOWNTURNS IN CUSTOMERS BUSINESS CYCLES. 
 
 WE ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC CYCLES, SUCH AS THE PERIOD FROM 2007 TO 2009. SUCH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN DECREASE FREIGHT DEMAND AND INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AVAILABLE TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, THEREBY EXERTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON RATES AND EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR OUR SERVICES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE HEIGHTENED WHEN THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY IS WEAKENED. SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS DURING SUCH TIMES, THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DURING PRIOR RECESSIONARY PERIODS, ARE AS FOLLOWS: REDUCTION IN OVERALL FREIGHT LEVELS, WHICH MAY IMPAIR ASSET UTILIZATION; CUSTOMERS FACING CREDIT ISSUES AND CASH FLOW PROBLEMS THAT MAY LEAD TO PAYMENT DELAYS, INCREASED CREDIT RISK, BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS THAT COULD RESULT IN EVEN LOWER FREIGHT DEMAND AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; CHANGING FREIGHT PATTERNS AS SUPPLY CHAINS ARE REDESIGNED, RESULTING IN AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN CAPACITY AND FREIGHT DEMAND; CUSTOMERS BIDDING OUR FREIGHT OR SELECTING COMPETITORS THAT OFFER LOWER RATES FROM AMONG EXISTING CHOICES IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOWER COSTS, IN WHICH CASE, WE MAY BE FORCED TO LOWER RATES OR LOSE FREIGHT; ACCEPTING MORE FREIGHT FROM BROKERS, WHERE FREIGHT RATES ARE TYPICALLY LOWER, OR INCURRENCE OF MORE NON-REVENUE MILES TO OBTAIN LOADS; AND LACK OF ACCESS TO CURRENT SOURCES OF CREDIT OR LACK OF LENDER ACCESS TO CAPITAL, LEADING TO AN INABILITY TO SECURE FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, OR AT ALL. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASES IN COSTS AND OTHER EVENTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUCH COST INCREASES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, FUEL AND ENERGY PRICES, TAXES AND INTEREST RATES, TOLLS, LICENSE AND REGISTRATION FEES, INSURANCE PREMIUMS, REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND RELATED MAINTENANCE COSTS, AND HEALTHCARE AND OTHER BENEFITS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE AFFECTED BY STRIKES OR OTHER WORK STOPPAGES AT OUR SERVICE CENTERS OR AT CUSTOMER, PORT, BORDER, OR OTHER SHIPPING LOCATIONS. CHANGING IMPACTS OF REGULATORY MEASURES COULD IMPAIR OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY, DECREASE OUR OPERATING REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY, AND RESULT IN HIGHER OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, DECLINES IN THE RESALE VALUE OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS. FROM TIME TO TIME, VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL TAXES ALSO INCREASE, INCLUDING TAXES ON FUELS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR IN WHAT FORM, ANY SUCH INCREASE APPLICABLE TO US WILL BE ENACTED, BUT SUCH AN INCREASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FUEL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, OR HOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE COULD BE AFFECTED BY ACTUAL OR THREATENED ARMED CONFLICTS OR TERRORIST ATTACKS, GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM, MILITARY ACTION AGAINST A FOREIGN STATE OR GROUP LOCATED IN A FOREIGN STATE, OR HEIGHTENED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. ENHANCED SECURITY MEASURES COULD IMPAIR OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY AND RESULT IN HIGHER OPERATING COSTS. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS DOWNWARD PRICING PRESSURES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OTHER CARRIERS. 
 
 NUMEROUS COMPETITIVE FACTORS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE: 

WE COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS OF VARYING SIZES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, WITH LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS AND RAILROADS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT OR GREATER CAPITAL RESOURCES, OR OTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. 

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS PERIODICALLY REDUCE THEIR FREIGHT RATES TO GAIN BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF REDUCED ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE FREIGHT RATES, MAINTAIN OUR MARGINS, OR MAINTAIN GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESS. 

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO OPERATE THEIR OWN PRIVATE TRUCKING FLEETS, AND THEY MAY DECIDE TO TRANSPORT MORE OF THEIR OWN FREIGHT. 

MANY CUSTOMERS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CARRIERS THEY USE BY SELECTING SO-CALLED CORE CARRIERS AS APPROVED SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND IN SOME INSTANCES WE MAY NOT BE SELECTED. 

MANY CUSTOMERS PERIODICALLY ACCEPT BIDS FROM MULTIPLE CARRIERS FOR THEIR SHIPPING NEEDS, AND THIS PROCESS MAY DEPRESS FREIGHT RATES OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF OUR BUSINESS TO COMPETITORS. 

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY MAY CREATE LARGE CARRIERS WITH GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND OTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES RELATING TO THEIR SIZE, AND WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH THESE LARGER CARRIERS. 

ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY REQUIRE INCREASED INVESTMENTS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, AND OUR CUSTOMERS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO ACCEPT HIGHER FREIGHT RATES TO COVER THE COST OF THESE INVESTMENTS. 

COMPETITION FROM NON-ASSET-BASED AND OTHER LOGISTICS AND FREIGHT BROKERAGE COMPANIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND FREIGHT RATES. 

ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT MAY BE PASSED ON TO SMALLER CARRIERS BY PROCUREMENT AGGREGATION PROVIDERS MAY IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH US. 

OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS. A DEFAULT COULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF ALL OR PART OF ANY OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 IN FEBRUARY 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT FACILITY WITH A GROUP OF LENDERS AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS AGENT. CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE FUNDING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY, WE PAID OFF THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND TERMINATED SUCH FACILITY. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
 THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A SINGLE SPRINGING FINANCIAL COVENANT, WHICH REQUIRES A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 1.0 TO 1.0. THE FINANCIAL COVENANT SPRINGS ONLY IN THE EVENT EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY DROPS BELOW 10 OF THE LENDERS TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS RELATED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DIVIDENDS, LIENS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY A PLEDGE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS, WITH THE NOTABLE EXCLUSION OF ANY REAL ESTATE OR REVENUE EQUIPMENT FINANCED OUTSIDE THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES USUAL AND CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR A FACILITY OF THIS NATURE AND PROVIDES THAT, UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUATION OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE ACCELERATED, AND THE LENDERS COMMITMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED. 
 
 IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE IN DEFAULT UNDER THE RELEVANT AGREEMENT, WHICH COULD CAUSE CROSS-DEFAULTS UNDER OUR OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH DEFAULT, IF WE FAILED TO OBTAIN REPLACEMENT FINANCING OR AMENDMENTS TO, OR WAIVERS UNDER, THE APPLICABLE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING LENDERS COULD CEASE TO MAKE FURTHER ADVANCES, COULD DECLARE EXISTING DEBT TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE, COULD FAIL TO RENEW LETTERS OF CREDIT, COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS ON OUR OPERATIONS, COULD INSTITUTE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST COLLATERALIZED ASSETS, OR COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT FEES AND TRANSACTION COSTS. IF ACCELERATION OCCURS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE TO REFINANCE THE ACCELERATED DEBT OR THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES COULD DILUTE STOCK OWNERSHIP. EVEN IF NEW FINANCING CAN BE PROCURED, MORE STRINGENT BORROWING TERMS COULD MEAN THAT CREDIT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. A DEFAULT UNDER THESE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD CAUSE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FROM OPERATIONS, OR OBTAIN FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS. 
 
 THE TRUCKLOAD INDUSTRY IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE, AND OUR POLICY OF OPERATING NEWER EQUIPMENT REQUIRES US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS ANNUALLY. WE EXPECT TO PAY FOR PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES. WE BASE OUR EQUIPMENT PURCHASE AND REPLACEMENT DECISIONS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING NEW EQUIPMENT PRICES, THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, DEMAND FOR FREIGHT SERVICES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, COST PER MILE, FUEL EFFICIENCY, EQUIPMENT DURABILITY, EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS, AND DRIVER COMFORT. 
 
 IN THE FUTURE, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FROM OPERATIONS OR OBTAIN BORROWING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR FLEET SIZE, ENTER INTO LESS FAVORABLE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, OR OPERATE REVENUE EQUIPMENT FOR LONGER PERIODS, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT PROFITABILITY. 
 
 WE SELF-INSURE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CLAIMS EXPOSURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF, AND DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF, OUR EARNINGS. 
 
 OUR FUTURE INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS AND MAKE OUR EARNINGS MORE VOLATILE. WE SELF-INSURE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CLAIMS EXPOSURE AND RELATED EXPENSES. WE ACCRUE AMOUNTS FOR LIABILITIES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CLAIMS THAT ARISE AND OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE CLAIMS ARISE, AND WE EVALUATE AND REVISE THESE ACCRUALS FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT SELF-INSURED AMOUNTS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS AND THE RISK OF BEING REQUIRED TO ACCRUE OR PAY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS IF ESTIMATES ARE REVISED OR CLAIMS ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE MORE SEVERE THAN ORIGINALLY ASSESSED. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE HAD TO ADJUST OUR RESERVES, AND FUTURE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS MAY OCCUR. FURTHER, OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION LEVELS COULD CHANGE AND RESULT IN MORE VOLATILITY THAN IN RECENT YEARS. 
 
 WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE ABOVE THE AMOUNTS FOR WHICH WE SELF-INSURE WITH LICENSED INSURANCE CARRIERS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR AGGREGATE INSURANCE LIMITS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER REASONABLY EXPECTED CLAIMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE CLAIMS COULD EXCEED OUR AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS. IF ANY CLAIM WAS TO EXCEED OUR COVERAGE, WE WOULD BEAR THE EXCESS, IN ADDITION TO OTHER SELF-INSURED AMOUNTS. OUR INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COULD INCREASE, OR WE COULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION OR DECREASE OUR AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS WHEN OUR POLICIES ARE RENEWED OR REPLACED. OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THESE EXPENSES INCREASE, IF WE EXPERIENCE A CLAIM IN EXCESS OF OUR COVERAGE LIMITS, IF WE EXPERIENCE A CLAIM FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE COVERAGE, IF WE EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS, OR IF WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR RESERVES. 
 
 HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION AND INFLATIONARY COST INCREASES ALSO COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT FINANCIAL RESULTS BY INCREASING ANNUAL EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE COSTS GOING FORWARD. WE CANNOT PRESENTLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS COULD FORCE US TO MAKE CHANGES TO EXISTING BENEFITS PROGRAM, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OR AVAILABILITY OF FUEL, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, THE VOLUME AND TERMS OF DIESEL FUEL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, SURCHARGE COLLECTION, AND SURCHARGE POLICIES APPROVED BY CUSTOMERS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OF OPERATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 
 FUEL IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST OPERATING EXPENSES. DIESEL FUEL PRICES FLUCTUATE GREATLY DUE TO ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, WEATHER, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, EACH OF WHICH MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF FUEL. FUEL PRICING IS ALSO AFFECTED BY REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, FUEL PRICING ALSO CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE RISING DEMAND IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE USE OF CRUDE OIL AND OIL RESERVES FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND DIMINISHED DRILLING ACTIVITY. SUCH EVENTS MAY LEAD NOT ONLY TO INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES, BUT ALSO TO FUEL SHORTAGES AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR OPERATIONS ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIESEL FUEL, AND ACCORDINGLY, SIGNIFICANT DIESEL FUEL COST INCREASES, SHORTAGES, OR SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY USE HEDGING CONTRACTS AND VOLUME PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS TO ATTEMPT TO LIMIT THE EFFECT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. IF WE DO ENTER INTO HEDGING CONTRACTS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN TIMES OF FALLING DIESEL FUEL PRICES, INCLUDING RECENTLY, OUR COSTS WILL NOT BE REDUCED TO THE SAME EXTENT THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HAD WE NOT ENTERED INTO THE HEDGING CONTRACTS. ACCORDINGLY, IN TIMES OF FALLING DIESEL FUEL PRICES, OUR PROFITABILITY MAY NOT INCREASE TO THE EXTENT IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED WITHOUT THE HEDGING CONTRACT. 
 
 WE USE A FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAM TO RECAPTURE A PORTION OF THE INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES OVER A BASE RATE NEGOTIATED WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THE FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAM DOES NOT PROTECT US FROM THE FULL EFFECT OF INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES. THE TERMS OF EACH CUSTOMER S FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAM VARY, AND CERTAIN CUSTOMERS HAVE SOUGHT TO MODIFY THE TERMS OF THEIR FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAMS TO MINIMIZE RECOVERABILITY FOR FUEL PRICE INCREASES. A FAILURE TO IMPROVE OUR FUEL PRICE PROTECTION THROUGH THESE MEASURES, INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES, A SHORTAGE OR RATIONING OF DIESEL FUEL, OR SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS UNDER HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 A DECREASED DEMAND FOR USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. WE RELY ON THE SALE AND TRADE-IN OF USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE COST OF NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT. THE MARKET DEMAND FOR USED EQUIPMENT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST AND, ALTHOUGH OUR EQUIPMENT DISPOSAL SCHEDULE MAY FLUCTUATE, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THE MARKET DEMAND AND GAINS ON DISPOSAL IN 2016 TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED IN 2015 AS WE DOWNSIZED THE FLEET AND WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A FAVORABLE USED TRACTOR AND TRAILER MARKETS. WHEN THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET IS WEAK, IT MAY INCREASE OUR NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT, DECREASE OUR GAINS ON SALE OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT (OR CREATE A LOSS ON SALE OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT), OR INCREASE OUR MAINTENANCE COSTS IF WE DECIDE TO EXTEND THE USE OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT IN A DEPRESSED MARKET, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 INCREASED PRICES, REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY AND SCARCITY OF FINANCING FOR NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISK WITH RESPECT TO HIGHER PRICES FOR NEW TRACTORS. PRICES HAVE INCREASED AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE, DUE IN PART TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO NEWLY MANUFACTURED TRACTORS AND DIESEL ENGINES AND THE PRICING DISCRETION OF EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECENTLY EQUIPPED OUR TRACTORS WITH SAFETY, AERODYNAMICS, AND OTHER OPTIONS THAT INCREASE THE PRICE OF NEW TRACTORS. MORE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY EMISSIONS STANDARDS HAVE REQUIRED VENDORS TO INTRODUCE NEW ENGINES. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS HAS INCREASED THE COST OF OUR NEW TRACTORS AND COULD IMPAIR EQUIPMENT PRODUCTIVITY, LOWER FUEL MILEAGE, AND INCREASE OPERATING EXPENSES. THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS, COMBINED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE RELIABILITY OF THE VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH THE NEWLY DESIGNED DIESEL ENGINES AND THE RESIDUAL VALUES REALIZED FROM THE DISPOSITION OF THESE VEHICLES, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS AS THE REGULATIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE. 
 
 WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF AGREEMENTS AND NON-BINDING STATEMENTS OF INDICATIVE TRADE VALUES COVERING THE TERMS OF TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS FROM OUR PRIMARY EQUIPMENT VENDORS FOR DISPOSAL OF A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE EQUIPMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, PRICES WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE PRICES WE WOULD RECEIVE IN THE OPEN MARKET. WE MAY SUFFER A FINANCIAL LOSS UPON DISPOSITION OF OUR EQUIPMENT IF THESE VENDORS REFUSE OR ARE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, IF WE DO NOT ENTER INTO DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE INDICATIVE TRADE VALUES, IF WE FAIL TO OR ARE UNABLE TO ENTER INTO SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE, OR IF WE DO NOT PURCHASE THE NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT UNITS FROM THE VENDORS REQUIRED FOR SUCH TRADE-INS.

OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS. 
 
 AS A RESULT OF OUR LEVEL OF DEBT, CAPITAL LEASES, OPERATING LEASES, AND ENCUMBERED ASSETS, WE BELIEVE: 

OUR VULNERABILITY TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IS HEIGHTENED; 

WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO LEASE PAYMENTS AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, LIMITING THE AVAILABILITY OF CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES; 

OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY WILL BE LIMITED; 

OUR PROFITABILITY IS SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES BECAUSE SOME OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIABLE INTEREST RATES, AND FUTURE BORROWINGS AND LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH FLUCTUATIONS; 

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER PURPOSES MAY BE LIMITED; AND 

WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES TO RAISE FUNDS, WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP POSITION OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

OUR FINANCING OBLIGATIONS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS, ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS, OR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN REQUIRED OR, IF AVAILABLE, WILL BE ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US. 
 
 WE HAVE A RECENT HISTORY OF NET LOSSES AND MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING OR INCREASING PROFITABILITY. 
 
 WE HAVE GENERATED A PROFIT IN TWO OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS. MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY DEPENDS UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO INCREASE AVERAGE REVENUE PER TRACTOR, INCREASE VELOCITY, IMPROVE DRIVER RETENTION, AND CONTROL OPERATING EXPENSES. DESPITE RECENT RESULTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR PROFITABILITY, THEN OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING NEW MANAGEMENT, OPERATING PROCEDURES, AND COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN. 
 
 AS PART OF THE LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS OPERATING PROCEDURES. THESE CHANGES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS. ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR DIFFERENT PERSONNEL MAY BE REQUIRED, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, DELAYS IN OBTAINING RESULTS, OR DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. SOME OF THESE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES INCLUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DRIVER MANAGEMENT CHANGES AND COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES. THESE CHANGES AND INITIATIVES MAY NOT IMPROVE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ASSET PRODUCTIVITY, TRACTOR UTILIZATION, DRIVER RETENTION AND BASE REVENUE PER MILE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THE EXPECTED SAVINGS IN OUR COST STRUCTURE, INCLUDING THE AREAS OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE, EQUIPMENT OPERATING COSTS, AND FUEL ECONOMY. IN SUCH EVENT, OUR REVENUE, FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. FURTHER, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A FAILURE TO FURTHER PENETRATE OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE, CROSS-SELL OUR SERVICES, PURSUE NEW CUSTOMER OPPORTUNITIES, AND MANAGE THE OPERATIONS AND EXPENSES OF OUR NEW OR GROWING SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING OUR LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN AND INITIATIVES. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING OUR LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN AND INITIATIVES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEE TURNOVER OR FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE DEPEND ON THE LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE OF OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL TO DESIGN AND EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC AND OPERATING PLANS, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO GROW AND IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR TRUCKING AND SCS SEGMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CHANGE. TURNOVER, PLANNED OR OTHERWISE, IN KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, AND SUCH TURNOVER CAN BE DISRUPTIVE AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT, MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL DEPARTURES OF EXISTING PERSONNEL, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FUTURE PROFITABILITY. WE MUST RECRUIT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN A CORE GROUP OF MANAGERS TO REALIZE OUR GOAL OF EXPANDING OUR OPERATIONS, IMPROVING OUR EARNINGS CONSISTENCY, AND POSITIONING OURSELVES FOR LONG-TERM OPERATING REVENUE GROWTH.

INCREASES IN DRIVER COMPENSATION OR DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED DRIVERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 
 LIKE MANY TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCES A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED DRIVERS, PARTICULARLY DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION, IN WHICH ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE MORE PLENTIFUL AND FREIGHT DEMAND INCREASES, OR DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, IN WHICH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MIGHT BE EXTENDED AND FINANCING IS LIMITED FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO SEEK TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT OR FOR STUDENTS WHO SEEK FINANCIAL AID FOR DRIVING SCHOOL. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CSA AND HOURS-OF-SERVICE, AND AN IMPROVED ECONOMY COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE DRIVERS OR FORCE US TO INCREASE DRIVER COMPENSATION TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN DRIVERS. DUE TO THE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS AND INTENSE COMPETITION FOR DRIVERS FROM OTHER TRUCKING COMPANIES, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE DIFFICULTY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF OUR DRIVERS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE COMPENSATION WE OFFER OUR DRIVERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, AND, AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE DRIVER AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR COMPENSATION IN FUTURE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE IMPLEMENTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DRIVER PAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015. 
 
 IN ADDITION, WE AND OUR INDUSTRY SUFFER FROM A HIGH DRIVER TURNOVER RATE. THE HIGH DRIVER TURNOVER RATE REQUIRES US TO CONTINUALLY RECRUIT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DRIVERS TO OPERATE EXISTING REVENUE EQUIPMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF DRIVERS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADJUST OUR COMPENSATION PACKAGES, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS WITHOUT DRIVERS, OR OPERATE WITH FEWER TRACTORS AND FACE DIFFICULTY MEETING SHIPPER DEMANDS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 IF OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE DEEMED BY REGULATORS OR JUDICIAL PROCESS TO BE EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 TAX AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE ASSERTED THAT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DRIVERS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY ARE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. FEDERAL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE PAST THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR TAX AND OTHER AUTHORITIES TO RECLASSIFY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE THAT ENGAGE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DRIVERS AND TO INCREASE THE PENALTIES FOR COMPANIES WHO MISCLASSIFY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND ARE FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED EMPLOYEES OVERTIME AND/OR WAGE REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, FEDERAL LEGISLATORS HAVE SOUGHT TO ABOLISH THE CURRENT SAFE HARBOR ALLOWING TAXPAYERS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IF THEY ARE FOLLOWING A LONG-STANDING, RECOGNIZED PRACTICE, EXTEND THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, AND IMPOSE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS BASED ON EMPLOYMENT OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS AND FINES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY. SOME STATES HAVE PUT INITIATIVES IN PLACE TO INCREASE THEIR REVENUE FROM ITEMS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND INCOME TAXES, AND A RECLASSIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS EMPLOYEES WOULD HELP STATES WITH THIS INITIATIVE. TAXING AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND COURTS APPLY A VARIETY OF STANDARDS IN THEIR DETERMINATION OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. IF OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EMPLOYEES, WE WOULD INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE TAX, WORKERS COMPENSATION, UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, LABOR, EMPLOYMENT, AND TORT LAWS, INCLUDING FOR PRIOR PERIODS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAX WITHHOLDINGS. 
 
 WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTIES, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BROKERAGE AND RAIL INTERMODAL BUSINESSES, AND SERVICE INSTABILITY FROM THESE PROVIDERS COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO OFFER BROKERAGE OR RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. 
 
 OUR BROKERAGE BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SERVICES OF THIRD-PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING OTHER TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS. FOR THIS BUSINESS, WE DO NOT OWN OR CONTROL THE TRANSPORTATION ASSETS THAT DELIVER OUR CUSTOMERS FREIGHT, AND DO NOT EMPLOY THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN DELIVERING THE FREIGHT. THIS RELIANCE COULD ALSO CAUSE DELAYS IN REPORTING CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING RECOGNIZING REVENUE AND CLAIMS. THESE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS SEEK OTHER FREIGHT OPPORTUNITIES AND MAY REQUIRE INCREASED COMPENSATION IN TIMES OF IMPROVED FREIGHT DEMAND OR TIGHT TRUCKING CAPACITY. OUR INABILITY TO SECURE THE SERVICES OF THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS ON COMPETITIVE TERMS. ADDITIONALLY, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT EQUIPMENT OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR PROVIDE SERVICES ON COMPETITIVE TERMS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR ABILITY TO SECURE SUFFICIENT EQUIPMENT OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES IS AFFECTED BY MANY RISKS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY AMONG CONTRACTED TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS, INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICE DUE TO LABOR DISPUTES, CHANGES IN REGULATIONS IMPACTING TRANSPORTATION, AND CHANGES IN TRANSPORTATION RATES.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS, THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WE GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING REVENUE FROM OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS. GENERALLY, WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY, OUR PERFORMANCE, OUR CUSTOMERS INTERNAL INITIATIVES, OR OTHER FACTORS, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THEIR USE OF OUR SERVICES, OR THREATEN TO DO SO TO GAIN PRICING OR OTHER CONCESSIONS FROM US. 
 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO REMAIN SOLVENT. OUR CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, ESPECIALLY IF THESE CUSTOMERS WERE TO DELAY OR DEFAULT ON PAYMENTS TO US. FOR SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS, AND THE RATES WE CHARGE MAY NOT REMAIN ADVANTAGEOUS. A REDUCTION IN OR TERMINATION OF OUR SERVICES BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND CHANGES IN EXISTING REGULATIONS OR VIOLATIONS OF EXISTING OR FUTURE REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (THE DOT ), IN VARIOUS CANADIAN PROVINCES PURSUANT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE MINISTRIES OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND OUR MEXICAN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATING AUTHORITY GRANTED BY SECRETARIA DE COMMUNICACIONES Y TRANSPORTES. COMPANY DRIVERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ALSO MUST COMPLY WITH THE SAFETY AND FITNESS REGULATIONS OF THE DOT, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING, DRIVER SAFETY PERFORMANCE, AND HOURS-OF-SERVICE. MATTERS SUCH AS WEIGHT, EQUIPMENT DIMENSIONS, AND EXHAUST EMISSIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. WE ALSO MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO NEW OR MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS RELATING TO EXHAUST EMISSIONS, DRIVERS HOURS-OF-SERVICE, ERGONOMICS, ON-BOARD REPORTING OF OPERATIONS, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, SECURITY AT PORTS, SPEED LIMITERS, AND OTHER MATTERS AFFECTING SAFETY OR OPERATING METHODS. FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE MORE STRINGENT, REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING PRACTICES, INFLUENCE THE DEMAND FOR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, OR REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS. HIGHER COSTS WE INCUR, OR HIGHER COSTS INCURRED BY SUPPLIERS WHO PASS THE COSTS ON TO US, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 THE CSA PROGRAM ADOPTED BY THE FMCSA COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND OPERATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR GROW OUR FLEET, AND OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. 
 
 UNDER CSA, FLEETS ARE EVALUATED AND RANKED AGAINST THEIR PEERS BASED ON CERTAIN SAFETY-RELATED STANDARDS. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN CURRENT AND POTENTIAL DRIVERS MAY NOT BE HIRED TO DRIVE FOR US AND OUR FLEET COULD BE RANKED POORLY AS COMPARED TO OUR PEER FIRMS. WE RECRUIT AND RETAIN FIRST-TIME DRIVERS TO BE PART OF OUR FLEET, AND THESE DRIVERS MAY HAVE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CREATING ADVERSE SAFETY EVENTS UNDER CSA. THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE DEFICIENCIES COULD AFFECT DRIVER RECRUITMENT BY CAUSING HIGH-QUALITY DRIVERS TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT WITH OTHER CARRIERS OR COULD CAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DIRECT THEIR BUSINESS AWAY FROM US AND TO CARRIERS WITH HIGHER FLEET SAFETY RANKINGS, EITHER OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COMPETITION FOR DRIVERS WITH FAVORABLE SAFETY RATINGS MAY INCREASE AND THUS COULD NECESSITATE INCREASES IN DRIVER-RELATED COMPENSATION COSTS. FURTHER, WE MAY INCUR GREATER THAN EXPECTED EXPENSES IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE OUR SCORES OR AS A RESULT OF THOSE SCORES. 
 
 WE HAVE EXCEEDED THE ESTABLISHED INTERVENTION THRESHOLDS UNDER CERTAIN CSA CATEGORIES. BASED ON THESE UNFAVORABLE RATINGS, WE MAY BE PRIORITIZED FOR AN INTERVENTION ACTION OR ROADSIDE INSPECTION, OR OUR DRIVER RECRUITING AND RETENTION MAY BE AFFECTED BY CAUSING HIGH-QUALITY DRIVERS TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT WITH OTHER CARRIERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO ASSIGN LOADS TO US. WE HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS AREAS WHERE WE HAVE EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLDS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THESE MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE. 
 
 RECEIPT OF AN UNFAVORABLE DOT SAFETY RATING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SATISFACTORY DOT RATING, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE RATING UNDER THE CURRENT SAFETY RATING SCALE. IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE A CONDITIONAL OR UNSATISFACTORY DOT SAFETY RATING, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AS CUSTOMER CONTRACTS MAY REQUIRE A SATISFACTORY DOT SAFETY RATING, AND A CONDITIONAL OR UNSATISFACTORY RATING COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OR RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. 
 
 THE FMCSA ALSO HAS PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT WOULD MODIFY THE EXISTING RATING SYSTEM AND THE SAFETY LABELS ASSIGNED TO MOTOR CARRIERS EVALUATED BY THE DOT. UNDER THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING A CARRIER S DOT SAFETY RATING WOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE ON-ROAD SAFETY PERFORMANCE OF THE CARRIER S DRIVERS AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS RESULTS OBTAINED FROM INVESTIGATIONS. EXCEEDING CERTAIN THRESHOLDS BASED ON SUCH PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS WOULD CAUSE A CARRIER TO RECEIVE AN UNFIT SAFETY RATING. IF THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE ENACTED AND WE WERE TO RECEIVE AN UNFIT SAFETY RATING, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF WE RECEIVED A CONDITIONAL OR UNSATISFACTORY SAFETY RATING UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE VIOLATION OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR PENALTIES. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS DEALING WITH THE TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, FUEL STORAGE TANKS, AIR EMISSIONS FROM OUR VEHICLES AND FACILITIES, ENGINE IDLING, AND DISCHARGE AND RETENTION OF STORM WATER. WE OPERATE IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS, WHERE TRUCK TERMINALS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES ARE LOCATED, AND WHERE GROUNDWATER OR OTHER FORMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION MAY HAVE OCCURRED. OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVE THE RISKS OF FUEL SPILLAGE OR SEEPAGE, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL, AMONG OTHERS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN ABOVE-GROUND BULK FUEL STORAGE TANKS AND FUELING ISLANDS AT SEVERAL OF OUR FACILITIES AND ONE LEASED FACILITY HAS BELOW-GROUND BULK FUEL STORAGE TANKS. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR FREIGHT CONSISTS OF LOW-GRADE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO A WIDE ARRAY OF REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, INCREASING EFFORTS TO CONTROL EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWMAKERS ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF CLIMATE-CHANGE PROPOSALS AND NEW GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS THAT COULD INCREASE THE COST OF NEW TRACTORS, IMPAIR PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INSTITUTED PROGRAMS TO MONITOR AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IF WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SPILL OR OTHER ACCIDENT INVOLVING HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, IF THERE ARE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES WE TRANSPORT, OR IF WE ARE FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITIES, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR PENALTIES OR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 IF WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, OUR OPERATING REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY MAY SUFFER. 
 
 A COMPONENT OF OUR OPERATIONS IS THE BUSINESS WE CONDUCT IN MEXICO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CANADA, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF MEXICO AND CANADA, DIFFICULTIES IN ENFORCING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BURDENS OF COMPLYING WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL AND UNITED STATES EXPORT AND IMPORT LAWS, AND SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIVE TRADE POLICIES AND IMPOSITION OF DUTIES, TAXES, OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTIES BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, ARE PRESENT BUT LARGELY MITIGATED BY THE TERMS OF NAFTA. 
 
 LITIGATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LITIGATION BY EMPLOYEES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DRIVERS, CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, STOCKHOLDERS, AND OTHER PARTIES THROUGH PRIVATE ACTIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, REGULATORY ACTIONS, AND OTHER PROCESSES. RECENTLY, TRUCKING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EMPLOYEE MEAL BREAKS, REST PERIODS, OVERTIME ELIGIBILITY, AND FAILURE TO PAY FOR ALL HOURS WORKED. A NUMBER OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE RESULTED IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL SETTLEMENTS OR DAMAGES BY THE DEFENDANTS. 
 
 THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS, IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR QUANTIFY, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS RELATING TO SUCH LAWSUITS MAY REMAIN UNKNOWN FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME. THE COST TO DEFEND LITIGATION MAY ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT. NOT ALL CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR COVERAGE LIMITS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL AMOUNTS IN DISPUTE. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPERIENCE CLAIMS THAT ARE UNINSURED, EXCEED OUR COVERAGE LIMITS, INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT AGGREGATE USE OF OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION AMOUNTS, OR CAUSE INCREASES IN FUTURE PREMIUMS, THE RESULTING EXPENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE DEPEND ON THE PROPER FUNCTIONING, AVAILABILITY, AND SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AND A SYSTEMS FAILURE OR UNAVAILABILITY OR A SECURITY BREACH COULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WE DEPEND ON THE PROPER FUNCTIONING, AVAILABILITY, AND SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL REPORTING AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE PROTECTED THROUGH PHYSICAL AND SOFTWARE SAFEGUARDS, BUT ARE STILL VULNERABLE TO FIRE, STORM, FLOOD, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, PHYSICAL OR SOFTWARE BREAK-INS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, INTERNET FAILURES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, AND SIMILAR EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF THE INFORMATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS FAIL, OTHERWISE BECOME UNAVAILABLE, OR EXPERIENCE A SECURITY BREACH, MANUALLY PERFORMING FUNCTIONS COULD TEMPORARILY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR FLEET EFFICIENTLY, TO RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS REQUESTS EFFECTIVELY, TO MAINTAIN BILLING AND OTHER RECORDS RELIABLY, TO BILL FOR SERVICES ACCURATELY OR IN A TIMELY MANNER, TO COMMUNICATE INTERNALLY AND WITH DRIVERS, CUSTOMERS, AND VENDORS, AND TO PREPARE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCURATELY OR IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO PROTECT US IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE. ANY SYSTEM FAILURE, UPGRADE COMPLICATION, SECURITY BREACH, OR OTHER SYSTEM DISRUPTION COULD INTERRUPT OR DELAY OPERATIONS, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS AND REPORT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CAUSE THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON EXISTING AND FUTURE BUSINESS.

WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A MULTI-YEAR PROCESS TO MIGRATE OUR LEGACY MAINFRAME PLATFORM AND INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO SERVER-BASED PLATFORMS. WE STILL HAVE A FEW REMAINING SYSTEMS TO CONVERT, AND COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS, COMPLICATIONS, OR ADDITIONAL COSTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. WE ANTICIPATE THE LEGACY MAINFRAME APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE COMPLETELY MIGRATED TO NEWER PLATFORMS DURING 2016. 
 
 DURING 2014, WE BEGAN TO HOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AT A REMOTE DATA CENTER DESIGNED TO STORE AND PRESERVE OUR DATA. THIS DATA CENTER REPLICATES ALL PRODUCTION DATA BACK TO THE DATA CENTER AT OUR HEADQUARTERS, WHICH PROTECTS OUR INFORMATION IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISASTER. THIS REDUNDANT DATA CENTER ALLOWS THE DATA RELATED TO OUR SYSTEMS TO BE RECOVERED FOLLOWING AN INCIDENT. HOWEVER, RECOVERY OF SUCH DATA MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY RESTORE OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. IN THE EVENT SUCH SYSTEMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED, IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE OUR SYSTEMS REGAIN FUNCTIONALITY. ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH WE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DISRUPTION TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS SHOULD A DISASTER OCCUR THROUGH REDUNDANT COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, SUCH AS THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND OTHER BACKUP SYSTEMS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN RESTORING LOST DATA OR RESTORING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. 
 
 WE RECEIVE AND TRANSMIT CONFIDENTIAL DATA WITH AND AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS, DRIVERS, VENDORS, EMPLOYEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. DESPITE OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURE TRANSMISSION TECHNIQUES, INTERNAL DATA SECURITY MEASURES, AND MONITORING TOOLS, OUR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY THREATS AND BREACH ATTEMPTS FROM BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SOURCES. ANY SUCH BREACH COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, DRIVERS, VENDORS, EMPLOYEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ACCESS, VIEWING, MISAPPROPRIATION, ALTERING, OR DELETING INFORMATION IN OUR SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER, DRIVER, VENDOR, EMPLOYEE, AND SERVICE PROVIDER INFORMATION AND OUR PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION. A SECURITY BREACH COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION AND COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING OUR SYSTEMS, INCREASED SECURITY, CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS, LOST OPERATING REVENUE, LITIGATION, REGULATORY ACTION, AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. 
 
 SEASONALITY AND THE IMPACT OF WEATHER AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 OUR TRACTOR PRODUCTIVITY DECREASES DURING THE WINTER SEASON BECAUSE INCLEMENT WEATHER IMPEDES OPERATIONS, AND SOME SHIPPERS REDUCE THEIR SHIPMENTS AFTER THE WINTER HOLIDAY SEASON. REVENUE CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY BAD WEATHER AND HOLIDAYS, SINCE REVENUE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO AVAILABLE WORKING DAYS OF SHIPPERS. AT THE SAME TIME, OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASE, WITH FUEL EFFICIENCY DECLINING BECAUSE OF ENGINE IDLING AND HARSH WEATHER CREATING HIGHER ACCIDENT FREQUENCY, INCREASED CLAIMS, AND MORE EQUIPMENT REPAIRS. WE COULD ALSO SUFFER SHORT-TERM IMPACTS FROM WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS SUCH AS HURRICANES, BLIZZARDS, ICE STORMS AND FLOODS THAT COULD MAKE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MORE VOLATILE. CONSEQUENTLY, WEATHER AND OTHER SEASONAL EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 WE FACE VARIOUS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER ACTIVISTS. 
 
 ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDERS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR CERTAIN CHANGES AT THE COMPANY. SUCH ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL STOCKHOLDERS MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATION ON OR CONTROL OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE POSSIBILITY OF WHICH MAY CREATE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING OUR FUTURE. THESE PERCEIVED UNCERTAINTIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, RAISE CUSTOMER CONCERNS, OR CAUSE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE PRESENCE OF SUCH ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDERS ALSO MAY CREATE A SIGNIFICANT DISTRACTION FOR OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ACTIVISTS ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COOPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH CONTAIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON SUCH STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO VOTE THEIR SHARES OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUIRE SUCH STOCKHOLDERS TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN STANDSTILL PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN THESE COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ARE SCHEDULED TO END ON THE DATE THAT IS 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE ADVANCE NOTICE PERIOD FOR STOCKHOLDER NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AT OUR 2017 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO AGREE TO TERMS FOR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OTHER ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDERS THAT MIGHT ACQUIRE AN INTEREST IN OUR COMPANY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

A POTENTIAL PROXY CONTEST WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND CAUSE IT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS. THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED TO GIVE STOCKHOLDERS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE THEIR DIRECTOR NOMINEES AND THEIR PROPOSALS RELATING TO A STOCKHOLDER NOMINATION PROCESS IN OUR PROXY MATERIALS, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR ACTIVISTS TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMMISSION S PROPOSED RULE WAS STRUCK DOWN BY A FEDERAL COURT IN 2011. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, MANY PUBLIC COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED, AND IN SOME INSTANCES ADOPTED, STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ALLOWING CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS THE ABILITY TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO SUCH COMPANY S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND WE MAY RECEIVE SIMILAR STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS. FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, PROXY CONTESTS AND THE PRESENCE OF ADDITIONAL ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS COULD INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR LONG-TERM TURNAROUND PLAN AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, BE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, AND DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, WE COULD BE SUBJECTED TO ACTIVIST STOCKHOLDER LAWSUITS. SUCH LAWSUITS ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND COULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES AND PROXY COSTS IN DEFENDING OUR POSITION. AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUCH LAWSUITS DIVERT MANAGEMENT S TIME AND ATTENTION FROM OPERATIONS AND CAN ALSO CAUSE DISTRACTIONS AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES. 
 
 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. THIS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED AND AMENDED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION MAY DISCOURAGE, DELAY, OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR CHANGES IN OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR MANAGEMENT THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER FAVORABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AUTHORIZES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE UP TO 1,000,000 SHARES OF BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK. WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ATTACH SPECIAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING VOTING AND DIVIDEND RIGHTS, TO THIS PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY. OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION ALSO PROVIDES: 

FOR A CLASSIFIED BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHEREBY DIRECTORS SERVE FOR THREE-YEAR TERMS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE DIRECTORS COMING UP FOR RE-ELECTION EACH YEAR, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO OBTAIN CONTROL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THROUGH A PROXY CONTEST; 

THAT VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY BE FILLED ONLY BY THE REMAINING DIRECTORS IN OFFICE, EVEN IF ONLY ONE DIRECTOR REMAINS IN OFFICE; 

THAT DIRECTORS MAY ONLY BE REMOVED FOR CAUSE AND ONLY BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK; 

THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 66 2/3 OF THE VOTING POWER OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE ANY MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION WITH ANY OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY THAT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE STOCKHOLDERS; 

THAT STOCKHOLDERS CAN ONLY ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT IF SUCH CONSENT IS SIGNED BY THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 66 2/3 OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK; AND 

THAT EACH OF THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY ONLY BE AMENDED BY THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 66 2/3 OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. 

OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REQUIRE ADVANCE NOTICE OF ALL STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, INCLUDING NOMINATIONS FOR ELECTION AS DIRECTOR, AND PROVIDE THAT A SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE CALLED ONLY BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE PRESIDENT, OR BY A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE HAVE IN THE PAST ADOPTED A STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, WHICH WAS VOLUNTARILY TERMINATED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN APRIL 2014, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ADOPT NEW STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, IF ANYONE BECOMES AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, WE MAY NOT ENTER INTO A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH THAT PERSON FOR THREE YEARS WITHOUT SPECIAL APPROVAL, WHICH COULD DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM MAKING A TAKEOVER OFFER AND COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL. FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 203, INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER MEANS, GENERALLY, SOMEONE OWNING 15 OR MORE OF OUR OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK OR AN AFFILIATE OF OURS THAT OWNED 15 OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 203. THESE PROVISIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE CHANGE MAY BE CONSIDERED BENEFICIAL BY SOME OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND THEREBY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS MIGHT BE WILLING TO PAY IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE PROVISIONS DISCOURAGE AN ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY OR OTHER CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION, THEY COULD DEPRIVE STOCKHOLDERS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE TAKEOVER PREMIUMS FOR THEIR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

KNIGHT TRANSPORTATION, INC. S UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER PROPOSAL WAS, AND ANY FUTURE UNSOLICITED OFFERS MAY BE, DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 IN SEPTEMBER 2013, KNIGHT TRANSPORTATION, INC. KNIGHT ANNOUNCED ITS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER PROPOSAL FOR OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. RESPONDING TO KNIGHT S UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL, EXPLORING THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS THAT REFLECTED OUR FULL INTRINSIC VALUE AND INSTITUTING LEGAL ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH KNIGHT S TENDER OFFER CREATED A SIGNIFICANT DISTRACTION FOR OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND REQUIRED US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES, AND ANY FUTURE UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS MAY LEAD TO SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS. SUCH PROPOSALS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS BY CAUSING UNCERTAINTY AMONG CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, AND CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND CAUSE VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE. THESE CONSEQUENCES, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CHANGE OF CONTROL/SEVERANCE PLAN WITH CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE ENTITLED TO SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS UPON A TERMINATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT BY US WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THEM FOR GOOD REASON IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE APPLICABLE PLAN). THE CHANGE OF CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO ALLOW US TO RETAIN CRITICAL EMPLOYEES DURING A TIME WHEN A CHANGE OF CONTROL IS BEING PROPOSED OR IS IMMINENT.

 STRENGTHS. PRODUCT DESIGN IDEAS ARE DRAWN FROM VARIOUS SOURCES
 AND ARE REVIEWED AND MODIFIED BY THE DESIGN STAFF TO ENSURE
 CONSISTENCY WITHIN THE COMPANY S EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS
 AND THE THEMES AND IMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH EXISTING
 PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO CHANGING CONSUMER

PRODUCT
 SOURCING 

THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BY FOREIGN
 MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION BEING IN CHINA.

 AND DUTIES. THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
 PERSONNEL VISIT THE THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES REGULARLY TO MONITOR
 PRODUCT QUALITY AND TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR

SEASONALITY
 AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT 

IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE COMPANY S SALES WERE LOWEST IN THE
 FIRST QUARTER AND HIGHEST IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, ALTHOUGH
 THERE IS SOME VARIATION IN THE SEASONAL DEMAND FOR THE
 COMPANY S PRODUCTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR. SALES ARE GENERALLY
 HIGHER IN PERIODS WHEN CUSTOMERS TAKE INITIAL SHIPMENTS OF NEW
 PRODUCTS, AS THESE ORDERS TYPICALLY INCLUDE ENOUGH PRODUCTS FOR
 INITIAL SETS FOR EACH STORE AND ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES FOR THE
 CUSTOMER S DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. THE TIMING OF THESE
 INITIAL SHIPMENTS VARIES BY CUSTOMER AND DEPENDS ON WHEN THE
 CUSTOMER FINALIZES STORE LAYOUTS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR AND
 WHETHER THE CUSTOMER HAS ANY MID-YEAR INTRODUCTIONS OF PRODUCTS.
 SALES MAY ALSO BE HIGHER OR LOWER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, IN
 PERIODS WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE OPENING NEW STORES OR CLOSING
 EXISTING STORES. CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED INTRODUCTION OF
 SPECIFIC PRODUCT OFFERINGS, THE COMPANY CARRIES NECESSARY LEVELS
 OF INVENTORY TO MEET THE ANTICIPATED DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF
 ITS CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE SHIPPED ARE
 HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1 OF GROSS SALES.

INTERNATIONAL
 SALES 

SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES
 REPRESENTED 2 OF THE COMPANY S GROSS SALES IN FISCAL YEAR
 2010 AND LESS THAN 1 IN FISCAL YEAR 2009. INTERNATIONAL SALES
 ARE BASED UPON THE LOCATION THAT PREDOMINATELY REPRESENTS THE
 FINAL DESTINATION OF THE PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO THE

GOVERNMENT
 REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL 

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL
 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH REGULATE, AMONG OTHER
 THINGS, PRODUCT SAFETY AND THE DISCHARGE, STORAGE, HANDLING AND
 DISPOSAL OF A VARIETY OF SUBSTANCES AND WASTES, AND TO LAWS AND
 REGULATIONS RELATING TO EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH, PRINCIPALLY
 THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION ACT AND
 REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT CURRENTLY
 COMPLIES IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL,
 HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THAT FUTURE
 COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS WILL NOT HAVE
 A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS
 OR

COMPETITIVE POSITION. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH
 REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT BECOME MORE STRINGENT IN THE FUTURE OR
 THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT HAVE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO
 COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS.

ORDER
 BACKLOG 

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE BACKLOG OF CUSTOMER ORDERS WAS
 5.8 MILLION AND 3.5 MILLION AT JUNE 4, 2010 AND
 MAY 29, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY THE MAJORITY OF
 THESE UNFILLED ORDERS ARE SHIPPED WITHIN APPROXIMATELY FOUR
 WEEKS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BACKLOG AT ANY POINT IN
 TIME WILL TRANSLATE INTO SALES IN ANY PARTICULAR SUBSEQUENT
 PERIOD. DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF QUICK-SHIP PROGRAMS ADOPTED BY
 ITS CUSTOMERS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS BACKLOG IS
 A MEANINGFUL OR MATERIAL INDICATOR OF FUTURE BUSINESS.

EMPLOYEES 

AT JUNE 1, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD 161 EMPLOYEES, NONE
 OF WHOM IS REPRESENTED BY A LABOR UNION OR IS OTHERWISE A PARTY
 TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY ATTRACTS AND
 MAINTAINS QUALIFIED PERSONNEL BY PAYING COMPETITIVE SALARIES AND
 BENEFITS AND OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT. THE COMPANY
 CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS EMPLOYEES TO BE GOOD.

COMPETITION 

THE INFANT AND TODDLER CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY
 COMPETITIVE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTORS
 AND MANUFACTURERS (BOTH BRANDED AND PRIVATE LABEL), INCLUDING
 LARGE INFANT AND JUVENILE PRODUCT COMPANIES AND SPECIALTY INFANT
 AND JUVENILE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS, ON THE BASIS OF QUALITY,
 DESIGN, PRICE, BRAND NAME RECOGNITION, SERVICE AND PACKAGING.
 THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS PRINCIPALLY ON
 STYLING, PRICE, SERVICE TO THE RETAILER AND CONTINUED HIGH
 REGARD FOR THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS AND TRADE NAMES.

TRADEMARKS,
 COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS 

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BE OF
 MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO ITS BUSINESS. SALES OF PRODUCTS MARKETED
 UNDER THE COMPANY S TRADEMARKS, PRIMARILY
 NOJO ,

 ACCOUNTED FOR 20 OF THE COMPANY S TOTAL GROSS SALES DURING
 FISCAL YEAR 2010. PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS IS OBTAINED
 THROUGH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN REGISTRATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO
 MARKETS DESIGNS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHTS AND DESIGN
 PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY.

LICENSED
 PRODUCTS 

CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD PURSUANT TO LICENSING
 AGREEMENTS FOR TRADEMARKS. ALSO, MANY OF THE DESIGNS USED BY THE
 COMPANY ARE COPYRIGHTED BY OTHER PARTIES, INCLUDING TRADEMARK
 LICENSORS, AND ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY THROUGH COPYRIGHT
 LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE LICENSING AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR
 AN INITIAL TERM OF ONE TO THREE YEARS AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE
 SUBJECT TO RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. SALES OF LICENSED PRODUCTS

 IS 5.0 MILLION, INCLUDING 3.2 MILLION AND
 1.6 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.
 THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FUTURE SALES OF LICENSED PRODUCTS WILL
 EXCEED AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO COVER THE MINIMUM ROYALTY GUARANTEES.
 THE COMPANY S TOTAL ROYALTY EXPENSE WAS 7.0 MILLION
 AND 6.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009,
 RESPECTIVELY.

RISK
 FACTORS 

THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS THE OTHER INFORMATION
 CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC SHOULD
 BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY S BUSINESS.
 ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR
 THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR
 BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY
 OCCUR, OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE
 LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY S KEY CUSTOMERS COULD
 RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUES. 

THE COMPANY S TOP TWO CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY
 64 OF GROSS SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2010. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY
 DOES NOT ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH ITS KEY CUSTOMERS, IT EXPECTS
 THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS GROSS SALES
 IN THE FUTURE. THE LOSS OF ONE OR BOTH OF THESE CUSTOMERS COULD
 RESULT IN A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE COMPANY S REVENUE AND
 OPERATING INCOME.

THE
 LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY S LICENSES COULD RESULT
 IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUES. 

SALES OF LICENSED PRODUCTS REPRESENTED 51 OF THE COMPANY S
 GROSS SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, WHICH INCLUDED 36 OF SALES
 ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY S LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH
 DISNEY. THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUES
 IF IT IS UNABLE TO RENEW ITS MAJOR LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR OBTAIN
 NEW LICENSES.

ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RAW
 MATERIAL PRICES. 

THE COMPANY USES SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF COTTON, EITHER IN THE
 FORM OF COTTON FABRIC OR COTTON/POLYESTER FABRIC. COTTON IS
 SUBJECT TO ONGOING PRICE FLUCTUATIONS BECAUSE IT IS AN
 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IMPACTED BY CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS,
 DISEASE AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS SUPPLY AND DEMAND
 CONSIDERATIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. IN
 ADDITION, INCREASED OIL PRICES AFFECT KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RAW
 MATERIAL PRICES IN OUR PRODUCTS. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE
 PRICES OF COTTON AND OIL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RAW MATERIAL
 PRICES IN OUR PRODUCTS (E.G., 100 POLYESTER FILL, POLYESTER
 FABRICS, PE, PEVA AND PACKAGING).

THE
 COMPANY S INABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO
 CONSUMERS TASTES AND PREFERENCES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
 THE COMPANY S REVENUES. 

SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY S
 PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE DEMAND FOR THE
 COMPANY S PRODUCTS WILL NOT DECLINE OR THAT THE COMPANY
 WILL BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN DEMAND. THE
 COMPANY S FAILURE TO ADAPT TO THESE CHANGES COULD LEAD TO
 LOWER SALES AND EXCESS INVENTORY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
 ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 OPERATING RESULTS.

THE
 COMPANY S SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON RETAINING KEY
 MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. 

THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO RETAIN QUALIFIED EXECUTIVE
 MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IS VITAL TO THE
 COMPANY S SUCCESS. IF THE COMPANY WERE UNABLE TO RETAIN OR
 ATTRACT QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, THE COMPANY S GROWTH AND
 OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.

THE
 COMPANY S BUSINESS IS IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS AND RELATED UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING MARKETS IN WHICH
 THE COMPANY OPERATES. 

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CREDIT CRISIS
 AFFECTING GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF AN
 EXTENDED GLOBAL RECESSION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE
 COMPANY S BUSINESS. THESE CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN
 REDUCED DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS,
 INCREASED ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND RETURNS, AN INCREASED RISK OF
 EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES AND INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE
 PRICES OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS. ALSO, ALTHOUGH THE
 COMPANY S USE OF A COMMERCIAL FACTOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES
 THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE
 FACTOR MAY AT ANY TIME TERMINATE OR LIMIT ITS APPROVAL OF
 SHIPMENTS TO A PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE
 FACTOR DOING SO MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS. SUCH AN ACTION BY THE FACTOR WOULD RESULT IN THE
 LOSS OF FUTURE SALES TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMER.

CURRENCY
 EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND OTHER SUPPLIER-RELATED RISKS
 COULD INCREASE THE COMPANY S EXPENSES. 

THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY FOREIGN CONTRACT
 MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION BEING IN CHINA.
 DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THESE SUPPLIERS, SUCH AS FIRE,
 ACCIDENT, NATURAL DISASTERS, OUTBREAKS OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OR
 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY COULD HALT OR DISRUPT
 PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS. ALSO, THE PRICES PAID
 BY THE COMPANY TO THESE SUPPLIERS COULD INCREASE IF RAW
 MATERIALS, LABOR OR OTHER COSTS INCREASE. IN ADDITION,
 RESTRICTIVE ACTIONS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, A STRENGTHENING OF
 THE CHINESE CURRENCY VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR OR CHANGES IN
 IMPORT DUTIES OR IMPORT OR EXPORT RESTRICTIONS COULD INCREASE
 THE PRICES AT WHICH

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE COMPANY PURCHASES FINISHED GOODS. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE
 TO PASS THESE COST INCREASES ALONG TO ITS CUSTOMERS,
 PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CHANGES
 IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED
 WITH FOREIGN TRADE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
 SOURCING. 

THE COMPANY SOURCES ITS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY FROM FOREIGN CONTRACT
 MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION BEING IN CHINA.
 THE ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE IMPORTATION OF
 PRODUCT, INCLUDING QUOTAS, DUTIES, TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES OR
 RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTED GOODS, AND CHANGES IN U.S. CUSTOMS
 PROCEDURES COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF THE
 COMPANY S PRODUCTS. DELAYS IN CUSTOMS CLEARANCE OF GOODS OR
 THE DISRUPTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION LINES USED BY THE
 COMPANY COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY BEING UNABLE TO DELIVER
 GOODS TO CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF
 SALES ALTOGETHER.

THE
 COMPANY S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH ITS FINANCING AGREEMENT IS
 SUBJECT TO FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND OTHER FACTORS. 

THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO MAKE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF
 PRINCIPAL, TO PAY THE INTEREST ON OR TO REFINANCE ITS MATURING
 INDEBTEDNESS, TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR TO COMPLY WITH ITS
 DEBT COVENANTS WILL DEPEND UPON FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE
 COMPANY S FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,
 SUBJECT TO GENERAL ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE,
 LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND ITS CONTROL.
 THE BREACH OF ANY OF THESE COVENANTS COULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT
 UNDER THE COMPANY S FINANCING AGREEMENT. UPON THE
 OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, THE COMPANY S LENDERS
 COULD DECLARE ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER SUCH CREDIT
 FACILITIES TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. IF A DEFAULT WERE
 TO OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY S
 ASSETS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY IN FULL THAT INDEBTEDNESS.

THE
 COMPANY S DEBT COVENANTS MAY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY OR LIMIT
 ITS ABILITY TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, INCUR DEBT, MAKE
 INVESTMENTS, SELL ASSETS OR COMPLETE OTHER SIGNIFICANT
 TRANSACTIONS. 

THE COMPANY S FINANCING AGREEMENT CONTAINS USUAL AND
 CUSTOMARY COVENANTS REGARDING SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS,
 INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, LIENS, TRANSFERS
 OF ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION
 TRANSACTIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND CHANGES IN OR
 AMENDMENTS TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE COMPANY AND
 ITS SUBSIDIARIES. UNLESS WAIVED BY THE COMPANY S PRIMARY
 LENDER, THESE COVENANTS COULD LIMIT THE COMPANY S ABILITY
 TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS,
 RESPOND TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND
 OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, OR OTHERWISE ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS
 THAT THE COMPANY CONSIDERS BENEFICIAL.

THE
 STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY S COMPETITORS MAY IMPACT THE
 COMPANY S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW ITS SALES, WHICH
 COULD DECREASE THE COMPANY S REVENUES. 

THE INFANT AND TODDLER CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY
 COMPETITIVE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTORS
 AND MANUFACTURERS, BOTH BRANDED AND PRIVATE LABEL. THE
 COMPANY S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS
 PRINCIPALLY ON STYLING, PRICE, SERVICE TO THE RETAILER AND
 CONTINUED HIGH REGARD FOR THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS AND TRADE
 NAMES. SEVERAL OF THESE COMPETITORS ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANY
 AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY. INCREASED
 COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE
 COMPANY S REVENUES.

RECALLS
 OR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS COULD INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE
 SALES. 

THE COMPANY MUST COMPLY WITH THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
 IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008, WHICH IMPOSES STRICT STANDARDS TO
 PROTECT CHILDREN FROM POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS AND WHICH
 REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS BE TESTED TO ENSURE
 THAT THEY ARE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS FOR LEAD AND PHTHALATES.
 THE COMPANY MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH RELATED REGULATIONS DEVELOPED
 BY THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION AND SIMILAR STATE
 REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS COULD BE
 SUBJECT TO INVOLUNTARY RECALLS AND OTHER ACTIONS BY THESE
 AUTHORITIES, AND CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCT SAFETY MAY LEAD THE
 COMPANY TO VOLUNTARILY RECALL, ACCEPT RETURNS OR DISCONTINUE THE
 SALE OF SELECTED PRODUCTS. PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS COULD EXCEED
 OR FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE COMPANY S INSURANCE
 COVERAGE. RECALLS OR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN
 DECREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS,
 DAMAGE

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

TO THE COMPANY S REPUTATION, A DIVERSION OF
 MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM ITS BUSINESS, AND INCREASED
 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT COSTS, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD
 ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S OPERATING RESULTS.

CUSTOMER
 PRICING PRESSURES COULD RESULT IN LOWER SELLING PRICES, WHICH
 COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S OPERATING
 RESULTS. 

THE COMPANY S CUSTOMERS COULD PLACE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY
 TO REDUCE THE PRICES OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY
 STRIVES TO STAY AHEAD OF ITS COMPETITION IN SOURCING, WHICH
 ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN LOWER COST PRODUCTS WHILE
 MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY. THERE CAN BE NO
 ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY COULD RESPOND TO A DECREASE IN SALES
 PRICES BY PROPORTIONATELY REDUCING ITS COSTS, WHICH COULD
 ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S OPERATING RESULTS.

A
 STOCKHOLDER COULD LOSE ALL OR A PORTION OF HIS INVESTMENT IN THE
 COMPANY. 

THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED A
 DEGREE OF PRICE VARIABILITY, AND THE PRICE COULD BE SUBJECT TO
 RAPID AND SUBSTANTIAL FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY S COMMON
 STOCK HAS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN THINLY TRADED, A CIRCUMSTANCE
 THAT EXISTS WHEN THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL VOLUME OF BUY AND
 SELL ORDERS FOR THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK AT ANY GIVEN
 POINT IN TIME. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, A STOCKHOLDER MAY BE UNABLE
 TO LIQUIDATE HIS POSITION IN THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK AT
 THE DESIRED PRICE. ALSO, AS AN EQUITY INVESTMENT, A
 STOCKHOLDER S INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IS SUBORDINATE TO
 THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY S CREDITORS, AND A STOCKHOLDER
 COULD LOSE ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF HIS INVESTMENT IN THE
 COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF A VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY
 FILING.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

SET FORTH BELOW ARE THE RISKS THE PARTNERSHIP
BELIEVES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS. THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OPERATE IN A CONTINUALLY
CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND, THEREFORE, NEW RISKS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS SECTION CONTAINS SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, SEE ITEM 7. 

(A) RISKS ARISING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE RULES GOVERNING LOW INCOME HOUSING
TAX CREDITS 

LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE . IF A HOUSING COMPLEX DOES NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42,
THEN THE HOUSING COMPLEX WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. 

LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS MIGHT BE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED . THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS.
NO OPINION OF COUNSEL WILL COVER THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THE IRS COULD CHALLENGE THE AMOUNT
OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS CLAIMED FOR ANY HOUSING COMPLEX UNDER ANY OF A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN INTERNAL
REVENUE CODE SECTION 42. A SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE BY THE IRS WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS FROM
THE AMOUNT PAID FOR BY THE PARTNERSHIP. 

UNLESS A BOND IS POSTED
OR A TREASURY DIRECT ACCOUNT IS ESTABLISHED, LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS MAY BE RECAPTURED IF HOUSING COMPLEXES ARE NOT OWNED
AND OPERATED FOR 15 YEARS . HOUSING COMPLEXES MUST COMPLY WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42 FOR THE 15-YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS WILL BE RECAPTURED WITH INTEREST TO THE EXTENT THAT A HOUSING COMPLEX IS NOT RENTED AS LOW INCOME
HOUSING OR IN SOME OTHER WAY DOES NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42 DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
FOR EXAMPLE, UNLESS A BOND IS POSTED OR A TREASURY DIRECT ACCOUNT IS ESTABLISHED, RECAPTURE WITH INTEREST WOULD OCCUR IF: 

A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP DISPOSED OF
ITS INTEREST IN A HOUSING COMPLEX DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD, OR 

THE PARTNERSHIP DISPOSED OF ITS INTEREST
IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD. 

FOR THESE PURPOSES, DISPOSITION INCLUDES TRANSFER
BY WAY OF FORECLOSURE. 

IT WILL BE UP TO THE PARTNERSHIP TO DETERMINE
WHETHER TO POST A BOND. THERE IS NO OBLIGATION UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT THE LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS MUST DO SO. 

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT RECAPTURE WILL
NOT OCCUR. IF IT DOES, RECAPTURE WILL BE A PORTION OF ALL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TAKEN IN PRIOR YEARS FOR THAT HOUSING
COMPLEX, PLUS INTEREST. DURING THE FIRST 11 YEARS OF THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD, NON-COMPLIANCE RESULTS IN ONE-THIRD OF THE LOW INCOME
HOUSING TAX CREDITS UP TO THAT POINT FOR THE PARTICULAR HOUSING COMPLEX BEING RECAPTURED, PLUS INTEREST. BETWEEN YEARS 12 AND 15,
THE RECAPTURE IS PHASED OUT RATABLY. 

4 

SALES OF HOUSING COMPLEXES
AFTER 15 YEARS ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY IMPACT A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX .
EACH LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP EXECUTES AN EXTENDED LOW INCOME HOUSING COMMITMENT WITH THE STATE IN WHICH THE HOUSING COMPLEX IS
LOCATED. THE EXTENDED LOW INCOME HOUSING COMMITMENT STATES THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AND ANY SUBSEQUENT
OWNERS MUST RENT THE HOUSING COMPLEX AS LOW INCOME HOUSING. UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE COMMITMENT MUST BE FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS. THE
COMMITMENT, ACTUALLY AGREED TO, MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN 30 YEARS. IN PRIORITIZING APPLICANTS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS, MOST STATES GIVE ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR COMMITMENT PERIODS IN EXCESS OF 30 YEARS. ON ANY SALE OF THE HOUSING COMPLEX DURING
THE COMMITMENT PERIOD, THE PURCHASER WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO CONTINUE TO RENT THE HOUSING COMPLEX AS LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR THE
DURATION OF THE COMMITMENT PERIOD. THIS REQUIREMENT REDUCES THE POTENTIAL MARKET, AND POSSIBLY THE SALES PRICE, FOR THE HOUSING
COMPLEXES. THE SALE OF A HOUSING COMPLEX MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LENDERS OR SUBSIDIZERS MAY
HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE A PURCHASE OF A HOUSING COMPLEX. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP WILL BE ABLE TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX. EVEN IF IT DOES SO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY AMOUNT OF CASH WILL
BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS. THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD FIRST USE SALE PROCEEDS TO PAY OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP. AS
A RESULT, A MATERIAL PORTION OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS MAY REPRESENT A RETURN OF THE MONEY ORIGINALLY INVESTED IN THE
PARTNERSHIP. 

AS PART OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED HEALTH CARE
LEGISLATION, CONGRESS HAS CODIFIED THE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE DOCTRINE. BECAUSE OF ITS RECENT ENACTMENT, THE FULL REACH OF THIS PROVISION
IS UNCLEAR. INASMUCH AS HOUSING COMPLEXES MIGHT OFFER NO BENEFIT TO A PURCHASER OTHER THAN TAX BENEFITS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE
ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE DOCTRINE COULD BE INTERPRETED TO LIMIT DEDUCTION OF TAX LOSSES FROM HOUSING COMPLEXES, WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED
TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SALE VALUE OF THE HOUSING COMPLEXES AND THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS. 

LIMITED PARTNERS CAN
ONLY USE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS IN LIMITED AMOUNTS . THE ABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER NON-CORPORATE LIMITED PARTNER
TO CLAIM LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ON HIS INDIVIDUAL TAX RETURN IS LIMITED. FOR EXAMPLE, AN INDIVIDUAL LIMITED PARTNER CAN
USE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TO REDUCE HIS TAX LIABILITY ON: 

AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF PASSIVE INCOME,
WHICH IS INCOME FROM ENTITIES SUCH AS THE PARTNERSHIP, AND 

25,000 IN INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES. 

HOWEVER, THE USE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS BY AN INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THESE TYPES OF INCOME IS SUBJECT TO ORDERING RULES, WHICH MAY FURTHER LIMIT THE USE OF LOW INCOME
HOUSING TAX CREDITS. SOME CORPORATE LIMITED PARTNERS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. THEY INCLUDE CORPORATIONS WHICH
PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICES, AND CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE OWNED BY FIVE OR FEWER SHAREHOLDERS. 

ANY PORTION OF A LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT
WHICH IS ALLOWED TO A LIMITED PARTNER UNDER SUCH RULES IS THEN AGGREGATED WITH ALL OF THE LIMITED PARTNER S OTHER BUSINESS
CREDITS. THE AGGREGATE IS THEN SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL LIMITATION ON ALL BUSINESS CREDITS. THAT LIMITATION PROVIDES THAT A LIMITED
PARTNER CAN USE BUSINESS CREDITS TO OFFSET THE LIMITED PARTNER S ANNUAL TAX LIABILITY EQUAL TO 25,000 PLUS 75 OF THE LIMITED
PARTNER S TAX LIABILITY IN EXCESS OF 25,000. HOWEVER, BUSINESS CREDITS MAY NOT BE USED TO OFFSET ANY ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM
TAX. ALL OF THESE CONCEPTS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED. 

(B) RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND HOUSING COMPLEXES 

BECAUSE THE PARTNERSHIP
HAS FEW INVESTMENTS, EACH INVESTMENT WILL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIP S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ANY SINGLE
HOUSING COMPLEX EXPERIENCING POOR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, IMPAIRMENT OF VALUE OR RECAPTURE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS WILL
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE PARTNERSHIP AS A WHOLE. 

THE FAILURE TO PAY MORTGAGE
DEBT COULD RESULT IN A FORCED SALE OF A HOUSING COMPLEX . EACH LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP LEVERAGES THE PARTNERSHIP S INVESTMENT
THEREIN BY INCURRING MORTGAGE DEBT. A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP S REVENUES COULD BE LESS THAN ITS DEBT PAYMENTS AND TAXES
AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS. IF SO, THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE TO USE WORKING CAPITAL RESERVES, SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDS,
OR SUFFER A FORCED SALE OF ITS HOUSING COMPLEX, WHICH COULD INCLUDE A FORECLOSURE. THE SAME RESULTS COULD OCCUR IF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES
CEASED. 

5 

FORECLOSURE WOULD RESULT
IN A LOSS OF THE PARTNERSHIP S CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE HOUSING COMPLEX. FORECLOSURE COULD ALSO RESULT IN A RECAPTURE OF LOW
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, AND A LOSS OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FORECLOSURE OCCURS. IF THE HOUSING
COMPLEX IS HIGHLY-LEVERAGED, A RELATIVELY SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE RENTAL REVENUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP S
ABILITY TO PAY ITS DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. MORTGAGE DEBT MAY BE REPAYABLE IN A SELF-AMORTIZING SERIES OF EQUAL INSTALLMENTS
OR WITH A LARGE BALLOON FINAL PAYMENT. BALLOON PAYMENTS MATURING PRIOR TO THE END OF THE ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE HOUSING
COMPLEX CREATE THE RISK OF A FORCED SALE IF THE DEBT CANNOT BE REFINANCED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL
BE AVAILABLE TO ANY LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IF NEEDED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. 

THE PARTNERSHIP DOES
NOT CONTROL THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND MUST RELY ON THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS . THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS WILL MAKE
ALL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS FOR THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. THE PARTNERSHIP HAS VERY LIMITED RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT OF THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE ANY CONTROL WITH RESPECT
TO LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP BUSINESS DECISIONS AND OPERATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SUCCESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP WILL DEPEND ON THE
ABILITIES OF THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS. 

HOUSING COMPLEXES SUBSIDIZED
BY OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RULES WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AND SELL HOUSING COMPLEXES .
SOME OR ALL OF THE HOUSING COMPLEXES RECEIVE OR MAY RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES IN ADDITION TO LOW INCOME
HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THE FOLLOWING ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME SUCH SUBSIDY PROGRAMS: 

OBTAINING TENANTS FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEXES.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS LIMIT THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO CAN RENT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THESE REGULATIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
TO RENT THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS IN THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. 

OBTAINING RENT INCREASES. IN MANY CASES
RENTS CAN ONLY BE INCREASED WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE SUBSIDIZING AGENCY. 

LIMITATIONS ON CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. THE
AMOUNT OF CASH THAT MAY BE DISTRIBUTED TO OWNERS OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE EARNED BY
THE OWNERS OF NON-SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES. 

LIMITATIONS ON SALE OR REFINANCING OF
THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX OR TO REFINANCE ITS MORTGAGE LOAN
WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE LENDER. THE LENDER MAY WITHHOLD SUCH APPROVAL IN THE DISCRETION OF THE LENDER. APPROVAL MAY BE
SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION THAT THE PURCHASER CONTINUES TO OPERATE THE PROPERTY AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR TERMS
WHICH COULD BE AS LONG AS 30 YEARS OR MORE. IN ADDITION, ANY PREPAYMENT OF A MORTGAGE MAY RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF A PREPAYMENT
PENALTY. 

LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS
IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ITS INTEREST IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT THE PRIOR
APPROVAL OF THE LENDER. THE LENDER MAY WITHHOLD SUCH APPROVAL IN THE DISCRETION OF THE LENDER. APPROVAL MAY BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS. 

LIMITATIONS ON REMOVAL AND ADMISSION OF
LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS. THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO REMOVE A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER FROM A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP EXCEPT
FOR CAUSE, SUCH AS THE VIOLATION OF THE RULES OF THE LENDER OR STATE ALLOCATING AUTHORITY. REGULATIONS MAY PROHIBIT THE REMOVAL
OF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER OR PERMIT REMOVAL ONLY WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE LENDER. REGULATIONS MAY ALSO REQUIRE APPROVAL
OF THE ADMISSION OF A SUCCESSOR LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER EVEN UPON THE DEATH OR OTHER DISABILITY OF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER. 

LIMITATIONS ON SUBSIDY PAYMENTS. SUBSIDY
PAYMENTS MAY BE FIXED IN AMOUNT AND SUBJECT TO ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS. THE RENTAL REVENUES OF A HOUSING COMPLEX, WHEN
COMBINED WITH THE MAXIMUM COMMITTED SUBSIDY, MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET OBLIGATIONS. CONGRESS OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE, AS THE
CASE MAY BE, MAY FAIL TO APPROPRIATE OR INCREASE THE NECESSARY SUBSIDY. IN THOSE EVENTS, THE MORTGAGE LENDER COULD FORECLOSE ON
THE HOUSING COMPLEX UNLESS A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT COULD BE NEGOTIATED. 

POSSIBLE CHANGES IN APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED WHICH ADVERSELY REVISES PROVISIONS OF OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE LOANS. SUCH LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ENACTED
IN THE PAST. 

LIMITED PARTNERS MAY NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS
IF HOUSING COMPLEXES ARE SOLD. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT LIMITED PARTNERS WILL RECEIVE ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SALE OR
REFINANCING OF A HOUSING COMPLEX. THE PRICE AT WHICH A HOUSING COMPLEX IS SOLD MAY NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH TO PAY THE MORTGAGE AND OTHER
EXPENSES AT THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AND PARTNERSHIPS LEVELS WHICH MUST BE PAID AT SUCH TIME. IF THAT HAPPENS, A LIMITED PARTNER S
RETURN WOULD BE DERIVED ONLY FROM THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES. 

6 

UNINSURED CASUALTIES
COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND RECAPTURE . THERE ARE CASUALTIES WHICH ARE EITHER UNINSURABLE OR NOT ECONOMICALLY INSURABLE. THESE
INCLUDE EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, WARS AND LOSSES RELATING TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. IF A HOUSING COMPLEX EXPERIENCED
AN UNINSURED CASUALTY, THE PARTNERSHIP COULD LOSE BOTH ITS INVESTED CAPITAL AND ANTICIPATED PROFITS IN SUCH PROPERTY. EVEN IF THE
CASUALTY WERE AN INSURED LOSS, THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE UNABLE TO REBUILD THE DESTROYED PROPERTY. A PORTION OF PRIOR
TAX CREDITS COULD BE RECAPTURED AND FUTURE TAX CREDITS COULD BE LOST IF THE HOUSING COMPLEX WERE NOT RESTORED WITHIN A REASONABLE
PERIOD OF TIME. ANY LIABILITY JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP COULD EXCEED AVAILABLE INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR OTHERWISE
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. THE COST OF LIABILITY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT
YEARS. CASUALTY INSURANCE HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND MAY REQUIRE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS. 

HOUSING COMPLEXES WITHOUT
FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES . IF A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WERE UNABLE TO PAY
OPERATING EXPENSES, ONE RESULT COULD BE A FORCED SALE OF ITS HOUSING COMPLEX. IF A FORCED SALE OCCURS DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD
OF A HOUSING COMPLEX, A PARTIAL RECAPTURE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS COULD OCCUR. IN THIS REGARD, SOME OF THE LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS MAY OWN HOUSING COMPLEXES WHICH HAVE NO SUBSIDIES OTHER THAN LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THOSE HOUSING COMPLEXES
DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BELOW-MARKET-INTEREST-RATE FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES WHICH OFTEN ARE IMPORTANT TO THE FEASIBILITY
OF LOW INCOME HOUSING. THOSE HOUSING COMPLEXES RELY SOLELY ON RENTS TO PAY EXPENSES. HOWEVER, IN ORDER FOR ANY HOUSING COMPLEX
TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, IT MUST RESTRICT THE RENT WHICH MAY BE CHARGED TO TENANTS. OVER TIME, THE EXPENSES
OF A HOUSING COMPLEX WILL INCREASE. IF A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP CANNOT INCREASE ITS RENTS, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY INCREASED
OPERATING EXPENSES. 

THE PARTNERSHIP S
INVESTMENT PROTECTION POLICIES WILL BE WORTHLESS IF THE NET WORTH OF THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THEIR
OBLIGATIONS. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS WILL BE UNABLE TO PERFORM THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARTNERSHIP.
THE GENERAL PARTNER HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM NET WORTH REQUIREMENT FOR THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS. RATHER, EACH LOCAL GENERAL
PARTNER DEMONSTRATES A NET WORTH WHICH THE GENERAL PARTNER BELIEVES IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE ASSETS OF THE LOCAL
GENERAL PARTNERS ARE LIKELY TO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS AND SIMILAR ASSETS. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE TYPES
OF ASSETS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. THESE TYPES OF ASSETS CANNOT BE READILY LIQUIDATED TO SATISFY THE FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND
COMMITMENTS WHICH THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS MAKE TO THE PARTNERSHIP. MOREOVER, OTHER CREDITORS MAY HAVE CLAIMS ON THESE ASSETS.
NO ESCROW ACCOUNTS OR OTHER SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE PERFORMANCE OF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER S
OBLIGATIONS. THE COST TO ENFORCE A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER S OBLIGATIONS MAY BE HIGH. IF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER DOES NOT SATISFY
ITS OBLIGATIONS THE PARTNERSHIP MAY HAVE NO REMEDY, OR THE REMEDY MAY BE LIMITED TO REMOVING THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER AS GENERAL
PARTNER OF THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. 

FLUCTUATING ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS CAN REDUCE THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE . THE PARTNERSHIP S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS PROVIDING ITS LIMITED
PARTNERS WITH LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, NOT THE GENERATION OF GAINS FROM THE APPRECIATION OF REAL ESTATE HELD BY THE LOCAL
LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE PARTNERSHIP HAS CARRIED ITS INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AT
VALUES EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE REMAINING FUTURE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ESTIMATED TO BE
ALLOCATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE TO THE PARTNERSHIP OF ITS INTERESTS IN THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. 

ANY INVESTMENT IN REAL
ESTATE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM FLUCTUATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY TO REALIZE A
PROFIT OR EVEN TO RECOVER INVESTED CAPITAL. AMONG THESE CONDITIONS ARE: 

THE GENERAL AND LOCAL JOB MARKET, 

THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF MORTGAGE
FINANCING, 

MONETARY INFLATION, 

TAX, ENVIRONMENTAL, LAND USE AND ZONING
POLICIES, 

THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR SIMILAR PROPERTIES, 

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS, 

THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF UTILITIES
AND WATER. 

7 

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS
ENDED MARCH 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010, A LOSS IN VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, OTHER THAN A TEMPORARY DECLINE,
IS RECORDED BY THE PARTNERSHIP IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS. IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE PARTNERSHIP S
CARRYING AMOUNT IN THE INVESTMENT TO THE SUM OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE REMAINING FUTURE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ESTIMATED
TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AND ANY ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE TO THE PARTNERSHIP. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012, 2011
AND 2010, IMPAIRMENT LOSS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS WAS 1,113,185, 1,015,218, AND 876,565, RESPECTIVELY. 

(C) TAX RISKS OTHER THAN THOSE RELATING TO TAX CREDITS 

IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY
TO LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, THERE ARE OTHER FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT
LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: 

NO OPINION OF COUNSEL
AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS . NO LEGAL OPINION IS OBTAINED REGARDING MATTERS: 

THE DETERMINATION OF WHICH DEPENDS ON
FUTURE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, 

WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO INDIVIDUAL LIMITED
PARTNERS, OR 

WHICH ARE NOT CUSTOMARILY THE SUBJECT
OF AN OPINION. 

THE MORE SIGNIFICANT OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE: 

ALLOCATING PURCHASE PRICE AMONG COMPONENTS
OF A PROPERTY, PARTICULARLY AS BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND FIXTURES, THE COST OF WHICH IS DEPRECIABLE, AND THE UNDERLYING LAND, THE COST
OF WHICH IS NOT DEPRECIABLE, 

CHARACTERIZING EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS MADE
TO OR BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, 

IDENTIFYING THE PORTION OF THE COSTS OF
ANY HOUSING COMPLEX WHICH QUALIFY FOR HISTORIC AND OTHER TAX CREDITS, 

APPLYING TO ANY SPECIFIC LIMITED PARTNER
THE LIMITATION ON THE USE OF TAX CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES. LIMITED PARTNERS MUST DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY
CAN USE TAX CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES, AND 

THE APPLICATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX TO
 ANY SPECIFIC LIMITED PARTNER, OR THE CALCULATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX BY ANY LIMITED PARTNER. THE ALTERNATIVE
 MINIMUM TAX COULD REDUCE THE TAX BENEFITS FROM AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP 

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, THEREFORE, THAT
THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE SOME OF THE TAX POSITIONS ADOPTED BY THE PARTNERSHIP. THE COURTS COULD SUSTAIN AN IRS CHALLENGE. AN
IRS CHALLENGE, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE PARTNERSHIP S ABILITY TO REALIZE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. 

PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES
WILL LIMIT DEDUCTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP S LOSSES AND IMPOSE TAX ON INTEREST INCOME. THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IMPOSES
LIMITS ON THE ABILITY OF MOST INVESTORS TO CLAIM LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE. AN INDIVIDUAL MAY CLAIM THESE SO-CALLED
PASSIVE LOSSES ONLY AS AN OFFSET TO INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE OR RENTAL ACTIVITIES. AN INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT CLAIM PASSIVE
LOSSES AS AN OFFSET AGAINST OTHER TYPES OF INCOME, SUCH AS SALARIES, WAGES, DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST. THESE PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES
WILL RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF MOST LIMITED PARTNERS TO USE LOSSES FROM THE PARTNERSHIP AS AN OFFSET OF NON-PASSIVE INCOME. 

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY
EARN INTEREST INCOME ON ITS RESERVES AND LOANS . THE PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES GENERALLY WILL CATEGORIZE INTEREST AS PORTFOLIO
INCOME, AND NOT PASSIVE INCOME. PASSIVE LOSSES CANNOT BE USED AS AN OFFSET TO PORTFOLIO INCOME. CONSEQUENTLY, A LIMITED PARTNER
COULD PAY TAX LIABILITY ON PORTFOLIO INCOME FROM THE PARTNERSHIP. 

AT RISK RULES MIGHT
LIMIT DEDUCTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP S LOSSES . IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FINANCING USED TO PURCHASE HOUSING COMPLEXES
DOES NOT CONSIST OF QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE FINANCING, THE AT RISK RULES WILL LIMIT A LIMITED PARTNER S ABILITY
TO CLAIM PARTNERSHIP LOSSES TO THE AMOUNT THE LIMITED PARTNER INVESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THE AT RISK RULES OF THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE GENERALLY LIMIT A LIMITED PARTNER S ABILITY TO DEDUCT PARTNERSHIP LOSSES TO THE SUM OF: 

THE AMOUNT OF CASH THE LIMITED PARTNER
INVESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP, AND 

THE LIMITED PARTNER S SHARE OF PARTNERSHIP
QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE FINANCING. 

8 

QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE FINANCING IS NON-CONVERTIBLE,
NONRECOURSE DEBT WHICH IS BORROWED FROM A GOVERNMENT, OR WITH EXCEPTIONS, ANY PERSON ACTIVELY AND REGULARLY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS
OF LENDING MONEY. 

TAX LIABILITY ON SALE
OF A HOUSING COMPLEX OR LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST MAY EXCEED THE CASH AVAILABLE FROM THE SALE . WHEN A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP SELLS A HOUSING COMPLEX IT WILL RECOGNIZE GAIN. SUCH GAIN IS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN: 

THE SALES PROCEEDS PLUS THE AMOUNT OF
INDEBTEDNESS SECURED BY THE HOUSING COMPLEX, AND 

THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEX.
THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR A HOUSING COMPLEX IS ITS ORIGINAL COST, PLUS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, MINUS DEPRECIATION. 

SIMILARLY, WHEN THE PARTNERSHIP SELLS AN INTEREST
IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP THE PARTNERSHIP WILL RECOGNIZE GAIN. SUCH GAIN IS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN: 

THE SALES PROCEEDS PLUS THE PARTNERSHIP S
SHARE OF THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS SECURED BY THE HOUSING COMPLEX, AND 

THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR THE INTEREST. THE
ADJUSTED BASIS FOR AN INTEREST IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IS THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE INTEREST, PLUS INCOME ALLOCATIONS AND
CASH DISTRIBUTIONS, LESS LOSS ALLOCATIONS. 

ACCORDINGLY, GAIN WILL BE INCREASED BY THE
DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS TAKEN DURING THE HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEX. IN SOME CASES, A LIMITED PARTNER COULD HAVE A
TAX LIABILITY FROM A SALE GREATER THAN THE CASH DISTRIBUTED TO THE LIMITED PARTNER FROM THE SALE. 

IRS COULD AUDIT THE
RETURNS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR THE LIMITED PARTNERS . THE IRS CAN AUDIT THE PARTNERSHIP OR A
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AT THE ENTITY LEVEL WITH REGARD TO ISSUES AFFECTING THE ENTITY. THE IRS DOES NOT HAVE TO AUDIT EACH LIMITED
PARTNER IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE A POSITION TAKEN BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. SIMILARLY, ONLY ONE JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING CAN BE FILED TO CONTEST AN IRS DETERMINATION. A CONTEST BY THE PARTNERSHIP OF ANY IRS DETERMINATION MIGHT RESULT IN
HIGH LEGAL FEES. 

AN AUDIT OF THE PARTNERSHIP
OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ALSO COULD RESULT IN AN AUDIT OF A LIMITED PARTNER. AN AUDIT OF A LIMITED PARTNER S TAX
RETURNS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS BOTH TO ITEMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AND TO UNRELATED ITEMS. THE LIMITED PARTNER
COULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO FILE AMENDED TAX RETURNS AND PAY ADDITIONAL TAX PLUS INTEREST AND PENALTIES. 

A SUCCESSFUL IRS CHALLENGE
TO TAX ALLOCATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WOULD REDUCE THE TAX BENEFITS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP.
 UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, A PARTNERSHIP S ALLOCATION OF INCOME, GAINS, DEDUCTIONS, LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS MUST
HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT. SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT IS A HIGHLY-TECHNICAL CONCEPT. THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IS TWO-FOLD.
IF A PARTNER WILL BENEFIT ECONOMICALLY FROM AN ITEM OF PARTNERSHIP INCOME OR GAIN, THAT ITEM MUST BE ALLOCATED TO HIM SO THAT HE
BEARS THE CORRELATIVE TAX BURDEN. CONVERSELY, IF A PARTNER WILL SUFFER ECONOMICALLY FROM AN ITEM OF PARTNERSHIP DEDUCTION OR LOSS,
THAT ITEM MUST BE ALLOCATED TO HIM SO THAT HE BEARS THE CORRELATIVE TAX BENEFIT. IF A PARTNERSHIP S ALLOCATIONS DO NOT HAVE
SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT, THEN THE PARTNERSHIP S TAX ITEMS ARE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH PARTNER S INTEREST
IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THE IRS MIGHT CHALLENGE THE ALLOCATIONS MADE BY THE PARTNERSHIP: 

BETWEEN THE LIMITED PARTNERS AND THE GENERAL
PARTNER, 

AMONG THE LIMITED PARTNERS, OR 

BETWEEN THE PARTNERSHIP AND A LOCAL GENERAL
PARTNER. 

IF ANY ALLOCATIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED,
A GREATER SHARE OF THE INCOME OR GAIN OR A LESSER SHARE OF THE LOSSES OR TAX CREDITS MIGHT BE ALLOCATED TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS.
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE TAX LIABILITY OR REDUCE THE TAX BENEFITS TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS. 

9 

TAX LIABILITIES COULD
ARISE IN LATER YEARS OF THE PARTNERSHIP . AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FOLLOWING COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS BY A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MAY GENERATE PROFITS RATHER THAN LOSSES. A LIMITED PARTNER WOULD HAVE TAX LIABILITY ON HIS SHARE
OF SUCH PROFITS UNLESS HE COULD OFFSET THE INCOME WITH: 

UNUSED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THE PARTNERSHIP
OR OTHER INVESTMENTS, OR 

CURRENT PASSIVE LOSSES FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS.

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIMITED PARTNER
WOULD NOT RECEIVE A CASH DISTRIBUTION FROM THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WHICH TO PAY ANY TAX LIABILITY. 

IRS CHALLENGE TO TAX
TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURES COULD REDUCE LOSSES . THE IRS MAY CONTEND THAT FEES AND PAYMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP: 

SHOULD BE DEDUCTIBLE OVER A LONGER PERIOD
OF TIME OR IN A LATER YEAR, 

ARE EXCESSIVE AND MAY NOT BE CAPITALIZED
OR DEDUCTED IN FULL, 

SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED AND NOT DEDUCTED,
OR 

MAY NOT BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE BASIS
FOR COMPUTING TAX CREDITS. 

ANY SUCH CONTENTION BY THE IRS COULD ADVERSELY
IMPACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

THE ELIGIBLE BASIS OF A HOUSING COMPLEX
USED TO COMPUTE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, 

THE ADJUSTED BASIS OF A HOUSING COMPLEX
USED TO COMPUTE DEPRECIATION, 

THE CORRECT DEDUCTION OF FEES, 

THE AMORTIZATION OF ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING
EXPENSES AND START-UP EXPENDITURES. 

IF THE IRS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY SUCH CONTENTION,
THE ANTICIPATED LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES OF THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE REDUCED, PERHAPS SUBSTANTIALLY. 

CHANGES IN TAX LAW MIGHT
REDUCE THE VALUE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS . ALTHOUGH ALL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED TO A HOUSING
COMPLEX AT COMMENCEMENT OF THE 10-YEAR CREDIT PERIOD, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION MAY NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT
AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, LEGISLATION COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE VALUE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS.
IN THIS REGARD, BEFORE 1986, THE PRINCIPAL TAX BENEFIT OF AN INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME HOUSING WAS TAX LOSSES. THESE TAX LOSSES
GENERALLY WERE USED TO REDUCE AN INVESTOR S INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES ON A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN LOW INCOME
HOUSING WERE MADE IN RELIANCE ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH TAX BENEFITS. HOWEVER, TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED IN 1986 SEVERELY CURTAILED
DEDUCTION OF SUCH LOSSES. 

NEW ADMINISTRATIVE OR
JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW MIGHT REDUCE THE VALUE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE RELATED TO LOW INCOME HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE IRS IN REGULATIONS,
RULINGS OR PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS, OR BY THE COURTS. IN THE FUTURE, THESE PROVISIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED OR CLARIFIED BY THE IRS OR
THE COURTS IN A MANNER ADVERSE TO THE PARTNERSHIP OR THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE IRS CONSTANTLY REVIEWS THE FEDERAL TAX
RULES, AND CAN REVISE ITS INTERPRETATIONS OF ESTABLISHED CONCEPTS. ANY SUCH REVISIONS COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED
WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP. 

STATE INCOME TAX LAWS
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LIMITED PARTNERS . A LIMITED PARTNER MAY BE REQUIRED TO FILE INCOME TAX RETURNS AND BE SUBJECT TO TAX
AND WITHHOLDING IN EACH STATE OR LOCAL TAXING JURISDICTION IN WHICH: A HOUSING COMPLEX IS LOCATED, THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP ENGAGES IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, OR THE LIMITED PARTNER IS A RESIDENT. CORPORATE LIMITED PARTNERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO
PAY STATE FRANCHISE TAXES. 

THE TAX TREATMENT OF
PARTICULAR ITEMS UNDER STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX LAWS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF SUCH ITEMS. 
NONETHELESS, MANY OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP MAY ALSO APPLY UNDER STATE OR
LOCAL INCOME TAX LAW. THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BE REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD STATE TAXES FROM DISTRIBUTIONS OR INCOME ALLOCATIONS TO LIMITED
PARTNERS IN SOME INSTANCES. 

10 

(D) RISKS RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY
BE UNABLE TO TIMELY PROVIDE FINANCIAL REPORTS TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MONITOR PARTNERSHIP
OPERATIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO TIMELY FILE AND PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ALL OF ITS REQUIRED PERIODIC
REPORTS. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE DELAY HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. EACH LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER IS REQUIRED TO RETAIN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS AND TO REPORT FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN A TIMELY MANNER. THERE CANNOT BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE LOCAL
GENERAL PARTNERS WILL SATISFY THESE OBLIGATIONS. IF NOT, THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS IN
A TIMELY MANNER ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS. THAT WOULD IMPACT THE LIMITED PARTNERS ABILITY TO MONITOR PARTNERSHIP
OPERATIONS. THE PARTNERSHIP S FAILURE TO MEET ITS FILING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 COULD REDUCE
THE LIQUIDITY FOR THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTNERSHIP. THE FAILURE
TO FILE COULD ALSO RESULT IN SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE SEC. ANY DEFENSE MOUNTED BY THE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FACE OF SUCH SANCTIONS
COULD ENTAIL LEGAL AND OTHER FEES, WHICH WOULD DIMINISH CASH RESERVES. 

LACK OF LIQUIDITY OF
INVESTMENT. THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ONE WILL DEVELOP.
ACCORDINGLY, LIMITED PARTNERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR PARTNERSHIP UNITS PROMPTLY OR AT A REASONABLE PRICE. PARTNERSHIP UNITS
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE PARTNERSHIP IS UNLIKELY TO SELL ANY LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
FOR AT LEAST 15 YEARS. PARTNERSHIP UNITS CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED TO TAX-EXEMPT OR FOREIGN ENTITIES, OR THROUGH A SECONDARY MARKET.
THE GENERAL PARTNER CAN DENY EFFECTIVENESS OF A TRANSFER IF NECESSARY TO AVOID ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES FROM THE TRANSFER. THE
GENERAL PARTNER DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY PARTNERSHIP UNITS WILL BE REDEEMED BY THE PARTNERSHIP. 

THE LIMITED PARTNERS
WILL NOT CONTROL THE PARTNERSHIP AND MUST RELY TOTALLY ON THE GENERAL PARTNER . THE GENERAL PARTNER WILL MAKE ALL MANAGEMENT
DECISIONS FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. MANAGEMENT DECISIONS INCLUDE EXERCISING POWERS GRANTED TO THE PARTNERSHIP BY A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.
LIMITED PARTNERS HAVE NO RIGHT OR POWER TO TAKE PART IN PARTNERSHIP MANAGEMENT. 

INDIVIDUAL LIMITED PARTNERS WILL HAVE NO RECOURSE
IF THEY DISAGREE WITH ACTIONS AUTHORIZED BY A VOTE OF THE MAJORITY. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT GRANTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS OWNING
MORE THAN 50 OF THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS THE RIGHT TO: 

REMOVE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ELECT A
REPLACEMENT GENERAL PARTNER, 

AMEND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, 

TERMINATE THE PARTNERSHIP. 

ACCORDINGLY, A MAJORITY-IN-INTEREST OF THE
LIMITED PARTNERS COULD CAUSE ANY SUCH EVENTS TO OCCUR, EVEN IF LIMITED PARTNERS OWNING 49 OF THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS OPPOSED SUCH
ACTION. 

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO THE PARTNERSHIP . THE ABILITY OF LIMITED PARTNERS TO SUE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES IS
SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES TO THE LIMITED
PARTNERS. THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS FOR ACTS AND OMISSIONS: PERFORMED OR
OMITTED IN GOOD FAITH, AND PERFORMED OR OMITTED IN A MANNER WHICH THE GENERAL PARTNER REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE WITHIN THE SCOPE
OF ITS AUTHORITY AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS, PROVIDED SUCH CONDUCT DID NOT CONSTITUTE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT. 

THEREFORE, LIMITED PARTNERS MAY BE LESS ABLE
TO SUE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF SUCH PROVISIONS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. 

ASSOCIATES AND ITS AFFILIATES
ARE SERVING AS THE GENERAL PARTNERS OF MANY OTHER PARTNERSHIPS . DEPENDING ON THEIR CORPORATE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THE OFFICERS
OF ASSOCIATES INITIALLY DEVOTE APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 50 OF THEIR TIME TO THE PARTNERSHIP. THESE INDIVIDUALS SPEND SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS TIME DEVOTED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AFTER THE INVESTMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP S CAPITAL IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. 

11 

THE INTERESTS OF LIMITED
PARTNERS MAY CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES . THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES ARE
COMMITTED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF MORE THAN 100 OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE INVESTMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP.
THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIP. THE GENERAL PARTNER DECIDES HOW THE
PARTNERSHIP S INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING COMPLEXES ARE MANAGED, AND WHEN THE INVESTMENTS WILL BE SOLD. THE GENERAL PARTNER MAY
FACE A CONFLICT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE THE GENERAL PARTNER S SHARE OF FEES AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TRANSACTION
MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR EXPECTED SHARE OF FEES IF A HOUSING COMPLEX WAS NOT SOLD. THE RESULT OF THESE CONFLICTS COULD BE
THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER MAY MAKE INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE LESS DESIRABLE, OR ON TERMS WHICH ARE LESS FAVORABLE, TO THE PARTNERSHIP
THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE BE THE CASE. THE PARTNERSHIP HAS NOT DEVELOPED ANY FORMAL PROCESS FOR RESOLVING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. HOWEVER,
THE GENERAL PARTNER IS SUBJECT TO A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO EXERCISE GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY IN HANDLING THE AFFAIRS OF THE PARTNERSHIP,
AND THAT DUTY WILL GOVERN ITS ACTIONS IN ALL SUCH MATTERS. FURTHERMORE, THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PARTNERSHIP CAN OPERATE AND SELL
INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS AS OUTLINED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. 

THE
PARTNERSHIP S ACCRUED PAYABLES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF THE ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES PAYABLE TO THE GENERAL PARTNER. THESE
ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES PAYABLE INCREASED BY 118,000, 118,000, AND 131,000, FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012, 2011 AND
2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE PARTNERSHIP S FUTURE CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PAY FUTURE
ANNUAL ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES AND THE PAYABLES DUE TO THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FUTURE ANNUAL ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES
WILL EQUAL APPROXIMATELY 143,000 PER YEAR THROUGH THE TERMINATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP, WHICH MUST OCCUR NO LATER THAN
DECEMBER 31, 2062. THOUGH THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES ARE CONTRACTUALLY CURRENTLY
PAYABLE, THE PARTNERSHIP ANTICIPATES THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF THESE
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL CAPITAL RESERVES ARE IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND
ANTICIPATED FUTURE FORESEEABLE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SHOULD THE GENERAL
PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES DEMAND CURRENT PAYMENT OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OR SUSPEND SERVICES FOR THIS
OR ANY OTHER REASON. 

ASSOCIATES AGREED TO CONTINUE
PROVIDING ADVANCES SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO FUND THE OPERATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP THROUGH JUNE 30,
2013.

HAVE A SINGLE AGREEMENT AND (II) DEALERS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE PURCHASE REQUESTS FROM US AS PART OF A SINGLE AGREEMENT WITH AN AUTOMOTIVE
MANUFACTURER OR ITS AUTOMOTIVE BUYING SERVICE AFFILIATE. OUR LEAD REFERRAL SERVICES CONSIST OF OUR ONLINE NEW CAR MARKETING PROGRAMS, USED VEHICLE PROGRAM AND FINANCE REQUEST PROGRAM. OUR CRM DEALER RELATIONSHIPS CONSIST OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH RETAIL
AND ENTERPRISE DEALERS THAT SUBSCRIBE TO OUR LEAD MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND RETENTION MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR LEAD REFERRAL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS REPRESENT DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED MAKES OF VEHICLES AND LIGHT TRUCKS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR LEAD REFERRAL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 5,570 RETAIL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS, RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR DEALER GROUPS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 740 ENTERPRISE DEALER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EIGHT DIRECT
RELATIONSHIPS ENCOMPASSING 18 BRANDS WITH AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS OR THEIR AUTOMOTIVE BUYING SERVICE AFFILIATES THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE SALES INITIATIVES REPRESENTING UP TO APPROXIMATELY 22,080 ENTERPRISE DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY 740 RETAIL DEALERS HAD MORE THAN ONE RETAIL LEAD REFERRAL DEALER RELATIONSHIP WITH US. A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE FROM LEAD REFERRAL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS IS DERIVED FROM RETAIL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AND ENTERPRISE
DEALER RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR DEALER GROUPS. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR FINANCE LEAD REFERRAL NETWORK INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY 340 RELATIONSHIPS WITH RETAIL DEALERS, FINANCE REQUEST INTERMEDIARIES, AND AUTOMOTIVE FINANCE
COMPANIES WHO PARTICIPATE IN OUR CAR.COM FINANCE REFERRAL NETWORK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CRM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 2,980 DEALERS WHO USE WEB CONTROL, OUR LEAD MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, AND APPROXIMATELY 820 DEALERS

RELATIONSHIPS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CALCULATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS, A DEALER THAT SUBSCRIBES TO THE AUTOBYTEL.COM NEW CAR PROGRAM AND THE AUTOWEB.COM NEW CAR PROGRAM ACCOUNTS FOR TWO RETAIL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS, AND A DEALER THAT SUBSCRIBES TO OUR
WEB CONTROL PRODUCT AND RPM PROGRAM ACCOUNTS FOR TWO CRM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. AS A FURTHER EXAMPLE, A DEALER GROUP THAT OWNS THREE DIFFERENT FRANCHISES AND THAT SUBSCRIBES TO THE AUTOWEB.COM NEW CAR PROGRAM FOR ALL SUCH FRANCHISES ACCOUNTS FOR
THREE RETAIL DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. WEB CONTROL CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS USING WEB CONTROL, RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF FRANCHISES OWNED BY A GIVEN CUSTOMER. WE NO LONGER INCLUDE IMANAGER (OUR LEGACY LEAD MANAGEMENT TOOL) PRODUCT RELATIONSHIPS
WITHIN CRM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS WE ARE OFFERING DEALERS WHO USE IMANAGER THE OPPORTUNITY TO MIGRATE TO WEB CONTROL. DEALERS PARTICIPATE IN OUR BRANDED CAR BUYING NETWORKS BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH US DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A MAJOR DEALER GROUP OR AN AUTOMOTIVE
MANUFACTURER OR ITS AUTOMOTIVE BUYING SERVICE AFFILIATE. IN TURN, WE DIRECT CONSUMERS TO DEALERS IN THEIR LOCAL AREA BASED ON THE CONSUMERS VEHICLE PREFERENCE. WE EXPECT OUR DEALERS TO PROMPTLY PROVIDE CONSUMERS A HAGGLE-FREE, COMPETITIVE
OFFER WITHIN 24 HOURS OF BEING CONTACTED BY THE CUSTOMER. WE RECOMMEND THAT EACH DEALER HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHOSE PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY IS SUPERVISING THE DEALER S INTERNET BUSINESS, SIMILAR TO THE WAY IN WHICH MOST DEALERS HAVE A NEW VEHICLE
SALES MANAGER, USED VEHICLE SALES MANAGER AND SERVICE AND PARTS DEPARTMENT MANAGERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DEALERSHIP FUNCTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT DEALERS WHO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER INQUIRIES, HAVE READILY AVAILABLE INVENTORY AND
PROVIDE UP-FRONT COMPETITIVE PRICING BENEFIT THE MOST FROM OUR MARKETING SERVICES. LEAD FEES PAID BY PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS OR THEIR AUTOMOTIVE BUYING SERVICE AFFILIATES) CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 62 OF OUR
REVENUES IN 2005 COMPARED TO 69 OF OUR REVENUES IN 2004 (INCLUDING FEES PAID FOR FINANCE REQUESTS BEGINNING APRIL 15, 2004). WE CONNECT AUTOMOTIVE MARKETERS WITH THE MILLIONS OF CAR SHOPPERS VISITING OUR BRANDED WEB SITES (AUTOBYTEL.COM, AUTOWEB.COM, CAR.COM, CARSMART.COM,

(AVV WE PROVIDE DEALER LEAD MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND DATA EXTRACTION SERVICES SUCH AS THE WEB CONTROL PRODUCT AND AUTOMOTIVE DOWNLOAD SERVICE SM (ADS SM ). THE WEB CONTROL PRODUCT IS A CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT ENABLES DEALERS TO MANAGE INTERNET AND WALK-IN SALES ACTIVITY, MAINTAIN CUSTOMER HISTORY AND ACTIVITY, MEASURE AND REPORT ON MARKETING EFFECTIVENESS OR RETURN ON
INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS ESTABLISH AUTOMATED MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CUSTOMIZE SALES PROCESS AND WORKFLOW INSIDE THE DEALERSHIP. ADS EXTRACTS DATA, INCLUDING NEW AND USED CAR INVENTORY AND SALES, SERVICE AND FINANCE RECORDS FROM THE DEALERSHIP

IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES, IN 2005, 53 OF NEW CAR BUYERS INDICATED THAT THE INTERNET IMPACTED THEIR MAKE/MODEL PURCHASE DECISION. ACCORDING TO JUPITERMEDIA CORPORATION, BY 2009, 33

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OF ALL NEW CAR SALES WILL BE INTERNET GENERATED, UP FROM 24 IN 2005. STUDIES FROM MAJOR THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH COMPANIES INDICATE THAT CONSUMERS PREFER
INDEPENDENT, MULTI-BRAND WEB SITES FOR PRODUCT REVIEWS, COMPARISONS AND PRICING INFORMATION. THE AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE MARKET. AUTOMOTIVE DEALERS OPERATE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND FACE SIGNIFICANT STATE REGULATIONS AND INCREASING BUSINESS PRESSURES. THESE FRAGMENTED MARKETS ARE
CHARACTERIZED BY: 

COMPETITIVE SALES WITHIN REGIONAL MARKETS, 

INCREASING ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS THAT CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEALER PROFITS, AND 

LARGE INVESTMENTS BY DEALERS IN INVENTORY, REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, PERSONNEL AND OTHER OVERHEAD EXPENSES. THE ONGOING RAPID ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET BY CONSUMERS DURING THEIR VEHICLE
PURCHASING PROCESS HAS RESULTED, IN PART, FROM THE FACT THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TRADITIONALLY ENTERED INTO THE HIGHLY NEGOTIATED SALES PROCESS WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE INFORMATION REGARDING MANUFACTURER S COSTS, LEASING COSTS, FINANCING COSTS,
RELATIVE SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE ONGOING GROWTH OF NEW VEHICLE SALES GENERATED ONLINE IS, IN PART, AN OUTGROWTH OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SALES TACTICS CONSUMERS ASSOCIATE WITH THE TRADITIONAL VEHICLE BUYING
EXPERIENCE. BUYING A VEHICLE IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES A UNITED STATES CONSUMER MAKES. THE AUTOBYTEL SOLUTION WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKETING SERVICES IMPROVE THE VEHICLE PURCHASING PROCESS FOR DEALERS, AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS. THE INTERNET S
WIDE REACH TO CONSUMERS ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE OUR INVESTMENT IN BRANDING AND MARKETING ACROSS A VERY LARGE AUDIENCE TO CREATE QUALIFIED PURCHASE REQUESTS FOR VEHICLES. FOR THESE REASONS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET REPRESENTS THE MOST EFFICIENT
METHOD OF DIRECTING PURCHASE REQUESTS TO LOCAL MARKETS AND DEALERS. WE BELIEVE OUR SERVICES ENABLE DEALERS TO REACH CONSUMERS FROM AN ATTRACTIVE DEMOGRAPHIC BASE, REDUCE MARKETING COSTS, INCREASE CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND INCREASE VEHICLE SALES AND
PROFITS. WE OFFER AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS QUALIFIED CAR BUYERS TO TARGET DURING THE CONSUMER S RESEARCH AND CONSIDERATION PHASE. WE OFFER CONSUMERS WEB SITES WITH QUALITY AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION, NUMEROUS TOOLS TO CONFIGURE AND COMPARE THIS
INFORMATION, AND A CONVENIENT AND EFFICIENT CAR PURCHASING PROCESS. BENEFITS TO DEALERS. WE BELIEVE WE BENEFIT DEALERS BY REDUCING THE DEALERS INCREMENTAL MARKETING COSTS AND INCREASING SALES VOLUME. WE BELIEVE DEALERS PERSONNEL PRODUCTIVITY COULD INCREASE BECAUSE
WE PROVIDE DEALERS ACCESS TO POTENTIAL PURCHASERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR RESEARCH AND SHOULD BE READY TO BUY OR LEASE A VEHICLE. AS A RESULT, REACHING THESE CONSUMERS AND SELLING OR LEASING THEM VEHICLES COSTS THE DEALER LITTLE OR NO ADDITIONAL
OVERHEAD EXPENSE, OTHER THAN THE FEES PAID TO US AND THE PERSONNEL COSTS OF A DEDICATED MANAGER. WE BELIEVE FRANCHISED NEW CAR RETAIL DEALERS SPEND CONSIDERABLY LESS IN MARKETING COSTS ON EACH VEHICLE SOLD BY USING OUR NEW CAR MARKETING SERVICES.
THROUGH OUR WEB CONTROL PRODUCT, WE PROVIDE DEALERS WITH ON-SITE TECHNOLOGY TO BETTER TRACK SALES, INVENTORY, CUSTOMER SOLICITATIONS, RESPONSES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS. WE DIRECT CONSUMERS TO DEALERS IN THEIR LOCAL AREA BASED ON THE CONSUMERS VEHICLE PREFERENCE. WE BELIEVE THIS PROVIDES
DEALERS ACCESS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF WELL INFORMED, READY-TO-BUY CONSUMERS, WHICH ALLOWS DEALERS TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DEALERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE AUTOBYTEL OR CARSMART NETWORK ARE ASSIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY IN SUCH NETWORK BASED UPON A SPECIFIC VEHICLE MAKE. A TERRITORY
ALLOCATED BY US TO A DEALER IS GENERALLY LARGER THAN A TERRITORY ASSIGNED TO A DEALER BY A MANUFACTURER. RECENTLY, WE BEGAN SIGNING DEALERS TO THE AUTOBYTEL NETWORK ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIAL BASIS. AUTOWEB RETAIL DEALERS ARE NOT ASSIGNED
EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AUTOWEB NETWORK. GENERALLY, CAR.COM RETAIL DEALERS ARE NOT ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAR.COM NETWORK. BENEFITS TO MANUFACTURERS . RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OF ALL NEW CAR BUYERS, 67 USE THE INTERNET
WHILE SHOPPING. MANUFACTURERS CAN INFLUENCE CAR BUYERS DECISIONS BY TARGETING THEM DURING THEIR RESEARCH,

CONSIDERATION AND DECISION PROCESS, IN PARTICULAR, BY USING OUR DYNAMIC MARKETING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURERS CAN OBTAIN PURCHASE REQUESTS FROM US
AND USE OUR AIC DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO POWER THEIR OWN WEB SITES, WHICH ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO CONFIGURE AND COMPARE CARS. BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS. BECAUSE WEB SITES CAN BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED AND PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF QUALITY INFORMATION, AND
BECAUSE CONSUMERS HAVE SHOWN A PREFERENCE FOR THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES AND A PREFERENCE FOR USING THE INTERNET DURING THEIR CAR SHOPPING EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THE INTERNET OFFERS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEDIUM FOR CONSUMERS TO LEARN ABOUT AND SHOP FOR
VEHICLES. OUR WEB SITES PROVIDE CONSUMERS FREE OF CHARGE, UP-TO-DATE SPECIFICATIONS AND PRICING INFORMATION ON VEHICLES AND READY-TO-PRINT VEHICLE INFORMATION SUMMARIES OF EACH NEW MAKE AND MODEL ON THE MARKET. WE ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATIVE VEHICLE
VIDEO REVIEWS. IN ADDITION, OUR CONSUMERS GAIN EASY ACCESS TO VALUABLE AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION, SUCH AS DEALER INVOICE PRICING AND TOOLS CONSISTING OF A LEASE CALCULATOR, A LOAN CALCULATOR TO DETERMINE MONTHLY PAYMENTS, AND A LEASE OR BUY DECISION
ASSISTANT. OUR DATABASE OF ARTICLES ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO PERFORM ONLINE LIBRARY RESEARCH BY ACCESSING DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL REVIEWS. VARIOUS AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS KELLEY BLUE BOOK, ARE ALSO AVAILABLE
ON OUR WEB SITES TO ASSIST CONSUMERS WITH SPECIFIC VEHICLE AND RELATED AUTOMOTIVE DECISIONS. ARMED WITH SUCH INFORMATION, THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE MORE CONFIDENT AND CAPABLE OF MAKING AN INFORMED AND INTELLIGENT VEHICLE BUYING DECISION. WE BELIEVE WE OFFER CONSUMERS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT VEHICLE PURCHASING
EXPERIENCE FROM THAT OF TRADITIONAL METHODS. CONSUMERS USING OUR WEB SITES ARE ABLE TO SHOP FOR A VEHICLE AND MAKE FINANCING AND INSURANCE DECISIONS FROM THE CONVENIENCE OF THEIR OWN HOME OR OFFICE. WE EXPECT DEALERS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS A
HAGGLE-FREE PRICE QUOTE WITHIN 24 HOURS AFTER BEING CONTACTED BY THE CONSUMER AND A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE FORM OUR DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AFTER ANALYSIS OF AUTOMOTIVE SALES AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IN EACH REGION. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN IN OUR
DEALER NETWORK THE HIGHEST QUALITY DEALERS WITHIN DEFINED TERRITORIES AND TERMINATE DEALERS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS WE SET. STRATEGY WE ARE AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKETING SERVICES COMPANY THAT HELPS DEALERS SELL CARS AND MANUFACTURERS BUILD BRANDS THROUGH EFFICIENT MARKETING AND ADVERTISING,
PRIMARILY THROUGH THE INTERNET. WE ARE ALSO A LEADING PROVIDER OF CRM PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS, CONSISTING OF LEAD MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS, CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND RETENTION MARKETING PROGRAMS, DATA EXTRACTION SERVICES AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETING DATA AND
TECHNOLOGY. SINCE OUR INCEPTION WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY TO BUILD OUR DEALER NETWORKS. WE CONSIDER OUR DEALER NETWORKS TO BE SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ASSETS WHERE NEW SERVICES AND PRODUCTS CAN BE DEPLOYED. WE INTEND TO GARNER AN INCREASING SHARE OF THE APPROXIMATELY 30 BILLION
SPENT ANNUALLY BY DEALERS, DEALER ASSOCIATIONS, AFTERMARKET AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING SERVICES. WE INTEND TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES: INCREASE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PURCHASE REQUESTS THAT CAN BE
MONETIZED. WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PURCHASE REQUESTS THAT CAN BE MONETIZED IS CRUCIAL TO THE LONG-TERM GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
PURCHASE REQUESTS, WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF INFORMATION AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR WEB SITES SO THAT WELL-INFORMED, READY-TO-BUY CONSUMERS CAN BE DIRECTED TO PARTICIPATING DEALERS. WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN NEW
INITIATIVES TO HELP DRIVE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF QUALIFIED BUYERS TO DEALERSHIPS. BY AUGMENTING THE VOLUME OF QUALITY PURCHASE REQUESTS, WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL DEALERS TO OUR NETWORKS, INCREASE SERVICES PROVIDED TO DEALERS, AND
SOLIDIFY OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING DEALERS. OUR STRATEGY FOR INCREASING TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES AND THE NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS THAT CAN BE MONETIZED INCLUDES FORMING AND MAINTAINING ONLINE SPONSORSHIPS AND ALLIANCES WITH INTERNET PORTALS
AND SEARCH SITES AND WITH INTERNET AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDERS. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROFITABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH RETAIL DEALERS USING OUR MARKETING SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING THE SIZE AND QUALITY OF OUR RETAIL DEALER NETWORKS IS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS AND
GROWTH

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR RETAIL DEALER NETWORKS BY ATTRACTING NEW DEALERS AND STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING
DEALERS BY: 

INCREASING THE MONETIZABLE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF PURCHASE REQUESTS, 

MAINTAINING OUR TRAINING AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS TO PARTICIPATING DEALERS, 

PROVIDING DEALER MANAGEMENT REPORTS TO ENHANCE DEALERSHIP OPERATIONS, 

OFFERING OUR CRM PRODUCTS TO ALL PARTICIPATING DEALERS, AND 

PARTICIPATING IN INDUSTRY TRADE SHOWS AIMED AT DEALERS. INCREASE ENTERPRISE SALES TO MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING THE SIZE AND
QUALITY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS IS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS GENERAL MOTORS, FORD AND
AUTONATION, WITH ACCESS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PURCHASE-MINDED CONSUMERS. WE HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MOST AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THESE RELATIONSHIPS INTO OUR OTHER MARKETING SERVICES. STRENGTHEN THE ADVERTISING COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS
MODEL. OUR ADVERTISING SALES EFFORT IS PRIMARILY TARGETED TO VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND AUTOMOTIVE-RELATED MASS MARKET CONSUMER VENDORS. USING THE TARGETED NATURE OF INTERNET ADVERTISING, MANUFACTURERS CAN ADVERTISE THEIR
BRANDS EFFECTIVELY TO SPECIFIC SUBSETS OF OUR CONSUMERS. VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS CAN TARGET ADVERTISEMENTS TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE RESEARCHING VEHICLES, THEREBY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF INFLUENCING THEIR PURCHASE DECISIONS. WE PROVIDE DYNAMIC
MARKETING PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW MANUFACTURERS TO INTERACT WITH INTERNET CAR SHOPPERS AS THEY MAKE THEIR CAR BUYING DECISIONS. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE OUR CARTV SM AD PROGRAM THAT ENABLES MANUFACTURERS TO PRESENT THEIR TELEVISION COMMERCIALS TO SUCH INTERNET CAR SHOPPERS. INCREASE CRM SALES TO RETAIL DEALERS, MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING CRM
PRODUCTS AND TOOLS, SUCH AS WEB CONTROL AND RPM, WILL STRENGTHEN THE SIZE AND QUALITY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RETAIL DEALERS, MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND WILL BE AN INTEGRAL FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF OUR
BUSINESS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE RETAIL DEALERS, MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS WITH QUALITY CRM PRODUCTS AND TOOLS. ENTER INTO ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WE INTEND TO GROW AND ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MAY DO SO, IN PART, THROUGH
ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WE ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 24, 2005 THAT WE RETAINED THE SERVICES OF MERRILL LYNCH CO. TO ASSIST US IN EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF, OR MERGERS WITH,
COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY. WE ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 1, 2006 THAT WE WILL NO LONGER PURSUE A SALE OF THE COMPANY AS ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, BUT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW STRATEGIC
ACQUISITIONS AND PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES CAN ALLOW US TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE, BENEFIT FROM ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND STRENGTHEN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS BY ENHANCING OUR OFFERING OF
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE MAY ACQUIRE BUSINESSES THAT INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE IN THE LEAD REFERRAL AND AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION CONTENT BUSINESSES. IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS STRATEGY, WE ACQUIRED AUTOWEB.COM, INC. IN AUGUST 2001 AND STONEAGE
CORPORATION (NOW CAR.COM, INC.) IN APRIL 2004. IN ADDITION, TO COMPLEMENT OUR CORE BUSINESS AND EXTEND OUR PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, WE MAY ALSO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES,
DATABASE MARKETING SERVICES AND/OR WEB SITE MANAGEMENT. IN JUNE 2003, WE ACQUIRED AVV, A LEADING PROVIDER OF DEALERSHIP LEAD MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND DEALER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATA EXTRACTION SERVICES. IN APRIL 2004, WE ACQUIRED IDRIVEONLINE, INC. (NOW
RETENTION PERFORMANCE MARKETING, INC.), A LEADING PROVIDER OF DEALERSHIP CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND RETENTION MARKETING PROGRAMS. INVEST IN OTHER CORE PRODUCT INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE LEAD QUALITY AND DEALER PROFITABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT
EXPANDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED TO BOTH MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISHING OURSELVES AS THE PREMIER PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE MARKETING SERVICES. IN 2004, WE MODIFIED

RPM SO THAT IT INTEGRATES ADVANCED CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION WITH PERSONALIZED COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS, INCLUDING EMAIL, TELEPHONE, WEB
SITES, AND PRINT MEDIA. IN 2002, WE DEVELOPED A MULTI-LEVEL PROGRAM TO FURTHER QUALIFY CONSUMERS WE SEND TO THE DEALERS USING OUR SERVICES. THE AUTOBYTEL QUALITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM SM (QVS SM USES FILTERS AND
VALIDATION PROCESSES TO IDENTIFY CONSUMERS WITH STRONG PURCHASE INTENT AND WAS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PURCHASE REQUEST QUALITY. HIGH QUALITY PURCHASE REQUESTS ARE THOSE THAT RESULT IN HIGH CLOSING RATIOS. CLOSING RATIO IS THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF
VEHICLES PURCHASED AT A DEALER GENERATED FROM PURCHASE REQUESTS TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS SENT TO THAT DEALER. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A CUSTOMIZED PROGRAM FOR TRAINING DEALERS. THE PROGRAM TEACHES DEALERS TO INCORPORATE INTERNET SALES,
MARKETING, MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TECHNIQUES THROUGHOUT THE DEALERSHIP. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION TO SELL MORE EFFECTIVELY TO AUTOMOTIVE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE VISITED THE INTERNET CONSUMERS THAT NOW
REPRESENT NEARLY TWO OUT OF THREE NEW CAR BUYERS. ACCORDING TO J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES, IN 2005, 9 OUT OF 10 AUTOMOTIVE INTERNET USERS WENT ONLINE TO DO RESEARCH BEFORE ACTUALLY VISITING A DEALERSHIP. CONTINUE TO BUILD BRAND EQUITY. IN THE FUTURE
WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MARKET AND ADVERTISE TO ENHANCE THE BRAND RECOGNITION OF OUR WEB SITES WITH CONSUMERS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE INTERNET. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN BRAND AWARENESS OF THE AUTOBYTEL.COM, AUTOWEB.COM, CAR.COM,
CARSMART.COM, AUTOSITE.COM, AICAUTOSITE.COM, AUTOAHORROS.COM AND CARTV.COM NAMES AMONG CONSUMERS IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACT VEHICLE BUYERS, INCREASE PURCHASE REQUESTS AND, IN TURN, MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR DEALER AND AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURER
RELATIONSHIPS. IN 2005, WE EXTENDED OUR BRAND ONLINE BY LAUNCHING ESPN CARS WITH ESPN.COM, BECOMING THE EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION, TOOLS AND CAR-BUYING FULFILLMENT FOR EARTHLINK SUBSCRIBERS, PROVIDING AUTOMOTIVE CONTENT FOR THE

BRANDS, TAP INTO EXPERT REVIEWS, SAFETY CONTENT, CAR BUYING TIPS AND ARTICLES, AND SUBMIT A PURCHASE REQUEST ON A NEW OR USED VEHICLE ALL IN SPANISH. IN 2004, WE ALSO INTRODUCED VEHICLE VIDEO REVIEWS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO ADVERTISE THROUGH
TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, RADIO AND PRINT PUBLICATIONS. PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY CONSUMER EXPERIENCE ON OUR WEB SITES. WE BELIEVE THAT CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE CONSUMER S EXPERIENCE WITH OUR WEB SITES AND WITH OUR
DEALERS. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE OUR APPEAL TO CONSUMERS, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING OUR WEB SITES BY ENHANCING VEHICLE INFORMATION AND PERSONALIZATION. WE ALSO PLAN TO CONTINUE COMPILING HIGH QUALITY CONTENT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES ON OUR WEB
SITES. WE BELIEVE THAT CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH THE VEHICLE PURCHASING EXPERIENCE IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND THE DIFFERENTIATION OF OUR SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR RETAIL DEALER TRAINING
AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT, HIGH-QUALITY ALTERNATIVE TO THE TRADITIONAL VEHICLE BUYING PROCESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS THROUGH ONGOING CONSUMER SURVEYS AND RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY OUR INTERNAL DEALER SUPPORT
GROUP. RETAIL DEALERS THAT FAIL TO ABIDE BY OUR PROGRAM GUIDELINES OR WHO GENERATE REPEATED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ARE REVIEWED AND, IF APPROPRIATE, TERMINATED. ENFORCE AND STRENGTHEN OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE INTEND TO GROW AND ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS, IN PART, THROUGH

CARTV. WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED A PATENT DIRECTED TOWARD AN INNOVATIVE METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FORMING AND SUBMITTING PURCHASE REQUESTS OVER THE INTERNET AND OTHER COMPUTER NETWORKS FROM CONSUMERS TO SUPPLIERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES. THE METHOD PERMITS
SUPPLIERS OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO PROVIDE ENHANCED CUSTOMER SERVICE BY MAKING THE PURCHASING PROCESS CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS AS WELL AS SUPPLIERS. THE PATENT IS ALSO DIRECTED TOWARD THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USED TO BRING CONSUMERS AND SUPPLIERS
CLOSER TOGETHER. TO THIS END, WE HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST DEALIX CORPORATION FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS LAWSUIT. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE PATENT WILL BE
ENFORCEABLE AND, IF ENFORCEABLE, THAT THE PATENT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC VALUE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN

VEHICLES, SUCH AS PRICING, FEATURES, SPECIFICATIONS AND COLORS. WHEN CONSUMERS INDICATE THEY ARE READY TO BUY A VEHICLE, CONSUMERS CAN COMPLETE A PURCHASE REQUEST ONLINE, WHICH SPECIFIES THE TYPE OF VEHICLE AND ACCESSORIES THE CONSUMERS DESIRE,
ALONG WITH THE CONSUMERS CONTACT INFORMATION. WE VALIDATE THE CONSUMER CONTACT INFORMATION USING OUR PROPRIETARY QUALITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM. WE THEN ROUTE SUCH INFORMATION TO ONE OR MORE LOCAL PARTICIPATING DEALERS, IF AVAILABLE, THAT SELL
THE TYPE OF VEHICLE REQUESTED. WE PROMPTLY RETURN AN E-MAIL MESSAGE TO THE CONSUMER WITH THE DEALERSHIP S NAME AND PHONE NUMBER AND THE NAME OF THE DEDICATED MANAGER, IF ANY, AT THE DEALERSHIP. WE EXPECT RETAIL DEALERS TO CONTACT THE CONSUMER

DAYS OF THE SUBMISSION OF A CONSUMER S PURCHASE REQUEST, WE CONTACT THE CONSUMER AGAIN BY E-MAIL TO CONDUCT A QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEY THAT ALLOWS US TO EVALUATE THE SALES PROCESS AT PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
DEALER SERVICE. DEALERS PARTICIPATE IN OUR NETWORKS BY
ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH US OR THROUGH MAJOR DEALER GROUPS OR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS OR THEIR AUTOMOTIVE BUYING SERVICE AFFILIATES WITH WHOM WE HAVE AGREEMENTS. GENERALLY, OUR RETAIL DEALER CONTRACTS ARE TERMINABLE ON 30 DAYS NOTICE BY

ARE FORWARDED TO THE NEAREST PARTICIPATING DEALER THAT OFFERS FINANCING OR, IF A DEALER IS NOT AVAILABLE, TO AN AUTOMOTIVE FINANCE INSTITUTION. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE CONSUMERS, WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE LOANS THROUGH CONVENTIONAL
LENDING SOURCES, TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND PURCHASE THEIR DESIRED VEHICLE. WEB CONTROL. IN JUNE 2003, WE ACQUIRED AVV, A LEADING PROVIDER OF DEALERSHIP LEAD MANAGEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS WEB CONTROL. WEB CONTROL IS A CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT ENABLES DEALERS TO
MANAGE INTERNET AND WALK-IN SALES ACTIVITY, MAINTAIN CUSTOMER HISTORY AND ACTIVITY, MEASURE AND REPORT ON MARKETING EFFECTIVENESS OR RETURN ON INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS ESTABLISH AUTOMATED MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CUSTOMIZE SALES PROCESS AND WORKFLOW

THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO SERVE THE INTERNET USER AND TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF OUR PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS. THEREFORE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR DEALERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TRAINING IS CRITICAL TO ENHANCING OUR BRANDS AND
REPUTATION. WE REQUIRE RETAIL DEALERS TO HAVE THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TRAINED ON OUR SYSTEM. TRAINING IS CONDUCTED AT REGIONAL TRAINING LOCATIONS AND AT DEALERSHIPS PREMISES. IN TRAINING OUR RETAIL DEALERS, WE DE-EMPHASIZE TRADITIONAL VEHICLE

COMPETITIVE FACTORS FACED BY BOTH INTERNET COMMERCE COMPANIES AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL OFFLINE COMPANIES WITHIN THE AUTOMOTIVE AND AUTOMOTIVE-RELATED
INDUSTRIES. THE MARKET FOR INTERNET-BASED COMMERCIAL SERVICES IS RELATIVELY NEW. COMPETITION INTENSIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2005. OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY MINIMAL TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY, AND NEW COMPETITORS CAN LAUNCH A COMPETITIVE
SERVICE AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AWARENESS OF OUR SERVICES AND BRAND NAMES. FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WILL CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECLINE AND WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE
COMPETE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT MAINTAIN SIMILAR COMMERCIAL WEB SITES, INCLUDING AUTONATION S AUTOUSA, MICROSOFT CORPORATION S MSN AUTOS, CARSDIRECT.COM, CARS.COM, EBAYMOTORS.COM, DEALIX.COM, AND AUTOTRADER.COM. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH
VEHICLE DEALERS. SUCH COMPANIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE DEALERS, MAY ALREADY MAINTAIN OR MAY INTRODUCE WEB SITES THAT COMPETE WITH OURS. WE ALSO COMPETE INDIRECTLY AGAINST VEHICLE BROKERAGE FIRMS AND AFFINITY PROGRAMS OFFERED BY SEVERAL COMPANIES,
INCLUDING COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION AND WAL-MART STORES, INC. IN ADDITION, ALL MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS HAVE THEIR OWN WEB SITES AND MANY HAVE LAUNCHED ONLINE BUYING SERVICES, SUCH AS GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY IN ITS
PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS DEALERS THROUGH FORDDIRECT.COM. THE WEB CONTROL PRODUCT COMPETES WITH PRODUCTS FROM COMPANIES SUCH AS REYNOLDS AND REYNOLDS AND COBALT SYSTEMS CORPORATION. OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, RPM, COMPETES WITH
COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE MARKETING SERVICES TO AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS, INCLUDING REYNOLDS AND REYNOLDS, TVI INC., MINACS, ONLINE ADMINISTRATORS AND TELETECH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE ONLINE MARKET ARE: 

BRAND RECOGNITION, 

DEALER RETURN ON INVESTMENT, 

LEAD QUALITY, 

PRICES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, 

SPEED AND QUALITY OF FULFILLMENT, 

FIELD SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT, 

DEALER TERRITORIAL COVERAGE, 

RELATIONSHIPS WITH AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, 

VARIETY OF INTEGRATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, 

EASE OF USE, 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, 

QUALITY OF WEB SITE CONTENT, 

QUALITY OF SERVICE, AND 

TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE CAN COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, EXISTING BRAND
RECOGNITION, RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL FINANCING. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED MARKETING COSTS, DECREASED WEB SITE TRAFFIC OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE OR OTHERWISE MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY

CENTERS INCLUDE REDUNDANT POWER INFRASTRUCTURE, REDUNDANT NETWORK CONNECTIVITY, FIRE DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS AND SECURITY SYSTEMS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. OUR NETWORK AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE BUILT ON INDUSTRY STANDARD TECHNOLOGY.
NETWORK SECURITY UTILIZES INDUSTRY STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PRACTICES. SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED TRAFFIC ACROSS OUR WEB SITES, IMPROVE THE SPEED IN WHICH PURCHASE REQUESTS ARE PROCESSED AND INTRODUCE NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS ENTAIL
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOPHISTICATED NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM PROCESSES. WE INTEND TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AS WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE. GOVERNMENT REGULATION CURRENTLY FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THAT APPLY DIRECTLY TO INTERNET BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL LOCAL, STATE OR
NATIONAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY DECREASE THE GROWTH OF INTERNET USAGE OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNET COMMERCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DEALER MARKETING SERVICES DO NOT CONSTITUTE FRANCHISING OR VEHICLE BROKERAGE ACTIVITY IN A WAY THAT MAKES FRANCHISE, MOTOR VEHICLE
DEALER, OR VEHICLE BROKER LICENSING LAWS APPLICABLE TO US. THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY, WE ARE LICENSED AS A MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER AND BROKER. HOWEVER, IF INDIVIDUAL STATE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE DEEMED APPLICABLE TO US OR CHANGE, OR ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED ON US, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OUR SERVICE PROGRAMS IN THAT STATE IN A MANNER THAT MAY UNDERMINE OUR PROGRAM S ATTRACTIVENESS TO CONSUMERS OR DEALERS, NOT OFFER SUCH SERVICE, OR TERMINATE OUR OPERATIONS IN THAT
STATE, ANY OF WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GROWTH. AS WE INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES, WE MAY NEED TO COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL LICENSING REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. OUR SERVICES MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE WAY VEHICLES ARE CURRENTLY SOLD OR
MAY BE VIEWED AS THREATENING BY NEW AND USED VEHICLE DEALERS THAT DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO OUR PROGRAMS. SUCH BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN REPRESENTED BY INFLUENTIAL LOBBYING ORGANIZATIONS, AND SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER PERSONS MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT, IF
ADOPTED, COULD IMPACT OUR EVOLVING MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MODEL. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPENDED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON LOBBYING OR RELATED GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ISSUES, BUT MAY BE REQUIRED TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. FRANCHISE CLASSIFICATION. IF OUR RELATIONSHIP OR WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITH OUR DEALERS WERE FOUND TO BE A FRANCHISE UNDER
FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS, WE COULD BE SUBJECTED TO ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED, TO LICENSING, INCREASED REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH VARIED LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT CHARACTERISTICS
FOUND IN EACH STATE MAY REQUIRE US TO ALLOCATE BOTH STAFF TIME AND MONETARY RESOURCES, EACH OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS AN ADDITIONAL RISK, IF OUR DEALER RELATIONSHIPS OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS ARE DETERMINED TO
ESTABLISH A FRANCHISE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY EFFECT CHANGES IN OUR DEALER RELATIONSHIPS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET TRENDS, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE
MARKETPLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT NEITHER OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR
PARTICIPATING DEALERS NOR OUR DEALER AGREEMENTS THEMSELVES CONSTITUTE FRANCHISES UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS. THIS BELIEF HAS BEEN UPHELD BY A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT IN MICHIGAN THAT RULED OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AND OUR DEALER
SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT DO NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A FRANCHISE UNDER MICHIGAN LAW. VEHICLE BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DEALER MARKETING REFERRAL SERVICE MODEL DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN AUTOMOBILE BROKERAGE ACTIVITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT STATE MOTOR
VEHICLES DEALER OR BROKER LICENSING LAWS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO US. THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, WE ARE LICENSED AS A MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER AND BROKER. IN THE EVENT SUCH LAWS ARE DEEMED APPLICABLE TO US, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE BUSINESS
IN ANY SUCH STATE, AND PAY ADMINISTRATIVE FEES, FINES, AND PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.

 IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT OUR MARKETING REFERRAL PROGRAM RAISED BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION, WE MODIFIED OUR PROGRAM IN THAT STATE TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE. THESE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDED IMPLEMENTING A PRICING MODEL UNDER WHICH ALL PARTICIPATING DEALERSHIPS (REGARDLESS OF BRAND) IN A GIVEN ZIP CODE IN TEXAS ARE CHARGED UNIFORM
FEES AND OPENING OUR PROGRAM TO ALL DEALERSHIPS WHO WISH TO APPLY. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OTHER STATE S REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSE STATE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ON US OR INCLUDE US WITHIN AN INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REGULATORY SCHEME, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS IN SUCH STATES IN A
MANNER THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE PROGRAM S ATTRACTIVENESS TO CONSUMERS OR DEALERS. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE LICENSING AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS ARE OVERLY BURDENSOME, WE MAY ELECT TO TERMINATE OPERATIONS IN SUCH STATE. IN EACH
CASE, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FINANCING RELATED ACTIVITIES. WE PROVIDE A CONNECTION THROUGH OUR WEB SITES THAT ALLOWS A CONSUMER TO OBTAIN FINANCE
INFORMATION AND LOAN APPROVAL. WE RECEIVE MARKETING FEES FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR DEALERS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ADVERTISING ACTIVITY. WE DO NOT DEMAND NOR DO WE RECEIVE ANY FEES FROM CONSUMERS FOR THIS SERVICE. IN THE EVENT STATES REQUIRE US
TO BE LICENSED AS A FINANCIAL BROKER, WE INTEND TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH A STATE S REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS OR NEWLY INTRODUCED SERVICES, OR WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT FEES AND
EXPENSES TO LICENSE OR BE COMPELLED TO DISCONTINUE SUCH OPERATIONS IN THOSE STATES. INSURANCE RELATED ACTIVITIES. WE PROVIDE LINKS ON OUR WEB SITES TO VARIOUS INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND PRODUCTS SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN RECEIVE REAL TIME QUOTES FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE AND
EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE FROM THOSE INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUBMIT QUOTE APPLICATIONS ONLINE. WE RECEIVE MARKETING FEES FROM SUCH PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ADVERTISING ACTIVITY. WE RECEIVE NO PREMIUMS FROM CONSUMERS NOR DO WE CHARGE
CONSUMERS FEES FOR OUR SERVICES. ALL APPLICATIONS ARE COMPLETED ON THE RESPECTIVE INSURANCE CARRIERS WEB SITES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR ACTIVITY REQUIRES US TO BE LICENSED UNDER STATE INSURANCE LAWS. THE USE OF THE INTERNET IN THE MARKETING OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS,
HOWEVER, IS A RELATIVELY NEW PRACTICE. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT STATE INSURANCE LICENSING LAWS APPLY TO ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO OURS. GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY, WE HAVE PROACTIVELY APPLIED FOR AND CURRENTLY HOLD, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED
SUBSIDIARY, INSURANCE AGENT LICENSES OR ARE OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE IN THE SALE OF INSURANCE IN NUMEROUS STATES. EMPLOYEES AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2006, WE HAD 426 EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO UTILIZE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS REQUIRED. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY A LABOR
UNION. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY WORK STOPPAGES AND CONSIDER OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS TO BE GOOD. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THE OVERVIEW AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTIONS OF PART II ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL FACTORS MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS. WE HAVE ONLY BEEN PROFITABLE FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER
OF 2004 AND OTHERWISE HAVE A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES. WE INCURRED A LOSS IN 2005 AND CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE AND WE CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, OUR OPERATIONS WILL NOT
BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY
RECENT EMERGENCE OF THE INTERNET-BASED VEHICLE INFORMATION AND PURCHASING INDUSTRY, NONE OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAS LONG-TERM EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY CONTRIBUTES TO OUR DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING FUTURE OPERATING
RESULTS.

 WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES EVERY QUARTER THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 AND HAVE ACHIEVED PROFITABILITY
FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004. WE INCURRED A LOSS IN 2005. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF 154.6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 148.4
MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. OUR POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE
PROFITABILITY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY COMPANIES IN EMERGING AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING MARKETS, SUCH AS THE MARKET FOR INTERNET COMMERCE. WE BELIEVE THAT TO ACHIEVE AND
SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY, WE MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

GENERATE INCREASED VEHICLE BUYER TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES, 

SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, 

CONTINUE TO SEND NEW AND USED VEHICLE PURCHASE REQUESTS TO DEALERS THAT RESULT IN SUFFICIENT DEALER TRANSACTIONS TO JUSTIFY OUR FEES, 

EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DEALERS IN OUR NETWORKS AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF DEALERS, 

SUSTAIN AND EXPAND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, 

IDENTIFY AND SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMMATE AND INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS, 

RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS, 

MAINTAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, 

PROVIDE SECURE AND EASY TO USE WEB SITES FOR CUSTOMERS, 

INCREASE VISIBILITY OF OUR BRAND NAMES, 

DEFEND AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, 

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS SYSTEMS, 

CONTINUE TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND 

CONTINUE TO UPGRADE AND ENHANCE OUR TECHNOLOGIES TO ACCOMMODATE EXPANDED SERVICE OFFERINGS AND INCREASED CONSUMER TRAFFIC. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS OR
THAT IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS, THAT WE WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES NEED TO BE IMPROVED. MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT OF
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, MANAGEMENT USED THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED IN INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION COSO ). A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IS A CONTROL DEFICIENCY, OR COMBINATION OF CONTROL DEFICIENCIES, THAT RESULTS IN A MORE THAN REMOTE LIKELIHOOD THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL OR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED
OR DETECTED. MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT WE HAD MATERIAL
WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES RELATE TO NOT HAVING A SUFFICIENT COMPLEMENT OF PERSONNEL WITH AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTING KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, AND TRAINING
IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES COMMENSURATE WITH OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN (A) REVENUE AND DEFERRED REVENUE AND (B) ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND THE RELATED EXPENSE
ACCOUNTS. FURTHER, THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE OPINION BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

 MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT WE HAD MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS
OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND THESE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES LED TO THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FULL 2002 FISCAL YEAR, THE FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2003, THE FULL 2003 FISCAL YEAR AND THE FIRST AND
SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2004. THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES RELATE TO THE LACK OF (1) EFFECTIVE CONTROLS OVER THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS DUE TO AN INSUFFICIENT COMPLEMENT OF PERSONNEL WITH A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTING KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE AND
TRAINING IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES COMMENSURATE WITH OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND (2) AN EFFECTIVE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN THE INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED
FRAMEWORK. BECAUSE OF THESE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, MANAGEMENT WAS UNABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT WE MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 BASED ON THE CRITERIA IN THE INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED
FRAMEWORK. FURTHER, THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE OPINION BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, OUR ABILITY
TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A TIMELY AND ACCURATE BASIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT ACCURATE, INVESTORS MAY NOT HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATIONS. IF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE
NOT TIMELY, WE COULD BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ. IF EITHER OR BOTH OF THESE EVENTS OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. PLEASE SEE PART II ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR MORE
INFORMATION REGARDING THE MEASURES WE HAVE COMMENCED TO IMPLEMENT, AND WHICH WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT DURING THE COURSE OF 2006, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REMEDIATE THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS DESCRIBED IN OUR MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING SET FORTH ON PAGE F-2 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE COSTS OF REMEDIATING SUCH DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN
ADDITION, EVEN AFTER THE REMEDIAL MEASURES DISCUSSED IN PART II ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL NOT PREVENT ALL POTENTIAL ERROR AND FRAUD, BECAUSE ANY CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW
WELL DESIGNED, CAN ONLY PROVIDE REASONABLE AND NOT ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM WILL BE ACHIEVED. THE IMPACT OF ONGOING PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, DERIVATIVE AND OTHER LITIGATION MAY BE MATERIAL. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM ANY SUCH LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. WE RESTATED OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FULL 2002 FISCAL
YEAR, THE FULL 2003 FISCAL YEAR, THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2003, AND THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2004. WE, AND A PRESENT AND A FORMER DIRECTOR AND CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, ARE DEFENDANTS IN CERTAIN PURPORTED CLASS
ACTION LITIGATIONS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE CLAIMS WERE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS WHO PURCHASED SHARES DURING THE PERIOD JULY 24, 2003 THROUGH OCTOBER 21, 2004. THE
CLAIMS IN ALL OF THESE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, AND PURPORTED TO ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. IN THIS REGARD, THE PLAINTIFFS
ALLEGE THAT WE MISREPRESENTED AND OMITTED MATERIAL FACTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN JULY 24, 2003 AND OCTOBER 20, 2004. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES, AND
ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AS WELL AS ACCOUNTANTS AND EXPERTS FEES. ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE COURT ORDERED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CURRENTLY PENDING CLASS ACTIONS INTO A SINGLE CASE PURSUANT TO A STIPULATION FOR CONSOLIDATION SIGNED BY ALL PARTIES. ON MARCH 14, 2005, THE
COURT APPOINTED A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND APPROVED THE SELECTION OF LEAD COUNSEL AND LIAISON COUNSEL. ON JUNE 30, 2005, THE LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AND SERVED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. THE PUTATIVE CLASS PERIOD IS JULY 24,
2003 TO OCTOBER 21, 2004. DEFENDANTS FILED AND SERVED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT ON AUGUST 1, 2005 AND FILED THEIR REPLY BRIEF ON FEBRUARY 17, 2006. THE HEARING WAS SET FOR MARCH 13,

2006, BUT THE PARTIES FILED A STIPULATION TO TAKE THE HEARING OFF-CALENDAR WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO RE-NOTICING THE HEARING IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS
ASSERTING THE SAME OR SIMILAR CLAIMS MAY BE FILED AS WELL. WE INTEND TO DEFEND THE CLAIMS VIGOROUSLY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT CURRENTLY PREDICT THE IMPACT OR OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, AND THE INITIATION, CONTINUATION AND
OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, OUR PRESENT DIRECTORS AND A FORMER DIRECTOR AND CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN A DERIVATIVE SUIT PENDING IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF
ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, AND WE ARE NAMED AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT IN THIS SUIT. THIS SUIT PURPORTS TO ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED NUMEROUS DUTIES TO US, INCLUDING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF INFORMATION, ABUSE OF
CONTROL, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE 25402 (TRADING WITH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION), AND THAT THESE BREACHES AND VIOLATIONS CAUSED LOSSES TO US,
INCLUDING DAMAGES TO OUR REPUTATION AND GOODWILL. PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS ARE BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT THE DEFENDANTS DISSEMINATED FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT THESE RESULTS WERE INFLATED AT ALL
RELEVANT TIMES DUE TO VIOLATIONS OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES, TREBLE DAMAGES, EQUITABLE AND/OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION, AND
ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AS WELL AS ACCOUNTANTS AND EXPERTS FEES. PLAINTIFFS FILED AND SERVED AN AMENDED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT ON JULY 29, 2005. ON NOVEMBER 29, 2005, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO STAY AND SET A STATUS
CONFERENCE FOR MARCH 1, 2006. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO CONTINUE THE MARCH 1, 2006 STATUS CONFERENCE, AND THE COURT APPROVED THE STIPULATION. DEFENDANTS FILED AND SERVED A MOTION TO STAY AND A DEMURRER IN OCTOBER
2005. WE INTEND TO DEFEND THIS SUIT VIGOROUSLY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT CURRENTLY PREDICT THE IMPACT OR OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, AND THE CONTINUATION AND OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT, AS WELL AS THE INITIATION OF SIMILAR SUITS MAY
HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ON OCTOBER 21, 2005, WE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT AS WELL AS A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION/STATEMENT OF CLAIM FILED BY CERTAIN FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF STONEAGE CORPORATION STONEAGE ). THE COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN
THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND NAMES US AS WELL AS CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS. THE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION WAS FILED WITH THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AND NAMES THE SAME GROUP OF DEFENDANTS. THE
ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS IN BOTH OF THESE MATTERS ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, AND STEM FROM THE ACQUISITION OF STONEAGE BY US ON APRIL 15, 2004. BOTH THE COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION CONTAIN CAUSES OF ACTION FOR: BREACH OF THE ACQUISITION
AGREEMENT, BREACH OF THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE SECTIONS 25401 AND 25501, VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE SECTIONS 25400 AND 25500, FRAUD, NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT
CONCEALMENT, AND VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. THE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION ALSO CONTAINS A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933. THE COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AS WELL AS RESCISSION AND PUNITIVE AWARDS. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO EITHER THE COMPLAINT OR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION. ON
NOVEMBER 29, 2005, THE PARTIES REQUESTED THAT THE ARBITRATION BE STAYED, AND ON FEBRUARY 8, 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. IF THE ARBITRATION STAY IS LIFTED OR A NEW COMPLAINT IS FILED, WE WILL DEFEND THESE
CLAIMS VIGOROUSLY. WE CANNOT CURRENTLY PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, DERIVATIVE, OR OTHER SECURITIES LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, COULD COMMENCE AN INVESTIGATION RELATING TO
THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ADDITIONAL LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATION HAVING BEEN COMMENCED AGAINST US RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER ANY SUCH
LITIGATION OR REGULATORY INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMMENCED OR, IF IT IS, THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATION. IF ANY SUCH INVESTIGATION WERE TO RESULT IN A REGULATORY PROCEEDING OR ACTION AGAINST US, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION COULD BE HARMED. THE INITIATION OF ANY ADDITIONAL SECURITIES LITIGATION, TOGETHER WITH THE LAWSUITS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MAY ALSO HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 UNTIL THE EXISTING PURPORTED CLASS ACTION AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION OR ANY ADDITIONAL LITIGATION OR
REGULATORY INVESTIGATION ARE RESOLVED, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR INCUR INDEBTEDNESS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. IF AN UNFAVORABLE RESULT OCCURRED IN ANY SUCH ACTION, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE
FURTHER HARMED. WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH
ONGOING PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, DERIVATIVE AND OTHER LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS WHICH WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOW. WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED CLASS
ACTION, DERIVATIVE AND OTHER LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL FEES FOR ATTORNEYS AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS. WE ARE ALSO
OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY OUR CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN SUCH ACTIONS. THESE EXPENSES, TO THE EXTENT NOT COVERED BY AVAILABLE INSURANCE, WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS. WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES RELATING
TO REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS IDENTIFIED IN OUR INTERNAL REVIEW RELATED TO THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CERTAIN PRIOR PERIODS, WHICH WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS. WE
WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES RELATING TO THE REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS IDENTIFIED IN OUR INTERNAL REVIEW RELATED TO THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FULL 2002 FISCAL YEAR, THE
FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2003, THE FULL 2003 FISCAL YEAR, AND THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2004. THESE EXPENSES WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS.
 OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR OUR COMMON
STOCK TO BE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET COULD RESULT IN THE DELISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET. AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO TIMELY FILE OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON
FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2005, AND CERTAIN REQUIRED RESTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS, FROM NOVEMBER 2004 TO
MAY 2005 WE WERE NOT IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14), WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, ALL FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REQUIRED BY THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. WE
ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH NASDAQ MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14) AS A CONDITION FOR OUR COMMON STOCK TO CONTINUE TO BE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14) AND ALL OTHER CONDITIONS TO CONTINUED LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET.
HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF OUR PRIOR FAILURE TO COMPLY, OUR CONTINUED LISTING IS CONDITIONED ON US TIMELY FILING ALL PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET FOR ALL REPORTING PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE
DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE FILING OF A FORM 12B-25 EXTENSION REQUEST WILL NOT RESULT IN AN AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF THESE FILING DEADLINES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUED LISTING, THEN OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE DELISTING FROM THE NASDAQ
NATIONAL MARKET. IF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, THEY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO TRADE ON ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE OR THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKET. IF OUR COMMON STOCK IS NO LONGER TRADED THROUGH A
MARKET SYSTEM, IT MAY NOT BE LIQUID, WHICH COULD AFFECT ITS PRICE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FUTURE EQUITY FINANCING, OR USE OUR COMMON STOCK AS CONSIDERATION FOR MERGERS OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE INTEND TO APPEAL ANY DECISION
TO DELIST OUR SHARES FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, BUT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT OUR APPEAL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. ANY SUCH APPEAL WILL NOT STAY THE DECISION TO DELIST OUR SHARES.

 IF OUR DEALER ATTRITION CONTINUES, OUR DEALER NETWORKS AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM THESE NETWORKS MAY DECREASE.
 THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM FEES
PAID BY OUR NETWORKS OF PARTICIPATING RETAIL AND ENTERPRISE DEALERS. A FEW AGREEMENTS ACCOUNT FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ENTERPRISE DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. FROM TIME TO TIME, A MAJOR DEALER GROUP OR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURER MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF ENTERPRISE DEALERS PARTICIPATING IN OUR DEALER NETWORKS OR THE NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS ACCEPTED FROM US. IF DEALER ATTRITION INCREASES OR THE NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS ACCEPTED FROM US DECREASES AND WE ARE UNABLE TO
ADD NEW DEALERS TO MITIGATE THE ATTRITION OR DECREASE IN NUMBER OF ACCEPTED REQUESTS, OUR REVENUES WILL DECREASE. A MATERIAL FACTOR AFFECTING DEALER ATTRITION IS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE DEALERS WITH HIGH QUALITY PURCHASE REQUESTS AT PRICES ACCEPTABLE
TO DEALERS. HIGH QUALITY PURCHASE REQUESTS ARE THOSE THAT RESULT IN HIGH CLOSING RATIOS. CLOSING RATIO IS THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES PURCHASED AT A DEALER GENERATED FROM PURCHASE REQUESTS TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS SENT TO
THAT DEALER. IF THE NUMBER OF DEALERS IN OUR NETWORKS DECLINES OR DEALERS REDUCE THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVE FROM US, OUR REVENUES WILL DECREASE AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
IN ADDITION, IF AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS OR MAJOR DEALER GROUPS FORCE US TO DECREASE THE FEES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES, OUR REVENUES WILL DECLINE WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION. GENERALLY, OUR RETAIL DEALER AGREEMENTS ARE
CANCELABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON 30 DAYS NOTICE. PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT OUR SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OR AS A RESULT OF JOINING ALTERNATIVE MARKETING
PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT RETAIL DEALERS WILL NOT TERMINATE THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH US. OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED NEW AND USED VEHICLE RETAIL DEALERS, MAJOR DEALER GROUPS AND AUTOMOTIVE
MANUFACTURERS. IN ORDER FOR US TO GROW OR MAINTAIN OUR DEALER NETWORKS, WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR DEALER ATTRITION. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DEALER ATTRITION, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE
MAY LOSE PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS BECAUSE OF THE RECONFIGURATION OR ELIMINATION OF EXCLUSIVE DEALER TERRITORIES. WE WILL LOSE THE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REDUCTIONS IN PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS RESULTING FROM SUCH CHANGES.
 WE MAY REDUCE, RECONFIGURE OR ELIMINATE EXCLUSIVE
TERRITORIES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO AUTOBYTEL, CARSMART OR CAR.COM RETAIL DEALERS. IF A RETAIL DEALER IS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT A REDUCTION, RECONFIGURATION OR ELIMINATION OF ITS EXCLUSIVE TERRITORY, IT MAY TERMINATE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US. A RETAIL
DEALER ALSO COULD SUE TO PREVENT SUCH REDUCTION, RECONFIGURATION OR ELIMINATION, OR COLLECT DAMAGES FROM US. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RETAIL DEALERS PARTICIPATING IN OUR NETWORKS OR LITIGATION WITH RETAIL DEALERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE SEND SOME INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE REQUESTS TO MULTIPLE RETAIL DEALERS. AS A RESULT, WE MAY LOSE PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRESSURE ON THE FEES WE CHARGE SUCH DEALERS FOR SUCH PURCHASE REQUESTS. WE WILL LOSE THE
REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REDUCTIONS IN PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS OR FEES. WE SEND SOME INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE REQUESTS TO MULTIPLE RETAIL DEALERS TO ENHANCE CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND EXPERIENCE. IF A RETAIL DEALER PERCEIVES SUCH REQUESTS AS HAVING LESS VALUE, IT MAY REQUEST THAT FEES BE
REDUCED OR MAY TERMINATE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RETAIL DEALERS PARTICIPATING IN OUR NETWORKS OR THE FEES SUCH DEALERS PAY US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE RELY HEAVILY ON OUR PARTICIPATING DEALERS TO
PROMOTE OUR BRAND VALUE BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO OUR CONSUMERS. IF DEALERS DO NOT PROVIDE OUR CONSUMERS HIGH QUALITY SERVICES, OUR BRAND VALUE WILL DIMINISH AND THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO USE OUR SERVICES MAY DECLINE CAUSING A DECREASE
IN OUR REVENUES. PROMOTION OF OUR BRAND VALUE DEPENDS
ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS A HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCE FOR PURCHASING VEHICLES THROUGHOUT THE PURCHASING PROCESS. IF OUR DEALERS DO NOT PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH HIGH QUALITY 
 
 18 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

SERVICE, THE VALUE OF OUR BRANDS COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS USING OUR SERVICES MAY DECREASE. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO TRAIN
PARTICIPATING RETAIL DEALERS IN PRACTICES THAT ARE INTENDED TO INCREASE CONSUMER SATISFACTION. OUR INABILITY TO TRAIN RETAIL DEALERS EFFECTIVELY, OR THE FAILURE BY PARTICIPATING DEALERS TO ADOPT RECOMMENDED PRACTICES, RESPOND RAPIDLY AND
PROFESSIONALLY TO VEHICLE INQUIRIES, OR SELL AND LEASE VEHICLES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR MARKETING STRATEGIES, COULD RESULT IN LOW CONSUMER SATISFACTION, DAMAGE OUR BRAND NAMES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. COMPETITION COULD REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND
HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OUR MARKET IS COMPETITIVE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE INTERNET HAS MINIMAL TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE OFFLINE ENVIRONMENT. OUR VEHICLE PURCHASING SERVICES COMPETE AGAINST A VARIETY OF INTERNET AND
TRADITIONAL VEHICLE PURCHASING SERVICES, AUTOMOTIVE BROKERS AND CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENT PROVIDERS. THEREFORE, WE ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS FACED BY BOTH INTERNET COMMERCE COMPANIES AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL, OFFLINE COMPANIES WITHIN THE
AUTOMOTIVE AND AUTOMOTIVE-RELATED INDUSTRIES. THE MARKET FOR INTERNET-BASED COMMERCIAL SERVICES IS RELATIVELY NEW. COMPETITION HAS INTENSIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2005. OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY MINIMAL TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY, AND NEW
COMPETITORS CAN LAUNCH A COMPETITIVE SERVICE AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AWARENESS OF OUR SERVICES AND BRAND NAMES AND DELIVER SATISFACTORY VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY
WILL CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECLINE AND WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER ENTITIES WHICH MAINTAIN SIMILAR COMMERCIAL WEB SITES INCLUDING AUTONATION S AUTOUSA, MICROSOFT CORPORATION S MSN AUTOS,
CARSDIRECT.COM, CARS.COM, EBAYMOTORS.COM, DEALIX.COM, AND AUTOTRADER.COM. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH VEHICLE DEALERS. SUCH COMPANIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE DEALERS, MAY ALREADY MAINTAIN OR MAY INTRODUCE WEB SITES WHICH COMPETE WITH OURS. WE ALSO COMPETE
INDIRECTLY AGAINST VEHICLE BROKERAGE FIRMS AND AFFINITY PROGRAMS OFFERED BY SEVERAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION AND WAL-MART STORES, INC. IN ADDITION, ALL MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS HAVE THEIR OWN WEB SITES AND MANY HAVE
LAUNCHED ONLINE BUYING SERVICES, SUCH AS GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY IN ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS DEALERS THROUGH FORDDIRECT.COM. THE WEB CONTROL PRODUCT COMPETES WITH PRODUCTS FROM COMPANIES SUCH AS REYNOLDS AND REYNOLDS AND
COBALT SYSTEMS CORPORATION. OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, RPM, COMPETES WITH COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE MARKETING SERVICES TO AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS, INCLUDING REYNOLDS AND REYNOLDS, TVI INC., MINACS, ONLINE ADMINISTRATORS
AND TELETECH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE
FACTORS IN THE ONLINE MARKET ARE: 

BRAND RECOGNITION, 

DEALER RETURN ON INVESTMENT, 

LEAD QUALITY, 

PRICES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, 

SPEED AND QUALITY OF FULFILLMENT, 

FIELD SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT, 

DEALER TERRITORIAL COVERAGE, 

RELATIONSHIPS WITH AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, 

VARIETY OF INTEGRATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, 

EASE OF USE, 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, 

QUALITY OF WEB SITE CONTENT,

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

QUALITY OF SERVICE, AND 

TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE CAN COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, EXISTING BRAND
RECOGNITION, RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL FINANCING. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED MARKETING COSTS, DECREASED WEB SITE TRAFFIC OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE OR OTHERWISE MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL
RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO PREDICT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS HAVE FLUCTUATED IN THE PAST AND MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO MANY FACTORS. OUR EXPENSE LEVELS ARE BASED IN PART ON
OUR EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE REVENUES WHICH MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. IF REVENUES DO NOT INCREASE FASTER THAN EXPENSES, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE: 

OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING DEALERS, ATTRACT NEW DEALERS AND MAINTAIN DEALER AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, 

THE ANNOUNCEMENT OR INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR ENHANCED SITES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS, 

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE INTERNET, ONLINE COMMERCE OR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, 

A DECLINE IN THE USAGE LEVELS OF ONLINE SERVICES AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERNET AND COMMERCIAL ONLINE SERVICES FOR THE PURCHASE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SUCH AS
THOSE OFFERED BY US, 

OUR ABILITY TO UPGRADE AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO ATTRACT NEW PERSONNEL IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER, 

THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC ON OUR WEB SITES AND OTHER SITES THAT REFER TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES, 

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, SYSTEM DOWNTIME, INTERNET BROWNOUTS OR ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS, 

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OPERATING COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN AN ANNUAL TRADE
SHOW, 

COSTS RELATING TO REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IDENTIFIED IN OUR INTERNAL REVIEW, 

COSTS OF ONGOING LITIGATION AND ANY ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH LITIGATION, 

COSTS OF DEFENDING AND ENFORCING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, 

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, AND 

UNFORESEEN EVENTS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY. SEASONALITY IS LIKELY TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS. INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON A QUARTER TO
QUARTER COMPARISON OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS. THE
SEASONAL PATTERNS OF INTERNET USAGE AND VEHICLE PURCHASING DO NOT COMPLETELY OVERLAP. HISTORICALLY, INTERNET USAGE TYPICALLY DECLINES DURING SUMMER AND CERTAIN HOLIDAY PERIODS, WHILE VEHICLE PURCHASING IN THE UNITED STATES IS STRONGEST IN THE SPRING
AND SUMMER MONTHS. IN ADDITION, PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME USUALLY DECLINES IN THE SUMMER BECAUSE OF THE MODEL YEAR CHANGE OVER, AS SOME CONSUMERS DEFER PURCHASES UNTIL INFORMATION REGARDING THE NEW MODEL YEAR IS AVAILABLE, AND MANY MANUFACTURERS DO
NOT MAKE THEIR DATA AVAILABLE

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FOR PUBLICATION UNTIL LATER IN THE YEAR. AS SEASONALITY OCCURS, INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON A QUARTER TO
QUARTER COMPARISON OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS. SEASONALITY IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, INTERNET AND COMMERCIAL ONLINE SERVICE USAGE AND ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES IS LIKELY TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. EMPLOYEE PRICING AND OTHER ACTIONS BY MANUFACTURERS THAT PROMOTE TRANSPARENT PRICING MAY DECREASE THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF OUR SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND DEALERS. IF THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS AND DEALERS WHO USE OUR SERVICES DECLINES, OUR
REVENUES WILL DECREASE. IN THE SUMMER OF 2005, SOME
MANUFACTURERS INTRODUCED PROGRAMS ALLOWING ALL CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE NEW VEHICLES AT PRICES OFFERED TO EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE PRICING AND FUTURE ACTIONS BY MANUFACTURERS THAT PROMOTE TRANSPARENT PRICING MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF OUR
SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND DEALERS. A DECLINE IN THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF OUR SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND DEALERS MAY RESULT IN A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. WE MAY BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE REVENUES WE DERIVE FROM DEALERS, AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMER TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES. THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, WITH
VEHICLE SALES FLUCTUATING DUE TO CHANGES IN NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FORCES. PURCHASES OF VEHICLES ARE TYPICALLY DISCRETIONARY FOR CONSUMERS AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE TRENDS IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY. THE SUCCESS OF OUR
OPERATIONS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS RELATING TO DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (AND PERCEPTIONS OF SUCH CONDITIONS BY CONSUMERS) AFFECTING DISPOSABLE CONSUMER INCOME (SUCH AS
EMPLOYMENT, WAGES AND SALARIES, BUSINESS CONDITIONS, ENERGY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES IN REGIONAL AND LOCAL MARKETS). BECAUSE THE PURCHASE OF A VEHICLE IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND IS RELATIVELY DISCRETIONARY, ANY REDUCTION IN DISPOSABLE INCOME
IN GENERAL OR A GENERAL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, ENERGY PRICES OR A GENERAL TIGHTENING OF LENDING MAY AFFECT US MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN COMPANIES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. IN ADDITION, IF ANY OF OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS WERE TO BECOME INSOLVENT BECAUSE OF
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EMPLOYEE PRICING AND OTHER INCENTIVES OFFERED TO ALL CONSUMERS BY SOME MANUFACTURERS IN 2005 MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT VEHICLE SALES IN 2006. CONSUMERS MAY
HAVE ACCELERATED THEIR PLANNED VEHICLE PURCHASES FROM 2006 TO 2005. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, MANUFACTURERS MAY DECREASE CURRENT LEVELS OF INCENTIVE SPENDING ON NEW VEHICLES, WHICH HAS SERVED TO DRIVE SALES VOLUME IN THE PAST. SUCH A REDUCTION IN
INCENTIVES COULD LEAD TO A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR NEW VEHICLES. A DECLINE IN VEHICLE PURCHASES MAY RESULT IN A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THREATENED TERRORIST ACTS AND THE ONGOING MILITARY ACTION HAVE CREATED
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES IN GENERAL. THESE EVENTS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR VEHICLES AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS
WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE NATURE, EXTENT AND DURATION OF THESE EFFECTS ON OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CANNOT
ASSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF AN INDUSTRY OR GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

 IF ANY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES OR ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDERS TERMINATES, OUR
PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME OR QUALITY COULD DECLINE. IF OUR PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME OR QUALITY DECLINES, OUR PARTICIPATING DEALERS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICES AND MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US OR FORCE US TO DECREASE THE FEES WE
CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES. IF THIS OCCURS, OUR REVENUES WOULD DECREASE. WE DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS TO DIRECT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PURCHASE REQUESTS AND TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES. THE TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS OR ANY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TRAFFIC
TO WEB SITES ON WHICH OUR SERVICES ARE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED, OR THE FAILURE TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL REFERRAL SOURCES, COULD CAUSE OUR PURCHASE REQUEST VOLUME OR QUALITY TO DECLINE. IF THIS OCCURS, DEALERS MAY NO LONGER BE SATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICES
AND MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US OR FORCE US TO DECREASE THE FEES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES. IF DEALERS TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US OR FORCE US TO DECREASE THE FEES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES, OUR REVENUES WILL DECLINE WHICH
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PURCHASE REQUESTS THROUGH A LIMITED NUMBER OF INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES, ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDERS,
AND OTHER AUTO RELATED INTERNET SITES. WE PERIODICALLY NEGOTIATE REVISIONS TO EXISTING AGREEMENTS AND THESE REVISIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. A NUMBER OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE TERMINATED WITHOUT
CAUSE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS OR FIND ALTERNATIVE, COMPARABLE MARKETING SPONSORSHIPS AND ALLIANCES CAPABLE OF ORIGINATING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PURCHASE REQUESTS ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO
US. IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN OR REPLACE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF ANY OF OUR ADVERTISING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANUFACTURERS TERMINATES, OUR REVENUES
WOULD DECREASE. WE DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURER
RELATIONSHIPS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS OR ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF ADVERTISING WOULD CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECLINE WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE PERIODICALLY NEGOTIATE REVISIONS TO EXISTING AGREEMENTS AND THESE REVISIONS COULD DECREASE OUR ADVERTISING REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS. A NUMBER OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH
SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY BE TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR FIND ALTERNATIVE COMPARABLE RELATIONSHIPS CAPABLE OF REPLACING ADVERTISING REVENUES ON TERMS
SATISFACTORY TO US. IF WE CANNOT DO SO, OUR REVENUES WOULD DECLINE WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE CANNOT BUILD AND MAINTAIN STRONG BRAND LOYALTY, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND RECOGNITION WILL INCREASE AS MORE
COMPANIES ENGAGE IN COMMERCE OVER THE INTERNET. DEVELOPMENT AND AWARENESS OF THE AUTOBYTEL.COM, AUTOWEB.COM, CAR.COM, CARSMART.COM AND OTHER BRANDS WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN INTERNET COMMERCE. IF DEALERS
AND MANUFACTURERS DO NOT PERCEIVE US AS AN EFFECTIVE CHANNEL FOR INCREASING VEHICLE SALES, OR CONSUMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE US AS OFFERING RELIABLE INFORMATION CONCERNING NEW AND USED VEHICLES, AS WELL AS REFERRALS TO HIGH QUALITY DEALERS, IN A
USER-FRIENDLY MANNER THAT REDUCES THE TIME SPENT FOR VEHICLE PURCHASES, WE WILL BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN PROMOTING AND MAINTAINING OUR BRANDS. OUR BRANDS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GAIN WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE AMONG CONSUMERS OR DEALERS. OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP OUR
BRANDS SUFFICIENTLY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL HIGHLY QUALIFIED SALES, MARKETING, MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, OUR
BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED SALES, MARKETING, MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, AS WE INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES WE MAY NEED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

PERSONNEL. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT, ASSIMILATE OR RETAIN SUCH PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE. THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE NECESSARY MANAGERIAL,
TECHNICAL, SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ONE OR
MORE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW BUSINESS IN AN EMERGING INDUSTRY AND NEED TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH AND OUR ENTRY INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASED EXPENSES
WITHOUT CORRESPONDING REVENUES. WE HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND DEALERS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OURSELVES AS A LEADER IN THE EVOLVING MARKET FOR AUTOMOTIVE MARKETING SERVICES. INTRODUCING NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REQUIRES US TO INCREASE EXPENDITURES BEFORE WE
GENERATE REVENUES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY NEED TO HIRE PERSONNEL TO OVERSEE THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES BEFORE WE GENERATE REVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES. OUR INABILITY TO GENERATE SATISFACTORY REVENUES FROM SUCH EXPANDED SERVICES TO OFFSET COSTS
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE MUST ALSO: 

TEST, INTRODUCE AND DEVELOP NEW SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ENHANCING OUR WEB SITES, 

EXPAND THE BREADTH OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, 

EXPAND OUR MARKET PRESENCE THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES, AND 

ACQUIRE NEW OR COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. IF FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS APPLY TO US WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
MARKET OUR SERVICES IN THE MANNER WE CURRENTLY DO, OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AND OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. WE BELIEVE THAT NEITHER OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR DEALERS NOR OUR DEALER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS CONSTITUTE FRANCHISES UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE
FRANCHISE LAWS. A FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS IN MICHIGAN HAS RULED THAT OUR DEALER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IS NOT A FRANCHISE UNDER MICHIGAN LAW. HOWEVER, IF ANY STATE S REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO FRANCHISES OR OUR METHOD OF
BUSINESS IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON US OR INCLUDE US WITHIN AN INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REGULATORY SCHEME, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS IN SUCH STATES IN A MANNER WHICH UNDERMINES THE PROGRAM S ATTRACTIVENESS TO CONSUMERS
OR DEALERS. IF OUR RELATIONSHIP OR WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH OUR DEALERS WERE FOUND TO BE A FRANCHISE UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE FRANCHISE LAWS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO OTHER REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FRANCHISE DISCLOSURE AND REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT CHANGES IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR DEALERS, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECREASE AND OUR BUSINESS TO SUFFER. IF WE BECOME SUBJECT TO FINES OR
OTHER PENALTIES OR IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE FRANCHISE AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS ARE OVERLY BURDENSOME, WE MAY ELECT TO TERMINATE OPERATIONS IN SUCH STATE. IN EACH CASE, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE ALSO
BELIEVE THAT OUR DEALER MARKETING SERVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN AUTOMOBILE BROKERAGE ACTIVITY AND, THEREFORE, STATE MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER OR BROKER LICENSING REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY TO US. THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY, WE ARE LICENSED AS A MOTOR
VEHICLE DEALER AND BROKER. IN RESPONSE TO TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CONCERNS, WE MODIFIED OUR MARKETING PROGRAM IN THAT STATE TO MAKE OUR PROGRAM OPEN TO ALL DEALERS WHO WISH TO APPLY. IN ADDITION, WE MODIFIED THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A
PRICING MODEL UNDER WHICH ALL PARTICIPATING DEALERS, REGARDLESS OF BRAND, IN A GIVEN ZIP CODE IN TEXAS ARE CHARGED UNIFORM FEES. IF OTHER STATES 
 
 23 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS OR BROKERS ARE DEEMED APPLICABLE TO US, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER
REQUIREMENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS IN SUCH STATES IN A MANNER THAT UNDERMINES THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM TO CONSUMERS OR DEALERS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE LICENSING OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS, IN A GIVEN STATE ARE
OVERLY BURDENSOME, WE MAY ELECT TO TERMINATE OPERATIONS IN SUCH STATE. IN EACH CASE, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF FINANCIAL BROKER AND INSURANCE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO US IN STATES WHERE WE
ARE NOT CURRENTLY LICENSED, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LICENSES AND OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED AS A FINANCIAL BROKER, IT MAY RESULT IN AN EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS THAT COULD DIVERT THE EFFORT OF
MANAGEMENT AWAY FROM DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT STATES REQUIRE US TO BE LICENSED AND WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO, OR ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS REQUIRED BY CHANGES IN CURRENT OPERATIONS OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES,
WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR OTHER PENALTIES OR BE COMPELLED TO DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS IN SUCH STATES, AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE PROVIDE LINKS ON OUR WEB SITES SO CONSUMERS CAN RECEIVE REAL TIME QUOTES
FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE FROM THIRD PARTIES AND SUBMIT QUOTE APPLICATIONS ONLINE THROUGH SUCH PARTIES WEB SITES. WE RECEIVE FEES FROM SUCH PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ADVERTISING ACTIVITY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH ACTIVITIES REQUIRE
US TO BE LICENSED UNDER STATE INSURANCE LAWS. THE USE OF THE INTERNET IN THE MARKETING OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS, HOWEVER, IS A RELATIVELY NEW PRACTICE. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT STATE INSURANCE LICENSING LAWS APPLY TO ACTIVITIES SIMILAR
TO OURS. GIVEN THESE UNCERTAINTIES, WE CURRENTLY HOLD, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, INSURANCE AGENT LICENSES OR ARE OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE IN NUMEROUS STATES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO BE LICENSED TO COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, OR ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS
REQUIRED BY CHANGES IN CURRENT OPERATIONS OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR OTHER PENALTIES OR BE COMPELLED TO DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS IN SUCH STATES, AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THERE ARE MANY RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMMATED AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. WE MAY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL COMPLEMENT OR ENHANCE OUR EXISTING BUSINESS. IF WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FUTURE, IT MAY DILUTE THE VALUE OF EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP. THE IMPACT OF DILUTION
MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY OR OTHERWISE NOT ALLOW US TO CONSUMMATE ACQUISITIONS. ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES MAY RESTRICT UTILIZATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS BECAUSE OF AN ANNUAL LIMITATION DUE TO OWNERSHIP CHANGE LIMITATIONS UNDER THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE MAY ALSO INCUR DEBT AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IF WE ACQUIRE ANOTHER COMPANY, AND THIS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ANY
DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE ANY COMPANY OR BUSINESS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITION IN THE FUTURE. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE: 

IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ASSIMILATE THE OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS INTO OUR OWN BUSINESS, 

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS, 

WE MAY LOSE DEALERS PARTICIPATING IN BOTH OUR NETWORK AS WELL AS THAT OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS, IF ANY, 

OUR MANAGEMENT MUST DEVOTE ITS ATTENTION TO ASSIMILATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS WHICH DIVERTS ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS, 

WE MAY ENTER MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LIMITED PRIOR EXPERIENCE, AND 

WE MAY LOSE KEY EMPLOYEES OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS THAT MAY REDUCE OUR FUTURE EARNINGS. BECAUSE OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE INTERNET, THE ADOPTION OF NEW
LOCAL, STATE OR NATIONAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY DECREASE THE GROWTH OF INTERNET USAGE OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNET COMMERCE WHICH COULD, IN TURN, DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. TAX AUTHORITIES IN A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATE TAX TREATMENT OF COMPANIES ENGAGED IN INTERNET COMMERCE. NEW STATE TAX REGULATIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL STATE SALES, USE AND INCOME TAXES. EVOLVING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE FUTURE LICENSING WHICH COULD INCREASE
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES. IN A REGULATORY CLIMATE THAT IS UNCERTAIN, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIRECT AND INDIRECT ADOPTION, EXPANSION OR REINTERPRETATION OF VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO
OBTAIN APPROPRIATE LICENSES AT AN UNDETERMINABLE AND POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT INITIAL MONETARY AND ANNUAL EXPENSE. THESE ADDITIONAL MONETARY EXPENDITURES MAY INCREASE FUTURE OVERHEAD, THEREBY POTENTIALLY REDUCING OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 WE HAVE IDENTIFIED WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE AREAS OF DOMESTIC
GOVERNMENT REGULATION, WHICH IF CHANGED, WOULD BE COSTLY TO US. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDE FRANCHISE LAWS, MOTOR VEHICLE BROKERAGE LICENSING LAWS, MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER LICENSING LAWS, INSURANCE LICENSING LAWS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES LAWS,
WHICH ARE OR MAY BE APPLICABLE TO ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. THERE COULD BE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS WHICH WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED OR WHICH, IF CHANGED, MAY BE COSTLY TO US. OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON KEEPING PACE WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. IF WE ARE UNABLE
TO KEEP PACE WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMERS MAY STOP USING OUR SERVICES AND OUR REVENUES WILL DECREASE. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN TECHNOLOGY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL SUFFER. THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, CHANGES IN USER AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, FREQUENT NEW SERVICE AND PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS EMBODYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES THAT COULD RENDER OUR EXISTING WEB SITES AND
TECHNOLOGY OBSOLETE. THESE MARKET CHARACTERISTICS ARE EXACERBATED BY THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE MARKET AND THE FACT THAT MANY COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO INTRODUCE NEW INTERNET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADAPT TO
CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING SERVICES, DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGY
THAT ADDRESSES THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND VARIED NEEDS OF OUR PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, LICENSE LEADING TECHNOLOGIES AND RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND EMERGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES ON A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS. THE
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR WEB SITES AND CRM SYSTEMS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS RISKS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES EFFECTIVELY OR ADAPTING OUR WEB SITES AND CRM SYSTEMS, OR OTHER
PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS OR TO EMERGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL SUFFER.
 WE ARE VULNERABLE TO ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
INTERRUPTIONS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRIMARY SERVERS ARE LOCATED IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IF ELECTRICITY OR COMMUNICATIONS TO THAT LOCATION OR TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE INTERRUPTED, OUR OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADS PRODUCTION SERVERS AND CERTAIN RELATED
SYSTEMS, OUR PRODUCTION WEB SITES AND CERTAIN SYSTEMS, INCLUDING AUTOBYTEL.COM, AUTOWEB.COM, CARSMART.COM, AUTOSITE.COM, CAR.COM, FINANCE.CAR.COM, AVV.COM, IDRIVEONLINE AND RPM ARE CURRENTLY HOSTED AT SECURE THIRD-PARTY HOSTING FACILITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE HOST THE ADS PRODUCTION SERVERS AT A COMPANY OWNED FACILITY. ALTHOUGH BACKUP SERVERS ARE AVAILABLE, OUR PRIMARY SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO INTERRUPTION BY
DAMAGE FROM FIRE, EARTHQUAKE, FLOOD, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, BREAK-INS AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN THE EVENT THAT WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED PERIODIC SYSTEMS INTERRUPTIONS AND ANTICIPATE THAT SUCH INTERRUPTIONS WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. OUR MAIN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND OUR ACCOUNTING, FINANCE AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE HOSTED IN SECURE FACILITIES WITH
GENERATORS AND OTHER ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLIES IN CASE OF A POWER OUTAGE. HOWEVER, OUR CORPORATE OFFICES, WHERE WE HAVE THE USERS AND LIMITED APPLICATIONS FOR OUR ACCOUNTING, FINANCE AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, ARE VULNERABLE TO WIDE-SCALE POWER
OUTAGES. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY BLACKOUTS OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICE. IN THE EVENT WE ARE AFFECTED BY INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICE, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND
ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION
INSURANCE WHICH PAYS UP TO 8.6 MILLION FOR THE ACTUAL LOSS OF BUSINESS INCOME SUSTAINED DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AT OUR OFFICES. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A PROLONGED
INTERRUPTION, THIS BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RESULTING LOSSES. INTERNET COMMERCE IS RELATIVELY NEW AND EVOLVING. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS MODEL WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. THE MARKET FOR INTERNET-BASED PURCHASING SERVICES HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO
DEVELOP AND IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING. AS IS TYPICAL FOR A NEW AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING INDUSTRY, DEMAND AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR RECENTLY INTRODUCED SERVICES AND PRODUCTS OVER THE INTERNET ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AND THERE ARE FEW PROVEN
SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, SINCE THE MARKET FOR OUR SERVICES IS RELATIVELY NEW AND EVOLVING, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE GROWTH RATE, IF ANY, AND SIZE OF THIS MARKET. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS MODEL WILL BE
SUCCESSFUL OR THAT WE WILL BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE. IF CONSUMERS DO
NOT CONTINUE TO ADOPT INTERNET COMMERCE AS A MAINSTREAM MEDIUM OF COMMERCE OR IF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS DO NOT CONTINUE TO ACCEPT THE ROLE OF THIRD-PARTY ONLINE SERVICES, OUR REVENUES MAY NOT GROW AND OUR EARNINGS MAY SUFFER.
 THE SUCCESS OF OUR SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND
UPON THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET BY CONSUMERS AND DEALERS AS A MAINSTREAM MEDIUM FOR COMMERCE AND/OR THE WILLINGNESS OF AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS TO COOPERATE WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICES. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SERVICES OFFER SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES
TO CONSUMERS AND DEALERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES BY CONSUMERS, DEALERS OR AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES. OUR SUCCESS ASSUMES THAT CONSUMERS AND DEALERS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON TRADITIONAL MEANS OF COMMERCE
TO PURCHASE OR LEASE VEHICLES, AND TO PROCURE VEHICLE FINANCING AND INSURANCE, WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT NEW METHODS OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND EXCHANGING INFORMATION AND THAT AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT A ROLE FOR ALL MAKE, ALL
MODEL THIRD-PARTY SITES SUCH AS OURS THAT ALLOW FOR COMPARISONS. IN ADDITION, DEALERS MUST CONTINUE TO ADOPT NEW SELLING MODELS AND BE TRAINED TO USE AND INVEST IN DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES. IF THE MARKET FOR INTERNET-BASED VEHICLE MARKETING SERVICES
FAILS TO DEVELOP, DEVELOPS SLOWER THAN EXPECTED, FACES OPPOSITION OR BECOMES SATURATED WITH COMPETITORS, OR IF OUR SERVICES DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE ACCEPTED, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. INTERNET-RELATED ISSUES MAY REDUCE OR SLOW THE GROWTH IN THE
USE OF OUR SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. CRITICAL ISSUES
CONCERNING THE COMMERCIAL USE OF THE INTERNET, SUCH AS EASE OF ACCESS, SECURITY, PRIVACY, RELIABILITY, COST, AND QUALITY OF SERVICE, REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND MAY IMPACT THE GROWTH OF INTERNET USE. IF INTERNET USAGE CONTINUES TO INCREASE RAPIDLY, THE
INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS PLACED ON IT BY THIS GROWTH, AND ITS PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY MAY DECLINE. THE RECENT GROWTH IN INTERNET TRAFFIC HAS CAUSED

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FREQUENT PERIODS OF DECREASED PERFORMANCE, OUTAGES AND DELAYS. OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE THE SPEED WITH WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND TO INCREASE
THE SCOPE AND QUALITY OF SUCH SERVICES IS LIMITED BY AND DEPENDENT UPON THE SPEED AND RELIABILITY OF THE INTERNET, WHICH IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF PERIODS OF DECREASED PERFORMANCE, OUTAGES OR DELAYS ON THE INTERNET OCCUR FREQUENTLY OR OTHER CRITICAL
ISSUES CONCERNING THE INTERNET ARE NOT RESOLVED, OVERALL INTERNET USAGE OR USAGE OF OUR WEB SITES COULD INCREASE MORE SLOWLY OR DECLINE, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION TO BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. THE PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CONTINUE TO BE
VOLATILE, ESPECIALLY SINCE MARKET PRICES FOR INTERNET-RELATED AND TECHNOLOGY STOCKS HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE. PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN MARCH 1999, THERE WAS NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT AN ACTIVE
TRADING MARKET WILL BE SUSTAINED OR THAT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK WILL NOT DECLINE. RECENTLY, THE STOCK MARKET IN GENERAL AND THE SHARES OF EMERGING COMPANIES IN PARTICULAR HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE MARKET
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO FACTORS SUCH AS: 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS, 

HISTORICAL AND ANTICIPATED OPERATING METRICS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING DEALERS, THE VISITORS TO OUR WEB SITES AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY TRANSACT,

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERINGS, 

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, 

COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING ACTIONS BY AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, 

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR OUR FAILURE TO MEET SUCH ESTIMATES, 

CONDITIONS AND TRENDS IN THE INTERNET, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, 

OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUED LISTING OF OUR STOCK ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, 

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AFFECTING THE TECHNOLOGY OR AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, AND 

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. FURTHER, THE STOCK MARKETS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE PARTICULARLY
AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICES OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF SUCH COMPANIES. THESE BROAD MARKET FACTORS HAVE AFFECTED AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, GENERAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS RECESSIONS, INTEREST RATES, ENERGY PRICES, INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, TERRORIST ACTS, MILITARY ACTIONS OR WARS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK. IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF A COMPANY S SECURITIES, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS OFTEN BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST COMPANIES WITH PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES.
SUCH LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CHANGING LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY COULD REQUIRE INCREASED
REGULATORY AND LOBBYING COSTS AND MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS. OUR SERVICES MAY RESULT IN CHANGING THE WAY VEHICLES ARE SOLD WHICH MAY BE VIEWED AS THREATENING BY NEW AND USED VEHICLE DEALERS WHO DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO OUR PROGRAMS. SUCH BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN REPRESENTED BY INFLUENTIAL LOBBYING
ORGANIZATIONS, AND SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER PERSONS MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION WHICH COULD IMPACT THE EVOLVING MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MODEL WHICH OUR SERVICES PROMOTE. SHOULD CURRENT LAWS BE CHANGED OR NEW LAWS PASSED, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS WE INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES, WE MAY NEED TO COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL LICENSING REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT SPENT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON LOBBYING OR RELATED
GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ISSUES BUT WE MAY NEED TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT WE SPEND ON LOBBYING OR RELATED ACTIVITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR LICENSEES CURRENTLY HAVE WEB
SITES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE NETHERLANDS AND JAPAN. REVENUE FROM OUR LICENSEES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS IN CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN THEIR MARKETS, SUCH AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN POLITICAL CONDITIONS, POTENTIALLY WEAKER
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS AND EDUCATING CONSUMERS AND DEALERS WHO MAY BE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BENEFITS OF ONLINE MARKETING AND COMMERCE. IN ADDITION, OUR INVESTMENT IN LICENSEES MAY BE IMPAIRED. WE MAY EXPAND OUR BRAND INTO OTHER FOREIGN
MARKETS PRIMARILY THROUGH LICENSING OUR TRADE NAMES. IN THE PAST WE INCURRED LOSSES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING OR MARKETING OUR SERVICES ABROAD. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. REVENUES FROM LICENSEES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WERE LESS THAN 1 OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003. OUR COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES. ANY SUCH PROBLEMS COULD JEOPARDIZE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET, CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS OR CAUSE US TO HAVE LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSONS. OUR COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE IS POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC COMPUTER BREAK-INS, VIRUSES AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIVE PROBLEMS AND SECURITY
BREACHES. ANY SUCH PROBLEMS OR SECURITY BREACHES COULD CAUSE US TO HAVE LIABILITY TO ONE OR MORE THIRD PARTIES AND DISRUPT ALL OR PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. A PARTY ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT OUR SECURITY MEASURES COULD MISAPPROPRIATE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION,
CUSTOMER INFORMATION OR CONSUMER INFORMATION, JEOPARDIZE THE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET OR CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS. CONCERNS OVER THE SECURITY OF INTERNET TRANSACTIONS AND THE PRIVACY OF USERS
COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET IN GENERAL, PARTICULARLY AS A MEANS OF CONDUCTING COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ACTIVITIES OR THOSE OF THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS INVOLVE THE STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY
INFORMATION SUCH AS PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION, SECURITY BREACHES COULD EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS, LITIGATION AND OTHER LIABILITIES. OUR CURRENT INSURANCE PROGRAM MAY PROTECT US AGAINST SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF SUCH LOSSES. ANY OF THESE
EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE DEPEND ON CONTINUED TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS AND IN THE INTERNET OVERALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE AN UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE INCREASE IN VOLUME OF CONSUMERS USING OUR WEB SITES, WE CANNOT
ASSURE OUR CONSUMERS OR DEALERS THAT PURCHASE REQUESTS WILL BE EFFICIENTLY PROCESSED AND OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. IF THE INTERNET CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF USERS AND THE LEVEL OF USE, THEN THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS PLACED ON IT BY SUCH POTENTIAL GROWTH. THE INTERNET MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE A VIABLE COMMERCIAL MEDIUM BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE, TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS,
DELAYS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OR ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS REQUIRED TO HANDLE INCREASED LEVELS OF INTERNET ACTIVITY OR INCREASED GOVERNMENT REGULATION. AN UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OR PACE OF TRAFFIC ON OUR WEB SITES OR THE NUMBER OF ORDERS PLACED BY CUSTOMERS
MAY REQUIRE US TO EXPAND AND FURTHER UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY, TRANSACTION-PROCESSING

SYSTEMS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE RATE OR TIMING OF INCREASES, IF ANY, IN THE USE OF OUR WEB SITES OR EXPAND
AND UPGRADE OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH INCREASES. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR DEALERS WILL EFFICIENTLY PROCESS PURCHASE REQUESTS. ANY OF SUCH FAILURES REGARDING THE INTERNET IN GENERAL OR OUR WEB SITES, TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN
PARTICULAR, OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR DEALERS, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS COULD IMPAIR OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY.
WHILE WE RELY ON TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, PATENT AND COPYRIGHT LAW, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND TECHNICAL MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE TECHNICAL AND CREATIVE SKILLS OF OUR PERSONNEL, CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF OUR
PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY, BRAND NAME RECOGNITION AND RELIABLE WEB SITE MAINTENANCE ARE MORE ESSENTIAL IN ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A LEADERSHIP POSITION AND STRENGTHENING OUR BRANDS. AS PART OF OUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROCEDURES, WE
GENERALLY ENTER INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS AND LIMIT ACCESS TO OUR TRADE SECRETS AND TECHNOLOGY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO COPY ASPECTS OF OUR
SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN AND USE INFORMATION THAT WE REGARD AS PROPRIETARY. POLICING UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IS DIFFICULT. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE STEPS TAKEN BY US WILL PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF TECHNOLOGY OR THAT THE AGREEMENTS
ENTERED INTO FOR THAT PURPOSE WILL BE ENFORCEABLE. EFFECTIVE TRADEMARK, SERVICE MARK, PATENT, COPYRIGHT AND TRADE SECRET PROTECTION MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN EVERY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE. IN ADDITION,
LITIGATION MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR TO DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS OR INFRINGEMENT OR INVALIDITY. WE FILED ONE SUCH LAWSUIT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY PENDING, TO PROTECT ONE OF OUR PATENTS. SUCH LITIGATION, EVEN
IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR
POTENTIAL LITIGATION COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE FACE RISK OF CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITY FOR RETRIEVING AND TRANSMITTING INFORMATION OVER
THE INTERNET. SUCH CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS, WE MAKE INTERNET SERVICES AND CONTENT AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR CLAIMS TO BE MADE AGAINST US, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
WITH THIRD PARTIES. WE COULD FACE LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVED FROM OR TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET AND LIABILITY FOR PRODUCTS SOLD OVER THE INTERNET. WE COULD BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION THAT MAY BE
ACCESSIBLE THROUGH OUR WEB SITES, LINKS OR CAR REVIEW SERVICES. SUCH CLAIMS MIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, BE MADE FOR DEFAMATION, NEGLIGENCE, PATENT, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, PERSONAL INJURY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, UNFAIR COMPETITION, FALSE
ADVERTISING, INVASION OF PRIVACY OR OTHER LEGAL THEORIES BASED ON THE NATURE, CONTENT OR COPYING OF THESE MATERIALS. SUCH CLAIMS MIGHT ASSERT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT, BY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PROVIDING LINKS TO WEB SITES OPERATED BY THIRD
PARTIES, WE SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER WRONGFUL ACTIONS BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES THROUGH SUCH WEB SITES. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT, IF ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT INFORMATION PROVIDED ON OUR WEB SITES CONTAINS ERRORS,
CONSUMERS COULD MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR LOSSES INCURRED IN RELIANCE ON SUCH INFORMATION. ANY CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION, DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, CAUSE DELAYS IN RELEASING NEW OR UPGRADING EXISTING SERVICES
OR REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO ROYALTY OR LICENSING AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES UNDER WHICH ANY REVENUE THAT RESULTS FROM THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES THROUGH DIRECT LINKS TO OR FROM OUR WEB SITES IS SHARED. SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL LEGAL RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH SUCH PARTIES REGARDING REVENUE SHARING, LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND POTENTIAL LIABILITIES TO CONSUMERS OF THESE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE DO NOT

PROVIDE THE SERVICES OURSELVES. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT ANY INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED TO US IN OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THESE PARTIES, IF AVAILABLE, WILL BE
ADEQUATE. EVEN TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIMS DO NOT RESULT IN
LIABILITY TO US, WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN INVESTIGATING AND DEFENDING AGAINST SUCH CLAIMS. THE IMPOSITION UPON US OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION CARRIED ON OR DISSEMINATED THROUGH OUR SYSTEM COULD REQUIRE US TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES
TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE EXPENDITURE OF SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES OR LIMIT THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR SERVICES TO CONSUMERS, DEALERS AND OTHERS. LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS COMMON IN THE INTERNET AND SOFTWARE INDUSTRIES. WE EXPECT THAT INTERNET
TECHNOLOGIES AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN OUR INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF PRODUCTS IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OVERLAPS.
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR SERVICES DO NOT INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. IN THE PAST, PLAINTIFFS HAVE BROUGHT THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS AND SOMETIMES SUCCESSFULLY LITIGATED THEM AGAINST ONLINE SERVICES. OUR GENERAL LIABILITY
INSURANCE MAY NOT COVER ALL POTENTIAL CLAIMS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED AND MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ALL LIABILITY THAT MAY BE IMPOSED. ANY IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY THAT IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE OR IS IN EXCESS OF OUR INSURANCE
COVERAGE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION. IF WE WERE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE LITIGATION OUTCOME, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS HEREIN. FROM TIME
TO TIME, WE ARE INVOLVED IN OTHER LITIGATION MATTERS ARISING FROM THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE ACTIONS FILED AGAINST US AND OTHER LITIGATION, EVEN IF NOT MERITORIOUS, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES
AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN LITIGATION COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE UNCERTAIN OF OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR OUR FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE CURRENTLY
ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL
FUNDS SOONER, HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW OR ENHANCE EXISTING SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OR TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. IF ADEQUATE
FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OR ENHANCE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS
MAY ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED. SUCH LIMITATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS. 
 OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND DELAWARE
LAW CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM ACQUIRING US OR LIMIT THE PRICE THIRD PARTIES ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR OUR STOCK. PROVISIONS OF OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS RELATING TO OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PROVISIONS IN OUR STOCKHOLDER
RIGHTS PLAN COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE US, AND COULD DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF US. THESE PROVISIONS ALLOW US TO ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WITH RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF THE COMMON STOCK
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER VOTE OR ACTION BY THE

STOCKHOLDERS. THESE PROVISIONS PROVIDE THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING CHANGES
IN CONTROL OR CHANGE IN OUR MANAGEMENT BECAUSE LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE UP FOR ELECTION AT EACH ANNUAL MEETING. IN ADDITION, THESE PROVISIONS IMPOSE VARIOUS PROCEDURAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR STOCKHOLDERS TO EFFECT CORPORATE ACTIONS SUCH AS A MERGER, ASSET SALE OR OTHER CHANGE OF CONTROL OF US. UNDER THE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, IF A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES 15 OR MORE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, ALL RIGHTSHOLDERS, EXCEPT THE
ACQUIROR, WILL BE ENTITLED TO ACQUIRE AT THE THEN EXERCISE PRICE OF A RIGHT THAT NUMBER OF SHARES OF AUTOBYTEL S COMMON STOCK WHICH, AT THE TIME, HAS A MARKET VALUE OF TWO TIMES THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE RIGHT. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES, ALL RIGHTHOLDERS, OTHER THAN THE ACQUIROR, WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AT THE THEN EXERCISE PRICE OF A RIGHT THAT NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE ACQUIRING COMPANY WHICH, AT THE TIME, HAS A MARKET VALUE OF TWO TIMES THE
EXERCISE PRICE OF THE RIGHT. THE INITIAL EXERCISE PRICE OF A RIGHT IS 65. SUCH CHARTER AND RIGHTS PROVISIONS COULD LIMIT THE PRICE THAT CERTAIN INVESTORS MIGHT BE WILLING TO PAY IN THE FUTURE FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAY HAVE THE EFFECT
OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE IN CONTROL. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK ALSO COULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS AND ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS AND POWERS, INCLUDING
VOTING RIGHTS, OF THE HOLDERS OF THE COMMON STOCK. WE ARE ALSO
SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW. IN GENERAL, THE STATUTE PROHIBITS A PUBLICLY HELD DELAWARE CORPORATION FROM ENGAGING IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN INTERESTED
STOCKHOLDER FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE PERSON BECAME AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, UNLESS THE BUSINESS COMBINATION IS APPROVED IN A PRESCRIBED MANNER. FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 203, A
 BUSINESS COMBINATION INCLUDES A MERGER, ASSET SALE OR OTHER TRANSACTION RESULTING IN A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, AND AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER IS A PERSON WHO, TOGETHER WITH AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATES,
OWNS OR DID OWN 15 OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION S VOTING STOCK. OUR
ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT. THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS WHICH INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE

IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THAT WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY

RISKS RELATED TO OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SEGMENT 

REGULATORY RISKS 

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND THE CONTINUALLY CHANGING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING BUSINESSES. THESE REGULATIONS DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND REQUIRE CONSTANT COMPLIANCE, MONITORING AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS AND EXAMINATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS. THIS CAN RESULT IN INCREASES IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND WE OR PLS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THESE REGULATORS DUE TO COMPLIANCE ERRORS, OR PLS MAY LOSE ITS LICENSES. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR FINES AND PENALTIES INCURRED IN ONE JURISDICTION MAY CAUSE INVESTIGATIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS BY REGULATORS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. 

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROPOSED OR ENACTED NUMEROUS LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES RELATED TO MORTGAGE LOANS. LAWS, REGULATIONS, RULES AND JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS RELATING TO MORTGAGE LOANS INCLUDE THOSE PERTAINING TO REAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, FAIR LENDING, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, TRUTH IN LENDING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, SERVICE MEMBERS PROTECTIONS, COMPLIANCE WITH NET WORTH AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS, COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE DISCLOSURE AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES, FINANCE CHARGES AND OTHER CHARGES, QUALIFIED MORTGAGES, LICENSING OF LOAN OFFICERS AND OTHER PERSONNEL, LOAN OFFICER COMPENSATION, SECURED TRANSACTIONS, PROPERTY VALUATIONS, SERVICING TRANSFERS, PAYMENT PROCESSING, ESCROW, COMMUNICATIONS WITH CONSUMERS, LOSS MITIGATION, COLLECTION, FORECLOSURE, BANKRUPTCY, REPOSSESSION AND CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, AND OTHER TRADE PRACTICES AND PRIVACY REGULATIONS PROVIDING FOR THE USE AND SAFEGUARDING OF NON PUBLIC PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BORROWERS. SERVICE PROVIDERS WE USE MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH SOME OF THESE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE COUNSEL RETAINED TO PROCESS FORECLOSURES AND BANKRUPTCIES. 

OUR FAILURE TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY OF THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES COULD SUBJECT US TO LAWSUITS OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, REDUCED PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS, MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF MORTGAGE LOANS, PERMANENT FORGIVENESS OF DEBT, DELAYS IN THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, INCREASED SERVICING ADVANCES, LITIGATION, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AND REPURCHASE AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE FORECLOSURE COUNSEL, MAY ALSO HAVE THESE NEGATIVE RESULTS. 

THE FAILURE OF THE MORTGAGE LENDERS FROM WHOM LOANS WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES TO COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES MAY ALSO RESULT IN THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE IN PLACE A DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ASSESS AREAS OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ACQUIRED LOANS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COMPLIANCE WITH UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES AND APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT DETECT EVERY VIOLATION OF LAW BY THESE MORTGAGE LENDERS. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY ORIGINATORS OR SERVICERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND ANY OF THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS OR MSRS BECOME PART OF OUR ASSETS, IT COULD SUBJECT US, AS AN ASSIGNEE OR PURCHASER OF THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS OR MSRS, TO MONETARY PENALTIES OR OTHER LOSSES. IN GENERAL, IF ANY OF OUR LOANS ARE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ORIGINATED, SERVICED OR OWNED BY US OR A THIRD PARTY IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, OR WE COULD BE FINED OR INCUR LOSSES. WHILE WE HAVE MAY CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO SEEK INDEMNITY OR REPURCHASE FROM CERTAIN OF THESE LENDERS AND THIRD PARTY ORIGINATORS AND SERVICERS, IF ANY OF THEM ARE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR INDEMNITY OR REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS TO US TO A MATERIAL EXTENT, OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, H.R. 1, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE TAX ACT ), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WHILE THE TAX ACT HAS REDUCED OUR APPLICABLE FEDERAL TAX RATE, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THE TAX ACT WILL HAVE ON THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY OR OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE AVAILABILITY OF MORTGAGE FINANCING, INTEREST RATES, CONSUMER SPENDING, THE ECONOMY AND THE GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TAX ACT HAS AN OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR INDUSTRY, SUCH LEGISLATION MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE CFPB IS ACTIVE IN ITS MONITORING OF THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND SERVICING SECTORS. NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS AND MORE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS BY THE CFPB COULD RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES, PENALTIES AND THE INHERENT REPUTATIONAL RISK THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH ACTIONS. 

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CFPB IS EMPOWERED WITH BROAD SUPERVISION, RULEMAKING AND EXAMINATION AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE LAWS INVOLVING CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO ENSURE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT CONSUMERS RECEIVE CLEAR AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURES REGARDING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND ARE PROTECTED FROM HIDDEN FEES AND UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES. THE CFPB HAS ADOPTED A NUMBER OF FINAL REGULATIONS UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REGARDING TRUTH IN LENDING, ABILITY TO REPAY, HOME MORTGAGE LOAN DISCLOSURE, HOME LOAN ORIGINATION, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, FORECLOSURE PROTECTIONS, AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RULES, INCLUDING PROVISIONS REGARDING LOSS MITIGATION, EARLY INTERVENTION, PERIODIC STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND LENDER-PLACED INSURANCE. IN OCTOBER 2016, THE CFPB FURTHER REVISED ITS RULES UNDER REGULATIONS X AND Z IMPACTING LENDER-PLACED INSURANCE NOTICES, DELINQUENCY AND EARLY INTERVENTION, LOSS MITIGATION, PERIODIC STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS, AND SUCCESSORS-IN-INTEREST TO BORROWERS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE REVISED RULES REGARDING PERIODIC STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BORROWERS IN BANKRUPTCY AND SUCCESSORS-IN-INTEREST TO BORROWERS, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2018, THESE REVISED RULES BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2017. IN JANUARY 2018, CERTAIN HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACT RULES ALSO BECAME EFFECTIVE THAT REQUIRE US TO COLLECT, RECORD AND REPORT ADDITIONAL DATA ABOUT LOANS THAT WE ORIGINATE AND SERVICE. 

THE CFPB ALSO HAS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDUCT OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE CFPB HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT EXPECTS NON-BANK ENTITIES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS FOR MANAGING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE-RELATED RISKS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WE ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS OF POTENTIAL VENDORS, REVIEW VENDORS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL TRAINING MATERIALS TO CONFIRM COMPLIANCE-RELATED FOCUS, INCLUDE ENFORCEABLE CONSEQUENCES IN CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS REGARDING FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CONSUMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS, AND TAKE PROMPT ACTION, INCLUDING TERMINATING THE RELATIONSHIP, IN THE EVENT THAT VENDORS FAIL TO MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS. THE CFPB IS ALSO APPLYING GREATER SCRUTINY TO COMPENSATION PAYMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS FOR MARKETING SERVICES AND MAY ISSUE GUIDANCE THAT NARROWS THE RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE PAYMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AS PART OF MARKETING SERVICES AGREEMENTS, LEAD GENERATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY MARKETER RELATIONSHIPS. 

IN ADDITION TO ITS SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION AUTHORITY, THE CFPB IS AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY PERSON IS ENGAGING IN, OR HAS ENGAGED IN, CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAWS, AND TO INITIATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS, REGARDLESS OF ITS DIRECT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY. INVESTIGATIONS MAY BE CONDUCTED JOINTLY WITH OTHER REGULATORS. IN FURTHERANCE OF ITS SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION POWERS, THE CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE MONETARY PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, REQUIRE REMEDIATION OF PRACTICES AND PURSUE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS OR LITIGATION FOR VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. THE CFPB ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS (WHICH CAN INCLUDE ORDERS FOR RESTITUTION OR RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS OTHER KINDS OF AFFIRMATIVE RELIEF) AND MONETARY PENALTIES RANGING FROM 5,000 PER DAY FOR ORDINARY VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS TO 25,000 PER DAY FOR RECKLESS VIOLATIONS AND 1 MILLION PER DAY FOR KNOWING VIOLATIONS. 

RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT OR BY THE CFPB, UNCERTAINTY REGARDING RECENT CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP (INCLUDING INTERIM LEADERSHIP) OR AUTHORITY LEVELS WITHIN THE CFPB, AND ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN BY THE CFPB COULD RESULT IN HEIGHTENED FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, AND INCREASE COSTS AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, WHETHER ACTUAL OR ALLEGED, WOULD EXPOSE US TO FINES, PENALTIES OR POTENTIAL LITIGATION LIABILITIES, INCLUDING COSTS, SETTLEMENTS AND 

14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

JUDGMENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND ANY CHANGES IN THESE ENTITIES OR THEIR CURRENT ROLES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH MORTGAGE LOAN SALES DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ON PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY GSES, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING GINNIE MAE, AND OTHERS THAT FACILITATE THE ISSUANCE OF MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES MBS ), IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. THESE AGENCIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF THEM. PRESENTLY, ALMOST ALL OF THE NEWLY ORIGINATED CONFORMING LOANS THAT WE ORIGINATE DIRECTLY WITH BORROWERS OR ASSIST PMT IN ACQUIRING FROM MORTGAGE LENDERS THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES QUALIFY UNDER EXISTING STANDARDS FOR INCLUSION IN MBS ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR GUARANTEED BY GINNIE MAE. WE ALSO DERIVE OTHER MATERIAL FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM OUR AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF CREDIT RISK BY CERTAIN OF THESE AGENCIES ON LOANS INCLUDED IN SUCH MBS IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR PAYMENT OF GUARANTEE FEES AND THE ABILITY TO AVOID CERTAIN LOAN INVENTORY FINANCE COSTS THROUGH STREAMLINED LOAN FUNDING AND SALE PROCEDURES. 

ANY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AND THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. TREASURY HAS COMMITTED CAPITAL TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, THESE ACTIONS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR THEIR NEEDS. ANY DISCONTINUATION OF, OR SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN, THE OPERATION OF FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR ANY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, FINANCIAL CONDITION, ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE PRIMARY OR SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKETS OR IN UNDERWRITING CRITERIA COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE ROLES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURED, REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AND THE NATURE OF THE GUARANTEES COULD BE CONSIDERABLY LIMITED RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL MEASUREMENTS. ELIMINATION OF THE TRADITIONAL ROLES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, OR ANY CHANGES TO THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF THE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC OR THE FEES, TERMS AND GUIDELINES THAT GOVERN OUR SELLING AND SERVICING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM, SUCH AS INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEE FEES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY, INITIATIVES THAT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REPURCHASE REQUESTS AND/OR THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE PURSUED, OR POSSIBLE LIMITS ON DELIVERY VOLUMES IMPOSED UPON US AND OTHER SELLER/SERVICERS, COULD ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SELL AND SECURITIZE LOANS THROUGH OUR LOAN PRODUCTION SEGMENT, AND THE PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS THAT WE ASSIST PMT IN ACQUIRING THROUGH ITS CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION BUSINESS WOULD BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED. MOREOVER, ANY CHANGES TO THE NATURE OF THE GSES OR THEIR GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS COULD REDEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES AN AGENCY MBS AND COULD HAVE BROAD ADVERSE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKET AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS THAT WE ASSIST PMT IN ACQUIRING THROUGH ITS CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION BUSINESS IS ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE FACT THAT THE AGENCIES HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED SUCH LOANS DIRECTLY FROM MORTGAGE LENDERS, BUT HAVE INSTEAD RELIED ON BANKS AND NON BANK AGGREGATORS SUCH AS US TO ACQUIRE, AGGREGATE AND SECURITIZE OR OTHERWISE SELL SUCH LOANS TO INVESTORS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. CERTAIN OF THE AGENCIES HAVE APPROVED NEW AND SMALLER LENDERS THAT TRADITIONALLY MAY NOT HAVE QUALIFIED FOR SUCH APPROVALS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE LENDERS CHOOSE TO SELL DIRECTLY TO THE AGENCIES RATHER THAN THROUGH LOAN AGGREGATORS LIKE US, THE NUMBER OF LOANS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE BY AGGREGATORS IS REDUCED, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, TO THE EXTENT THE AGENCIES INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PURCHASES AND SALES FOR THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD VARIOUS AGENCY APPROVALS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THOSE AGENCY APPROVALS OR THAT CHANGES IN AGENCY GUIDELINES WILL NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD CERTAIN AGENCY APPROVALS IN ORDER TO SELL MORTGAGE LOANS TO THE AGENCIES AND SERVICE SUCH MORTGAGE LOANS ON THEIR BEHALF. OUR FAILURE TO SATISFY THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN SUCH 

15 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AGENCY APPROVALS OVER TIME WOULD RESTRICT OUR DIRECT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC GUIDELINES THAT IMPACT THE WAY THAT WE ORIGINATE AND SERVICE AGENCY LOANS, INCLUDING GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO: 

CREDIT STANDARDS FOR MORTGAGE LOANS; 

COLLECTIONS, REMITTANCES AND OTHER PAYMENTS; 

OUR STAFFING LEVELS AND OTHER SERVICING PRACTICES; 

THE SERVICING AND ANCILLARY FEES THAT WE MAY CHARGE; 

OUR MODIFICATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES; AND 

THE AMOUNT OF NON REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES. 

WE GENERALLY CANNOT NEGOTIATE THESE TERMS WITH THE AGENCIES AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THESE GUIDELINES THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FEES WE CHARGE OR REQUIRES US TO EXPEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN PROVIDING MORTGAGE SERVICES COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS, WHICH WOULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY FHFA HAS DIRECTED THE GSES TO ALIGN THEIR GUIDELINES FOR SERVICING DELINQUENT MORTGAGES THAT THEY OWN OR THAT BACK SECURITIES WHICH THEY GUARANTEE, WHICH CAN RESULT IN MONETARY INCENTIVES FOR SERVICERS THAT PERFORM WELL AND PENALTIES FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT. THE FHFA HAS ALSO DIRECTED THE GSES TO ASSESS COMPENSATORY PENALTIES AGAINST SERVICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED TIMELINES RELATING TO DELINQUENT LOANS AND FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS, AND OTHER BREACHES OF SERVICING OBLIGATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THE PREVAILING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE ORIGINATION AND SERVICING GUIDELINES AND/OR THE LOSS OF OUR SELLER/SERVICER LICENSE APPROVAL OR APPROVED ISSUER STATUS WITH THE AGENCIES COULD RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO BENEFIT FROM AVAILABLE MONETARY INCENTIVES AND/OR EXPOSE US TO MONETARY PENALTIES AND CURTAILMENTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR INABILITY TO MEET CERTAIN NET WORTH AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE AGENCIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE AGENCIES. THESE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ALIGN THE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTITIES TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE AGENCIES. THESE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES , INCLUDE NET WORTH, CAPITAL RATIO AND/OR LIQUIDITY CRITERIA IN ORDER TO SET A MINIMUM LEVEL OF CAPITAL NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY ABSORB POTENTIAL LOSSES AND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY NEEDED TO SERVICE AGENCY MORTGAGE LOANS AND MBS AND COVER THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND RISKS. 

IN ORDER TO MEET THESE MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN AMOUNTS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THIS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDE US FROM GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IN RELATION TO FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH MINIMUM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET, THE AGENCIES MAY SUSPEND OR TERMINATE OUR AGENCY APPROVALS OR AGREEMENTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO CROSS DEFAULT UNDER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN BANKING REGULATIONS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. 

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. PNC OWNED APPROXIMATELY 22 OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING COMMON SHARES OF BLACKROCK, INC. BASED ON PNC S INTERESTS IN AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH BLACKROCK, INC., BLACKROCK, INC. IS DEEMED TO BE A NON-BANK SUBSIDIARY OF PNC. BLACKROCK, INC. IS AN AFFILIATE OF BLACKROCK MORTGAGE VENTURES, LLC, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST EQUITY HOLDERS. DUE TO THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE ARE DEEMED TO BE A NON-BANK SUBSIDIARY OF PNC, WHICH IS REGULATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED. AS A NON-BANK SUBSIDIARY OF PNC, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN BANKING REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE ). SUCH BANKING REGULATIONS COULD LIMIT THE ACTIVITIES AND THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT WE MAY CONDUCT. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BROAD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD EXERCISE ITS POWER TO RESTRICT PNC FROM HAVING A NON-BANK SUBSIDIARY THAT IS ENGAGED IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT, IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE S OPINION, IS UNAUTHORIZED OR CONSTITUTES AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BUSINESS PRACTICE, AND COULD EXERCISE ITS POWER TO RESTRICT US FROM ENGAGING IN ANY SUCH ACTIVITY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY ALSO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND OTHER PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THAT WE MAY COMMIT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE, AS A NON-BANK MORTGAGE LENDER, ARE SUBJECT TO BANKING REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR NON-BANK COMPETITORS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE SAME REGULATIONS. 

IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBIT OR RESTRICT A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM CONDUCTING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS (COLLECTIVELY COVERED FUNDS ), WHEN IT HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, SPONSORS OR ADVISES A COVERED FUND. THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS PROPRIETARY TRADING AS DEFINED BY SUCH RULE, UNLESS THE TRADING IS PERMITTED BY AN EXEMPTION, SUCH AS FOR RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING PURPOSES. THE VOLCKER RULE APPLIES TO US BY VIRTUE OF OUR AFFILIATION WITH PNC THROUGH BLACKROCK. THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE OR RETAIN AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, SPONSOR, ADVISE OR MANAGE COVERED FUNDS, AND LIMITS INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN COVERED FUNDS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, AMONG OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IF A FUND, WHETHER NEWLY CREATED OR EXISTING, BECOMES A COVERED FUND, THEN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND THE COVERED FUND COULD BE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED, OR THE FUND MAY NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THESE PROHIBITIONS, RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS COULD DISADVANTAGE US AGAINST THOSE COMPETITORS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE VOLCKER RULE IN THE ABILITY TO MANAGE COVERED FUNDS AND TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE VOLCKER RULE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

UNLIKE COMPETITORS THAT ARE FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE LICENSING AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS, AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE LOSE OUR LICENSES. 

BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A FEDERALLY CHARTERED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, WE DO NOT BENEFIT FROM EXEMPTIONS TO STATE MORTGAGE LENDING, LOAN SERVICING OR DEBT COLLECTION LICENSING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE MUST COMPLY WITH STATE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND VARYING COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS IN ALL 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, GUAM AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS THROUGH STRICTER LICENSING LAWS, DISCLOSURE LAWS OR INCREASED FEES OR MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS TO LICENSING THAT WE OR OUR PERSONNEL ARE UNABLE TO MEET. 

IN MOST STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, A REGULATORY AGENCY OR AGENCIES REGULATE AND ENFORCE LAWS RELATING TO MORTGAGE SERVICERS AND MORTGAGE ORIGINATORS. THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR LICENSING AS A MORTGAGE SERVICER, MORTGAGE ORIGINATOR, LOAN MODIFICATION UNDERWRITER, OR THIRD PARTY DEBT DEFAULT SPECIALIST (OR A COMBINATION THEREOF), REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE FORM AND CONTENT OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION CONTRACTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION, LICENSING OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND THOSE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT, AND EMPLOYEE HIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS. THEY ALSO SET FORTH RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURE AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS, AND THEY ESTABLISH A VARIETY OF BORROWERS RIGHTS. FUTURE STATE LEGISLATION AND CHANGES IN EXISTING REGULATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ANCILLARY INCOME WE ARE ENTITLED TO COLLECT FROM BORROWERS OR OTHERWISE. THIS COULD MAKE OUR BUSINESS COST PROHIBITIVE IN THE AFFECTED STATE OR STATES AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE FAILURE OF PENNYMAC LOAN SERVICES, LLC TO AVAIL ITSELF OF AN APPROPRIATE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE INTEND TO OPERATE SO THAT WE AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUBSIDIARY, PENNYMAC LOAN SERVICES, LLC PLS ), QUALIFIES FOR THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED IN SECTION 3(C)(6) BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, PRIMARILY ENGAGED, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, IN (1) THE BUSINESS OF PURCHASING OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRING MORTGAGES OR OTHER LIENS ON AND INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE (FROM WHICH NOT LESS THAN 25 PERCENT OF ITS GROSS INCOME DURING ITS LAST FISCAL YEAR WAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED), TOGETHER WITH (2) AN ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OR BUSINESSES OTHER THAN INVESTING, REINVESTING, OWNING, HOLDING, OR TRADING IN SECURITIES, NAMELY THE BUSINESS OF SERVICING MORTGAGES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT NOT LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT (25 OF PLS GROSS INCOME TO BE DERIVED FROM ORIGINATING, PURCHASING, OR ACQUIRING MORTGAGES OR LIENS ON AND INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPOSITION OF PLS GROSS INCOME WILL REMAIN THE SAME OVER TIME. 

TO DATE, THE SEC STAFF HAS PROVIDED LIMITED GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 3(C)(6), AND PLS HAS NOT SOUGHT A NO-ACTION LETTER FROM THE SEC STAFF RESPECTING ITS POSITION. IF PLS IS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO RELY ON THE SECTION 3(C)(6) EXEMPTION DUE TO A FAILURE TO MEET THE 25 PERCENT OF GROSS INCOME TEST OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SEC STAFF PROVIDES NEGATIVE GUIDANCE REGARDING THE APPLICABILITY OR SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EITHER (A) REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, OR (B) SUBSTANTIALLY RESTRUCTURE OUR BUSINESS, CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND/OR THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR ANOTHER INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT EXEMPTION AND AVOID BEING REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, EITHER OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

IN THE CASE OF A RESTRUCTURING, PLS COULD TEMPORARILY RELY ON RULE 3A-2 FOR ITS EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. RULE 3A-2 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR EXEMPTION, NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR, FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE A BONA FIDE INTENT TO BE ENGAGED IN AN EXCEPTED ACTIVITY BUT TEMPORARILY FAIL TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EXEMPTION. IN SUCH CASE, PLS WOULD LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING AND/OR DISPOSING OF ASSETS IN ORDER TO MEET AN EXEMPTION UNDER SECTION 3(C)(5)(C), DEPENDING ON THE COMPOSITION OF ITS ASSETS AT THE TIME. THE SEC STAFF S POSITION ON SECTION 3(C)(5)(C) GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT AN ISSUER MAINTAIN AT LEAST 55 OF ITS ASSETS IN MORTGAGES AND OTHER LIENS ON AND INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE (QUALIFYING ASSETS) AND AT LEAST 80 OF ITS ASSETS IN QUALIFYING ASSETS PLUS REAL ESTATE-RELATED ASSETS. PLS WOULD BE MORE LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO HOLD MSRS OR WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE AND HOLD MORE MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE TO ADJUST THE COMPOSITION OF ITS ASSETS TO MEET THE 55 AND 80 TESTS. 

IF PLS IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A VARIETY OF SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT THAT IMPOSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS: LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL STRUCTURE; RESTRICTIONS ON SPECIFIED INVESTMENTS; PROHIBITIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; COMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING, RECORD KEEPING, VOTING AND PROXY DISCLOSURE; AND, OTHER RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. FURTHER, IF PLS WAS OR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, PLS WOULD BE IN BREACH OF VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ITS CREDIT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS RESULTING IN A DEFAULT AS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS AND OBLIGATIONS. THIS COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL ACTIONS OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, OR RESULT IN A COURT APPOINTED RECEIVER TO TAKE CONTROL OF US AND LIQUIDATE OUR BUSINESS, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

LIABILITY RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY IMPACT THE VALUE OF PROPERTIES THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE OR THE PROPERTIES UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENTS. 

UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL PROPERTY MAY BECOME LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RELEASED ON ITS PROPERTY. THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR OPERATOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, OR AWARE OF, THE RELEASE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT AN OWNER S ABILITY TO SELL REAL ESTATE, BORROW USING REAL ESTATE AS COLLATERAL OR MAKE DEBT PAYMENTS TO US. IN ADDITION, IF WE TAKE TITLE TO A PROPERTY, THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL THE PROPERTY, AND WE MAY BECOME LIABLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR TO THIRD PARTIES FOR VARIOUS FINES, DAMAGES OR REMEDIATION COSTS. ANY OF THESE LIABILITIES OR EVENTS MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT ASSET AND/OR OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MARKET RISKS 

OUR MORTGAGE BANKING REVENUES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON MACROECONOMIC AND UNITED STATES REAL ESTATE MARKET, MORTGAGE MARKET AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. 

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CURRENT OR FUTURE CONDITIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, MORTGAGE MARKETS, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. FACTORS SUCH AS INFLATION, DEFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, PERSONAL AND BUSINESS INCOME TAXES, HEALTHCARE, ENERGY COSTS, GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED VOLATILITY AND UNCLEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE REAL ESTATE, MORTGAGE MARKET AND FINANCIAL MARKETS IN PARTICULAR GOING FORWARD. A DESTABILIZATION OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, MORTGAGE MARKET AND FINANCIAL MARKETS OR DETERIORATION IN THESE MARKETS ALSO COULD REDUCE OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUME, REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF SERVICING MORTGAGES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WE ORIGINATE OR ACQUIRE, EITHER AT A PROFIT OR AT ALL. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND IS LIKELY TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, AND DECREASED MARGINS RESULTING FROM INCREASED COMPETITION OR OUR INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY THAT COULD BECOME EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE AS A RESULT OF ECONOMIC, LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCTION, WE FACE COMPETITION IN SUCH AREAS AS MORTGAGE LOAN OFFERINGS, RATES, FEES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WITH RESPECT TO SERVICING, WE FACE COMPETITION IN AREAS SUCH AS FEES, COST TO SERVICE AND SERVICE LEVELS, INCLUDING OUR PERFORMANCE IN REDUCING DELINQUENCIES AND ENTERING INTO SUCCESSFUL MODIFICATIONS. 

LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS AND SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER NON-BANK MORTGAGE ORIGINATORS AND SERVICERS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE IN THE ORIGINATION OR ACQUISITION OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND THE SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS. MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL THAN WE DO, WHICH MAY GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF A LOWER COST OF FUNDS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR EXISTING AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS MAY DECIDE TO MODIFY THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO COMPETE MORE DIRECTLY WITH OUR LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, OTHER NON BANK LOAN SERVICERS MAY TRY TO LEVERAGE THEIR SERVICING RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP OR EXPAND A LOAN ORIGINATION BUSINESS. SINCE THE WITHDRAWAL OR DECREASED PARTICIPATION OF A NUMBER OF LARGE PARTICIPANTS FROM THESE MARKETS FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NON BANK PARTICIPANTS. AS MORE NON BANK ENTITIES ENTER THESE MARKETS AND AS MORE COMMERCIAL BANKS AGGRESSIVELY COMPETE, OUR MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESSES MAY GENERATE LOWER VOLUMES AND/OR MARGINS. 

IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND HEIGHTENED E COMMERCE ACTIVITIES HAVE INCREASED CONSUMERS ACCESS TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS HAS INTENSIFIED COMPETITION AMONG BANKS AND NON BANKS IN OFFERING AND SERVICING MORTGAGE LOANS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESSES AND THIS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OR DECREASES IN OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUME, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR LOAN PRODUCTION SEGMENT CONSISTS OF OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING ACTIVITIES, IN WHICH WE ORIGINATE MORTGAGE LOANS DIRECTLY WITH BORROWERS THROUGH TELEPHONE CALL CENTERS OR THE INTERNET, AND OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, IN WHICH WE FACILITATE THE ACQUISITION BY PMT FROM CORRESPONDENT SELLERS OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERWRITTEN TO OUR STANDARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF GOVERNMENT LOANS, ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS FROM PMT. 

OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE RELATIONSHIP DRIVEN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE WORKED WITH 613 APPROVED MORTGAGE LENDERS, BUT THESE LENDERS ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO DO BUSINESS WITH US OR PMT, AND OUR COMPETITORS ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE LENDERS AND ACTIVELY COMPETE AGAINST US IN OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND PMT S NETWORK OF APPROVED MORTGAGE LENDERS. TO DATE, WE HAVE GROWN OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUMES WITH MORTGAGE LENDERS ON THE BASIS OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE, MANUFACTURING QUALITY, SPEED OF EXECUTION, INTEREST RATES AND 

19 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY MAINTAIN THESE QUALITIES OF EXECUTION, OUR REPUTATION AND EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MORTGAGE LENDERS COULD BE DAMAGED. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN PMT S EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS OR DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH MORTGAGE LENDERS OR OUR NEW MORTGAGE PRODUCTS MAY NOT GAIN WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE. 

OUR CURRENT VOLUME OF CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING ORIGINATIONS, WHICH IS BASED IN LARGE PART ON THE REFINANCING OF EXISTING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WE SERVICE, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON INTEREST RATES AND MAY DECLINE IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE. OUR NON-SERVICING PORTFOLIO CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING PLATFORM MAY NOT SUCCEED BECAUSE OF THE REFERRAL DRIVEN NATURE OF OUR INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ORIGINATION OF PURCHASE MONEY MORTGAGE LOANS IS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY TRADITIONAL BUSINESS CLIENTS IN THE HOME BUYING PROCESS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND BUILDERS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO SECURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH TRADITIONAL BUSINESS CLIENTS WILL INFLUENCE OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR PURCHASE MONEY MORTGAGE LOAN VOLUME AND, THUS, OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING BUSINESS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, TO GROW OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING BUSINESS, WE WILL NEED TO CONVERT LEADS REGARDING PROSPECTIVE BORROWERS INTO FUNDED LOANS, THE SUCCESS OF WHICH DEPENDS ON THE PRICING WE OFFER RELATIVE TO THE PRICING OF OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR OPERATIONAL ABILITY TO PROCESS, UNDERWRITE AND CLOSE LOANS. INSTITUTIONS THAT COMPETE WITH US IN THIS REGARD MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ACCESS TO CAPITAL OR OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE DO, WHICH MAY GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF A LOWER COST OF OPERATIONS. 

ON THE OTHER HAND, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION AND CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING LOAN VOLUMES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH, THE QUALITY OF OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION AND CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BRAND AND OPERATING RESULTS. OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION AND CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO OVERALL MARKET FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUME. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED COMPETITION FROM NEW AND EXISTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS, REDUCTIONS IN THE OVERALL LEVEL OF REFINANCING ACTIVITY OR SLOW GROWTH IN THE LEVEL OF NEW HOME PURCHASE ACTIVITY CAN IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUMES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO ACCEPT LOWER MARGINS IN OUR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE AND KEEP OUR VOLUME OF ACTIVITY CONSISTENT WITH PAST OR PROJECTED LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE HAVE BEEN DRIVING LOWER MARGINS IN RECENT PERIODS, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND IN OUR GAINS ON MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GROW OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUMES OR IF OUR MARGINS BECOME COMPRESSED, THEN OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY TO MEET THE FINANCING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS. 

WE WILL REQUIRE NEW AND CONTINUED DEBT FINANCING TO FACILITATE OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH. ACCORDINGLY, OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND REPAY MATURING OBLIGATIONS RESTS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY. WE ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO RENEW OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS EACH YEAR, WHICH EXPOSES US TO REFINANCING AND INTEREST RATE RISKS. OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT AND BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS IS AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING: 

LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON US UNDER OUR FINANCING AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND BORROWING CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT; 

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON US BY REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT MANDATE CERTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS; 

LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS; 

PREVAILING INTEREST RATES; 

THE STRENGTH OF THE LENDERS FROM WHICH WE BORROW, AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, INCLUDING PROPOSED CAPITAL STRENGTHENING REQUIREMENTS; 

LIMITATIONS ON BORROWINGS ON CREDIT FACILITIES IMPOSED BY THE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL PLEDGED, WHICH MAY BE LESS THAN THE BORROWING CAPACITY OF THE CREDIT FACILITY; AND 

20 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ACCOUNTING CHANGES THAT MAY IMPACT CALCULATIONS OF COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. 

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY REFINANCING OR ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE POSSIBLE WHEN NEEDED, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT MARKET CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE AT THE TIMES THAT WE REQUIRE SUCH REFINANCING OR ADDITIONAL FINANCING. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MEET THE FINANCING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT EXTEND US CREDIT ON TERMS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE. THESE BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN REGULATORY SUPERVISION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS, PROFITABILITY AND RISK THRESHOLDS AND TOLERANCES, ANY OF WHICH MAY CHANGE MATERIALLY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THEIR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO US SPECIFICALLY OR MORTGAGE LENDERS AND SERVICERS GENERALLY. CERTAIN BANKING INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY EXITED, AND OTHERS MAY IN THE FUTURE DECIDE TO EXIT, THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND LIMIT OR OTHERWISE ELIMINATE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL, IN WHICH CASE OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE LEVERAGE OUR ASSETS UNDER CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS AND UTILIZE VARIOUS OTHER SOURCES OF BORROWINGS, WHICH EXPOSES US TO SIGNIFICANT RISK AND MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE CURRENTLY LEVERAGE AND, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE MORTGAGE LOANS PRODUCED THROUGH OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING BUSINESS AND THE GOVERNMENT INSURED LOANS ACQUIRED THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION OPERATIONS FROM PMT WITH BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. WHEN WE ENTER INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE SELL MORTGAGE LOANS TO LENDERS, WHICH ARE THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COUNTERPARTIES, AND RECEIVE CASH FROM THE LENDERS. THE LENDERS ARE OBLIGATED TO RESELL THE SAME ASSETS BACK TO US AT THE END OF THE TERM OF THE TRANSACTION. BECAUSE THE CASH THAT WE RECEIVE FROM A LENDER WHEN WE INITIALLY SELL THE ASSETS TO THAT LENDER IS LESS THAN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS (THIS DIFFERENCE IS REFERRED TO AS THE HAIRCUT), IF THE LENDER DEFAULTS ON ITS OBLIGATION TO RESELL THE SAME ASSETS BACK TO US WE COULD INCUR A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE HAIRCUT (ASSUMING THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS). IN ADDITION, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY ALLOW THE COUNTERPARTIES, TO VARYING DEGREES, TO DETERMINE A NEW FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. IF A COUNTERPARTY LENDER DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL HAS DECREASED, IT MAY INITIATE A MARGIN CALL AND REQUIRE US TO EITHER POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO COVER SUCH DECREASE OR REPAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BORROWING. SHOULD THIS OCCUR, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CASH TO SATISFY A MARGIN CALL, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS AT A DISADVANTAGEOUS TIME, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR FURTHER LOSSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY A MARGIN CALL, OUR COUNTERPARTY MAY SELL THE COLLATERAL, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. 

IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING MSRS, FOR WHICH FINANCING HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WE CURRENTLY LEVERAGE CERTAIN OF OUR MSRS UNDER SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. OUR FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC MSRS ARE PLEDGED TO SECURE BORROWINGS UNDER A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, WHILE OUR GINNIE MAE MSRS AND RELATED ESS ARE PLEDGED TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH GINNIE MAE ASSETS AND REPAID THROUGH THE CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PLS. IN EACH CASE, SIMILAR TO OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, THE CASH THAT WE RECEIVE UNDER THESE SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS IS LESS THAN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLEDGED COLLATERAL CAN RESULT IN A MARGIN CALL. SHOULD A MARGIN CALL OCCUR, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS AT A DISADVANTAGEOUS TIME, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR FURTHER LOSSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY A MARGIN CALL, THE SECURED PARTIES MAY SELL THE COLLATERAL, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. 

EACH OF THE SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE FINANCE MSRS AND ESS IS FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC OR GINNIE MAE, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO WHICH OUR AND THE SECURED PARTIES RIGHTS ARE SUBORDINATE IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE APPLICABLE AGENCY. ACCORDINGLY, THE EXERCISE BY ANY OF FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC OR GINNIE MAE OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AGREEMENT COULD RESULT IN THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF OUR AND THE SECURED PARTIES RIGHTS IN THE RELATED COLLATERAL AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO US. 

21 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE LEVERAGE CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE AND A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MAY IN THE FUTURE UTILIZE OTHER SOURCES OF BORROWINGS, INCLUDING TERM LOANS, BANK CREDIT FACILITIES AND STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHERS. THE AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE WE EMPLOY VARIES DEPENDING ON THE ASSET CLASS BEING FINANCED, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND ACCESS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH LENDERS AND THE LENDERS AND RATING AGENCIES ESTIMATE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE STABILITY OF OUR CASH FLOWS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ANY DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT THE DESIRED TIMES, OR AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL OR OBTAIN FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

ALTHOUGH OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS CONTAIN NO LIMITATION ON THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE MAY INCUR, THE LENDERS UNDER OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US AND/OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH, PROFITABILITY AND OUR RATIO OF TOTAL LIABILITIES TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH. INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL DEBT SUBJECTS US TO THE RISK THAT OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPURCHASE THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE SOLD TO THE LENDERS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE SERVICE THE DEBT INCURRED UNDER OUR OTHER CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS. OUR LENDERS ALSO REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN A SPECIFIED LIQUIDITY POSITION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE LIQUIDITY LEVELS, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS AT A LOSS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD DETERIORATE RAPIDLY. 

OUR EXISTING CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS ALSO IMPOSE OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON US THAT IMPACT OUR FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE OUR OPERATING POLICIES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES BY LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO INCUR CERTAIN TYPES OF INDEBTEDNESS; GRANT LIENS; ENGAGE IN CONSOLIDATIONS, MERGERS AND ASSET SALES, MAKE RESTRICTED PAYMENTS AND INVESTMENTS; ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND AMEND, MODIFY OR PREPAY CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS . IN OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS, WE AGREE TO CERTAIN COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS AND WE MAKE REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ASSETS SOLD OR PLEDGED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO AGREE TO CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MATERIALITY THRESHOLDS AND GRACE PERIODS), INCLUDING PAYMENT DEFAULTS, BREACHES OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS AND/OR CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, CROSS-DEFAULTS, SERVICER TERMINATION EVENTS, RATINGS DOWNGRADES, GUARANTOR DEFAULTS, BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES CUSTOMARY FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS. IF WE DEFAULT ON OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER A CREDIT OR FINANCING AGREEMENT, FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS OR BREACH OUR REPRESENTATIONS AND ARE UNABLE TO CURE, THE LENDER MAY BE ABLE TO TERMINATE THE TRANSACTION OR ITS COMMITMENTS, ACCELERATE ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR REPURCHASE THE ASSETS, AND/OR CEASE ENTERING INTO ANY OTHER CREDIT TRANSACTIONS WITH US. 

BECAUSE OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS, A DEFAULT THAT OCCURS UNDER ANY ONE AGREEMENT COULD ALLOW THE LENDERS UNDER OUR OTHER AGREEMENTS TO ALSO DECLARE A DEFAULT, THEREBY EXPOSING US TO A VARIETY OF LENDER REMEDIES, SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING THEREFROM. ANY LOSSES THAT WE INCUR ON OUR CREDIT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR EARNINGS MAY DECREASE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES. 

OUR PROFITABILITY IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MATERIAL RISKS WE FACE RELATED TO INCREASES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES: 

AN INCREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LOAN PRODUCTION VOLUME BECAUSE REFINANCING AN EXISTING LOAN WOULD BE LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND QUALIFYING FOR A LOAN MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS; 

AN INCREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GINNIE MAE EARLY BUYOUT PROGRAM BECAUSE LOAN MODIFICATIONS WOULD BECOME LESS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE; 

22 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AN INCREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF SERVICING OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT, INCLUDING DEBT RELATED TO SERVICING ASSETS AND LOAN PRODUCTION; AND 

AN INCREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES COULD INCREASE PAYMENTS FOR SERVICING CUSTOMERS WITH ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES AND GENERATE AN INCREASE IN DELINQUENCY, DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE RATES, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN OUR LOAN SERVICING EXPENSES. 

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MATERIAL RISKS WE FACE RELATED TO DECREASES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES: 

A DECREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES MAY CAUSE MORE BORROWERS TO REFINANCE EXISTING LOANS THAT WE SERVICE OR MAY CAUSE THE EXPECTED VOLUME OF REFINANCING TO INCREASE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO RECORD DECREASES IN FAIR VALUE AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT OR BOTH ON OUR MSRS; AND 

A DECREASE IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS FROM OUR CUSTODIAL DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. 

AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, A NEGATIVE RATINGS ACTION BY A RATING AGENCY, THE PERCEPTION OF FINANCIAL WEAKNESS, AN ADVERSE ACTION BY A REGULATORY AUTHORITY, A LENGTHENING OF FORECLOSURE TIMELINES OR A GENERAL DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY THAT CONSTRICTS THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT AND BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADJUST OUR OPERATIONAL CAPACITY IN A TIMELY FASHION, OR AT ALL, IN RESPONSE TO INCREASES OR DECREASES IN MORTGAGE PRODUCTION VOLUME RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES. 

ANY OF THE INCREASES OR DECREASES DISCUSSED ABOVE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

HEDGING AGAINST INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 

WE PURSUE HEDGING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. OUR HEDGING ACTIVITY WILL VARY IN SCOPE BASED ON THE RISKS HEDGED, THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES, THE TYPE OF INVESTMENTS HELD, AND OTHER CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. HEDGING INSTRUMENTS INVOLVE RISK BECAUSE THEY OFTEN ARE NOT TRADED ON REGULATED EXCHANGES, GUARANTEED BY AN EXCHANGE OR ITS CLEARING HOUSE, OR REGULATED BY ANY U.S. OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

INTEREST RATE HEDGING CAN BE EXPENSIVE, PARTICULARLY DURING PERIODS OF RISING AND VOLATILE INTEREST RATES; 

AVAILABLE INTEREST RATE HEDGING MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK FOR WHICH PROTECTION IS SOUGHT; 

THE DURATION OF THE HEDGE MAY NOT MATCH THE DURATION OF THE RELATED LIABILITY OR ASSET; 

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE HEDGING COUNTERPARTY OWING MONEY ON THE HEDGE MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR ASSIGN OUR SIDE OF THE HEDGING TRANSACTION; AND 

THE HEDGING COUNTERPARTY OWING THE MONEY IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION MAY DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY. 

IN ADDITION, WE MAY FAIL TO RECALCULATE, RE ADJUST AND EXECUTE HEDGES IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. ANY HEDGING ACTIVITY, WHICH IS INTENDED TO LIMIT LOSSES, MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THEREFORE, WHILE WE MAY ENTER INTO SUCH TRANSACTIONS SEEKING TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE RISK, UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY RESULT IN WORSE OVERALL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE THAN IF WE HAD NOT ENGAGED IN ANY SUCH HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. A LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET MAY NOT EXIST FOR A HEDGING INSTRUMENT PURCHASED OR SOLD, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A POSITION UNTIL EXERCISE OR EXPIRATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN PRICE MOVEMENTS OF THE INSTRUMENTS USED IN HEDGING STRATEGIES AND PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE PORTFOLIO POSITIONS OR LIABILITIES BEING HEDGED MAY VARY MATERIALLY. MOREOVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, WE MAY NOT ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SUCH HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND THE PORTFOLIO POSITIONS OR LIABILITIES BEING 

23 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

HEDGED. ANY SUCH INEFFECTIVE CORRELATION MAY PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING THE INTENDED HEDGE AND EXPOSE US TO RISK OF LOSS. NUMEROUS REGULATIONS CURRENTLY APPLY TO HEDGING AND ANY NEW REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN EXISTING REGULATIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR COMPLIANCE COSTS. OUR DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR THE DAILY MARK TO MARKET OF OUR HEDGE EXPOSURES. IF A HEDGE COUNTERPARTY DETERMINES THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO US EXCEEDS ITS EXPOSURE THRESHOLD, IT MAY INITIATE A MARGIN CALL AND REQUIRE US TO POST COLLATERAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY A MARGIN CALL, WE WOULD BE IN DEFAULT OF OUR AGREEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE USE ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MSRS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE ASSETS WITH CONTINUALLY CHANGING VALUES. IF OUR ESTIMATES OF THEIR VALUE PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE MSRS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MSRS IS BASED ON THE CASH FLOWS PROJECTED TO RESULT FROM THE SERVICING OF THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND CONTINUALLY FLUCTUATES DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH AFFECT THE NUMBER OF LOANS THAT ARE REPAID OR REFINANCED AND THUS NO LONGER RESULT IN CASH FLOWS, AND THE NUMBER OF LOANS THAT BECOME DELINQUENT. 

WE USE INTERNAL FINANCIAL MODELS THAT UTILIZE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO VALUE OUR MSRS FOR PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE PRICE THAT WE PAY FOR PORTFOLIOS OF MSRS AND TO ACQUIRE LOANS FOR WHICH WE WILL RETAIN MSRS. THESE MODELS ARE COMPLEX AND USE ASSET SPECIFIC COLLATERAL DATA AND MARKET INPUTS FOR INTEREST AND DISCOUNT RATES. IN ADDITION, THE MODELING REQUIREMENTS OF MSRS ARE COMPLEX BECAUSE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT DRIVE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH MSRS. EVEN IF THE GENERAL ACCURACY OF OUR VALUATION MODELS IS VALIDATED, VALUATIONS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR INPUTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE MODELS. 

IF LOAN DELINQUENCIES OR PREPAYMENT SPEEDS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ANTICIPATED OR OTHER FACTORS PERFORM DIFFERENTLY THAN MODELED, THE RECORDED VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR MSRS MAY CHANGE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE COULD INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON OUR VALUATIONS WHICH COULD RESULTS IN MISSTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RESTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OR OTHERWISE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO MAY DECREASE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MSRS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONSUMER DIRECT BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, APPROXIMATELY 19 OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE IN OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO WAS SECURED BY PROPERTIES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. TO THE EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA OR OTHER STATES IN WHICH WE HAVE GREATER CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE WEAKER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR GREATER RATES OF DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUES THAN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY, SUCH CONCENTRATION MAY DISPROPORTIONATELY DECREASE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MSRS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING BUSINESS. THE IMPACT OF PROPERTY VALUE DECLINES MAY INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE AND IT MAY CONTINUE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ADDITIONALLY, IF STATES IN WHICH WE HAVE GREATER CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS WERE TO CHANGE THEIR LICENSING OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE OUR BUSINESS COST PROHIBITIVE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO STOP DOING BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

A DECREASE IN HOME PRICES MAY RESULT IN HIGHER LOAN TO VALUE RATIOS LTVS ), LOWER RECOVERIES IN FORECLOSURE AND AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITIES ABOVE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALIZED HAD PROPERTY VALUES REMAINED THE SAME OR CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SOME BORROWERS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES TO PERMIT THEM TO REFINANCE THEIR EXISTING LOANS, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE VOLUME OR GROWTH OF OUR LOAN PRODUCTION BUSINESS. THIS MAY ALSO PROVIDE BORROWERS WITH AN INCENTIVE TO DEFAULT ON THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS EVEN IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. FURTHER, DESPITE RECENT INCREASES, INTEREST RATES HAVE REMAINED NEAR HISTORICAL LOWS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF 

24 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

TIME. BORROWERS WITH ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS MUST MAKE LARGER MONTHLY PAYMENTS WHEN THE INTEREST RATES ON THOSE MORTGAGE LOANS ADJUST UPWARD FROM THEIR INITIAL FIXED RATES OR LOW INTRODUCTORY RATES TO THE RATES COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE INDEX AND MARGIN. INCREASES IN MONTHLY PAYMENTS MAY INCREASE THE DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES ON A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE LOANS THAT WE SERVICE. 

INCREASED MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUE FOR LOANS THAT WE SERVICE FOR THE AGENCIES BECAUSE WE ONLY COLLECT SERVICING FEES FROM THE AGENCIES FOR PERFORMING LOANS, AND OUR FAILURE TO SERVICE DELINQUENT AND DEFAULTED LOANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING GUIDELINES COULD RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO BENEFIT FROM AVAILABLE MONETARY INCENTIVES AND/OR EXPOSE US TO MONETARY PENALTIES AND CURTAILMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE INCREASED DELINQUENCIES GENERATE HIGHER ANCILLARY FEES, INCLUDING LATE FEES, THESE FEES ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN THE EVENT THAT THE RELATED LOAN IS LIQUIDATED. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES LOWERS THE INTEREST INCOME THAT WE RECEIVE ON CASH HELD IN COLLECTION AND OTHER ACCOUNTS BECAUSE THERE IS LESS CASH IN THOSE ACCOUNTS. ALSO, INCREASED MORTGAGE DEFAULTS MAY ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES THAT WE SERVICE. 

INCREASED MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES WILL ALSO RESULT IN A HIGHER COST TO SERVICE THOSE LOANS DUE TO THE INCREASED TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO COLLECT PAYMENTS FROM DELINQUENT BORROWERS AND TO ACQUIRE AND LIQUIDATE THE PROPERTIES SECURING THE LOANS OR OTHERWISE RESOLVE LOAN DEFAULTS IF PAYMENT COLLECTION IS UNSUCCESSFUL, AND ONLY A PORTION OF THESE INCREASED COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE UNDER OUR SERVICING AGREEMENTS. INCREASED MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES MAY ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES TO FUND AN INCREASE IN THE ADVANCES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MBS HOLDERS AND TO PROTECT OUR INVESTORS INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTIES SECURING THE DELINQUENT MORTGAGE LOANS. 

A DISRUPTION IN THE MBS MARKET COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

MOST OF THE LOANS THAT WE PRODUCE ARE POOLED INTO MBS ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR GUARANTEED BY GINNIE MAE. DISRUPTIONS IN THE GENERAL MBS MARKET HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST. ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR PERIOD OF ILLIQUIDITY IN THE GENERAL MBS MARKET WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR OWN LIQUIDITY AND THE LIQUIDITY OF PMT BECAUSE NO EXISTING ALTERNATIVE SECONDARY MARKET WOULD LIKELY BE WILLING AND ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ON A TIMELY BASIS THE VOLUME OF LOANS THAT WE TYPICALLY SELL IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. FURTHERMORE, WE WOULD REMAIN CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO FUND LOANS UNDER OUR OUTSTANDING IRLCS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SELL OUR EXISTING INVENTORY OF MORTGAGE LOANS. ACCORDINGLY, IF THE MBS MARKET EXPERIENCES A PERIOD OF ILLIQUIDITY, WE MIGHT BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING THE LOANS THAT WE PRODUCE INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD A LARGER INVENTORY OF LOANS THAN WE HAVE COMMITTED FACILITIES TO FUND OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE DEBT SECURED BY THESE ASSETS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR ORIGINATIONS OF MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE LOANS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE ORIGINATE LOANS AND ACQUIRE REAL ESTATE ASSETS SECURED BY MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF THESE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WILL BE CLOSELY TIED TO THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF AND COMPETITION IN THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET. VARIOUS CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS MAY IMPACT THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE SECTOR. ANY NEGATIVE TRENDS IN SUCH REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND, AS A RESULT, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE: 

INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE SECTOR BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE ATTRACTIVENESS, LOCATION, RENTAL RATES, AMENITIES AND SAFETY RECORD OF VARIOUS PROPERTIES; 

OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET; 

OVERSUPPLY OF, OR A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR, MULTIFAMILY HOUSING PROPERTIES;

RENT CONTROL OR STABILIZATION LAWS, OR OTHER LAWS REGULATING MULTIFAMILY HOUSING, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF MULTIFAMILY DEVELOPMENTS; 

THE INABILITY OF RESIDENTS OR TENANTS TO PAY RENT; AND 

INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, INCLUDING INCREASED REAL PROPERTY TAXES, MAINTENANCE, INSURANCE AND UTILITIES COSTS. 

MOREOVER, OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING REAL ESTATE, ZONING OR TAXES, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATE LEVELS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LAWS, DELINQUENCY, FORECLOSURE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE MARKET AND, AS A RESULT, REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ANY SUCH REDUCTION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

RELATED PARTY RISKS 

WE RELY ON PMT AS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF FINANCING FOR, AND REVENUE RELATED TO, OUR MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS, AND THE TERMINATION OF, OR MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN, THE TERMS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, OR A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE TO PMT OR ITS OPERATIONS, WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

PMT IS THE COUNTERPARTY THAT CURRENTLY ACQUIRES ALL OF THE NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION OPERATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCOME IS DERIVED FROM A FULFILLMENT FEE EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH PMT S ACQUISITION OF CONVENTIONAL LOANS. WE ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION OPERATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO INCUR THE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR US TO PURCHASE THOSE LOANS FROM THE ORIGINATING LENDER. IN THE CASE OF GOVERNMENT INSURED LOANS, WE PURCHASE THEM FROM PMT AT PMT S COST PLUS A SOURCING FEE AND FULFILL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT AND SELL THE LOANS, TYPICALLY BY POOLING THE FEDERALLY INSURED OR GUARANTEED LOANS TOGETHER INTO AN MBS WHICH GINNIE MAE GUARANTEES. WE EARN INTEREST INCOME AND GAINS OR LOSSES DURING THE HOLDING PERIOD AND UPON THE SALE OF THESE SECURITIES, AND WE RETAIN THE MSRS WITH RESPECT TO THE LOANS. IF THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH PMT IS TERMINATED BY PMT OR PMT REDUCES THE VOLUME OF THESE LOANS THAT IT ACQUIRES FOR ANY REASON, WE WOULD HAVE TO ACQUIRE THESE LOANS FROM THE CORRESPONDENT SELLERS FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT, SOMETHING THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DO, OR ENTER INTO ANOTHER SIMILAR COUNTERPARTY ARRANGEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ON TERMS THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. 

WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON PMT AS A SOURCE OF CAPITAL IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ABILITY TO ORIGINATE AND SERVICE MULTIFAMILY LOANS. THROUGH ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PMT IS AN APPROVED MULTIFAMILY SELLER/SERVICER FOR FANNIE MAE, AND WE RELY UPON PMT TO PURCHASE THE MULTIFAMILY LOANS THAT WE ORIGINATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FANNIE MAE GUIDELINES AND DELIVER SUCH LOANS TO FANNIE MAE UNDER THIS APPROVAL. IF THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH PMT IS TERMINATED BY PMT OR FANNIE MAE NO LONGER PERMITS PMT TO SELL MULTIFAMILY LOANS IT ACQUIRES FROM US, IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL SUCH LOANS TO ANOTHER AGENCY OR THIRD PARTY INVESTOR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. ACCORDINGLY, A CHANGE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP BY AND AMONG PMT, FANNIE MAE AND US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR MULTIFAMILY LOAN BUSINESS. 

THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT AND CERTAIN OF THE OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH PMT CONTAIN CROSS TERMINATION PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW PMT TO TERMINATE ONE OR MORE OF THOSE AGREEMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ANOTHER ONE OF SUCH AGREEMENTS IS TERMINATED. ACCORDINGLY, THE TERMINATION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH PMT, OR A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE TERMS THEREOF THAT IS ADVERSE TO US, WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS EXTEND UNTIL SEPTEMBER 12, 2020, SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR ADDITIONAL 18-MONTH PERIODS, BUT ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED EARLIER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHERWISE NON-RENEWED. IF ANY AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED OR NON-RENEWED AND NOT REPLACED BY A NEW AGREEMENT, IT WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE EXPECT THAT PMT WILL CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT PMT MAY NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. IF PMT WERE TO LOSE ITS REIT STATUS, CORPORATE-LEVEL INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAXES, WOULD APPLY TO ALL OF PMT'S TAXABLE INCOME AT FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATES. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPAIR PMT S FINANCIAL POSITION AND ITS ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE EFFECT OF THE RECENTLY PASSED TAX ACT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME, IT MAY DECREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF A REIT INVESTMENT RELATIVE TO INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES. 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LOAN SERVICING OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SUBSERVICING CONTRACTS WITH PMT, AND ANY TERMINATION BY PMT OF THESE CONTRACTS, OR A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE TERMS THEREOF THAT IS ADVERSE TO US, WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

PMT, AS THE OWNER OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ALL OF THE MSRS OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WE SUBSERVICE, MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TERMINATE OUR SUBSERVICING CONTRACT WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, IN SOME INSTANCES WITH LITTLE NOTICE AND LITTLE TO NO COMPENSATION. UPON ANY SUCH TERMINATION, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE SUCH A LARGE VOLUME OF SUBSERVICING IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, OR PERHAPS AT ALL. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT GENERATE AS MUCH REVENUE FROM SUBSERVICING FOR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. IF WE WERE TO HAVE OUR SUBSERVICING TERMINATED BY PMT, OR IF THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE TERMS UNDER WHICH WE PERFORM SUBSERVICING FOR PMT THAT WAS MATERIAL AND ADVERSE TO US, THIS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

PMT HAS AN EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE LOANS THAT ARE PRODUCED THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE REVENUES THAT WE COULD OTHERWISE EARN IN RESPECT OF THOSE LOANS. 

OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH PMT REQUIRES PLS TO PROVIDE FULFILLMENT SERVICES FOR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES EXCLUSIVELY TO PMT AS LONG AS PMT HAS THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO PURCHASE CORRESPONDENT LOANS. AS A RESULT, UNLESS PMT SELLS SOME OF THESE LOANS BACK TO US, THE REVENUE THAT WE EARN WITH RESPECT TO THESE LOANS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULFILLMENT FEES THAT WE EARN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THESE LOANS, WHICH MAY BE LESS THAN THE REVENUES THAT WE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO REALIZE BY ACQUIRING THESE LOANS OURSELVES AND SELLING THEM IN THE SECONDARY LOAN MARKET. 

OUR FINANCINGS OF MSRS USING EXCESS SERVICING SPREAD EXPOSES US TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS. 

WE SELL TO PMT OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN ESS ARISING FROM MSRS THAT WE OWN OR ACQUIRE. THE ESS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONTRACTUAL SERVICING FEE WITH THE APPLICABLE AGENCY AND THE BASE SERVICING FEE THAT WE RETAIN AS COMPENSATION FOR SERVICING THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS UPON OUR SALE OF THE ESS. 

AS A CONDITION OF OUR SALE OF THE ESS, PMT IS REQUIRED TO SUBORDINATE ITS INTERESTS IN THE ESS TO THOSE OF THE APPLICABLE AGENCY. WITH RESPECT TO OUR GINNIE MAE MSRS, WE PLEDGED OUR INTEREST IN SUCH MSRS AND PMT S INTEREST IN THE RELATED ESS TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH ISSUES VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES THAT ARE SECURED BY SUCH GINNIE MAE ASSETS AND REPAID THROUGH THE CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY AS THE LENDER UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PLS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR INTEREST IN THE GINNIE MAE MSRS AND PMT S INTEREST IN THE RELATED ESS ARE ALSO SUBORDINATED TO THE RIGHTS OF AN INDENTURE TRUSTEE ON BEHALF OF THE NOTE HOLDERS TO WHICH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY ISSUES ITS VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM NOTES UNDER AN INDENTURE, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE HAS A BLANKET LIEN ON ALL OF OUR GINNIE MAE MSRS (INCLUDING THE ESS WE SELL TO PMT AND RECORD AS A FINANCING). 

THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE, ON BEHALF OF THE NOTE HOLDERS, MAY LIQUIDATE OUR GINNIE MAE MSRS ALONG WITH PMT S INTEREST IN THE ESS TO THE EXTENT THERE EXISTS AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE, THE RESULT OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT PMT S ESS IS LIQUIDATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN OF OUR ACTIONS OR INACTIONS, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY PMT UNDER THE APPLICABLE SPREAD ACQUISITION AGREEMENT. A CLAIM BY PMT FOR THE LOSS OF ITS ESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACTIONS OR INACTIONS WOULD LIKELY BE SIGNIFICANT IN SIZE AND COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

IN CONNECTION WITH PLS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WE ALSO PROVIDE PASS THROUGH FINANCING TO PMT UNDER A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TO FACILITATE ITS FINANCING OF THE ESS IT ACQUIRES FROM US. THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT SUBJECTS US TO THE CREDIT RISK OF PMT. TO THE EXTENT PMT DEFAULTS IN ITS PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER ITS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH US, WE WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE ALLOCABLE AND CORRESPONDING PAYMENTS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY. TO THE EXTENT PMT FAILS TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TO US OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS UNDER ITS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THE ALLOCABLE AND CORRESPONDING PAYMENTS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, THIS COULD ALSO CREATE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT THAT COULD CAUSE A CROSS DEFAULT UNDER OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OTHER RISKS 

WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASERS OF LOANS THAT WE ORIGINATE, ACQUIRE OR ASSIST IN THE FULFILLMENT OF, OR REPURCHASE THOSE LOANS, IF THOSE LOANS FAIL TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA OR CHARACTERISTICS OR UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. 

OUR CONTRACTS WITH PURCHASERS OF NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS THAT WE FUND THROUGH OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING BUSINESS OR ACQUIRE FROM PMT THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE US TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER OF THE RELATED LOANS OR REPURCHASE SUCH LOANS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT, MANY PURCHASERS OF MORTGAGE LOANS, INCLUDING THE AGENCIES, ARE PARTICULARLY AWARE OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LOAN ORIGINATORS OR SELLERS MUST INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST LOSSES RELATED TO PURCHASED LOANS, OR REPURCHASE SUCH LOANS, AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM ENFORCING ANY INDEMNITY OR REPURCHASE REMEDIES THEY MAY HAVE. OUR LOAN SALE AGREEMENTS WITH PURCHASERS, INCLUDING THE AGENCIES, CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO INDEMNIFY OR REPURCHASE THESE LOANS IF: 

OUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING LOAN QUALITY AND LOAN CHARACTERISTICS ARE INACCURATE; OR 

THE LOANS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE RESPECTIVE AGENCY S UNDERWRITING OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. 

REPURCHASED LOANS TYPICALLY CAN ONLY BE FINANCED AT A STEEP DISCOUNT TO THEIR REPURCHASE PRICE, IF AT ALL. THEY ARE ALSO TYPICALLY VALUED AND, THEREFORE, CAN GENERALLY ONLY BE SOLD AT A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT TO THE UNDERLYING UPBS. IN CERTAIN CASES INVOLVING MORTGAGE LENDERS FROM WHOM LOANS WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH OUR CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WE MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO EITHER RECOVER SOME OR ALL OF OUR INDEMNIFICATION LOSSES OR OTHERWISE DEMAND REPURCHASE OF THESE LOANS. DEPENDING ON THE VOLUME OF REPURCHASE AND INDEMNIFICATION REQUESTS, SOME OF THESE MORTGAGE LENDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FINANCIALLY FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY US OR REPURCHASE THE AFFECTED LOANS. IF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECOVERY CANNOT BE OBTAINED FROM THESE MORTGAGE LENDERS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

ALTHOUGH OUR INDEMNIFICATION AND REPURCHASE EXPOSURE CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED WITH CERTAINTY, TO RECOGNIZE THESE POTENTIAL INDEMNIFICATION AND REPURCHASE LOSSES, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY OF 20.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN OUR LOAN PRODUCTION OVER TIME, WE EXPECT THAT INDEMNIFICATION AND REPURCHASE REQUESTS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO INCREASE. SHOULD HOME VALUES DECREASE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE RELATED LOAN VALUES, OUR REALIZED LOAN LOSSES FROM INDEMNIFICATIONS AND REPURCHASES MAY INCREASE AS WELL. AS SUCH, OUR INDEMNIFICATION AND REPURCHASE COSTS MAY INCREASE WELL BEYOND OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR MORTGAGE BANKING SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH PMT REQUIRES US TO INDEMNIFY IT WITH RESPECT TO LOANS FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE FULFILLMENT SERVICES IN CERTAIN INSTANCES. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY PMT, OR OTHER PURCHASERS AGAINST LOANS, OR REPURCHASE LOANS, THAT RESULT IN LOSSES THAT EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE DEPEND ON THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION ABOUT BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND ANY MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE LOANS OR TO ENTER INTO OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN OUR CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING AND CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, WE MAY RELY ON INFORMATION FURNISHED TO US BY OR ON 

28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

BEHALF OF BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION. WE ALSO MAY RELY ON REPRESENTATIONS OF BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THAT INFORMATION AND, WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS. IF ANY OF THIS INFORMATION IS INTENTIONALLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISREPRESENTED AND SUCH MISREPRESENTATION IS NOT DETECTED PRIOR TO LOAN FUNDING, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOAN MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN EXPECTED. WHETHER A MISREPRESENTATION IS MADE BY THE LOAN APPLICANT, ANOTHER THIRD PARTY OR ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WE GENERALLY BEAR THE RISK OF LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MISREPRESENTATION. OUR CONTROLS AND PROCESSES MAY NOT HAVE DETECTED OR MAY NOT DETECT ALL MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION IN OUR LOAN ORIGINATIONS OR ACQUISITIONS. ANY SUCH MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR PRIME SERVICING PORTFOLIO, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RECENTLY ORIGINATED LOANS, HAS A LIMITED PERFORMANCE HISTORY, WHICH MAKES OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. 

THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS, AND THE ASSOCIATED RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING HIGHER COSTS TO SERVICE SUCH LOANS AND A GREATER RISK THAT WE MAY INCUR LOSSES DUE TO REPURCHASE OR INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS, CHANGE AS LOANS SEASON. NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS TYPICALLY EXHIBIT LOW DELINQUENCY AND DEFAULT RATES AS THE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DRIVE BORROWER DELINQUENCY OFTEN DO NOT APPEAR FOR MONTHS OR YEARS. HIGHLY SEASONED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, IN WHICH BORROWERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED YEARS OF PERFORMANCE ON THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, ALSO TEND TO EXHIBIT LOW DELINQUENCY AND DEFAULT RATES. MOST OF THE LOANS IN OUR PRIME SERVICING PORTFOLIO WERE ORIGINATED IN THE YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2017. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT THE DELINQUENCY RATE AND DEFAULTS IN THE PRIME SERVICING PORTFOLIO TO INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS THE PORTFOLIO SEASONS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR COUNTERPARTIES MAY TERMINATE OUR MSRS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

AS IS STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY, UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR MASTER SERVICING AGREEMENTS WITH THE AGENCIES IN RESPECT OF AGENCY MSRS THAT WE RETAIN IN CONNECTION WITH OUR LOAN PRODUCTION, THE AGENCIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE US AS SERVICER OF THE LOANS WE SERVICE ON THEIR BEHALF AT ANY TIME (AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF ANY TERMINATION FEE) AND ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE US TO SELL THE MSRS TO A THIRD PARTY. IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING GUIDELINES COULD RESULT IN OUR TERMINATION UNDER SUCH MASTER SERVICING AGREEMENTS BY THE AGENCIES WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE AND WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION. THE OWNERS OF OTHER NON-AGENCY LOANS THAT WE SERVICE MAY ALSO TERMINATE CERTAIN OF OUR MSRS IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING GUIDELINES. IF THE MSRS ARE TERMINATED ON A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR SERVICING PORTFOLIO, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SERVICING ADVANCES THAT CAN BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS IN RECOVERY OR MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

DURING ANY PERIOD IN WHICH A BORROWER IS NOT MAKING PAYMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER MOST OF OUR SERVICING AGREEMENTS IN RESPECT OF OUR MSRS TO ADVANCE OUR OWN FUNDS TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE PREMIUMS, LEGAL EXPENSES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE ADVANCES. WE ALSO ADVANCE FUNDS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN, REPAIR AND MARKET REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. AS HOME VALUES CHANGE, WE MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER CERTAIN OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING OUR DECISIONS TO MAKE ADVANCES AND, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADVANCES FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT BE REIMBURSED. IN ADDITION, IF A MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICED BY US IS IN DEFAULT OR BECOMES DELINQUENT, THE REPAYMENT TO US OF THE ADVANCE MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE MORTGAGE LOAN IS REPAID OR REFINANCED OR A LIQUIDATION OCCURS. A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ADVANCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, AND OUR INABILITY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ADVANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OF MSRS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OF SERVICING PORTFOLIOS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO APPROPRIATELY SERVICE ANY SUCH ASSETS. THE PROCESS OF ACQUIRING THESE ASSETS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NOT RESULT IN THE FULL BENEFITS EXPECTED. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACQUISITIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, UNANTICIPATED ISSUES IN INTEGRATING INFORMATION REGARDING THE NEW LOANS TO BE SERVICED INTO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OTHER ONGOING BUSINESS CONCERNS. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN INCREASED SCRUTINY BY THE AGENCIES AND REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO LARGE SERVICING ACQUISITIONS, THE EFFECT OF WHICH COULD REDUCE THE WILLINGNESS OF SELLING INSTITUTIONS TO PURSUE MSR SALES AND/OR IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE MSR ACQUISITIONS. MOREOVER, IF WE INAPPROPRIATELY VALUE THE ASSETS THAT WE ACQUIRE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT WE ACQUIRE DECLINES AFTER WE ACQUIRE THEM, THE RESULTING CHARGES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT BOTH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AND OUR EARNINGS. FURTHERMORE, IF WE INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION, THE ACQUIRED SERVICING PORTFOLIO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO SERVICE THAT ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. UNSUITABLE OR UNSUCCESSFUL ACQUISITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT 

THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. 

THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, MANAGEMENT FEE RATES, REPUTATION, AND THE CONTINUITY OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND BUYING AND SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH INTERMEDIARIES. A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING, SERVE TO INCREASE OUR COMPETITIVE RISKS: 

A NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES, MORE COMPREHENSIVE NAME RECOGNITION AND MORE PERSONNEL THAN WE DO; 

POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW COST OF ENTERING THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY; 

SOME INVESTORS MAY PREFER TO INVEST WITH A MANAGER THAT IS NOT PUBLICLY TRADED BASED ON THE PERCEPTION THAT A PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENT MANAGER MAY FOCUS ON THE MANAGER S OWN GROWTH TO THE DETRIMENT OF ASSET PERFORMANCE FOR CLIENTS; 

OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, HEDGE FUNDS AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT MANAGERS MAY SEEK TO RECRUIT OUR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS; AND 

SOME COMPETITORS CHARGE LOWER FEES FOR THEIR INVESTMENT SERVICES THAN WE DO. 

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

MARKET CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT WE MANAGE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES. 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FEES THAT WE EARN UNDER OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT WE MANAGE. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS HELD IN THE PORTFOLIOS THAT WE MANAGE AND, THEREFORE, OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT MAY DECLINE DUE TO ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, A DECLINE IN HOUSING, CHANGES TO INTEREST RATES, STOCK OR BOND MARKET MOVEMENTS A GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY AND WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. IF VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, THAT DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH OUR ADVISED ENTITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR 

30 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REVENUES. IF OUR REVENUES DECLINE WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN OUR EXPENSES, OUR NET INCOME WILL BE REDUCED AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE CURRENTLY MANAGE ASSETS PRIMARILY FOR A SINGLE CLIENT, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES RESULT FROM OUR MANAGEMENT OF PMT. THE TERM OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH PMT, AS AMENDED, EXPIRES ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2020, SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR ADDITIONAL 18-MONTH PERIODS, UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF A TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS BY PMT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY BE ENTITLED TO A TERMINATION FEE UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THE TERMINATION OF SUCH MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE LOSS OF PMT AS A CLIENT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

ALSO, BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE ENTERED INTO WITH PMT WAS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN RELATED PARTIES WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE TYPE OF NEGOTIATIONS NORMALLY CONDUCTED WITH UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE FEES PAYABLE TO US, MAY PROVE TO BE MORE FAVORABLE TO US THAN THEY WOULD BE IF THIS AGREEMENT HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT GENERATE AS MUCH REVENUE FROM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES. 

THE INVESTMENT FUNDS WE MANAGE ARE LIMITED LIFE FUNDS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN 2008. ON AUGUST 9, 2017, THE INVESTMENT FUNDS COMPLETED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR REMAINING ASSETS AND FINAL DISTRIBUTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THE INVESTORS IN THE INVESTMENT FUNDS DURING 2018. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICING FEES FROM THE INVESTMENT FUNDS AFTER SUCH TIME. 

THE HISTORICAL RETURNS ON THE ASSETS THAT WE SELECT AND MANAGE FOR PMT, AND OUR RESULTING MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. 

THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF THE ASSETS THAT WE MANAGE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE FUTURE RETURNS ON THOSE ASSETS OR FUTURE RETURNS ON OTHER ASSETS THAT WE MAY SELECT FOR INVESTMENT BY PMT. THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE THAT IS ACHIEVED FOR THE ASSETS THAT WE MANAGE VARIES OVER TIME AND THE VARIANCE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDINGLY, THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE HAVE EARNED IN THE PAST BASED ON THOSE RETURNS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE MANAGEMENT OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE MAY EARN IN THE FUTURE FROM MANAGING THOSE SAME ASSETS OR FROM MANAGING OTHER ASSETS FOR PMT. A DECLINE IN THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR MANAGED ASSETS WILL ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CLIENTS. 

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RECENT PAST. WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CHANGES IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE, WHICH IS LIKELY TO SUBJECT INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO ADDITIONAL, MORE COSTLY AND GENERALLY MORE DETAILED REGULATION. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS, APPLICABLE TO US AND OUR CLIENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR AND PROMPTLY REACT TO LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES. 

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK ACT WILL, AND OTHER PROVISIONS MAY, INCREASE REGULATORY BURDENS AND REPORTING AND RELATED COMPLIANCE COSTS ON OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. THE SCOPE OF MANY PROVISIONS OF THE DODD FRANK ACT IS BEING DETERMINED BY IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, SOME OF WHICH WILL REQUIRE LENGTHY PROPOSAL AND PROMULGATION PERIODS. THE SEC REQUIRES INVESTMENT ADVISERS SUCH AS US WHO ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AND ADVISE ONE OR MORE PRIVATE FUNDS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR FUNDS AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF BORROWINGS, CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP AND OTHER PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. THESE FILINGS HAVE REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PEOPLE, RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO ENSURE TIMELY AND ACCURATE 

31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REPORTING. THE DODD FRANK ACT WILL AFFECT A BROAD RANGE OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS WITH WHOM WE INTERACT OR MAY INTERACT, INCLUDING BANKS, NON BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, RATING AGENCIES, MORTGAGE BROKERS, CREDIT UNIONS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BROKER DEALERS, AND MAY CAUSE US OR OUR ADVISED ENTITIES TO BECOME SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION. REGULATORY CHANGES THAT WILL AFFECT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH OUR COUNTERPARTIES. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DODD FRANK ACT AND ITS IMPACT ON THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY AND US CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME BUT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RISK FOR OUR BUSINESS. 

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF NEW OR REVISED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY THE SEC, OTHER U.S. OR NON U.S. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR SELF REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPERVISE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES BY THESE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND SELF REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS BY U.S. AND NON U.S. COURTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF ANY NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS OR INITIATIVES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON US OR THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE TRADE, OR WHETHER ANY OF THE PROPOSALS WILL BECOME LAW. COMPLIANCE WITH ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD ADD TO OUR COMPLIANCE BURDEN AND COSTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF REGULATION APPLICABLE TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, INCLUDING REGULATION OF PCM BY THE SEC UNDER THE ADVISERS ACT AND REGULATION OF PNMAC MORTGAGE OPPORTUNITY FUND LLC AND PNMAC MORTGAGE OPPORTUNITY FUND, LP UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY OUR REGULATORS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND TO PROTECT INVESTORS IN OUR ADVISED ENTITIES AND ARE NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE REGULATIONS OFTEN SERVE TO LIMIT OUR ACTIVITIES. 

THESE REQUIREMENTS RELATE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS, MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, SOLICITATION AGREEMENTS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON AGENCY CROSS AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN ADVISER AND ADVISORY CLIENTS AND GENERAL ANTI FRAUD PROHIBITIONS. SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND TO PCM S MANAGEMENT OF THOSE COMPANIES UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY AND ITS INVESTMENT ADVISER AND PROHIBITS OR SEVERELY RESTRICTS PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS AND JOINT TRANSACTIONS. REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ROUTINE PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC. 

WE ALSO REGULARLY RELY ON EXEMPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS FROM VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT ), THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT ), THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND ERISA. THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE SOMETIMES HIGHLY COMPLEX AND MAY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES DEPEND ON COMPLIANCE BY THIRD PARTIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO WE DO NOT CONTROL. IF FOR ANY REASON THESE EXEMPTIONS WERE TO BE REVOKED OR CHALLENGED OR OTHERWISE BECOME UNAVAILABLE TO US, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTION OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

OUR BUSINESS COMBINES THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF LOANS AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, THE COMBINATION OF WHICH PRESENTS PARTICULAR COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS THAT ARE EASILY APPLIED TO TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS STOCKS AND BONDS, MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO A PORTFOLIO OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND THE REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS CAN REQUIRE PROCEDURES THAT ARE UNCOMMON, IMPRACTICAL OR DIFFICULT IN OUR LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING BUSINESSES. 

THE FAILURE BY US TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES, SUSPENSIONS OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES OR OTHER SANCTIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EVEN IF AN INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING DID NOT RESULT IN A FINE OR SANCTION OR THE FINE OR SANCTION IMPOSED AGAINST US OR OUR EMPLOYEES BY A REGULATOR WERE SMALL IN MONETARY AMOUNT, THE ADVERSE PUBLICITY 

32 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

RELATING TO AN INVESTIGATION, PROCEEDING OR IMPOSITION OF THESE FINES OR SANCTIONS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE US TO LOSE EXISTING CLIENTS. 

WE MAY ENCOUNTER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN TRYING TO APPROPRIATELY ALLOCATE OUR TIME AND SERVICES BETWEEN ACTIVITIES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT AND THE ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE, OR IN TRYING TO APPROPRIATELY ALLOCATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AMONG OURSELVES AND THE ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE. 

PURSUANT TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PMT AND THE INVESTMENT FUNDS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE PMT AND THE INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THE SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, AND THE MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM ARE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE SUCH TIME AS IS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE, COMMENSURATE WITH THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY OF PMT AND THE INVESTMENT FUNDS. THE MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY HAVE CONFLICTS IN ALLOCATING THEIR TIME AND SERVICES BETWEEN OUR OPERATIONS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF PMT, THE INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY US NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. 

CERTAIN OF THE FUNDS THAT WE CURRENTLY ADVISE HAVE, AND CERTAIN OF THE FUNDS THAT WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ADVISE MAY HAVE, OVERLAPPING INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING FUNDS WHICH HAVE DIFFERENT FEE STRUCTURES, AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS MAY ARISE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DECISIONS REGARDING HOW TO ALLOCATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AMONG THOSE FUNDS. IN ADDITION, WE AND THE OTHER ENTITIES OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR WILL MANAGE MAY PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF PMT S INVESTMENTS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY NOT BE THE RESULT OF ARM S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS AND MAY INVOLVE OR LATER RESULT IN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN OUR INTERESTS IN THE INVESTMENTS AND THOSE OF PMT OR SUCH OTHER ENTITIES. ANY SUCH POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THIRD PARTY LITIGATION RISK, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. 

IN GENERAL, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF LITIGATION BY INVESTORS IN OUR CLIENT FUNDS IF OUR MANAGEMENT OF OR ADVICE TO ANY ADVISED ENTITY, INCLUDING ANY ADVICE RELATING TO WIND-DOWN STRATEGIES, IS ALLEGED TO CONSTITUTE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. INVESTORS COULD SUE US TO RECOVER AMOUNTS LOST BY THOSE ENTITIES DUE TO OUR ALLEGED MISCONDUCT, UP TO THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF LOSS. FURTHER, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION ARISING FROM INVESTOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ENTITIES THAT WE MANAGE OR FROM ALLEGATIONS THAT WE IMPROPERLY EXERCISED CONTROL OR INFLUENCE OVER THOSE ENTITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS OF LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATION RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS WHICH PRESENTED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT WERE NOT PROPERLY ADDRESSED. IN SUCH ACTIONS WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO BEAR LEGAL, SETTLEMENT AND OTHER COSTS (WHICH MAY BE IN EXCESS OF AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE ARE GENERALLY INDEMNIFIED BY THE ENTITIES THAT WE MANAGE, OUR RIGHTS TO INDEMNIFICATION MAY BE CHALLENGED. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INCUR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COSTS ARISING OUT OF LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF INADEQUATE INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR FAILURE TO OBTAIN INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE ENTITIES THAT WE MANAGE, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL 

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED RAPID GROWTH, WHICH MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN AND WHICH MAY PLACE SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. 

OUR RAPID GROWTH HAS CAUSED, AND IF IT CONTINUES WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE, SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON OUR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INCREASED EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING SOPHISTICATION OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND MORTGAGE LENDING MARKETS AND LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO ALL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. OUR FUTURE GROWTH WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AN OPERATING PLATFORM AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS OUR GROWTH AND WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND TO COMMIT ADDITIONAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES. AS A RESULT, WE FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN: 

MAINTAINING ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS CONTROLS; 

IMPLEMENTING NEW OR UPDATED INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES; AND 

33 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

TRAINING, MANAGING AND APPROPRIATELY SIZING OUR WORK FORCE AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ON A TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE BASIS. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR EXPANDING OPERATIONS EFFECTIVELY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW, AND ANY FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND CONTROL OUR EXPENSES. 

THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR SENIOR MANAGERS IS A VALUABLE ASSET TO US. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN THE MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCTION AND SERVICING INDUSTRY AND THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. WE DO NOT MAINTAIN KEY PERSON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO OUR SENIOR MANAGERS. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGERS FOR ANY REASON COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE FAIL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE. 

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE, DEVELOP, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL FOR ALL AREAS OF OUR ORGANIZATION, IN PARTICULAR SKILLED MANAGERS, LOAN OFFICERS, UNDERWRITERS, LOAN SERVICERS AND DEBT DEFAULT SPECIALISTS. TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND MAY BE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN SOME AREAS. MANY OF THE COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE COMPETE FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES HAVE GREATER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE AND MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EXPENSE IN TRAINING OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH INCREASES THEIR VALUE TO COMPETITORS WHO MAY SEEK TO RECRUIT THEM. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SKILLED WORKFORCE NECESSARY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES AND LABOR EXPENSES MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SHORTAGE IN THE SUPPLY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH PERSONNEL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY BE PRESENTED TO US AND THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE DEPEND ON COUNTERPARTIES AND VENDORS, SOME OF WHOM OPERATE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. 

WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COUNTERPARTIES AND VENDORS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THESE COUNTERPARTIES AND VENDORS PROVIDE US WITH FINANCIAL, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR CURRENT COUNTERPARTIES AND VENDORS WERE TO STOP PROVIDING SERVICES TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROCURE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES FROM OTHER COUNTERPARTIES OR VENDORS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND ON SIMILARLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE OR OUR VENDORS HAD TO CURTAIL OR CEASE OPERATIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO POLITICAL UNREST OR NATURAL DISASTERS AND THEN TRANSFER SOME OR ALL OF THESE OPERATIONS TO ANOTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREA, WE COULD EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS IN SERVICE AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER FUTURE OVERHEAD COSTS. WITH RESPECT TO VENDORS ENGAGED TO PERFORM CERTAIN SERVICING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS REGULATIONS AND ESTABLISH PROCEDURES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE VENDOR S ACTIVITIES COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT A VENDOR S ACTIVITIES ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR REGULATORS, AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. FURTHER, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISRUPTIONS IN SERVICE WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OUR FAILURE TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK, INCLUDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, COULD CAUSE HARM TO OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. 

MAINTAINING OUR REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING AND RETAINING CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, TRADING COUNTERPARTIES, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. IF WE FAIL TO DEAL WITH, OR APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK, WE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS. SUCH ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY OF THE OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN THIS ITEM 1A.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS ALSO SERVE AS OFFICERS OF PMT. AS WE EXPAND THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE INCREASINGLY CONFRONT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RELATING TO INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WE MANAGE FOR OUR CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, INVESTORS MAY PERCEIVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REGARDING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND WIND-DOWN STRATEGIES FOR FUNDS IN WHICH CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS HAVE MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE PERSONAL INVESTMENTS. SIMILARLY, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY EXIST REGARDING DECISIONS ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN FUNDS IN WHICH WE RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AS THE GENERAL PARTNER AND FUNDS IN WHICH WE DO NOT. 

THE SEC AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, AND AS WE EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES, WE MUST CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE OR OTHERWISE ADDRESS ANY CONFLICTS BETWEEN OUR INTERESTS AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN REAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISE, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO THE DISSATISFACTION OF, OR LITIGATION BY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS, INVESTORS IN OUR ADVISED ENTITIES OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. REPUTATIONAL RISK INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, STRAIN OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH REGULATORS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTION, IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, TRADING COUNTERPARTIES, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

REPUTATIONAL RISK, OR THE RISK TO OUR BUSINESS, EARNINGS AND CAPITAL FROM NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION, IS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS AND CAN RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION CAN RESULT FROM OUR ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING LENDING AND DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE ACTIVITIES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND MEDIA COVERAGE, WHETHER ACCURATE OR NOT. THESE FACTORS CAN TARNISH OR OTHERWISE STRAIN OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH REGULATORS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, TRADING COUNTERPARTIES AND EMPLOYEES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

INITIATING NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING EXISTING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY EXPOSE US TO NEW RISKS AND WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. 

INITIATING NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING EXISTING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS OUR ENTRY INTO BROKER DIRECT LENDING, NON-DELEGATED CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION AND MULTIFAMILY LENDING, ARE WAYS TO GROW OUR BUSINESSES AND RESPOND TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR INDUSTRY; HOWEVER, THEY MAY EXPOSE US TO NEW RISKS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED, AND ANY REVENUES WE EARN FROM ANY NEW OR EXPANDED BUSINESS INITIATIVE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE INITIAL AND ONGOING COSTS OF THAT INITIATIVE, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THAT INITIATIVE. 

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE. 

WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES AND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY, MANAGE, MONITOR, AND MITIGATE FINANCIAL RISKS, SUCH AS CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PREPAYMENT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OTHER MARKET-RELATED RISKS, AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES THAT ARE NOT INDUSTRY SPECIFIC, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE HIRING AND TERMINATION PRACTICES, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED, MITIGATE THE RISKS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED, OR IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT IN THE FUTURE. EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO RESULT IN OUR BEING EXPOSED TO RISKS TO WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPOSED OR MAY INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN TYPES OF RISKS, AND WE MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY, MANAGE, MONITOR, AND MITIGATE THESE RISKS AS OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CHANGE OR INCREASE.

WE COULD BE HARMED BY MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT. 

WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS RELATING TO MISCONDUCT BY OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS WE USE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR EMPLOYEES COULD EXECUTE UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS, USE OUR ASSETS IMPROPERLY OR WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, PERFORM IMPROPER ACTIVITIES, USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES, OR MISRECORD OR OTHERWISE TRY TO HIDE IMPROPER ACTIVITIES FROM US. THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT COULD ALSO RELATE TO ASSETS WE MANAGE FOR OTHERS THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY SUBSIDIARY, AND CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT. IF NOT PREVENTED OR DETECTED, MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR OTHERS COULD RESULT IN LOSSES, CLAIMS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST US, OR COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR REPUTATION. OUR CONTROLS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. 

IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD. AS A RESULT, OUR STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO PROVIDE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE DISCOVER AREAS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (THE SARBANES OXLEY ACT REQUIRES THAT WE EVALUATE AND REPORT ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING ADEQUATE CONTROL OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FINANCIAL PROCESSES. FURTHERMORE, AS WE RAPIDLY GROW OUR BUSINESSES, OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL BECOME MORE COMPLEX, AND WE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES TO ENSURE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS REMAIN EFFECTIVE. SECTION 404(B) OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT REQUIRES OUR AUDITORS TO FORMALLY ATTEST TO AND REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. 

IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, OR OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE AN UNQUALIFIED ATTESTATION REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND, IN TURN, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. IF WE OR OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS DISCOVER A MATERIAL WEAKNESS, THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT FACT, EVEN IF QUICKLY REMEDIED, COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR LENDING ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXISTENCE OF ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY COULD REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO REMEDIATE ANY SUCH MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY, AND MANAGEMENT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMEDIATE ANY SUCH MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR AT ALL. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD RESULT IN MISSTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR RESTATEMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

ACCOUNTING RULES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS COULD IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 

ACCOUNTING RULES FOR MORTGAGE LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS, VALUATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MSRS, INVESTMENT CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE COMPLEXITIES COULD LEAD TO A DELAY IN PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND THE DELIVERY OF THIS INFORMATION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND ALSO INCREASE THE RISK OF ERRORS AND RESTATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE COST OF COMPLIANCE. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS COULD IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR INABILITY TO TIMELY PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE WOULD LIKELY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SHARE PRICE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO AND IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. 

OUR MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCTION BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTERFACE WITH OUR BORROWERS, MORTGAGE LENDERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS LOAN APPLICATIONS AND CLOSINGS. THE CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING AND CORRESPONDENT PRODUCTION PROCESSES ARE BECOMING MORE DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, SUCH AS OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS OVER THE INTERNET, ACCEPT ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, PROVIDE PROCESS STATUS UPDATES INSTANTLY AND OTHER BORROWER OR COUNTERPARTY EXPECTED CONVENIENCES. MAINTAINING AND

IMPROVING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND BECOMING PROFICIENT WITH IT MAY ALSO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. AS THESE REQUIREMENTS INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL HAVE TO FULLY DEVELOP THESE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND ANY FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

CYBERSECURITY RISKS, CYBER INCIDENTS AND TECHNOLOGY FAILURES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY CAUSING A DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS, A COMPROMISE OR CORRUPTION OF OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

A CYBER INCIDENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE ANY ADVERSE EVENT THAT THREATENS THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR INFORMATION RESOURCES. THESE INCIDENTS MAY BE AN INTENTIONAL ATTACK OR AN UNINTENTIONAL EVENT AND COULD INVOLVE GAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR PURPOSES OF THEFT OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS, MISAPPROPRIATING ASSETS, STEALING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, CORRUPTING DATA OR CAUSING OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION. THE RESULT OF THESE INCIDENTS MAY INCLUDE DISRUPTED OPERATIONS, MISSTATED OR UNRELIABLE FINANCIAL DATA, LIABILITY FOR STOLEN ASSETS OR INFORMATION, INCREASED CYBERSECURITY PROTECTION AND INSURANCE COSTS, LITIGATION AND DAMAGE TO OUR INVESTOR RELATIONSHIPS. 

AS OUR RELIANCE ON RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED, SO HAVE THE RISKS POSED TO ITS INFORMATION SYSTEMS, BOTH PROPRIETARY AND THOSE PROVIDED TO US BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS AND FAILURES CAUSED BY FIRE, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, UNAUTHORIZED INTRUSION, COMPUTER VIRUSES AND DISABLING DEVICES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS MAY INTERRUPT OR DELAY OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. 

DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OUR INVESTMENT IN SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL SECURITY MEASURES, EMPLOYEE TRAINING, CONTRACTUAL PRECAUTIONS AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS, AND OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO HELP MITIGATE CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND CYBER INTRUSIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH CYBER INTRUSIONS WILL NOT OCCUR OR, IF THEY DO OCCUR, THAT THEY WILL BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. WE ALSO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE METHODS OF ATTACK CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED UNTIL AFTER SUCH ATTACK HAS BEEN LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE SECURITY ATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS PERSONS INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ARE ALSO HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ACTIONS AND INACTIONS OF OUR THIRD-PARTY VENDORS REGARDING CYBERSECURITY AND OTHER CONSUMER-RELATED MATTERS. 

ANY OF THE FOREGOING EVENTS COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO US OR TO OUR CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, ADDITIONAL REGULATORY SCRUTINY, SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION EXPOSURE AND HARM TO OUR REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS , ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR WAR MAY CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS AND IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR WAR MAY CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE REAL ESTATE CAPITAL MARKETS, AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL. SUCH ATTACKS COULD ALSO CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS. ANY FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE ANTICIPATION OF ANY SUCH ATTACKS, THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY MILITARY OR OTHER RESPONSE BY THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES, AND OTHER ARMED CONFLICTS COULD CAUSE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING TO DECREASE OR RESULT IN INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMY. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF SOME OF OUR LOANS AND INVESTMENTS AND THE PROPERTIES UNDERLYING OUR INTERESTS. 

WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE ATTACKS AND THESE LOSSES MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE AND MAY CAUSE THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE OR BE MORE VOLATILE. A PROLONGED ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, RECESSION OR DECLINING REAL ESTATE VALUES COULD IMPAIR THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE 

37 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CAPITAL MARKETS OR RESULT IN A DECISION BY LENDERS NOT TO EXTEND CREDIT TO US. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SEVERITY OF THE EFFECT THAT POTENTIAL FUTURE ARMED CONFLICTS AND TERRORIST ATTACKS WOULD HAVE ON US. LOSSES RESULTING FROM THESE TYPES OF EVENTS MAY NOT BE FULLY INSURABLE. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING RISKS OF LOSS FROM ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND MAN-MADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND MAN-MADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS HURRICANES, TORNADOES, EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, DROUGHTS, FIRES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAN DAMAGE PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN OR THAT COLLATERALIZE LOANS WE OWN OR SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE PROPERTIES WHERE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. FUTURE ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND MAN-MADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR, AND VALUE OF, OUR ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE COST TO SERVICE OR MANAGE SUCH ASSETS, DIRECTLY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS THROUGH DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR LOSS, AND THEREAFTER MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF INSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE EVENTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR OWNED REAL ESTATE AND THE PROPERTIES COLLATERALIZING OUR LOAN ASSETS OR UNDERLYING OUR MSR ASSETS ARE ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE, WE CANNOT PREDICT AT THIS TIME IF WE OR OUR BORROWERS WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE COVERAGE AT A REASONABLE COST IN THE FUTURE, OR IF WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PASS ALONG ALL OF THE COSTS OF INSURANCE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE INSURERS OF PROPERTY IN WHICH WE HOLD AN INTEREST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS PAYMENTS DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

OWNERS OF PENNYMAC OTHER THAN US WILL INITIALLY BE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF VOTES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK, AND THEIR INTERESTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OUR PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS. 

PURSUANT TO SEPARATE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS WITH BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS, EACH OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS HAS THE RIGHT TO NOMINATE ONE OR TWO INDIVIDUALS FOR ELECTION TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTING POWER OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK THAT IT HOLDS, AND WE ARE OBLIGATED TO USE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO CAUSE THE ELECTION OF THOSE NOMINEES. IN ADDITION, THESE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THAT WE OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS WITH RESPECT TO AMENDMENTS TO OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS, AND THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF PENNYMAC REQUIRES THE CONSENT OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS FOR US TO CONDUCT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, EACH OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS MAY BE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE OUR MANAGEMENT AND AFFAIRS. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE SIZE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL EQUITY HOLDING THEY WILL INITIALLY BE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF ALL MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, INCLUDING MERGERS AND OTHER MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE ABLE TO CAUSE OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY THAT COULD DEPRIVE OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AS PART OF A SALE OF OUR COMPANY AND MIGHT ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 

IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THEY HOLD THEIR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH PENNYMAC, RATHER THAN THROUGH THE PUBLIC COMPANY, THESE OWNERS MAY HAVE CONFLICTING INTERESTS WITH HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. FOR EXAMPLE, OTHER OWNERS OF PENNYMAC MAY HAVE DIFFERENT TAX POSITIONS FROM US WHICH COULD INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER AND WHEN TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS, WHETHER AND WHEN TO INCUR NEW OR REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, AND WHETHER AND WHEN WE SHOULD TERMINATE THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT AND ACCELERATE ITS OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER. FURTHER, THE STRUCTURING OF FUTURE TRANSACTIONS MAY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THESE OWNERS TAX OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS EVEN WHERE NO SIMILAR BENEFIT WOULD ACCRUE TO US. 

WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE OWNERS OF PENNYMAC OTHER THAN US FOR CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS THAT WE MAY CLAIM, AND THE AMOUNTS WE MAY PAY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. 

WE ARE A PARTY TO A TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN OWNERS OF PENNYMAC OTHER THAN US THAT PROVIDES FOR THE PAYMENT BY US TO THOSE OWNERS OF 85 OF THE TAX BENEFITS, IF ANY, THAT WE ARE DEEMED TO REALIZE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS A RESULT OF (I) INCREASES IN TAX BASIS RESULTING FROM EXCHANGES OF CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC FOR SHARES 

38 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND (II) CERTAIN OTHER TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO OUR ENTERING INTO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. 

WE EXPECT THAT THE PAYMENTS THAT WE MAY MAKE UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE TRANSACTIONS OR EVENTS COULD INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED AND THE CORRESPONDING TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT PAYMENTS. THERE MAY BE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY IF, AS A RESULT OF TIMING DISCREPANCIES OR OTHERWISE, THE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT EXCEED THE ACTUAL BENEFITS WE REALIZE IN RESPECT OF THE TAX ATTRIBUTES SUBJECT TO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO US BY PENNYMAC ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT US TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT AFTER WE HAVE PAID OUR TAXES. FURTHERMORE, OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT COULD MAKE US A LESS ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR AN ACQUISITION, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT CANNOT USE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE DEEMED REALIZED UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. THE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT ARE NOT CONDITIONED UPON THE CONTINUED OWNERSHIP OF US BY OWNERS OF PENNYMAC. 

IN CERTAIN CASES, PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT TO OWNERS OF PENNYMAC OTHER THAN US MAY BE ACCELERATED AND/OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE ACTUAL BENEFITS WE REALIZE IN RESPECT OF THE TAX ATTRIBUTES SUBJECT TO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. 

THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT UPON CERTAIN MERGERS, ASSET SALES, OTHER FORMS OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OR OTHER CHANGES OF CONTROL, OR IF, AT ANY TIME, WE ELECT AN EARLY TERMINATION OF THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, OUR (OR OUR SUCCESSOR S) OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO EXCHANGED OR ACQUIRED CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC (WHETHER EXCHANGED OR ACQUIRED BEFORE OR AFTER SUCH TRANSACTION) WOULD BE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME TO FULLY UTILIZE THE DEDUCTIONS ARISING FROM THE INCREASED TAX DEDUCTIONS AND TAX BASIS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO ENTERING INTO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT THAT DIFFER FROM THE PERCENTAGE SPECIFIED IN THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT OF THE ACTUAL BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE IN RESPECT OF THE TAX ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. ALSO, IF WE ELECT TO TERMINATE THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT EARLY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, WHICH UPFRONT PAYMENT MAY BE MADE YEARS IN ADVANCE OF THE ACTUAL REALIZATION OF SUCH FUTURE BENEFITS (IF ANY). IN THESE SITUATIONS, OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT COULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS OUR ATTRACTIVENESS AS A TARGET FOR AN ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FINANCE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. 

PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT WILL BE BASED ON THE TAX REPORTING POSITIONS THAT WE DETERMINE. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, OR IRS, TO CHALLENGE A TAX BASIS INCREASE, WE WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED FOR ANY PAYMENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PAYMENTS COULD BE MADE UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT IN EXCESS OF THE TAX BENEFITS THAT WE ACTUALLY REALIZE IN RESPECT OF (I) INCREASES IN TAX BASIS RESULTING FROM EXCHANGES OF CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC FOR SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND (II) CERTAIN OTHER TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO OUR ENTERING INTO THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. 

OUR ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS OUR INTEREST IN PENNYMAC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND WE ARE ACCORDINGLY DEPENDENT UPON DISTRIBUTIONS FROM PENNYMAC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY TAXES, MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT OR PAY DIVIDENDS. 

WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY AND HAVE NO MATERIAL ASSETS OTHER THAN OUR OWNERSHIP OF CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC. WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT MEANS OF GENERATING REVENUE. WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TAX ON OUR ALLOCABLE SHARE OF THE TAXABLE INCOME OF PENNYMAC AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER PENNYMAC DISTRIBUTES TO US ANY CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED FUNDS, AND PENNYMAC IS RESTRICTED FROM MAKING SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR UNDER THE TERMS OF FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, OR IS OTHERWISE UNABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDS, IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

39 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE MAY NOT PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE TAX DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY PENNYMAC. THE CASH RECEIVED FROM SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS WILL FIRST BE USED TO SATISFY ANY OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES AND THEN TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE OWNERS OF PENNYMAC OTHER THAN US. THE DECLARATION, AMOUNT AND PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDENDS ON SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO ANY REMAINING EXCESS CASH WILL BE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT GENERAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL, LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY US TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OR BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO US, AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS AS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT. WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO CREDIT AGREEMENTS OR OTHER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE THAT RESTRICT OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

ANTI TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MIGHT DISCOURAGE OR DELAY ACQUISITION ATTEMPTS FOR US THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER FAVORABLE. 

OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY MAKE THE ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY MORE DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PROVISIONS: 

AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF UNDESIGNATED PREFERRED STOCK, THE TERMS OF WHICH MAY BE ESTABLISHED AND THE SHARES OF WHICH MAY BE ISSUED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, AND WHICH MAY INCLUDE SUPER VOTING, SPECIAL APPROVAL, DIVIDEND, OR OTHER RIGHTS OR PREFERENCES SUPERIOR TO THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK; 

PROHIBIT STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT UNLESS THE MATTER AS TO WHICH ACTION IS BEING TAKEN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH REQUIRES ALL STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS REGARDING MATTERS NOT APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BE TAKEN AT A MEETING OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS; 

PROVIDE THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED TO MAKE, ALTER, OR REPEAL OUR BYLAWS (PROVIDED THAT, IF THAT ACTION ADVERSELY AFFECTS BLACKROCK OR HIGHFIELDS WHEN THAT ENTITY, TOGETHER WITH ITS AFFILIATES, HOLDS AT LEAST 5 OF THE VOTING POWER OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK, OUR STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT SUCH ACTION MUST BE APPROVED BY THAT ENTITY); 

ESTABLISH ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR NOMINATIONS FOR ELECTIONS TO OUR BOARD OR FOR PROPOSING MATTERS THAT CAN BE ACTED UPON BY STOCKHOLDERS AT STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS; AND 

PREVENT US FROM SELLING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS OR COMPLETING A MERGER OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT CONSTITUTES A CHANGE OF CONTROL WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY OF THOSE OF OUR DIRECTORS WHO ARE NOT ALSO OUR OFFICERS. 

THESE ANTI TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONS UNDER DELAWARE LAW COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY, INCLUDING ACTIONS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY DEEM ADVANTAGEOUS, OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU AND OTHER STOCKHOLDERS TO ELECT DIRECTORS OF YOUR CHOOSING AND TO CAUSE US TO TAKE OTHER CORPORATE ACTIONS YOU DESIRE. 

OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS PROVISIONS RENOUNCING OUR INTEREST AND EXPECTANCY IN CERTAIN CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED BY OR PRESENTED TO BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS. 

BLACKROCK, HIGHFIELDS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING CAPITAL TO GROWING COMPANIES, AND MAY ACQUIRE INTERESTS IN BUSINESSES THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COMPETE WITH CERTAIN PORTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION PROVIDES THAT NEITHER BLACKROCK NOR HIGHFIELDS NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HAS ANY DUTY TO REFRAIN FROM (I) ENGAGING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN A CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY IN THE SAME OR SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS IN WHICH WE NOW ENGAGE OR PROPOSE TO ENGAGE, OR (II) DOING BUSINESS WITH ANY OF OUR CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS OR

VENDORS. IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER OF BLACKROCK OR HIGHFIELDS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION OR OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY WHICH MAY BE A CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FOR ITSELF OR ITS AFFILIATES AND FOR US OR OUR AFFILIATES OTHER THAN IN THE CAPACITY AS ONE OF OUR OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS, THEN NEITHER BLACKROCK NOR HIGHFIELDS HAS ANY DUTY TO COMMUNICATE OR OFFER SUCH TRANSACTION OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY TO US AND MAY TAKE ANY SUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR THEMSELVES OR OFFER IT TO ANOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY. NEITHER BLACKROCK NOR HIGHFIELDS NOR ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR OR EMPLOYEE THEREOF, SHALL BE LIABLE TO US OR TO ANY OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS (OR ANY AFFILIATES THEREOF) FOR BREACH OF ANY FIDUCIARY OR OTHER DUTY BY ENGAGING IN ANY SUCH ACTIVITY AND WE WAIVE AND RENOUNCE ANY CLAIM BASED ON SUCH ACTIVITY. THIS PROVISION APPLIES EVEN IF THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IS ONE THAT WE MIGHT REASONABLY BE DEEMED TO HAVE PURSUED OR HAD THE ABILITY OR DESIRE TO PURSUE IF GRANTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. OUR SEPARATE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS WITH BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS PROVIDE THAT ANY AMENDMENT OR REPEAL OF THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE REQUIRES THE CONSENT OF EACH OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS AS LONG AS IT, OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, HOLDS ANY EQUITY INTEREST IN US. THESE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS IF ATTRACTIVE CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALLOCATED BY BLACKROCK OR HIGHFIELDS TO THEMSELVES OR THEIR OTHER AFFILIATES INSTEAD OF TO US. 

OUR BYLAWS INCLUDE AN EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION THAT COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO OBTAIN A JUDICIAL FORUM VIEWED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS AS MORE FAVORABLE FOR DISPUTES WITH US OR OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR OTHER EMPLOYEES. 

OUR BYLAWS PROVIDE THAT THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IS THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR ANY DERIVATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT ON OUR BEHALF; ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM OF BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY; ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST US ARISING PURSUANT TO THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OR OUR BYLAWS; OR ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST US THAT IS GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE. THIS EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER S ABILITY TO BRING A CLAIM IN A JUDICIAL FORUM THAT IT FINDS FAVORABLE FOR DISPUTES WITH US OR OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR OTHER ASSOCIATES, WHICH MAY DISCOURAGE SUCH LAWSUITS AGAINST US AND OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF A COURT WERE TO FIND THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION CONTAINED IN OUR BYLAWS TO BE INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE IN AN ACTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING SUCH ACTION IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK 

THE MARKET PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN RAPID AND SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK HAS FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST AND MAY BE HIGHLY VOLATILE IN THE FUTURE AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE TRADING VOLUME IN OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PRICE VARIATIONS TO OCCUR. BECAUSE THE TRADING VOLUME OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IS RELATIVELY LOW, EVEN IN TIMES OF FLUCTUATION, CERTAIN INVESTORS MAY BE UNWILLING OR PROHIBITED AS A MATTER OF POLICY FROM MAKING INVESTMENTS. FURTHER, IF THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, IF AT ALL. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR SHARE PRICE OR RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OR TRADING VOLUME OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK INCLUDE: 

VARIATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS; 

CHANGES IN OUR EARNINGS ESTIMATES (IF PROVIDED) OR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS AND THOSE EXPECTED BY INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS; 

THE CONTENTS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH REPORTS ABOUT US OR OUR INDUSTRY OR THE FAILURE OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS TO COVER OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK; 

ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL; 

ANY INCREASED INDEBTEDNESS WE MAY INCUR IN THE FUTURE;

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY US OR OTHERS AND DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING US; 

ACTIONS BY INSTITUTIONAL STOCKHOLDERS; 

LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS; 

CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATIONS OF SIMILAR COMPANIES; 

SPECULATION OR REPORTS BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO US OR OUR INDUSTRY IN GENERAL; 

INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES THAT MAY LEAD PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES TO DEMAND A HIGHER YIELD; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS; AND 

GENERAL MARKET, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY SUCH CONDITIONS AND LOCAL CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED. 

THESE BROAD MARKET AND INDUSTRY FACTORS MAY DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, REGARDLESS OF OUR ACTUAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE STOCK MARKET IN GENERAL HAS FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING IN RECENT MONTHS. IN ADDITION, IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE OVERALL MARKET AND THE MARKET PRICE OF A COMPANY S SECURITIES, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS OFTEN BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THESE COMPANIES. THIS LITIGATION, IF INSTITUTED AGAINST US, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS. 

SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUED UPON THE EXCHANGE OF CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC, IN THE PUBLIC MARKET, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH SALES COULD OCCUR, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND COULD IMPAIR OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES OR EQUITY RELATED SECURITIES. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 23,529,970 SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING. THE ISSUANCE AND SALE (OR RESALE) OF UP TO 46,003,552 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT SO THOSE SHARES, UPON ISSUANCE, WILL BE FREELY TRADABLE WITHOUT RESTRICTION OR FURTHER REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. 

A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK MIGHT IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES. 

THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INCENTIVE PLANS, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE WILL DILUTE ALL OTHER STOCKHOLDINGS. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAVE AN AGGREGATE OF 18,837,717 SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED AND REMAINING AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER OUR 2013 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN OR UPON THE EXCHANGE OF CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC. WE MAY ISSUE ALL OF THESE SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WITHOUT ANY ACTION OR APPROVAL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. WE ALSO INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND MAY ISSUE CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THESE ACQUISITIONS. ANY CLASS A COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INCENTIVE PLANS, ACQUISITIONS, THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS OR OTHERWISE WOULD DILUTE THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP HELD BY INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE CLASS A COMMON STOCK.

FUTURE OFFERINGS OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES BY US MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 

IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO FURTHER INCREASE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES BY ISSUING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR OFFERING DEBT OR OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, MEDIUM TERM NOTES, SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED NOTES, DEBT SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO EQUITY OR SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN PARTICULAR, WE INTEND TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE MSR PORTFOLIOS. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. WE WOULD EXPECT TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF EQUITY, CORPORATE INDEBTEDNESS, ASSET BACKED ACQUISITION FINANCING AND/OR CASH FROM OPERATIONS. 

ISSUING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES OR SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO EQUITY MAY DILUTE THE ECONOMIC AND VOTING RIGHTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR BOTH. UPON LIQUIDATION, HOLDERS OF SUCH DEBT SECURITIES AND PREFERRED SHARES, IF ISSUED, AND LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER BORROWINGS WOULD RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION OF OUR AVAILABLE ASSETS PRIOR TO THE HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. DEBT SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO EQUITY COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS IN THE CONVERSION RATIO PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EVENTS MAY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION. PREFERRED SHARES, IF ISSUED, COULD HAVE A PREFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS OR A PREFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDEND PAYMENTS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. OUR DECISION TO ISSUE SECURITIES IN ANY FUTURE OFFERING WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT, TIMING OR NATURE OF OUR FUTURE OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF PENNYMAC PROVIDES THAT NEW CLASSES OF UNITS OR OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS OF PENNYMAC MAY BE ISSUED TO THIRD PARTIES OTHER THAN US ONLY WITH THE APPROVAL OF BLACKROCK AND HIGHFIELDS AS LONG AS THEY, OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, HOLD ANY CLASS A UNITS OF PENNYMAC. ANY SUCH ISSUANCE WILL DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP OF HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS. THUS, HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK BEAR THE RISK THAT OUR FUTURE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ANY FUTURE OFFERINGS BY PENNYMAC, MAY REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND DILUTE THEIR STOCKHOLDINGS IN US.

 OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FUTURE PROSPECTS. THE RISKS DISCUSSED BELOW SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE RELATED NOTES. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE. THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PRESENTLY UNKNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL THAT COULD AFFECT US. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE DISCLOSED, BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION.

MACROECONOMIC, MARKET AND STRATEGIC RISK FACTORS 
 
 DECLINES IN CERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER SPENDING, OR CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTION IN OUR BUSINESS, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR SALES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO CYCLICAL VARIATIONS IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BECAUSE OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS ARE CONSUMER GOODS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED POSTPONABLE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES. ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND PROLONGED NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST AFFECTED, AND COULD CONTINUE TO AFFECT GENERAL CONSUMER SPENDING, RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR SUCH DISCRETIONARY ITEMS, INCLUDING HOME FURNISHINGS. FACTORS INFLUENCING CONSUMER SPENDING INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME, RECESSION AND FEARS OF RECESSION, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DEFAULT OR SHUTDOWN OR THE RISK OF SUCH DEFAULT OR SHUTDOWN, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, WAR AND FEARS OF WAR, AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT, CONSUMER DEBT LEVELS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CONDITIONS IN THE HOUSING MARKET, FUEL PRICES, INTEREST RATES, SALES TAX RATES, CIVIL DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, NATURAL DISASTERS, ADVERSE WEATHER, AND HEALTH EPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS. 
 
 DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, LIKE MANY BUSINESSES, WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RESULTING IN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASES IN MATERIAL AND FREIGHT COSTS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT UNAVAILABILITY OR DELAY OF PARTS OR FINISHED GOODS. WHILE THE PANDEMIC-ERA DISRUPTIONS HAVE DIMINISHED, FURTHER SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY CHAIN SHOCKS, MORE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY, DISRUPTION WITHIN OUR INDEPENDENT DEALER NETWORK OR THIRD-PARTY WHOLESALERS, OR OTHER UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENTS COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO OUR BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. 
 
 ALSO DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN DEMAND, AS MORE DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING WAS ALLOCATED TO HOME FURNISHINGS. WHILE WE HAVE SEEN A SLOW-DOWN IN DEMAND RELATIVE TO THE COVID-19 ERA DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF VARIOUS CITED FACTORS AND THE RETURN TO MORE NORMAL SEASONALITY, WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AND PREDICT TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH FACTORS MAY FURTHER IMPACT CONSUMER SPENDING ON OUR PRODUCTS IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. 
 
 LOSS OF MARKET SHARE AND OTHER FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES DUE TO COMPETITION WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR SALES, EARNINGS, AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 THE RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED. WE CURRENTLY COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS, INCLUDING ONLINE RETAILERS. SOME OF THESE COMPETITORS OFFER WIDELY ADVERTISED PRODUCTS OR ARE LARGE RETAIL FURNITURE DEALERS OFFERING THEIR OWN STORE-BRANDED PRODUCTS. COMPETITION IN THE RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE INDUSTRY IS BASED ON QUALITY, STYLE OF PRODUCTS, PERCEIVED VALUE, PRICE, PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES, SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER, AND ADVERTISING. CHANGES IN PRICING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES OF COMPETITORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS AND THEIR WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCTS (THROUGH STYLING, FINISH, AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES) FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY MEANS WE ARE CONSTANTLY SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSING MARKET SHARE, WHICH WOULD LIKELY DECREASE OUR FUTURE SALES, EARNINGS, AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 A MAJORITY OF OUR SALES ARE TO DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT RELY ON PHYSICAL STORES TO MERCHANDISE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE TOWARD PURCHASING PRODUCTS ONLINE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL HAS EXPERIENCED A SHIFT TO MORE ONLINE PURCHASING AND DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THIS SHIFT ACCELERATED AS CUSTOMER SHOPPING PATTERNS AND BEHAVIORS CHANGED. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO MEET CONSUMERS WHERE THEY PREFER TO SHOP BY EXPANDING OUR ONLINE CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVING THE USER EXPERIENCE AT WWW.LA-Z-BOY.COM TO DRIVE MORE TRAFFIC TO BOTH OUR ONLINE SITE AND OUR PHYSICAL STORES. WE ALSO OWN JOYBIRD, A LEADING E-COMMERCE RETAILER AND MANUFACTURER OF UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE. JOYBIRD SELLS PRODUCT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE, WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMER ATTENTION AMONG ONLINE AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER BRANDS. 
 
 THESE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE, REVENUE AND CUSTOMERS, INCREASE EXPENDITURES OR REDUCE PRICES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS AND THE FAILURE TO PROTECT SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE, CUSTOMER, CONSUMER, VENDOR OR COMPANY DATA. 
 
 CYBER-ATTACKS DESIGNED TO GAIN ACCESS TO AND EXTRACT SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE AFFECT OR COMPROMISE THE CONFIDENTIALLY, INTEGRITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING PHISHING ATTEMPTS, DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS, AND MALWARE OR RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS, HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AT A NUMBER OF MAJOR U.S. COMPANIES AND HAVE RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER 
 12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THINGS, THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, MATERIAL BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, AND NEGATIVE BRAND AND REPUTATIONAL IMPACTS. DESPITE WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF THE CYBER-ATTACK THREAT AND IMPROVED DATA PROTECTION METHODS, CYBER-ATTACKS ON ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE TO BE SOPHISTICATED, PERSISTENT, AND EVER-CHANGING, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREVENT AND DETECT THESE ATTACKS. SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER RETAILERS, WE RECEIVE AND STORE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES, WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, CONSUMERS, AND VENDORS. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO EXECUTE CERTAIN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND MAINTAIN CERTAIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WE SUPPLY SUCH THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THOSE SERVICES. 
 
 DURING FISCAL 2023, WE WERE SUBJECT, AND IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT, TO ATTEMPTS TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF OUR NETWORKS AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH CYBER-ATTACK, MALWARE, RANSOMWARE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHISHING ATTEMPTS, SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND OTHER MEANS OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, ATTEMPTS TO BREACH OUR SYSTEMS HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO DATE. A BREACH OF OUR SYSTEMS, EITHER INTERNALLY, THROUGH POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES OF OUR EMPLOYEES' HOME NETWORKS, OR AT OUR THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN THE LOSS OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF, AND UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, SENSITIVE INFORMATION. A BREACH THAT RESULTS IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION RESULTING IN A LOSS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE CUSTOMERS, LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSSES DUE TO REMEDIAL ACTIONS OR POTENTIAL LIABILITY, POSSIBLY INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR WE COULD INCUR REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES. AN ELECTRONIC SECURITY BREACH RESULTING IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF SENSITIVE DATA FROM OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD ALSO MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COSTS WE ALREADY INCUR TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE RISKS, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND POTENTIAL REMEDIATION MEASURES. WE CONTINUE TO BALANCE THE ADDITIONAL RISK WITH THE COST TO PROTECT US AGAINST A BREACH AND HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT LOSSES ARISING FROM A BREACH WOULD BE COVERED IN PART BY INSURANCE THAT WE CARRY, ALTHOUGH THE COSTS, POTENTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING TO CYBER INCIDENTS AND IMPLEMENTING REMEDIATION MEASURES MAY BE IN EXCESS OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE OR BE NOT COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE AT ALL. 
 
 WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A HYBRID WORK APPROACH FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT STRONG PHYSICAL AND CYBERSECURITY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS REMAIN FUNCTIONAL AND TO ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR SYSTEMS AND OUR OPERATIONS REMAIN VULNERABLE TO CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS DUE TO THE FACT THAT A PORTION OF OUR EMPLOYEES WORK REMOTELY AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. 
 
 WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, SUMMARIZE RESULTS, AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND THAT OF CERTAIN INDEPENDENT DEALERS. DISRUPTIONS IN BOTH OUR PRIMARY AND BACK-UP SYSTEMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR PRIMARY AND BACK-UP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FAILURES, COMPUTER HACKING, CYBERSECURITY BREACHES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHISHING ATTEMPTS, CYBER-ATTACKS, MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, ERRORS BY EMPLOYEES, NATURAL DISASTERS, ADVERSE WEATHER, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. WE ALSO RELY ON TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE SAME CYBER AND OTHER RISKS. INTERRUPTIONS OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR FAILURE OF OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS COULD RESULT IN LONGER PRODUCTION TIMES OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND A REDUCTION IN SALES. IF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR BACK-UP SYSTEMS WERE DAMAGED OR CEASED TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM. IF A RANSOMWARE ATTACK OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY BREACH OCCURS, EITHER INTERNALLY OR AT OUR THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY SERVICE PROVIDERS, IT IS POSSIBLE WE COULD BE PREVENTED FROM ACCESSING OUR DATA WHICH MAY CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN OUR BUSINESS, CAUSE US TO INCUR REMEDIATION COSTS OR REQUIRE US TO PAY RANSOM TO A HACKER WHICH TAKES OVER OUR SYSTEMS, OR DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. WHILE WE CARRY INSURANCE THAT WOULD MITIGATE LOSSES FROM CERTAIN DAMAGE, INTERRUPTION, OR BREACH OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INSURANCE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE US FULLY FOR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. 
 
 FURTHER, INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF OUR SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO ATTACKS BY HACKERS AND OTHER SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES AND MALWARE, THROUGH THE INTERNET, EMAIL ATTACHMENTS AND PERSONS WITH ACCESS TO THESE INFORMATION SYSTEMS. IF OUR SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SYSTEM DISRUPTION, ATTACK OR SECURITY BREACH THAT IMPACTS A CRITICAL FUNCTION, IT COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, THE LOSS OF SALES AND CUSTOMERS, POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND INCREMENTAL COSTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 INABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR BRAND AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CONSUMERS' TASTES AND TRENDS IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR BRANDS TO INCREASE OUR BUSINESS BY RETAINING CONSUMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW ONES. FURNITURE PRODUCT IS FASHION-ORIENTED SO CHANGES IN CONSUMERS' TASTES AND TRENDS AND THE 
 13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

RESULTANT CHANGE IN OUR PRODUCT MIX, AS WELL AS FAILURE TO OFFER OUR CONSUMERS MULTIPLE AVENUES FOR PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS BY MAINTAINING STRONG ADVERTISING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS PROMOTING OUR BRANDS. WE ALSO ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE OUR RISK BY UPDATING OUR CURRENT PRODUCT DESIGNS, STYLES, QUALITY, PRICES, AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS IN-STORE OR ONLINE. IF THESE EFFORTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR REQUIRE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL OR COMPETITIVE CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE, AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF RAW MATERIALS COULD CAUSE DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO TIMELY PROVIDE GOODS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND HAVE INCREASED, AND COULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE, OUR COSTS, EITHER OF WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR EARNINGS. 
 
 IN MANUFACTURING FURNITURE, WE USE VARIOUS TYPES OF WOOD, FABRICS, LEATHERS, UPHOLSTERED FILLING MATERIAL, INCLUDING POLYURETHANE FOAM, STEEL, AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PLANT OPERATIONS USE VARIOUS ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT AND COMPONENTS. BECAUSE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIERS FOR THESE ITEMS, FLUCTUATIONS IN THEIR PRICE, AVAILABILITY, AND QUALITY HAVE HAD, AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE, A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR COST OF SALES AND OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS. WE HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION IN UPHOLSTERY SALES, INCLUDING MOTION FURNITURE, THAN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND THE EFFECTS OF STEEL, POLYURETHANE FOAM, WOOD, ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS FOR POWER UNITS, LEATHER AND FABRIC PRICE INCREASES OR QUANTITY SHORTAGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS. COMPETITIVE AND MARKETING PRESSURES MAY PREVENT US FROM PASSING ALONG PRICE INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THE INABILITY TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE SALES. 
 FURTHER, MOST OF OUR POLYURETHANE FOAM COMES FROM TWO SUPPLIERS. THESE SUPPLIERS HAVE SEVERAL FACILITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, BUT ADVERSE WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES (SUCH AS PANDEMICS OR EPIDEMICS) COULD RESULT IN DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS OF POLYURETHANE FOAM TO OUR PLANTS. SIMILARLY, ADVERSE WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES (SUCH AS PANDEMICS OR EPIDEMICS), LABOR DISPUTES, POSSIBLE ACTS OF TERRORISM, PORT AND CANAL BLOCKAGES AND CONGESTION, AND AVAILABILITY OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS COULD RESULT IN DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS OR THE ABSENCE OF REQUIRED RAW MATERIALS FROM ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS. 
 
 A CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FABRIC SUPPLIERS COULD IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO US IN A TIMELY MANNER. UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE IS FASHION ORIENTED, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT FABRIC VARIETY, OR TO PREDICT OR RESPOND TO CHANGES IN FASHION TRENDS, WE MIGHT LOSE SALES AND HAVE TO SELL EXCESS INVENTORY AT REDUCED PRICES. DOING SO WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND EARNINGS. 
 
 CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FOREIGN SOURCING AND ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE PRODUCT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, SOME OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN EMERGING MARKETS. LONG-TERM ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM, MEXICO, AND THAILAND, COULD RESULT IN THE DISRUPTION OF MARKETS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR CASEGOODS BUSINESS IMPORTS PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY FOREIGN SOURCES, MAINLY IN VIETNAM, AND OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT PURCHASES CUT-AND-SEWN FABRIC AND LEATHER SETS, ELECTRONIC COMPONENT PARTS, AND SOME FINISHED GOODS FROM CHINESE AND OTHER FOREIGN VENDORS. OUR CUT-AND-SEWN LEATHER SETS ARE PRIMARILY PURCHASED FROM SUPPLIERS THAT OPERATE IN CHINA AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR FABRIC PRODUCTS ARE ALSO PURCHASED FROM SUPPLIERS THAT OPERATE IN CHINA. ONE OF THESE PRIMARY SUPPLIERS PROVIDES BOTH CUT-AND-SEWN LEATHER SETS AND FABRIC PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AT TIMES OUR SOURCING PARTNERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO, PRODUCE OR DELIVER GOODS IN A TIMELY FASHION OR THE QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCT MAY LEAD US TO REJECT IT, CAUSING DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 OUR CURRENT RETAIL MARKETS AND OTHER MARKETS THAT WE MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WE ANTICIPATE. WE COULD INCUR CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IF WE FAIL TO MEET OUR EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE MARKETS. 
 
 FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ACQUIRE RETAIL LOCATIONS OR OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR ACQUISITION OF JOYBIRD IN FISCAL 2019. WE MAY ALSO REMODEL AND RELOCATE EXISTING STORES, EXPERIMENT WITH NEW STORE FORMATS, AND CLOSE UNDERPERFORMING STORES. OUR ASSETS INCLUDE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE ACQUISITIONS. PROFITABILITY OF ACQUIRED, REMODELED, RELOCATED, AND NEW FORMAT STORES WILL DEPEND ON LEASE RATES (FOR STORES WE LEASE) AND RETAIL SALES AND PROFITABILITY JUSTIFYING THE COSTS OF ACQUISITION, REMODELING, AND RELOCATION. IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR SALES OR EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE 
 14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

STORES OR BUSINESSES, WE HAVE IN THE PAST INCURRED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE INCUR CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THE IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHT-OF-USE LEASE ASSETS, THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, OR THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. 
 WE ALSO OPERATE A WHOLESALE SALES OFFICE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISTRIBUTING LA-Z-BOY PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND, AS WELL AS A MANUFACTURING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022. OUR ASSETS INCLUDE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING ACQUIRED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS. IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR SALES OR EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE OPERATIONS, WE MAY INCUR CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR THE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS. 
 
 WE MAY REQUIRE FUNDING FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT THE LEVELS WE REQUIRE OR MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT, AND AS A RESULT, OUR EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. 
 
 WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND EVALUATE OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL NEEDS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND EXPECTED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. 
 
 IN THE EVENT THAT WE DRAW ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY, OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS MAY BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE UPON CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT A CONSOLIDATED NET LEASE ADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT AND A CONSOLIDATED FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OR WITH CERTAIN OTHER AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CREDIT AT THE LEVELS WE REQUIRE, OR THE COST OF CREDIT IS GREATER THAN EXPECTED, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PAYMENT TERMS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US BY CUSTOMERS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 WE GRANT PAYMENT TERMS TO MOST WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS RANGING FROM 15 TO 60 DAYS. SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE, CASH FLOW AND CREDIT-RELATED ISSUES. IF A MAJOR EVENT WITH NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS WERE TO OCCUR, AND SUCH EFFECTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US OR SUCH PAYMENT MAY ONLY OCCUR AFTER SIGNIFICANT DELAY. WHILE WE PERFORM CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, THOSE EVALUATIONS MAY NOT PREVENT UNCOLLECTIBLE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. CREDIT EVALUATIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT DILIGENCE AND JUDGMENT, ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. SHOULD MORE CUSTOMERS THAN WE ANTICIPATE EXPERIENCE LIQUIDITY ISSUES, IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED ON A TIMELY BASIS, OR IF A CUSTOMER DECLARES BANKRUPTCY OR CLOSES STORES, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COLLECTING AMOUNTS OWED TO US BY THESE CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK FACTORS 
 
 OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE, CUSTOMER, CONSUMER, VENDOR OR COMPANY DATA. 
 
 WE RECEIVE, PROCESS, STORE, USE AND SHARE DATA, SOME OF WHICH CONTAINS PERSONAL INFORMATION. THERE ARE NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE, HANDLING, USE, DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER, AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE REGULARLY CHANGING, SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN AND DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS AND MAY BE INCONSISTENT AMONG COUNTRIES OR CONFLICT WITH OTHER RULES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EUROPEAN GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION GDPR APPLIES TO US AND CREATES A RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF PERSONAL DATA, INCLUDING THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT DATA BREACHES, AND IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT CCPA ), AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURE AND DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE CCPA PROVIDES CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS, AS WELL AS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DATA BREACHES. THE GDPR, THE CCPA, THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT, AND OTHER PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND RISKS OF NON-COMPLIANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND HARM TO OUR BRAND. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE LAWS MAY BE INTERPRETED OR APPLIED IN A MANNER THAT IS ADVERSE TO US, UNFORESEEN, OR OTHERWISE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PRACTICES OR THAT WE MAY NOT ADEQUATELY ADAPT OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND/OR PROCEDURES TO EVOLVING REGULATIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND POTENTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR PRACTICES IN A MANNER ADVERSE TO OUR BUSINESS OR LIMIT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, MAY BE HARMED, WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO LITIGATION, OR WE COULD LOSE BOTH CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE.

CHANGES IN THE DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OR TRADE POLICIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, CUSTOMS, SANCTIONS, TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING, CONSUMER PROTECTION, E-COMMERCE, PRIVACY, HEALTH AND SAFETY, REAL ESTATE, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ZONING AND OCCUPANCY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONALLY MAY REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES OR OTHERWISE INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 BECAUSE WE MANUFACTURE COMPONENTS AND FINISHED GOODS IN MEXICO, PURCHASE COMPONENTS AND FINISHED GOODS MANUFACTURED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CHINA AND VIETNAM, PARTICIPATE IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES IN THAILAND, AND OPERATE A WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BUSINESS IN CANADA, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OR TRADE POLICIES, INCLUDING NEW OR INCREASED DUTIES, TARIFFS, RETALIATORY TARIFFS, TRADE LIMITATIONS AND TERMINATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS. THE UNITED STATES HAS ENACTED CERTAIN TARIFFS ON MANY ITEMS SOURCED FROM CHINA, INCLUDING CERTAIN FURNITURE, ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE PARTS, AND RAW MATERIALS WHICH ARE IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND THAT WE USE IN OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY OR SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE TARIFFS, PASS PRICE INCREASES ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OR SECURE ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF PRODUCTS OR MATERIALS. THE TARIFFS, ALONG WITH ANY ADDITIONAL TARIFFS OR RETALIATORY TRADE RESTRICTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY OTHER COUNTRIES, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMER SALES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DELAYS IN PRODUCT RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS, OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, IF CERTAIN TARIFFS ARE ELIMINATED OR REDUCED, WE MAY FACE ADDITIONAL COMPETITION FROM FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES MARKET AND FROM DOMESTIC RETAILERS WHO RELY ON IMPORTED GOODS, PUTTING PRESSURE ON OUR PRICES AND MARGINS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FINALLY, OUR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BEEN, AND COULD FURTHER BE, AFFECTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM'S EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OUR SALES AND MARGINS THERE AND IN OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPOSITION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF IMPORT BANS, QUOTAS, AND INCREASES IN TARIFFS. 
 
 CHANGES IN REGULATION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND SALE OF PRODUCT IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES SUBJECT US TO U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE UK BRIBERY ACT 2010, THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE U.S. EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT, AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION STATUTES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDE PROHIBITIONS ON IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE WE CAN DO BUSINESS, WHAT PRODUCTS WE CAN SUPPLY TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES, AND WHAT INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE TO CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS, WHICH ARE COMPLEX, FREQUENTLY CHANGING, AND ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT, MAY RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES OR SANCTIONS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OR OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 
 
 WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS OR UNDERTAKE TO RECALL ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION. 
 
 MILLIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS, SOLD OVER MANY YEARS, ARE CURRENTLY USED BY CONSUMERS. WE HAVE VOLUNTARILY RECALLED PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, AND WHILE NONE OF THOSE RECALLS HAS RESULTED IN A MATERIAL EXPENSE OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT, A SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT RECALL OR OTHER PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN FUTURE ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, PENALTIES, AND INJURY TO OUR BRANDS AND REPUTATION, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND PROCEEDINGS INCIDENT TO THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHETHER MERITORIOUS OR NOT, COULD RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN LIABILITY INSURANCE IN AMOUNTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE, IN MOST CASES, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LARGE, SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS AND DEFENSE COSTS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SUCH INSURANCE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE, OR THAT ALL SUCH MATTERS WOULD BE COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. AS A RESULT, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF UNSETTLED POLITICAL CONDITIONS, NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS, ADVERSE WEATHER, CLIMATE CHANGE, ACTS OF WAR, TERRORISM, ORGANIZED CRIME, PANDEMICS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF UNSETTLED POLITICAL CONDITIONS, NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS, ADVERSE WEATHER, CLIMATE CHANGE, ACTS OF WAR, TERRORISM, ORGANIZED CRIME, PANDEMICS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS CAUSE DISRUPTIONS OR DAMAGE IN OUR MANUFACTURING PLANTS, DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, COMPANY-OWNED LA-Z-BOY FURNITURE GALLERIES STORES OR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, OR THE FACILITIES OF OUR VENDORS, THAT COULD MAKE SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS MORE DIFFICULT OR RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF SALES AND CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR COSTS IN REPAIRING ANY DAMAGE BEYOND OUR APPLICABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE. 
 
 THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE WORLD ECONOMY, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, AND INCREASED VOLATILITY WITHIN FINANCIAL MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE HOME FURNISHINGS MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. THE IMPACT OF ANY RESURGENCE OF COVID-19 OR ANY OTHER PANDEMIC ON OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY AND ADOPTION OF EFFECTIVE VACCINES, GOVERNMENTAL ORDERS AND MITIGATION MEASURES, RECOVERY OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INFLATIONARY PRESSURES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 
 
 WE MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT IMPACT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH, IF NOT ACCURATE, MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 
 CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IMPACT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INVENTORIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, INSURANCE AND LEGAL-RELATED LIABILITIES, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AND INCOME TAXES. TO DERIVE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES, WE USE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE AS OF THE DATE WE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR GOODWILL AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY, RESULTING FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS, ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATIONS ACQUIRED. AT LEAST ANNUALLY, WE REASSESS THE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AND QUARTERLY, WE REASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR OTHER EVENTS COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE PROJECTION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WE USED IN THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF THE GOODWILL AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND SKILLED WORKERS IN A COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET OR WE COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUED INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND SKILLED WORKERS OR WE EXPERIENCE THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF THOSE EMPLOYEES, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL ALONG WITH CONTINUED LABOR COST INFLATION MAY REQUIRE US TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR COMPENSATION IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE HIRING AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. 
 
 CHANGES IN TAX POLICIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 CHANGES IN UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE OUTCOME OF INCOME TAX AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, AND ANY REPATRIATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THESE MATTERS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR TAX PROVISION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT. 
 
 OUR STRATEGY, GOALS AND DISCLOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE ("ESG") MATTERS EXPOSE US TO NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS TO OUR REPUTATION AND STOCK PRICE. 
 
 THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED FOCUS FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CONSUMERS, EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTORS, ON OUR ESG PRACTICES. WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH AND ANNOUNCE GOALS AND OTHER OBJECTIVES RELATED TO ESG MATTERS. THESE GOAL STATEMENTS WILL REFLECT OUR CURRENT PLANS AND ARE NOT GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEM. OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH AND ACCURATELY REPORT ON THESE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES PRESENT NUMEROUS OPERATIONAL, REPUTATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL, AND OTHER RISKS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT, INCLUDING ON OUR REPUTATION, STOCK PRICE, AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. WE COULD ALSO INCUR ADDITIONAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

COSTS AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT VARIOUS ESG PRACTICES TO MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST OUR PUBLIC GOALS AND TO MONITOR AND TRACK OUR PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH GOALS. 
 
 THE STANDARDS FOR TRACKING AND REPORTING ON ESG MATTERS ARE RELATIVELY NEW, HAVE NOT BEEN FORMALIZED AND CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. COLLECTING, MEASURING, AND REPORTING ESG INFORMATION AND METRICS CAN BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING. OUR SELECTED DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK OR STANDARDS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LACK OF CONSISTENT OR MEANINGFUL COMPARATIVE DATA FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR INTERPRETATION OF REPORTING FRAMEWORKS OR STANDARDS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHERS AND SUCH FRAMEWORKS OR STANDARDS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO OUR GOALS OR REPORTED PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING SUCH GOALS. 
 
 OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY ESG-RELATED GOAL OR OBJECTIVE IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF LOW-OR NON-CARBON-BASED ENERGY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES, EVOLVING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING ESG STANDARDS OR DISCLOSURES, THE AVAILABILITY OF VENDORS AND SUPPLIERS THAT CAN MEET OUR SUSTAINABILITY, DIVERSITY AND OTHER STANDARDS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS THAT MEET AND FURTHER OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. IF OUR ESG PRACTICES DO NOT MEET EVOLVING CONSUMER, EMPLOYEE, INVESTOR OR OTHER STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS OR OUR PUBLICLY-STATED GOALS, THEN OUR REPUTATION, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND OUR COMPETITIVENESS, INCLUDING AS AN INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS PARTNER, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. FURTHERMORE, IF OUR COMPETITORS ESG PERFORMANCE IS PERCEIVED TO BE BETTER THAN OURS, POTENTIAL OR CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS MAY ELECT TO DO BUSINESS WITH OUR COMPETITORS INSTEAD, AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN EMPLOYEES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OUR FAILURE, OR PERCEIVED FAILURE, TO PURSUE OR FULFILL OUR GOALS, TARGETS, AND OBJECTIVES OR TO SATISFY VARIOUS REPORTING STANDARDS WITHIN THE TIMELINES WE ANNOUNCE, OR AT ALL, COULD ALSO EXPOSE US TO GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND PRIVATE LITIGATION.

 RISK FACTORS. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. IF
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED. THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
 WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES IN THE
FUTURE AND MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER OUR PROSPECTS IN LIGHT OF THE
RISKS AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY EARLY STAGE COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND MAY NEVER BECOME
PROFITABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF 550.9 MILLION. AS WE CONTINUE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL COMMERCIAL EFFORTS, WE WILL INCUR INCREASING LOSSES. WE MAY CONTINUE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING
LOSSES EVEN AFTER WE BEGIN TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OUR DRUG, AURYXIA. OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, OBTAIN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR OUR
DRUG, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE ANY POST APPROVAL REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS AND SUCCESSFULLY MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG. WE ARE HIGHLY
DEPENDENT ON THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF AURYXIA IN THE U.S. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE; WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY AND POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. 
 IN SEPTEMBER 2014, THE FDA APPROVED AURYXIA (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZERENEX) FOR THE CONTROL OF SERUM PHOSPHORUS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH CKD
ON DIALYSIS. THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF AURYXIA WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: 

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AURYXIA AS A TREATMENT FOR ADULT PATIENTS WITH CKD ON DIALYSIS; 

THE SIZE OF THE TREATABLE PATIENT POPULATION; 

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SALES, MANAGED MARKETS AND MARKETING EFFORTS BY US AND OUR COMPETITORS; 

THE ADOPTION OF AURYXIA BY PHYSICIANS, WHICH DEPENDS ON WHETHER PHYSICIANS VIEW IT AS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO LOWER SERUM PHOSPHORUS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH CKD ON DIALYSIS; 

OUR ABILITY TO BOTH SECURE AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR, AND OPTIMIZE PATIENT ACCESS TO, AURYXIA BY PROVIDING THIRD PARTY PAYERS WITH A STRONG VALUE PROPOSITION BASED ON THE EXISTING BURDEN OF ILLNESS
ASSOCIATED WITH CKD PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS AND THE BENEFITS OF AURYXIA; 

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SIDE EFFECTS, ADVERSE REACTIONS OR MISUSE, OR ANY UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY IN THESE AREAS, ASSOCIATED WITH AURYXIA; 

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR AURYXIA; 

THE DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF COMPETING PRODUCTS OR THERAPIES FOR THE CONTROL OF SERUM PHOSPHORUS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH CKD ON DIALYSIS; AND 

OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY RELIABLE SUPPLIERS AND SUCCESSFULLY MANUFACTURE AURYXIA. OUR REVENUES
FROM THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA ARE SUBJECT TO THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, AND THEREFORE MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE FROM QUARTER-TO-QUARTER. ULTIMATELY, WE MAY NEVER GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES FROM AURYXIA TO REACH OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY OR
SUSTAIN OUR ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF OPERATIONS. AURYXIA MAY CAUSE UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS OR HAVE OTHER PROPERTIES THAT COULD LIMIT ITS COMMERCIAL
POTENTIAL. THE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED ADVERSE REACTIONS IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT SUPPORTED THE APPROVAL OF AURYXIA IN THE U.S.
WERE DIARRHEA (21 ), NAUSEA (11 ), CONSTIPATION (8 ), VOMITING (7 AND COUGH (6 ). GASTROINTESTINAL ADVERSE REACTIONS WERE THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DISCONTINUING AURYXIA (14 IN CLINICAL TRIALS. IF WE OR OTHERS IDENTIFY PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS, IF KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS ARE MORE FREQUENT OR SEVERE THAN IN THE PAST, IF WE OR OTHERS DETECT UNEXPECTED SAFETY SIGNALS FOR AURYXIA OR ANY PRODUCTS PERCEIVED TO BE SIMILAR TO AURYXIA, OR IF ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARE PERCEIVED TO
HAVE OCCURRED, THEN IN ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES: 

SALES OF AURYXIA MAY BE IMPAIRED; 
 23 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR AURYXIA MAY BE RESTRICTED OR WITHDRAWN; 

WE MAY DECIDE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, SEND DRUG WARNINGS OR SAFETY ALERTS TO PHYSICIANS, PHARMACISTS AND HOSPITALS, OR MAY DECIDE TO CONDUCT A PRODUCT RECALL; 

REFORMULATION OF THE PRODUCT, ADDITIONAL NONCLINICAL OR CLINICAL STUDIES, CHANGES IN LABELING OR CHANGES TO OR REAPPROVALS OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES MAY BE REQUIRED; 

WE MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM PURSUING ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE THE CLINICAL PROFILE OF AURYXIA WITHIN ITS INDICATED POPULATIONS, AS WELL AS BE PRECLUDED FROM STUDYING AURYXIA IN ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS
AND POPULATIONS AND IN NEW FORMULATIONS; AND 

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION SUITS, MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST US. 
 ANY OF THE ABOVE OCCURRENCES WOULD HARM OR PREVENT SALES OF AURYXIA, LIKELY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY
COMMERCIALIZE AURYXIA. FURTHERMORE, AS WE EXPLORE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE THE CLINICAL PROFILE OF AURYXIA, ANY CLINICAL
TRIALS CONDUCTED, IF SUCCESSFUL, MAY EXPAND THE PATIENT POPULATIONS TREATED WITH AURYXIA WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ITS CURRENT INDICATIONS OR PATIENT POPULATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS, INCREASED
FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS, OR DETECTION OF UNEXPECTED SAFETY SIGNALS. IN ADDITION, NOW THAT AURYXIA WILL SOON BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, IT WILL BE USED IN A WIDER POPULATION AND IN LESS RIGOROUSLY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS THAN
IN CLINICAL STUDIES. AS A RESULT, REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS, THIRD PARTY PAYERS OR PATIENTS MAY PERCEIVE OR CONCLUDE THAT THE USE OF AURYXIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS, UNDERMINING OUR COMMERCIALIZATION
EFFORTS. WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE AND ANALYTICALLY TEST OUR DRUG. IF THESE THIRD PARTIES DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANUFACTURE AND TEST
OUR DRUG, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED. WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS FOR CLINICAL OR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.
WE INTEND TO CONTINUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO USE THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE AND ANALYTICALLY TEST OUR DRUG FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND FOR FUTURE COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO FUTURE CONTRACT AGREEMENTS WITH THESE
THIRD-PARTIES ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG WILL
DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OUR DRUG ON A LARGE SCALE AT A COMPETITIVE COST AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE REGULATIONS, (OR CGMPS), AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS
FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND FOREIGN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, IF APPLICABLE. SIGNIFICANT SCALE-UP OF MANUFACTURING MAY RESULT IN UNANTICIPATED TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND WILL REQUIRE VALIDATION STUDIES
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FDA INSPECTION. SCALE-UP/TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACTIVITIES CAN BE COMPLEX, AND INSUFFICIENT PROCESS KNOWLEDGE CAN RESULT IN A POORLY SCALED UP PROCESS WITH INADEQUATE PROCESS CONTROL. A LACK OF PROCESS CONTROL CAN LEAD TO INCREASED
DEVIATIONS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, OUT OF SPECIFICATION TEST RESULTS, BATCH REJECTION AND THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION OF DRUG PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT CONFORM TO PREDETERMINED SPECIFICATIONS. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS CAN AFFECT A
CONTRACT MANUFACTURER S QUALIFICATIONS TO PRODUCE ACCEPTABLE PRODUCT, INCLUDING DEFICIENCIES IN THE CONTRACTOR S QUALITY UNIT, LACK OF TRAINING, A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AND CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTOR S
COMMERCIAL OR QUALITY RELATED PRIORITIES. ANY OF THESE DIFFICULTIES, IF THEY OCCUR, AND ARE NOT OVERCOME TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE FDA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCY, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AND POSSIBLY THE TERMINATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM FOR OUR DRUG, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT SOME OF THE THIRD PARTIES WE INTEND TO EMPLOY IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ARE SINGLE SOURCE PROVIDERS. THESE RISKS BECOME MORE ACUTE AS WE SCALE UP FOR COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES, WHERE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF
ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (OR API) AND A QUALIFIED CONTRACT MANUFACTURER BECOME CRITICAL TO COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN THE LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR AURYXIA PRODUCTION AND THE LARGE QUANTITIES OF AURYXIA THAT WILL
BE REQUIRED FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS, THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF AURYXIA WILL ALSO DEPEND ON ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF STARTING MATERIALS THAT MEET QUALITY, QUANTITY AND COST 
 24 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

STANDARDS AND THE ABILITY OF OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE THE API AND FINISHED DRUG PRODUCT ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THIS LEVEL OF SUPPLY CAN JEOPARDIZE AND PREVENT THE
SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE PRODUCT. MOREOVER, ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN OUR SCALE-UP/TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OF AURYXIA CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL TIMELINES. 
 OUR THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS MAY NOT PERFORM AS REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR SUPPLY AGREEMENT OR QUALITY AGREEMENT, OR MAY NOT REMAIN IN
THE CONTRACT MANUFACTURING BUSINESS FOR THE TIME REQUIRED BY US TO SUCCESSFULLY MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE OUR DRUG. IN ADDITION, OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONGOING PERIODIC AND UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS BY THE FDA AND CORRESPONDING
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES TO ENSURE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH CGMPS, AS WELL AS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND CORRESPONDING FOREIGN STANDARDS. WHILE WE PERIODICALLY AUDIT OUR CONTRACTORS FOR ADHERENCE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND ARE
ULTIMATELY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT UNFORESEEN CHANGES AT THESE CONTRACTORS WILL NOT OCCUR THAT COULD CHANGE THEIR REGULATORY STANDING. THE SAME ISSUES APPLY TO CONTRACT ANALYTICAL SERVICES WHICH WE
USE FOR QUALITY, IMPURITY AND RELEASE TESTING OF OUR DRUG. WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER RAW MATERIALS, COMPONENTS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS FURNISHED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS, WHICH WE ESTABLISH BY
CONTRACT, SUPPLIER QUALIFICATION AND PERIODIC AUDITS, BUT UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD AFFECT OUR THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS. AS WE CONTINUE TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION, WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP
ANALYTICAL TOOLS FOR AURYXIA DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUCT TESTING. FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE ANALYTICAL TOOLS COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY OR TECHNICAL DELAY OR COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL. MOREOVER, EVEN WITH EFFECTIVE
ANALYTICAL METHODS AVAILABLE, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE ALL THE RAW MATERIALS AND QUALIFY ALL IMPURITIES TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE FDA, POSSIBLY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL STUDIES, ANALYTICAL METHOD DEVELOPMENT, OR
PRECLINICAL STUDIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR OUR DRUG. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN THE ANALYTICAL SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED BY THE FDA OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, SUCH AS UNITED STATES
PHARMACOPEIAL CONVENTION STANDARDS, FROM TIME TO TIME, COULD DELAY OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR OUR DRUG OR OUR COMMERCIAL EFFORTS. SWITCHING OR ENGAGING MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS TO PRODUCE OUR DRUG SUBSTANCE OR DRUG
PRODUCT MAY BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS MAY BE LIMITED AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS MAKE THE DRUG SUBSTANCE OR DRUG PRODUCT MUST MEET ESTABLISHED SPECIFICATIONS AT EACH
MANUFACTURING FACILITY. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING FOR US TO FIND AND ENGAGE REPLACEMENT OR MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS QUICKLY AND ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. FOR AURYXIA, THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR DRUG SUBSTANCE OR DRUG PRODUCT
MANUFACTURERS WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS AND DELAYS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. MOREOVER, IF WE NEED TO ADD OR CHANGE MANUFACTURERS AFTER COMMERCIALIZATION, THE FDA AND CORRESPONDING FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES MUST APPROVE ANY NEW
MANUFACTURERS IN ADVANCE, WHICH WILL INVOLVE ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS. IF WE DO
NOT ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN MANUFACTURING, DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCTS. 
 WE DO NOT POSSESS ALL OF THE CAPABILITIES TO FULLY COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT ON OUR OWN. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY NEED TO CONTRACT WITH
ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTIES, OR RENEW OR REVISE CONTRACTS WITH EXISTING THIRD PARTIES, TO: 

MANUFACTURE OUR DRUG; 

ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING, TESTING AND OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR AND COMMERCIALIZING OUR COMPOUND AND TECHNOLOGIES; AND 

MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR DRUG. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH THIRD PARTIES ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR THESE SERVICES WHEN NEEDED, OR IF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE SERVICES ARE
TERMINATED, WHETHER OR NOT THROUGH OUR ACTIONS, OR IF SUCH THIRD PARTIES DO NOT FULLY PERFORM UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY HAVE TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR END ONE OR MORE OF OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR SEEK TO DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE OUR
PRODUCT

INDEPENDENTLY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH FAILURE COULD RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF LICENSE RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCT. IF THESE MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT OR
MARKETING AGREEMENTS TAKE THE FORM OF A PARTNERSHIP OR STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MAY PROVIDE OUR COLLABORATORS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE EFFORTS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY WILL APPLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND
COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FORM OR SCOPE THAT ANY SUCH COLLABORATION MIGHT TAKE, AND WE MAY PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES IF TERMS OR PROPOSED COLLABORATIONS ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RELY ON THIRD
PARTIES TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT, WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL WHETHER SUCH PRODUCT WILL BE SCIENTIFICALLY OR COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. ADDITIONALLY, IF THESE THIRD PARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS
WITH THEM OR FAIL TO PERFORM THEIR WORK IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER, IN SPITE OF OUR EFFORTS TO MONITOR AND ENSURE THE QUALITY OF SUCH WORK, WE MAY FACE DELAYS IN ACHIEVING THE BUSINESS OR REGULATORY MILESTONES REQUIRED FOR COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR
CURRENT DRUG AND ANY FUTURE DRUG CANDIDATE. WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT WE ARE PROMOTING ANY OFF-LABEL 
USE OF AURYXIA. PHYSICIANS ARE PERMITTED TO PRESCRIBE DRUG PRODUCTS FOR USES THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THE PRODUCT S LABELING
AND THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE APPROVED BY THE FDA OR OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY AGENCIES. SUCH OFF-LABEL USES ARE COMMON ACROSS MEDICAL SPECIALTIES. ALTHOUGH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES DO NOT REGULATE A PHYSICIAN S CHOICE
OF TREATMENTS, THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES DO RESTRICT COMMUNICATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF OFF-LABEL USE. COMPANIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PROMOTE DRUGS FOR OFF-LABEL USES OR PROMOTE DRUGS USING MARKETING CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE
CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA-APPROVED LABELING, INCLUDING COMPARATIVE OR SUPERIORITY CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA-APPROVED LABELING OR SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT PROMOTE AURYXIA IN THE U.S. FOR USE IN ANY
INDICATIONS OTHER THAN FOR THE CONTROL OF SERUM PHOSPHORUS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH CKD ON DIALYSIS AND ALL PROMOTIONAL CLAIMS MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA-APPROVED LABELING FOR AURYXIA. THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES
ACTIVELY ENFORCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROHIBITING PROMOTION OF OFF-LABEL USES AND THE PROMOTION OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH MARKETING APPROVAL HAS NOT BEEN OBTAINED AS WELL AS THE FALSE ADVERTISING OR MISLEADING PROMOTION OF DRUGS. A COMPANY THAT IS FOUND
TO HAVE IMPROPERLY PROMOTED OFF-LABEL USES OR TO HAVE OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN FALSE OR MISLEADING PROMOTION OF DRUGS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY, INCLUDING CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AS WELL AS CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. 
 NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON OFF-LABEL PROMOTION, THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ALLOW COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN
TRUTHFUL, NON-MISLEADING, AND NON-PROMOTIONAL SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE CONCERNING THEIR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. WE INTEND TO ENGAGE IN MEDICAL EDUCATION ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNICATE WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE
LAWS, REGULATORY GUIDANCE AND INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE A ROBUST COMPLIANCE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ALL SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED IN A LEGAL AND COMPLIANT MANNER, AURYXIA IS OUR FIRST COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT, SO OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IN CONNECTION WITH COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW. IF WE FAIL TO
COMPLY WITH HEALTHCARE REGULATIONS, WE COULD FACE SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 AS A MANUFACTURER OF PHARMACEUTICALS, EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT (AND DO NOT EXPECT IN THE FUTURE TO) CONTROL REFERRALS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES OR
BILL DIRECTLY TO MEDICARE, MEDICAID OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTHCARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO FRAUD AND ABUSE AND PATIENTS RIGHTS ARE AND WILL BE APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO
HEALTHCARE FRAUD AND ABUSE AND PATIENT PRIVACY REGULATION BY BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE REGULATIONS INCLUDE: 

FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM ANTI-KICKBACK LAWS, WHICH PROHIBIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PERSONS FROM SOLICITING, RECEIVING OR PROVIDING REMUNERATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO INDUCE EITHER THE REFERRAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL,
FOR AN ITEM OR SERVICE OR THE PURCHASING OR ORDERING OF A GOOD OR SERVICE, FOR WHICH PAYMENT MAY BE MADE UNDER FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID; 
 26 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS LAWS WHICH PROHIBIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES FROM KNOWINGLY PRESENTING, OR CAUSING TO BE PRESENTED, CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT FROM MEDICARE, MEDICAID, OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYERS THAT
ARE FALSE OR FRAUDULENT, AND WHICH MAY APPLY TO ENTITIES LIKE US WHICH PROVIDE CODING AND BILLING ADVICE TO CUSTOMERS; 

THE FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, WHICH PROHIBITS EXECUTING A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD ANY HEALTHCARE BENEFIT PROGRAM OR MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS RELATING TO HEALTHCARE MATTERS AND WHICH
ALSO IMPOSES CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY, SECURITY AND TRANSMISSION OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; 

THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, STRICTLY REGULATES DRUG PRODUCT MARKETING, PROHIBITS MANUFACTURERS FROM MARKETING DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OFF-LABEL USE AND REGULATES THE DISTRIBUTION OF
DRUG SAMPLES; 

STATE LAW EQUIVALENTS OF EACH OF THE ABOVE FEDERAL LAWS, SUCH AS ANTI-KICKBACK AND FALSE CLAIMS LAWS WHICH MAY APPLY TO ITEMS OR SERVICES REIMBURSED BY ANY THIRD-PARTY PAYER, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL INSURERS, AND STATE
LAWS GOVERNING THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MANY OF WHICH DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND OFTEN ARE NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAWS, THUS COMPLICATING COMPLIANCE EFFORTS; 

THE FEDERAL FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT WHICH PROHIBITS CORPORATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM PAYING, OFFERING TO PAY, OR AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF ANYTHING OF VALUE TO ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, GOVERNMENT STAFF
MEMBER, POLITICAL PARTY, OR POLITICAL CANDIDATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN OR RETAIN BUSINESS OR TO OTHERWISE INFLUENCE A PERSON WORKING IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY; AND 

THE FEDERAL PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS SUNSHINE ACT, WHICH WAS PASSED AS PART OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010, AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS IN CERTAIN STATES, THAT REQUIRE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE
COMPANIES TO MONITOR AND REPORT CERTAIN PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF VALUE MADE TO PHYSICIANS AND TEACHING HOSPITALS. IF OUR
OPERATIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE LAWS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR ANY OTHER LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO US, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES, INCLUDING CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, DAMAGES, FINES AND THE CURTAILMENT OR
RESTRUCTURING OF OUR OPERATIONS. ANY PENALTIES, DAMAGES, FINES, CURTAILMENT OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 IN PREPARATION FOR THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH OF AURYXIA, WE ASSEMBLED AN EXPERIENCED COMPLIANCE TEAM WHO COMPILED A PROGRAM BASED ON INDUSTRY BEST
PRACTICES THAT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS. WE ALSO HIRE, MANAGE AND INCENTIVIZE OUR EMPLOYEES AROUND A CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE, TRUST, RESPECT AND
OWNERSHIP. BECAUSE OUR PROGRAM IS RELATIVELY NEW AND THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS AREA ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR PROGRAM WILL ELIMINATE ALL AREAS OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. ALTHOUGH COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS CAN MITIGATE THE RISK OF
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION FOR VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS, THE RISKS CANNOT BE ENTIRELY ELIMINATED. ANY ACTION AGAINST US FOR VIOLATION OF THESE LAWS, EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND AGAINST IT, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL EXPENSES AND
DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS OR REPUTATION. MOREOVER, ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY, SECURITY, FRAUD AND REPORTING LAWS MAY
PROVE COSTLY. IF OUR COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE, MORE EFFECTIVE OR SAFER THAN OUR DRUG PRODUCT, OR OUR DRUG
PRODUCT DOES NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE VIS- -VIS EXISTING TREATMENTS, OUR COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED. 
 THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AS WELL AS
UNIVERSITIES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES THAT ARE ACTIVE IN DIFFERENT BUT RELATED FIELDS REPRESENT SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FOR US. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER CAPITAL RESOURCES, LARGER
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAFFS AND FACILITIES AND 
 27 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

GREATER EXPERIENCE IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT, REGULATION, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING THAN WE DO. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ALSO COMPETE WITH US TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, ATTRACT PARTNERS FOR JOINT
VENTURES OR OTHER COLLABORATIONS, AND LICENSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMPETITIVE WITH OURS. AS A RESULT, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO MORE EASILY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THAT COULD RENDER OUR DRUG PRODUCT OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE. TO
COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THIS INDUSTRY WE MUST IDENTIFY NOVEL AND UNIQUE DRUGS OR METHODS OF TREATMENT AND THEN COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE DRUGS AS TREATMENTS IN ADVANCE OF OUR COMPETITORS. 
 AURYXIA WILL COMPETE IN THE U.S. WITH OTHER FDA APPROVED PHOSPHATE BINDERS SUCH AS
RENAGEL (SEVELAMER HYDROCHLORIDE) AND RENVELA (SEVELAMER CARBONATE), BOTH MARKETED BY GENZYME CORPORATION (A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY
OF SANOFI), OR GENZYME, PHOSLO (CALCIUM ACETATE), MARKETED BY FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE, FOSRENOL (LANTHANUM CARBONATE), MARKETED BY
SHIRE PHARMACEUTICALS GROUP PLC, AND VELPHORO (SUCROFERRIC OXYHYDROXIDE), MARKETED BY FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS OVER-THE-COUNTER CALCIUM CARBONATE PRODUCTS SUCH AS TUMS AND METAL-BASED OPTIONS SUCH AS ALUMINUM AND MAGNESIUM. OUR STRATEGY TO COMPETE AGAINST THESE EXISTING TREATMENTS DEPENDS IN PART ON PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS ACCEPTING THAT AURYXIA IS
DIFFERENTIATED IN THE MARKETPLACE VERSUS THESE FDA APPROVED PHOSPHATE BINDERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST EXISTING TREATMENTS ON PRICE, WHICH BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING AS GENERIC VERSIONS OF THESE EXISTING TREATMENTS COME TO MARKET.
FOR EXAMPLE, AN AUTHORIZED GENERIC OF RENVELA WAS LAUNCHED IN THE U.S. IN APRIL 2014 BY IMPAX LABORATORIES, INC., OR IMPAX, UNDER A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH GENZYME WHEREBY GENZYME AGREED TO
GRANT IMPAX A LICENSE TO SELL A ONE-TIME ALLOTMENT OF A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF BOTTLES OF AN AUTHORIZED GENERIC VERSION OF RENVELA TABLETS. IMPAX IS ALSO PURSUING APPROVAL OF ITS PENDING
ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR ANDA, FOR GENERIC RENVELA WITH THE FDA. IN ADDITION, A GENERIC FORMULATION OF PHOSLO 
MANUFACTURED BY ROXANE LABORATORIES, INC. WAS LAUNCHED IN THE U.S. IN OCTOBER 2008. IN ADDITION, UPON THE EXPIRATION OF ITS CORE PATENTS, GENERIC FORMULATIONS OF FOSRENOL MAY BE LAUNCHED.
THESE GENERIC FORMULATIONS COULD HAVE A FURTHER MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE PRICING OF PHOSPHATE BINDERS. FURTHERMORE, OUR COMMERCIAL
OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED IF OUR COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE, MORE EFFECTIVE OR SAFER THAN OUR DRUG PRODUCT. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE DRUG CANDIDATES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PRE-CLINICAL OR CLINICAL
DEVELOPMENT TO TREAT DISEASES FOR WHICH WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP DRUG PRODUCTS. EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE DRUGS, OUR PRODUCT(S) MAY NOT COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY OUR COMPETITORS. 
 IF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE
HARMED. AS OF FEBRUARY 17, 2015, WE HAD 155 FULL AND PART-TIME EMPLOYEES. TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG
AND ANY DRUG CANDIDATES WE MAY IN-LICENSE OR ACQUIRE, WE MUST BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL. OUR LIMITED RESOURCES MAY HINDER OUR EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES
OF OUR CURRENT PERSONNEL OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR BUSINESS PLAN COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RON BENTSUR AND GREG MADISON, THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT PREVENT THEM FROM TERMINATING THEIR
EMPLOYMENT WITH US. IN JANUARY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THE TRANSITIONING OF THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM RON BENTSUR TO GREG
MADISON. MR. MADISON JOINED KERYX IN FEBRUARY 2014 AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER TO TRANSITION KERYX FROM A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE ORGANIZATION INTO A FULLY INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL ENTITY, BRINGING TO KERYX A WEALTH OF
RELEVANT EXPERTISE IN BOTH THE PHOSPHATE BINDER AND IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA MARKETS. MR. MADISON HAS BEEN APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF KERYX AND WILL WORK WITH MR. BENTSUR TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL LEADERSHIP TRANSITION BY THE END OF MAY, WHEN
MR. BENTSUR S CONTRACT EXPIRES. IN FEBRUARY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A PLANNED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING FUNCTION
INTO OUR BOSTON OFFICE AND THAT OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, JAMES OLIVIERO, WILL BE LEAVING KERYX BY OCTOBER 2015. MR. OLIVIERO HAS BEEN WITH KERYX FOR TWELVE YEARS AND HAS SERVED AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SINCE 2009. WE
 
 28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

HAVE COMMENCED A SEARCH FOR A NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WHO WILL BE BASED IN OUR BOSTON OFFICE. MR. OLIVIERO WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING TEAM DURING THE REMAINDER OF
HIS TENURE AND WILL ASSIST IN THE TRANSITION OF HIS DUTIES TO THE NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
EFFORTS IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET OUR DRUG PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR AT ALL, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE MATERIALLY
HARMED AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE ARE DEVELOPING AURYXIA, AN ORAL, FERRIC IRON-BASED COMPOUND THAT HAS THE
CAPACITY TO BIND TO PHOSPHATE AND FORM NON-ABSORBABLE COMPLEXES. IN MAY 2011, WE ANNOUNCED POSITIVE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE FROM THE EMA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AURYXIA FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF SERUM PHOSPHORUS IN CKD PATIENTS UNDERGOING DIALYSIS,
AND IN NDD-CKD PATIENTS. THE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE FROM THE EMA INDICATES THAT OUR SUCCESSFUL PHASE 3 PROGRAM IN DIALYSIS IN THE U.S., IN CONJUNCTION WITH SAFETY DATA GENERATED FROM OTHER CLINICAL STUDIES WITH AURYXIA, WILL BE CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO
SUPPORT A MAA TO THE EMA FOR THE INDICATION IN CKD PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS. THE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE ALSO PROVIDED US WITH A REGULATORY PATH FORWARD IN THE NDD-CKD SETTING IN EUROPE. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT SINCE OUR PHASE 3 PROGRAM IN DIALYSIS, AND
PHASE 2 STUDY IN NDD-CKD, IN THE U.S. WERE SUCCESSFUL, WE WILL NOT NEED TO CONDUCT ANY ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS TO ASSESS THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF AURYXIA IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EUROPEAN APPROVAL IN CKD, INCLUDING THE DIALYSIS AND NDD-CKD SETTINGS.
ACCORDINGLY, IN MARCH 2014, WE SUBMITTED A MAA WITH THE EMA FOR BOTH DIALYSIS AND NDD-CKD, WHICH WAS VALIDATED BY THE EMA IN MARCH 2014. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE IS LEGALLY NON-BINDING AND IS BASED ON THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT
TO FUTURE CHANGES. MANY COMPANIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH POSITIVE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE BY THE EMA HAVE ULTIMATELY FAILED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL OF AN MAA FOR THEIR DRUGS. ADDITIONALLY, EVEN IF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT IN A PHASE 3, OR OTHER PIVOTAL,
CLINICAL TRIAL IS ACHIEVED, THE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE DOES NOT GUARANTEE APPROVAL. THE EMA MAY RAISE ISSUES OF SAFETY, STUDY CONDUCT, BIAS, DEVIATION FROM THE PROTOCOL, STATISTICAL POWER AND ANALYSES, PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, PATIENT COMPLETION RATES,
CHANGES IN SCIENTIFIC OR MEDICAL PARAMETERS OR INTERNAL INCONSISTENCIES IN THE DATA PRIOR TO MAKING ITS FINAL DECISION, WHICH MAY DELAY OR PREVENT EMA APPROVAL OF AURYXIA. 
 OBTAINING APPROVAL OF AN MAA BY THE EMA IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND LIKE MANY PRODUCT CANDIDATES, WE MAY FAIL TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL EVEN THOUGH
OUR MAA HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY THE EMA. THE MAA REVIEW PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE, LENGTHY, EXPENSIVE AND UNCERTAIN, AND THE EMA MAY DELAY, LIMIT OR DENY APPROVAL OF AURYXIA FOR MANY REASONS, INCLUDING: 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT AURYXIA IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR ANY INDICATION; 

THE DATA ARISING FROM THE CLINICAL TRIALS, INCLUDING THE PHASE 3 RESULTS FOR DIALYSIS PATIENTS AND OUR PHASE 2 RESULTS FOR NDD-CKD, THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OR THE MAA FOR AURYXIA MAY NOT BE SATISFACTORY TO THE EMA;

THE EMA MAY DISAGREE WITH THE NUMBER, DESIGN, SIZE, CONDUCT OR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR CONCLUDE THAT THE DATA FAILS TO MEET STATISTICAL OR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE; 

THE EMA MAY NOT FIND THE DATA FROM PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES SUFFICIENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AURYXIA S CLINICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS OUTWEIGH ITS SAFETY RISKS; 

THE EMA MAY DISAGREE WITH OUR INTERPRETATION OF DATA FROM PRECLINICAL STUDIES OR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND MAY REJECT CONCLUSIONS FROM PRECLINICAL STUDIES OR CLINICAL TRIALS, OR DETERMINE THAT PRIMARY OR SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
FROM CLINICAL TRIALS WERE NOT MET, OR REJECT SAFETY CONCLUSIONS FROM SUCH STUDIES; 

THE EMA MAY NOT ACCEPT DATA GENERATED AT ONE OR MORE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIAL SITES; 

THE EMA MAY DETERMINE THAT WE DID NOT PROPERLY OVERSEE OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR FOLLOW THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY S ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONDUCTING OUR CLINICAL TRIALS; 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE, IF CONVENED BY THE EMA, MAY RECOMMEND AGAINST APPROVAL OF OUR APPLICATION OR MAY RECOMMEND THAT THE RESPECTIVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY REQUIRE, AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL, ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL
STUDIES OR CLINICAL TRIALS, LIMITATIONS ON APPROVED LABELING OR DISTRIBUTION AND USE RESTRICTIONS, OR EVEN IF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE, IF CONVENED, MAKES A FAVORABLE RECOMMENDATION, THE RESPECTIVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY MAY STILL NOT APPROVE AURYXIA;

DATA AND ANALYSES SUBMITTED TO THE EMA IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS RAISED DURING THE REVIEW PROCESSES MAY NOT BE SATISFACTORY TO THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY, AND THIS MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL OF AURYXIA
OR TO THE REJECTION OF THE AURYXIA MAA; AND 

THE EMA MAY IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES IN THE CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS, OR CMC, SECTIONS OF OUR MAA, OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, FACILITIES OR ANALYTICAL METHODS OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT
MANUFACTURERS, AND THIS MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL OF AURYXIA OR TO THE REJECTION OF THE AURYXIA MAA. 
 ADDITIONALLY, OUR MARCH 2014 MAA SUBMISSION TO THE EMA WAS OUR FIRST MAA FILING IN EUROPE. DURING THE REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS, REGULATORY
AGENCIES WILL TYPICALLY ASK QUESTIONS OF DRUG SPONSORS, SUCH AS THE DAY 120 QUESTIONS WHICH WE RECEIVED FROM THE EMA FOR WHICH WE SUBMITTED OUR RESPONSES IN JANUARY 2015. WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO ANSWER ALL SUCH QUESTIONS IN A TIMELY AND COMPLETE
FASHION; HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS WILL BE COMPLETE AND TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES. IF CERTAIN QUESTIONS ASKED HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY AND SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED BY US, APPROVAL OF OUR FILINGS
MAY BE DELAYED, OR THE FILINGS MAY BE REJECTED. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT RECEIVE THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NEEDED TO MARKET AURYXIA. ANY
FAILURE OR DELAY IN COMPLETION OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OR THE EMA REVIEW PROCESSES WOULD DELAY OR FORECLOSE COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA AND SEVERELY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS, OR IF SUCH CLINICAL TRIALS TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE THAN WE PROJECT, OUR ABILITY
TO EXECUTE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WHETHER OR NOT AND HOW QUICKLY WE COMPLETE OUR CLINICAL
TRIALS IS DEPENDENT IN PART UPON THE RATE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE CLINICAL TRIAL SITES AND, THEREAFTER, THE RATE OF ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS, AND THE RATE WE COLLECT, CLEAN, LOCK AND ANALYZE THE CLINICAL TRIAL DATABASE. PATIENT ENROLLMENT IS A
FUNCTION OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION, THE PROXIMITY OF PATIENTS TO CLINICAL SITES, THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THE STUDY, THE EXISTENCE OF COMPETITIVE CLINICAL TRIALS, AND WHETHER EXISTING OR NEW DRUGS ARE APPROVED
FOR THE INDICATION WE ARE STUDYING. WE ARE AWARE THAT OTHER COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING OR PLANNING CLINICAL TRIALS THAT SEEK TO ENROLL PATIENTS WITH THE SAME DISEASE THAT WE ARE STUDYING. IF WE EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN IDENTIFYING AND
CONTRACTING WITH SITES AND/OR IN PATIENT ENROLLMENT IN OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND DELAYS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OUR CLINICAL TRIALS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE OR TIMELY MANNER OR AT
ALL. IN ADDITION, CONDUCTING MULTI-NATIONAL STUDIES ADDS ANOTHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY AND RISK. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO EVENTS AFFECTING COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. 
 NEGATIVE OR INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS FROM THE CLINICAL TRIALS WE CONDUCT, SUCH AS THE ONGOING PHASE 3 STUDY OF AURYXIA FOR THE TREATMENT OF IRON
DEFICIENCY ANEMIA IN PATIENTS WITH NDD-CKD, OR UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE MEDICAL EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO HAVE TO REPEAT OR TERMINATE THE CLINICAL TRIALS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MAY 2012, WE ABANDONED OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND TERMINATED OUR LICENSE FOR
KRX-0401 (PERIFOSINE) FOLLOWING NEGATIVE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 3 TRIAL. WE MAY ALSO OPT TO CHANGE THE DELIVERY METHOD, FORMULATION OR DOSAGE WHICH COULD AFFECT EFFICACY RESULTS FOR THE DRUG. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OUR CURRENT
OR FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME FRAME, IF AT ALL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 PRE-CLINICAL TESTING AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE LONG, EXPENSIVE AND UNCERTAIN PROCESSES. IF OUR DRUG DOES
NOT RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR DRUG, AURYXIA IN EUROPE. WE HAVE NOT
RECEIVED, AND MAY NEVER RECEIVE, REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE COMMERCIAL SALE OF AURYXIA BY THE EMA. WE MAY NEED TO CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND HUMAN TESTING BEFORE WE RECEIVE PRODUCT APPROVAL WITH THE EMA OR WITH REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES. PRE-CLINICAL TESTING AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE LONG, EXPENSIVE AND UNCERTAIN PROCESSES. SATISFACTION OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TYPICALLY DEPENDS ON THE NATURE, COMPLEXITY AND NOVELTY OF THE PRODUCT. IT REQUIRES
THE EXPENDITURE OF SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES. DATA OBTAINED FROM PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTS CAN BE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, WHICH COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE EMA OR A REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY, AS
APPLICABLE, MAY POSE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR REQUEST FURTHER TOXICOLOGICAL, DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION, PRE-CLINICAL OR CLINICAL DATA OR SUBSTANTIATION. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE AURYXIA IS A GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE, OR GRAS, SUBSTANCE IN THE U.S., AND THE
EMA HAS NOT REQUESTED THAT WE CONDUCT A TWO-YEAR CARCINOGENICITY STUDY IN ANIMALS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EMA OR SOME OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY WILL NOT ASK US TO CONDUCT SUCH A STUDY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, THE
EMA HAS NOT REQUESTED US TO CONDUCT REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY, GENOTOXICITY AND SINGLE-DOSE TOXICITY STUDIES AND WE ARE REFERENCING SUCH STUDIES FROM THE PUBLISHED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IN OUR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS. HOWEVER, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE
THAT THE EMA WILL NOT ASK US TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL STUDIES. WE RECEIVED DAY 120 QUESTIONS FROM THE EMA ON OUR MAA. WE PROVIDED OUR RESPONSES TO THE EMA S DAY 120 QUESTIONS IN JANUARY 2015; HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE ANSWERED
THESE QUESTIONS TO THE EMA S SATISFACTION OR THAT THE EMA WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS PART OF THE MAA REVIEW. CONSEQUENTLY, IT MAY TAKE US MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE THE TESTING OF OUR DRUG AND FAILURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY STAGE OF THIS
PROCESS. NEGATIVE, INCONCLUSIVE, OR INSUFFICIENT RESULTS OR MEDICAL EVENTS DURING A PRE-CLINICAL OR CLINICAL TRIAL COULD CAUSE US TO DELAY OR TERMINATE OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. FURTHERMORE, INTERIM RESULTS OF PRECLINICAL OR CLINICAL STUDIES DO NOT
NECESSARILY PREDICT THEIR FINAL RESULTS, AND ACCEPTABLE RESULTS IN EARLY STUDIES MIGHT NOT BE OBTAINED IN LATER STUDIES. SAFETY SIGNALS
DETECTED DURING CLINICAL STUDIES AND PRE-CLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES, SUCH AS THE GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING AND LIVER TOXICITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN SOME HIGH-DOSE AURYXIA CANINE STUDIES, MAY REQUIRE US TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL SAFETY STUDIES OR
ANALYSES, WHICH COULD DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRUG OR LEAD TO A DECISION TO DISCONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRUG. WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE EMA DATA FROM OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RAT AND CANINE PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES FOR AURYXIA. WHILE THE EMA
HAS REVIEWED THE DATA FROM THESE STUDIES AND WE HAVE CONDUCTED OUR PHASE 3 CLINICAL PROGRAM FOR CKD PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS, AND PHASE 2 STUDY IN NDD CKD PATIENTS, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EMA WILL NOT RAISE ANY SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE
FUTURE FROM THESE STUDIES. DRUG CANDIDATES IN THE LATER STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT MAY FAIL TO SHOW THE DESIRED TRAITS OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY DESPITE POSITIVE RESULTS IN EARLIER CLINICAL TESTING. MOREOVER, THE RISK REMAINS THAT THE SAFETY AND
EFFICACY DATA FROM OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 PROGRAM FOR DIALYSIS DEPENDENT CKD PATIENTS MAY BE INSUFFICIENTLY PERSUASIVE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE DRUG, OR MAY RAISE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT MAY PREVENT APPROVAL OF THE DRUG, FOR THE INDICATION SOUGHT. THE RISK
ALSO REMAINS THAT A CLINICAL PROGRAM CONDUCTED BY ONE OF OUR PARTNERS MAY RAISE EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS THAT MAY PREVENT APPROVAL OF THE DRUG. IN ADDITION, QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE AND STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION OF ANY OF THE PRIOR PRE-CLINICAL
AND CLINICAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF OUR DRUG MAY BE VIEWED AS FLAWED BY THE EMA OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AGENCY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SAFETY AND/OR EFFICACY CONCERNS FROM THE PRIOR DATA WERE NOT OVERLOOKED OR
MISINTERPRETED BY US OR OUR CONSULTANTS, WHICH IN SUBSEQUENT, LARGER STUDIES MIGHT APPEAR AND PREVENT APPROVAL OF SUCH DRUG CANDIDATE. IN ADDITION, TOP-LINE RESULTS REPORTED ON COMPLETED CLINICAL TRIALS, SUCH AS THOSE FROM OUR LONG-TERM OPEN LABEL
EXTENSION, OR OLE, STUDY FOR AURYXIA IN DIALYSIS-DEPENDENT CKD PATIENTS, ARE BASED ON A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THEN AVAILABLE DATA (BOTH SAFETY AND EFFICACY) AND THERE IS THE RISK THAT SUCH FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS COULD CHANGE FOLLOWING A MORE
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE DATA BY A REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JANUARY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED SUCCESSFUL TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM OUR LONG-TERM PHASE 3 STUDY OF AURYXIA FOR THE TREATMENT OF ELEVATED SERUM PHOSPHORUS LEVELS, OR
HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA, IN PATIENTS WITH ESRD ON DIALYSIS. UPDATED RESULTS FROM THE STUDY WERE PRESENTED IN JUNE 2013 AT THE WORLD CONGRESS OF NEPHROLOGY. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS FROM OUR LONG-TERM PHASE 3 STUDY OF
AURYXIA OR FROM OUR LONG-TERM OLE STUDY FOR AURYXIA IN DIALYSIS-DEPENDENT CKD PATIENTS WILL NOT CHANGE FOLLOWING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE DATA BY A REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE A HIGH RISK OF FAILURE. A NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT SETBACKS IN ADVANCED CLINICAL TRIALS, EVEN AFTER ACHIEVING WHAT APPEARED TO BE PROMISING RESULTS IN EARLIER TRIALS. WE EXPERIENCED SUCH A SETBACK WITH OUR PHASE 3 KRX-0401
(PERIFOSINE) RESULTS IN APRIL 2012, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE SUCH SETBACKS WITH AURYXIA OR ANY OTHER DRUG CANDIDATE WE DEVELOP. IF WE EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN THE TESTING OR APPROVAL PROCESS FOR OUR EXISTING DRUG OR IF
WE NEED TO PERFORM MORE OR LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS FOR OUR DRUG MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING AND MANAGING THE CLINICAL
TRIALS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY ENCOUNTER UNFORESEEN PROBLEMS AND DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS. ALTHOUGH WE ENGAGE, FROM TIME TO TIME, CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING REGULATORY
TRIALS, ERRORS IN THE CONDUCT, MONITORING, DATA CAPTURE AND ANALYSIS, AND/OR AUDITING COULD POTENTIALLY INVALIDATE THE RESULTS. BECAUSE ALL OF OUR
PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ARE LICENSED OR SUBLICENSED TO US BY THIRD PARTIES, TERMINATION OF THESE LICENSE RIGHTS WOULD PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING AURYXIA. 
 WE DO NOT OWN OUR DRUG, AURYXIA. WE HAVE LICENSED AND SUBLICENSED THE RIGHTS, PATENT OR OTHERWISE, TO AURYXIA FROM A THIRD PARTY,
PANION BF BIOTECH, INC., OR PANION, WHO IN TURN LICENSES CERTAIN RIGHTS TO AURYXIA FROM ONE OF THE INVENTORS OF AURYXIA. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH PANION REQUIRES US TO MEET DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES AND IMPOSES DEVELOPMENT AND
COMMERCIALIZATION DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS ON US. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE MUST PAY ROYALTIES BASED ON A MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES OF PRODUCT RESULTING FROM THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING AURYXIA) AND PAY THE
PATENT FILING, PROSECUTION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE LICENSE. IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE OTHERWISE BREACH THE TERMS OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING UPON CERTAIN INSOLVENCY EVENTS), PANION COULD
TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT, AND WE WOULD LOSE THE RIGHTS TO AURYXIA. IN ADDITION, IF PANION BREACHES ITS AGREEMENT WITH THE INVENTOR FROM WHOM IT LICENSES RIGHTS TO AURYXIA, PANION COULD LOSE ITS LICENSE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OR DELAY OUR ABILITY TO
DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AURYXIA. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH OUR LICENSORS OR COLLABORATORS, OR THEY AND/OR WE MAY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE ORIGINAL INVENTORS, REGARDING THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS OR OWNERSHIP OF
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO DELAYS IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR CURRENT DRUG AND ANY FUTURE DRUG CANDIDATE, COULD REQUIRE OR RESULT IN LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION, WHICH WOULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE,
OR COULD LEAD TO THE TERMINATION OF A LICENSE, OR FORCE US TO NEGOTIATE A REVISED OR NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ORIGINAL. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT THAT THE OWNERS AND/OR LICENSORS OF THE RIGHTS WE LICENSE WERE TO ENTER
INTO BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE OUR RIGHTS TO OUR DRUG OR DRUG CANDIDATES OR OUR RIGHTS COULD OTHERWISE BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WHICH COULD PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING OR COMMERCIALIZING OUR DRUGS. FINALLY, OUR RIGHTS
TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AURYXIA, WHETHER OURSELVES OR WITH THIRD PARTIES, ARE SUBJECT TO AND LIMITED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR LICENSES TO AURYXIA AND THE LICENSES AND SUBLICENSES WE GRANT TO OTHERS. 
 OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, OR CROS, MAY RESULT IN DELAYS IN COMPLETING, OR A FAILURE TO COMPLETE, CLINICAL
TRIALS IF SUCH CROS FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THEM. IN THE COURSE OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, WE ENGAGE CROS AND OTHER
VENDORS TO CONDUCT AND MANAGE CLINICAL STUDIES AND TO ASSIST US IN GUIDING OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE FDA REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS. IF THE CROS OR APPLICABLE VENDORS FAIL TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THEM OR FAIL TO
PERFORM CLINICAL TRIALS IN A SATISFACTORY OR TIMELY MANNER, WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN COMPLETING OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, SUBMITTING OUR REGULATORY FILINGS, OR APPROVAL, AS WELL AS THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ONE OR MORE DRUG CANDIDATES.
FURTHERMORE, ANY LOSS OR DELAY IN OBTAINING CONTRACTS WITH SUCH ENTITIES MAY ALSO DELAY THE COMPLETION OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE MARKET APPROVAL OF DRUG CANDIDATE(S).

 ANY ACQUISITIONS WE MAKE MAY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND MAY NOT BE SCIENTIFICALLY OR COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. 
 AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY EFFECT ACQUISITIONS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, CAPABILITIES AND
PERSONNEL. IF WE MAKE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS IN WHICH THE CONSIDERATION INCLUDES CASH, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH. 
 ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING: 

DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE OF ASSIMILATING THE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS; 

OUR INABILITY TO RETAIN THE MANAGEMENT, KEY PERSONNEL AND OTHER EMPLOYEES OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS; 

OUR INABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE ACQUIRED COMPANY S RELATIONSHIP WITH KEY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS ALLIANCE PARTNERS; 

EXPOSURE TO LEGAL CLAIMS FOR ACTIVITIES OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION; 

THE DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OUR CORE BUSINESS; AND 

THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND WRITE-OFF OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE STATUS OF REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR NEWLY APPROVED HEALTH CARE DRUGS IS UNCERTAIN AND FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT COULD
LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE. OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS MAY DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE EXTENT TO
WHICH REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM: 

GOVERNMENT AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES; 

PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS; 

MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS; AND 

OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS TO THE COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT
STATUS OF NEWLY APPROVED HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT DECISIONS BY THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, INCLUDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, ARE CHALLENGING THE PRICES CHARGED FOR MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS INCREASINGLY ARE ATTEMPTING TO CONTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS BY LIMITING BOTH COVERAGE AND THE LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR NEW DRUGS AND BY REFUSING, IN SOME CASES, TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR USES OF
APPROVED PRODUCTS FOR DISEASE INDICATIONS FOR WHICH THE FDA HAS NOT GRANTED LABELING APPROVAL. IN 2003, CONGRESS PASSED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME ESTABLISHED PRESCRIPTION DRUG
COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, UNDER MEDICARE PART D. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, BENEFICIARIES PURCHASE INSURANCE COVERAGE FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HOWEVER, THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT
BE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS FOR OUR PRODUCT. IF GOVERNMENT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR OUR PRODUCT, ITS MARKET ACCEPTANCE MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. 
 HEALTH CARE REFORM MEASURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 THE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE AFFECTED BY THE EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AND
THIRD-PARTY PAYORS TO CONTAIN OR REDUCE THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. IN THE U.S. AND IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THERE HAVE BEEN, AND WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND 
 33 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REGULATORY PROPOSALS AIMED AT CHANGING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, SUCH AS PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE PRICING OF HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY, THE REIMPORTATION OF
DRUGS INTO THE U.S. FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (WHERE THEY ARE THEN SOLD AT A LOWER PRICE), AND THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS. FOR EXAMPLE, DRUG MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A NATIONAL
REBATE AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OR HHS, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN STATE MEDICAID COVERAGE, WHICH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A REBATE ON DRUGS DISPENSED TO MEDICAID PATIENTS. ON JANUARY 27, 2012, THE CENTERS FOR
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, OR CMS, ISSUED A PROPOSED REGULATION COVERING THE CALCULATION OF AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE, OR AMP, WHICH IS THE KEY VARIABLE IN THE CALCULATION OF THESE REBATES. 
 FURTHERMORE, IN THE U.S., HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION TITLED THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OR PPACA, WAS SIGNED INTO LAW
IN MARCH 2010. THE IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION ON OUR BUSINESS IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AS MANY OF THE DETAILS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LEGISLATION HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED. IN A DECISION ISSUED ON JUNE 29, 2012, THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT UPHELD THE MAJORITY OF PPACA. THE COURT S DECISION ALLOWS IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY PROVISIONS IMPACTING DRUG AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS TO GO FORWARD. THIS INCLUDES PPACA CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM (INCLUDING CLOSING
THE DONUT HOLE ), MEDICAID DRUG REBATE PROGRAM (INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF AMP), AND EXPANSION OF THE 340B DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM. THE DECISION ALSO ALLOWS THE FDA AND CMS TO CONTINUE WITH IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS, INCLUDING RELATED TO THE
BIOLOGICS PRICE COMPETITION AND INNOVATION ACT AND THE PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS SUNSHINE ACT, BOTH OF WHICH WERE ENACTED AS PART OF THE PPACA. REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PPACA COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE
CAPITAL OR TO OBTAIN STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS OR LICENSES. GOVERNMENT-FINANCED COMPARATIVE EFFICACY RESEARCH COULD ALSO RESULT IN NEW PRACTICE GUIDELINES, LABELING OR REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES THAT DISCOURAGES USE OF OUR PRODUCT. 
 FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY 2010, CMS RELEASED ITS FINAL RULE TO IMPLEMENT A BUNDLED PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE
FACILITIES AS REQUIRED BY THE MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT, OR MIPPA. THE FINAL RULE DELAYED THE INCLUSION OF ORAL MEDICATIONS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS EQUIVALENTS, SUCH AS PHOSPHATE BINDERS, IN THE BUNDLE UNTIL JANUARY 1,
2014; HOWEVER, ON JANUARY 3, 2013, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS PASSED LEGISLATION KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DELAYED BY TWO YEARS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ORAL-ONLY END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE RELATED
DRUGS, INCLUDING PHOSPHATE BINDERS, IN THE BUNDLED ESRD PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM, UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2016. IN APRIL 2014, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS PASSED LEGISLATION KNOWN AS PROTECTING ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2014, WHICH, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, DELAYS BY EIGHT YEARS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ORAL-ONLY ESRD RELATED DRUGS, INCLUDING PHOSPHATE BINDERS, IN THE BUNDLED ESRD PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM, UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2025. IF PHOSPHATE BINDERS ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUNDLE BEGINNING IN
2025, OR EARLIER, SEPARATE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE FOR PHOSPHATE BINDERS, AS IT IS TODAY UNDER MEDICARE PART D. WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO PROJECT THE IMPACT BUNDLING MAY HAVE ON THE PHOSPHATE BINDER INDUSTRY, THE IMPACT
COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE DRAMATIC PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR PHOSPHATE BINDERS, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF AURYXIA. 
 ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2007, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 WAS ENACTED, GIVING THE FDA ENHANCED POST-MARKET
AUTHORITY, INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE POST-MARKETING STUDIES AND POST-MARKETING CLINICAL TRIALS RELATED TO SERIOUS RISKS, LABELING CHANGES BASED ON NEW SAFETY INFORMATION, AND COMPLIANCE WITH RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE FDA S EXERCISE OF THIS AUTHORITY MAY RESULT IN DELAYS OR INCREASED COSTS DURING THE PERIOD OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY REVIEW AND APPROVAL, WHICH MAY ALSO INCREASE COSTS RELATED TO COMPLYING
WITH NEW POST-APPROVAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE POTENTIAL FDA RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS. ON JULY 9, 2012, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SAFETY AND INNOVATION ACT WAS ENACTED TO, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, RENEW THE DRUG USER FEE PROGRAM, EXPAND THE FDA S INSPECTION RECORDS ACCESS AND REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROLS OVER THEIR SUPPLIERS AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS AND
CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, AS A PART OF CGMP COMPLIANCE. ON NOVEMBER 27, 2013, THE DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT, WHICH INCLUDES THE DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY ACT, WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BUILD AN ELECTRONIC, INTEROPERABLE
SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY AND TRACE CERTAIN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AS THEY ARE

DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TRACING OF PRODUCTS THROUGH THE PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION SUPPLY CHAIN TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2015 FOR MANUFACTURERS AND BUILDING
INTERNAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW WILL REQUIRE DEDICATION OF RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, THIS LAW REQUIRES ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH AUTHORIZED TRADING PARTNERS AND COULD LIMIT OUR POOL OF AVAILABLE TRADING PARTNERS. 
 WE FACE PRODUCT LIABILITY RISKS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE INSURANCE. 
 THE USE OF OUR DRUG OR FUTURE DRUG CANDIDATES IN CLINICAL TRIALS, AND THE FUTURE SALE OF ANY APPROVED DRUG AND NEW TECHNOLOGY, EXPOSES US TO
LIABILITY CLAIMS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY HISTORICAL OR ANTICIPATED PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AGAINST US, IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES OR BE REQUIRED TO
CEASE CLINICAL TRIALS OF OUR DRUG PRODUCT OR LIMIT COMMERCIALIZATION OF ANY APPROVED PRODUCT. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE TO
INCLUDE THE COMMERCIAL SALE OF AURYXIA; HOWEVER, INSURANCE COVERAGE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE AT A REASONABLE COST. WE ALSO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT WILL
BE ADEQUATE TO COVER PRODUCT LIABILITY RISKS THAT MAY ARISE. REGARDLESS OF MERIT OR EVENTUAL OUTCOME, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN: 

DECREASED DEMAND FOR A PRODUCT; 

INJURY TO OUR REPUTATION; 

OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A DRUG CANDIDATE; 

WITHDRAWAL OF CLINICAL TRIAL VOLUNTEERS; AND 

LOSS OF REVENUES. CONSEQUENTLY, A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM OR PRODUCT RECALL MAY RESULT IN
LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. SECURITY BREACHES AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS COULD COMPROMISE OUR INFORMATION AND EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY,
WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS AND REPUTATION TO SUFFER. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT AND STORE SENSITIVE
DATA, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION AND THAT OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, AS WELL AS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF AURYXIA PATIENTS, CLINICAL TRIAL PARTICIPANTS AND EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO HAVE
OUTSOURCED ELEMENTS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRUCTURE, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE MANAGING INDEPENDENT VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY OR COULD HAVE ACCESS TO OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND
OTHER THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS POSSESS CERTAIN OF OUR SENSITIVE DATA. THE SECURE MAINTENANCE OF THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. DESPITE OUR SECURITY MEASURES, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE
VULNERABLE TO ATTACKS BY HACKERS OR BREACHED DUE TO EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS. WE, OUR PARTNERS, VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS COULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIRD PARTY ATTACKS ON OUR, AND THEIR, INFORMATION SECURITY
SYSTEMS, WHICH ATTACKS ARE OF EVER INCREASING LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION AND ARE MADE BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF MOTIVES AND EXPERTISE, INCLUDING CRIMINAL GROUPS. ANY SUCH BREACH COULD COMPROMISE OUR, AND THEIR, NETWORKS AND THE
INFORMATION STORED THERE COULD BE ACCESSED, PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, LOST OR STOLEN. ANY SUCH ACCESS, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER LOSS OF INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION, DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATING CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE HAVE
ESTIMATED. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE SUFFICIENT
TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WE WILL NEED TO OPERATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY AND CAPACITY EXPANSION, THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY
REVIEW PROCESS FOR OUR EU MAA FILING, THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO AURYXIA, AND THE TIMING, DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR AURYXIA. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY NEED TO SEEK
ADDITIONAL FINANCINGS TO PROVIDE THE CASH NECESSARY TO EXECUTE OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS, INCLUDING BEYOND THE INITIAL COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA, AND TO DEVELOP ANY DRUG CANDIDATES WE MAY IN-LICENSE OR ACQUIRE. 
 OUR FORECAST OF THE PERIOD OF TIME THROUGH WHICH OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS IS A
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT THAT INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS WE WILL NEED TO OPERATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: 

THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY AND CAPACITY EXPANSION; 

THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS FOR OUR EU MAA FILING; 

THE TIMING AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO AURYXIA; 

THE TIMING, DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF, AND RESULTS FROM, CLINICAL TRIALS FOR AURYXIA; 

THE TIMING OF EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OF AURYXIA AND THOSE PROPRIETARY DRUG CANDIDATES THAT MAY BE IN-LICENSED, PARTNERED OR ACQUIRED; 

THE TIMING OF THE IN-LICENSING, PARTNERING AND ACQUISITION OF NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES; 

THE PROGRESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED, OR MAY ENTER, INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS; 

OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR MILESTONES UNDER OUR LICENSING ARRANGEMENT; 

THE TIMING AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO EXPAND OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES; 

THE TIMING AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUR OWN COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MANUFACTURE, MARKET AND SELL OUR DRUG AND THOSE THAT MAY BE IN-LICENSED, PARTNERED OR ACQUIRED; 

THE COSTS INVOLVED IN PROSECUTING AND ENFORCING PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR DEFENDING AGAINST CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT INITIATED BY THIRD PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS; AND 

THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF CASH RECEIVED FROM PRODUCT SALES. IF OUR CASH IS INSUFFICIENT TO
MEET FUTURE OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE OR REDUCE OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR SELL OR LICENSE TO THIRD
PARTIES SOME OR ALL OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY SELLING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK, THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE DILUTED. IF WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OR
LICENSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DO SO ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ABLE TO USE OUR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET. OUR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR
ABILITY, AND THE ABILITY OF OUR LICENSORS, TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN PATENT PROTECTION ON OUR DRUG PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND THESE PATENTS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY CHALLENGES. THE PATENT POSITIONS OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND
BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND INVOLVE COMPLEX LEGAL AND FACTUAL QUESTIONS. NO CONSISTENT POLICY REGARDING THE BREADTH OF CLAIMS ALLOWED IN BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS HAS EMERGED TO DATE. ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS WE USE MAY NOT BE
SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM PRACTICING OUR TECHNOLOGIES OR FROM DEVELOPING COMPETING PRODUCTS. FURTHERMORE,

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OTHERS MAY INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SIMILAR OR ALTERNATIVE DRUG PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES OR DESIGN AROUND OUR PATENTED DRUG PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGIES WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.
IF OUR COMPETITORS PREPARE AND FILE PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE U.S. THAT CLAIM TECHNOLOGY ALSO CLAIMED BY US, WE MAY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERFERENCE OR DERIVATION PROCEEDINGS IN FRONT OF THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE TO DETERMINE PRIORITY
OF INVENTION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COST, EVEN IF THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME IS FAVORABLE TO US. BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE TIME REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT, TESTING AND REGULATORY REVIEW OF A POTENTIAL PRODUCT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY RELATED
PATENT MAY EXPIRE PRIOR TO, OR REMAIN IN EXISTENCE FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD FOLLOWING, COMMERCIALIZATION, THUS REDUCING ANY ADVANTAGE OF THE PATENT. THE PATENTS WE USE MAY BE CHALLENGED OR INVALIDATED OR MAY FAIL TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE. AS MANY OF THE PATENTS WE USE ARE LICENSED OR SUBLICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE SUCH LICENSED PATENTS AGAINST THIRD PARTY INFRINGERS WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THE PATENT OWNER AND THE LICENSOR, WHICH MAY NOT
BE FORTHCOMING. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR TIMELY IN OBTAINING ANY PATENTS FOR WHICH WE SUBMIT APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY,
THE LAWS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE U.S. IN ADDITION, IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHERE WE OWN OR LICENSE PATENT RIGHTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PREVENT UNLICENSED
PARTIES FROM SELLING OR IMPORTING PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES DERIVED ELSEWHERE USING OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO RELY ON TRADE
SECRETS AND KNOW-HOW TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHERE WE BELIEVE PATENT PROTECTION IS NOT APPROPRIATE OR OBTAINABLE. TRADE SECRETS ARE DIFFICULT TO PROTECT. WHILE WE REQUIRE OUR EMPLOYEES, LICENSEES, COLLABORATORS AND CONSULTANTS TO ENTER
INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS, THIS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, WE SHARE OWNERSHIP AND PUBLICATION RIGHTS TO DATA RELATING TO OUR DRUG PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGIES WITH
OUR RESEARCH COLLABORATORS AND SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS. IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS INFORMATION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE PATENT PROTECTION OR PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION WILL BE AT RISK. 
 THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSED RELATING TO OUR DRUG, AURYXIA, IS LIMITED, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN
THE MARKET AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF AURYXIA. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSED RELATING TO AURYXIA ARE
LIMITED IN WAYS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXCLUDE THIRD PARTIES FROM COMPETING AGAINST US. IN PARTICULAR: 

COMPOSITION OF MATTER PATENTS CAN PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SPECIFICALLY COVERED COMPOSITIONS ARE KEY, NON-INTERCHANGEABLE COMPONENTS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT. THE FIRST
COMPOSITION OF MATTER AND METHOD PATENT RELATING TO AURYXIA IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. PATENT NO. 5,753,706) EXPIRES IN FEBRUARY 2017. WE LICENSED ADDITIONAL COMPOSITION OF MATTER AND METHOD OF USE PATENTS EXPIRING IN 2024 WITH INDEPENDENT
CLAIMS COVERING FORMS OF FERRIC CITRATE (THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, OF AURYXIA), PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS THAT INCLUDE THE API, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS HAVING FERRIC CITRATE IN AN AMOUNT EFFECTIVE TO REDUCE SERUM PHOSPHATE
LEVELS, AND METHODS OF TREATING HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA AND METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. 

OUR METHOD OF USE PATENTS, INCLUDING U.S. PATENT NOS. 7,767,851, 8,299,298 AND 8,338,642 AND (WHICH EXPIRE IN 2024), AND U.S. PATENT NO. 8,093,423 (WHICH EXPIRES IN 2026) ONLY PROTECT THE PRODUCT WHEN USED OR SOLD
FOR THE CLAIMED METHODS. HOWEVER, THESE TYPES OF PATENTS DO NOT LIMIT A COMPETITOR FROM MAKING AND MARKETING A PRODUCT THAT IS IDENTICAL TO OUR PRODUCT THAT IS LABELED FOR AN INDICATION THAT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR PATENTED METHODS. 

WE HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS UNDER THE PATENT TERM EXTENSION PROVISIONS OF 35 U.S.C. 156 ON THE ABOVE MENTIONED PATENTS FOR DELAYS CAUSED BY FDA REGULATORY REVIEW. IF GRANTED WE CAN UTILIZE THE PATENT TERM
EXTENSION ON ONE OF THESE PATENTS, HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE CAN OBTAIN ANY EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF THESE PATENTS. IF OBTAINED, THE MAXIMUM TERM OF EXTENSION AVAILABLE UNDER 35 U.S.C. 156 WOULD EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CHOSEN
PATENT BY NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS. UPON EXPIRATION OF THESE PATENTS, COMPETITORS WHO OBTAIN THE REQUISITE REGULATORY APPROVAL MAY POTENTIALLY OFFER PRODUCTS WITH THE SAME COMPOSITION AND/OR METHOD OF USE AS OUR PRODUCT, SO LONG AS THE COMPETITORS DO
NOT INFRINGE ANY OTHER PATENTS THAT WE MAY HOLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS MAY NOT ISSUE AS PATENTS AND MAY NOT ISSUE IN ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE OR POTENTIALLY SELL OUR PRODUCT(S) OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE OTHERS DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND
POTENTIALLY SELL PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. MOREOVER, OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS, IF ISSUED AS PATENTS, MAY NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCT. 
 OBTAINING PROOF OF DIRECT INFRINGEMENT BY A COMPETITOR FOR A METHOD OF USE PATENT REQUIRES US TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COMPETITORS MAKE AND
MARKET A PRODUCT FOR THE PATENTED USE(S). ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN PROVE THAT OUR COMPETITORS INDUCE OR CONTRIBUTE OTHERS IN ENGAGING IN DIRECT INFRINGEMENT. PROVING THAT A COMPETITOR CONTRIBUTES TO, OR INDUCES, INFRINGEMENT OF A PATENTED METHOD BY
ANOTHER HAS ADDITIONAL PROOF REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, PROVING INDUCEMENT OF INFRINGEMENT REQUIRES PROOF OF INTENT BY THE COMPETITOR. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST CLAIMS OR TO PROTECT OUR OWN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AGAINST OTHERS, IT
COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO US AND THE DISTRACTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT. AN ADVERSE RULING IN ANY LITIGATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING COULD PREVENT US FROM MARKETING AND SELLING AURYXIA, INCREASE THE RISK THAT A GENERIC VERSION OF AURYXIA
COULD ENTER THE MARKET TO COMPETE WITH AURYXIA, LIMIT OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA, OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT COSTS. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT ASSERTED
AGAINST US COULD SUBJECT US TO MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTION, WHICH COULD PREVENT US FROM MAKING OR SELLING AURYXIA. WE ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES TO USE THE RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY. SUCH LICENSES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY
REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, PHYSICIANS MAY PRESCRIBE A COMPETITIVE IDENTICAL PRODUCT FOR INDICATIONS OTHER THAN THE ONE FOR
WHICH THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN APPROVED, OR OFF-LABEL INDICATIONS, THAT ARE COVERED BY THE APPLICABLE PATENTS. ALTHOUGH SUCH OFF-LABEL PRESCRIPTIONS MAY DIRECTLY INFRINGE OR CONTRIBUTE TO OR INDUCE INFRINGEMENT OF METHOD OF USE PATENTS, SUCH
INFRINGEMENT IS DIFFICULT TO PREVENT. IN ADDITION, ANY LIMITATIONS OF OUR PATENT PROTECTION DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
VALUE OF OUR DRUG PRODUCT AND MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN A CORPORATE PARTNER AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. IN ADDITION TO
PATENT PROTECTION, WE MAY UTILIZE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY OR OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT OF 1938, AS AMENDED, OR FDCA, SUCH AS NEW CHEMICAL ENTITY EXCLUSIVITY, OR NCE, OR NEW FORMULATION EXCLUSIVITY, TO PROVIDE MARKET
EXCLUSIVITY FOR A DRUG CANDIDATE. IN THE U.S., THE FDA HAS THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT ADDITIONAL DATA PROTECTION FOR APPROVED DRUGS WHERE THE
SPONSOR CONDUCTS SPECIFIED TESTING IN PEDIATRIC OR ADOLESCENT POPULATIONS. IF GRANTED, THIS PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS WHICH ARE ADDED TO THE TERM OF DATA PROTECTION AS WELL AS TO THE TERM OF A RELEVANT PATENT, TO THE
EXTENT THESE PROTECTIONS HAVE NOT ALREADY EXPIRED. THE FDCA PROVIDES A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF NON-PATENT MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY WITHIN THE
U.S. TO THE FIRST APPLICANT TO GAIN APPROVAL OF AN NDA FOR A NEW CHEMICAL ENTITY, OR NCE. A DRUG IS AN NCE IF THE FDA HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ANY OTHER NEW DRUG CONTAINING THE SAME ACTIVE MOIETY, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE MOLECULE(S) OR ION(S)
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION OF THE DRUG SUBSTANCE. DURING THE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD, THE FDA MAY NOT ACCEPT FOR REVIEW AN ANDA OR A 505(B)(2) NDA SUBMITTED BY ANOTHER COMPANY FOR ANOTHER VERSION OF SUCH DRUG WHERE THE APPLICANT DOES NOT OWN OR HAVE A
LEGAL RIGHT OF REFERENCE TO ALL THE DATA REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL. HOWEVER, AN APPLICATION MAY BE SUBMITTED AFTER FOUR YEARS IF IT CONTAINS A CERTIFICATION OF PATENT INVALIDITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE FDCA ALSO PROVIDES THREE YEARS OF MARKETING
EXCLUSIVITY FOR AN NDA, 505(B)(2) NDA OR SUPPLEMENT TO AN EXISTING NDA IF NEW CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS, OTHER THAN BIOAVAILABILITY STUDIES, THAT WERE CONDUCTED OR SPONSORED BY THE APPLICANT ARE DEEMED BY THE FDA TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE APPROVAL OF THE
APPLICATION (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR NEW INDICATIONS, DOSAGES, OR STRENGTHS OF AN EXISTING DRUG). THIS THREE-YEAR EXCLUSIVITY COVERS ONLY THE CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE FDA FROM APPROVING ANDAS FOR
DRUGS CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL ACTIVE AGENT. FIVE-YEAR AND THREE-YEAR EXCLUSIVITY WILL NOT DELAY THE SUBMISSION OR TENTATIVE APPROVAL OF A FULL ANDA; HOWEVER, AN APPLICANT SUBMITTING A FULL ANDA WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT SUFFICIENT STUDIES TO
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR GENERIC PRODUCT IS BIOEQUIVALENT TO AURYXIA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 WE MAY ALSO SEEK TO UTILIZE MARKET EXCLUSIVITIES IN OTHER TERRITORIES, SUCH AS IN THE EU. 
 WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT AURYXIA OR ANY DRUG CANDIDATES WE MAY ACQUIRE OR IN-LICENSE, WILL OBTAIN SUCH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY, NCE EXCLUSIVITY OR
ANY OTHER MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE U.S., EU OR ANY OTHER TERRITORY, OR THAT WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE THE RESPECTIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR SUCH DRUGS SO AS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY MARKET EXCLUSIVITY PROTECTION. WE ALSO CANNOT ASSURE THAT
AURYXIA OR ANY DRUG CANDIDATES WE MAY ACQUIRE OR IN-LICENSE WILL OBTAIN PATENT TERM EXTENSION. LITIGATION OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS COULD REQUIRE US TO
SPEND SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND MONEY DEFENDING SUCH CLAIMS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT. 
 WE MAY BE FORCED TO INITIATE LITIGATION TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTUAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR WE MAY BE SUED BY THIRD PARTIES
ASSERTING CLAIMS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THIRD PARTIES MAY HAVE OR MAY OBTAIN PATENTS IN THE FUTURE AND CLAIM THAT AURYXIA OR ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR PATENTS. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO
DEFEND AGAINST SUITS BROUGHT BY THIRD PARTIES, OR IF WE SUE THIRD PARTIES TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION COSTS, AND OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION MAY BE DIVERTED FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,
ANY LEGAL ACTION AGAINST OUR LICENSOR OR US THAT SEEKS DAMAGES OR AN INJUNCTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES RELATING TO AURYXIA OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES COULD SUBJECT US TO MONETARY LIABILITY, A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PREVENTING THE
DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SALE OF AURYXIA OR SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND/OR REQUIRE OUR LICENSOR OR US TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO CONTINUE TO USE AURYXIA OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR LICENSOR OR WE WOULD PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE TYPES
OF ACTIONS OR THAT ANY REQUIRED LICENSE WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
 FUTURE SALES OR OTHER ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR THE PERCEPTION BY THE MARKET THAT THOSE SALES COULD OCCUR, COULD CAUSE THE
MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY IN THE FUTURE. 
 ON JANUARY 21, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING IN WHICH WE SOLD 10,541,667 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
AT A PRICE OF 12.00 PER SHARE FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 126.5 MILLION. NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WERE APPROXIMATELY 118.3 MILLION, NET OF UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY 8.2 MILLION. THE SHARES WERE
SOLD UNDER REGISTRATION STATEMENTS (NOS. 333-201605 AND 333-201639) ON FORM S-3 AND FORM S-3MEF, RESPECTIVELY, FILED BY US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. 
 WE MAY NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO PROVIDE CASH NECESSARY TO EXECUTE OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS, INCLUDING BEYOND THE INITIAL
COMMERCIALIZATION OF AURYXIA, AND TO DEVELOP ANY DRUG CANDIDATES WE MAY IN-LICENSE OR ACQUIRE. FUTURE ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 IF WE MAKE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS IN WHICH THE CONSIDERATION INCLUDES STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES, OUR STOCKHOLDERS HOLDINGS
MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTED. IN ADDITION, STOCKHOLDERS HOLDINGS MAY ALSO BE DILUTED IF WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES PERMITTING US TO ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN LIEU OF CERTAIN CASH PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
MILESTONES. OUR STOCK PRICE CAN BE VOLATILE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF LITIGATION, AND MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF YOUR
INVESTMENT. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE IN
RESPONSE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE: 

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS;

INTRODUCTIONS OR ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS INVOLVING US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS; 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS; 

DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO THE MARKETING, SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF OUR DRUG PRODUCT, AND REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS FOR US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 

EXPECTATIONS REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION; 

EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF LICENSES, RESEARCH CONTRACTS OR OTHER COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS; 

EXPECTATIONS OR INVESTOR SPECULATION REGARDING THE STRENGTH OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITION, OR THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER FORMS OF REGULATORY EXCLUSIVITY; 

CONDITIONS OR TRENDS IN THE REGULATORY CLIMATE AND THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES; 

CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUATIONS OF SIMILAR COMPANIES; 

NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND SENTIMENT IN THE MEDIA; AND 

ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS IN GENERAL, AND THE
MARKET FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF COMPANIES TRADED IN THOSE MARKETS. THESE
BROAD MARKET AND INDUSTRY FACTORS MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, REGARDLESS OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF A COMPANY S SECURITIES,
SECURITIES CLASS-ACTION LITIGATION HAS OFTEN BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THAT COMPANY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PAST, WE HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A PUTATIVE STOCKHOLDERS SECURITIES CLASS ACTION ALLEGING MISSTATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS IN RELATION TO OUR CLINICAL
TRIALS FOR KRX-0401 (PERIFOSINE), WHICH WE ABANDONED IN MAY 2012 FOLLOWING NEGATIVE PHASE 3 RESULTS. ANY LITIGATION INSTITUTED AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO DEFEND SUCH CLAIMS AND DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION AND
RESOURCES, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD MAKE A
THIRD-PARTY ACQUISITION OF US DIFFICULT. THIS COULD LIMIT THE PRICE INVESTORS MIGHT BE WILLING TO PAY IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 PROVISIONS IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD
PARTY TO ACQUIRE, OR OF DISCOURAGING A THIRD PARTY FROM ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE, OR CONTROL US. THESE FACTORS COULD LIMIT THE PRICE THAT CERTAIN INVESTORS MIGHT BE WILLING TO PAY IN THE FUTURE FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION ALLOWS US TO ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS AND ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK
OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS AND POWERS, INCLUDING VOTING RIGHTS, OF SUCH HOLDERS. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH ISSUANCE COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ELIMINATE
THE RIGHT OF STOCKHOLDERS TO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR STOCKHOLDERS TO EFFECT CERTAIN CORPORATE ACTIONS. ANY OF THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE IN
CONTROL.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR MOVE FREE, MEGARED AND AIRBORNE PRODUCTS, AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . OUR MOVE FREE, MEGARED AND AIRBORNE PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR MOVE FREE, MEGARED OR AIRBORNE PRODUCTS WILL MAINTAIN SALES OR MARGIN LEVELS OVER TIME. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MOVE FREE, MEGARED OR AIRBORNE SALES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 TWO OF OUR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR NET SALES, AND THE LOSS OF, OR DECREASED PURCHASES BY, ONE OR BOTH OF THESE CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS ARE COSTCO AND WALMART (INCLUDING SAM'S CLUB). COMBINED, THESE TWO CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 66 , 73 AND 72 , RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010. WE DO NOT HAVE AGREEMENTS TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS FOR MOST OF OUR SALES TO COSTCO AND WALMART AND, THEREFORE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT EITHER COSTCO OR WALMART WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS IN THE FUTURE. THE LOSS OF EITHER COSTCO OR WALMART AS A CUSTOMER, OR A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PURCHASE VOLUME BY COSTCO OR WALMART, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY OR CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ANY SIMILAR PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED BY OTHER COMPANIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . WE BELIEVE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF THE SAFETY, QUALITY AND EFFICACY OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SIMILAR OR OTHER NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD BY OTHER COMPANIES. CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR FINDINGS, REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, LITIGATION, NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION, AND OTHER PUBLICITY REGARDING OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, INCLUDING PUBLICITY REGARDING THE LEGALITY, SAFETY OR QUALITY OF PARTICULAR INGREDIENTS OR PRODUCTS OR THE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT MARKET IN GENERAL. FROM TIME TO TIME, THERE IS UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR FINDINGS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER MEDIA ATTENTION REGARDING OUR INDUSTRY. THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY REGARDING FDA ACTION AGAINST NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES BASED ON ADVERSE EVENTS ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED BY PRODUCTS SOLD BY THESE COMPANIES. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS ALSO BEEN UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY REGARDING ITEMS IMPORTED FROM CHINA, WHERE WE SOURCE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR RAW MATERIALS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE PUBLICITY, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR FINDINGS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, OR MEDIA ATTENTION WILL BE FAVORABLE TO THE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT MARKET OR ANY PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR INGREDIENT, OR CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER PUBLICITY, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR 
 10 

FINDINGS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR MEDIA ATTENTION. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR FINDINGS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR MEDIA ATTENTION, WHETHER OR NOT ACCURATE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MAY LEAD TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR OPERATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES, REQUIRING FURTHER MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND POTENTIAL LEGAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE PUBLICITY, REPORTS OR OTHER MEDIA ATTENTION REGARDING THE SAFETY, QUALITY, OR EFFICACY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS OR NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS IN GENERAL, OR ASSOCIATING THE CONSUMPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS OR NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS IN GENERAL WITH ILLNESS OR OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED OR ACCURATE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY, IN WHICH INCREASED COMPETITION AND PRICING PRESSURES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . THE MARKET FOR THE SALE OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. MANY OF OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM AND POSSESS EXTENSIVE MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES. OTHER COMPETITORS ARE MORE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED THAN WE ARE. ADDITIONAL NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES MAY ENTER OR INCREASE THEIR PRESENCE (THROUGH ACQUISITION OR ORGANIC GROWTH) IN OUR INDUSTRY. PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, THE NUMBER OF WHICH IN RECENT YEARS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN CERTAIN NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT CATEGORIES, ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT PRICING PRESSURE AND COMPETITION WITH OUR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS CAN BE PURCHASED IN VARIOUS CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE MASS MARKET RETAIL CHANNEL, INCLUDING HEALTH FOOD STORES, DIRECT SALES, DIRECT MAIL AND INTERNET DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. INCREASED COMPETITION, INCLUDING EXPANSION OF PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS, OR INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 AMONG OTHER FACTORS, COMPETITION AMONG MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS IS BASED UPON PRICE. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH DEGREE OF PRICE COMPETITION, WE GENERALLY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PASS ALONG INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL PRICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR PRICES IN ORDER TO GAIN MARKET SHARE (PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE JOINT CARE AND OMEGA-3 CATEGORIES), OR IF RAW MATERIAL PRICES INCREASE AND WE ARE UNABLE TO PASS ALONG THE INCREASED COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS (PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE JOINT CARE AND OMEGA-3 CATEGORIES), OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 INCREASED PRIVATE LABEL BIDDING ACTIVITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT NET SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS, POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY. WE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE PRIVATE LABEL (STORE BRAND) PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN RETAIL CUSTOMERS WHERE WE SELL BRANDED PRODUCTS. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BIDDING ACTIVITY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF PRIVATE LABEL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS DISTRIBUTED IN MASS MARKET RETAIL ACCOUNTS SINCE JANUARY 2010. THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. AS A RESULT OF THE BIDDING PROCESS, WE NO LONGER MANUFACTURE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PRIVATE LABEL BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BIDDING PROCESSES FOR PRODUCTS WE BELIEVE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW MANY NEW PRODUCTS WE WILL WIN OR HOW MANY EXISTING PRODUCTS WE WILL LOSE. THE INCREASED PRIVATE LABEL BIDDING ACTIVITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS. 
 
 INCREASES IN PRICES OF RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. RAW MATERIALS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS. WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED MATERIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICING OF KEY RAW MATERIALS IN THE PAST. HISTORICALLY, WE GENERALLY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PASS ALONG RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL PRICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS. WE ACQUIRE ALL OF OUR RAW MATERIALS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM THIRD PARTIES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT SUPPLIERS WILL PROVIDE THE RAW MATERIALS WE NEED IN THE QUANTITIES REQUESTED, AT A PRICE WE ARE WILLING TO PAY OR THAT MEET OUR QUALITY STANDARDS AND LABELING REQUIREMENTS. THIS COULD CAUSE PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND BACK ORDERS, DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND RESULTING IN A LOSS OF NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY. 
 
 WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE LONG-TERM SUPPLY AND/OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS FOR KEY INGREDIENTS USED IN OUR MOVE FREE, MEGARED, DIGESTIVE ADVANTAGE, SUSTENEX AND AIRBORNE PRODUCTS. WHILE THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUING SUPPLY OF THESE INGREDIENTS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE SUPPLIERS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY THESE INGREDIENTS IN THE QUANTITIES OR ON THE TERMS WE REQUIRE, OR AT ALL. SEE ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 11 

IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE SUPPLIERS WILL SUPPLY THE RAW MATERIALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, OR AT ALL. FOR CERTAIN INGREDIENTS, WE DO NOT HAVE ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE TO SUPPLY OR CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL TERMS OF SUPPLY BY THE MOVE FREE, MEGARED, DIGESTIVE ADVANTAGE, SUSTENEX AND AIRBORNE KEY INGREDIENT SUPPLIERS OR OUR OTHER RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL DELAYS IN THE DELIVERY OF RAW MATERIALS CAUSED BY EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, STRIKES OR LABOR DISPUTES, TRANSPORTATION INTERRUPTIONS, CAPACITY ISSUES AT SUPPLIER FACTORIES, WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. ANY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN OR DISRUPTION OF THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF SUCH MATERIALS, REQUIRE REFORMULATION OR REPACKAGING OF PRODUCTS, REQUIRE THE QUALIFICATION OF NEW SUPPLIERS, OR RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF KEY INGREDIENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, AND MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND IMPORTATION ISSUES. WE ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF KEY INGREDIENTS FOR A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ACQUISITION OF THESE INGREDIENTS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTING RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY ASSURANCE, NONCONFORMITY TO SPECIFICATIONS OR LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TARIFFS, TRADE DISPUTES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. WHILE WE HAVE A SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND PERIODICALLY AUDIT AND INSPECT OUR SUPPLIERS' FACILITIES BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT RAW MATERIALS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL CONFORM TO ALL SPECIFICATIONS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THERE HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN QUALITY AND SAFETY ISSUES IN OUR INDUSTRY WITH CERTAIN ITEMS IMPORTED FROM THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND EXPERIENCE SHIPMENT DELAYS DUE TO PREVENTATIVE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE FOREIGN AND UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTS, OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR COMPANY. 
 
 IN ADDITION, THE DISCOVERY OF BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS MAD COW DISEASE, IN A COUNTRY FROM WHICH WE OBTAIN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR RAW MATERIALS (PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE JOINT CARE CATEGORY) DERIVED FROM BOVINE SOURCES COULD PREVENT US FROM PURCHASING SUCH RAW MATERIALS IN THE REQUIRED QUANTITIES, AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO RAW MATERIALS NEEDED FOR OUR JOINT CARE PRODUCTS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 OUR INABILITY OR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY TECHNIQUES OR OUR INFRINGEMENT OF OTHERS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ALTHOUGH THE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY PRODUCTS WITH NATURALLY OCCURRING INGREDIENTS IN CAPSULE OR TABLET FORM, IT HAS BECOME MORE COMMON FOR SUPPLIERS AND COMPETITORS TO APPLY FOR PATENTS OR DEVELOP PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE MAKE EFFORTS NOT TO INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT ASSERT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST US OR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSORS. SUCH CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MAY REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO COSTLY ROYALTY OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. THESE CLAIMS COULD ALSO BE COSTLY, CAUSE REPUTATIONAL INJURY AND DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTS PREVENT US FROM, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, OFFERING OR SUPPLYING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR OUR LICENSED PROPRIETARY INGREDIENTS IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR RESULT IN LITIGATION OR THREATENED LITIGATION AGAINST US RELATED TO ALLEGED OR ACTUAL INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BY RELYING ON TRADE SECRET LAWS AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. WHEN WE LICENSE OUR TRADEMARKS, PROPRIETARY INGREDIENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM A THIRD PARTY, WE TYPICALLY HAVE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE THE LICENSOR TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTERESTS. NEVERTHELESS, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH MEASURES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS. 
 
 OUR MOVE FREE, MEGARED, DIGESTIVE ADVANTAGE AND SUSTENEX PRODUCTS CONTAIN KEY INGREDIENTS, THE RIGHTS FOR WHICH WE LICENSE FROM THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS PURSUANT TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AND/OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS. OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE PATENTS AND PATENTS PENDING RELATING TO THE KEY INGREDIENTS, AND HAVE GRANTED US EXCLUSIVE AND NON-EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS CONTAINING THE INGREDIENTS IN CERTAIN TERRITORIES AND CLASSES OF TRADE. HOWEVER, WE 
 12 

CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL PREVAIL IN PREVENTING THIRD PARTIES FROM SELLING THE KEY INGREDIENTS IN COMPETING PRODUCTS AT LOWER COST. THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 IN ADDITION, WE HAVE REGISTERED, OR APPLIED FOR, OVER 70 TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR OUR SCHIFF, MOVE FREE, MEGARED, AIRBORNE AND TIGER'S MILK BRANDS AND CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SLOGANS, AND HAVE RIGHTS FOR TRADEMARKS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. OUR POLICY IS TO PURSUE REGISTRATIONS FOR CERTAIN TRADEMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR KEY PRODUCTS (THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO RELY ON COMMON LAW TRADEMARK RIGHTS TO PROTECT OUR UNREGISTERED MARKS) AND TO PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT INFRINGING PRODUCTS COULD NOT BE MARKETED WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT WE RELY UPON FOREIGN OR COMMON LAW PROTECTIONS FOR OUR MARKS, WE MAY NOT BE PROVIDED WITH AS EXTENSIVE PROTECTION AS IS AFFORDED BY A UNITED STATES FEDERAL REGISTRATION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARK RIGHTS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES EXPOSE US TO CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES EFFORTS ARE COMPRISED OF SELLING PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY OUR JOINT CARE PRODUCTS, FROM THE UNITED STATES ON AN EXPORT BASIS TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR DISTRIBUTORS ABROAD. OPERATING IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS EXPOSES US TO CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING AND COMPLYING WITH FOREIGN REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN OR INTERPRETATIONS OF FOREIGN REGULATIONS THAT MAY FURTHER LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SELL CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE POTENTIAL IMPOSITION OF TRADE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS OR INCREASED TARIFFS, DIFFICULTIES IN ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, DIFFICULTY IN COLLECTING INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, POTENTIALLY LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES, AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. WE ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO REFORMULATE OUR PRODUCTS BEFORE COMMENCING DISTRIBUTION IN A GIVEN COUNTRY. WE MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS AND CHANGING LOCAL LABELING, CUSTOMS AND OTHER REGULATIONS. TRADEMARK RIGHTS ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND ENFORCE IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS ALSO NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AND RETAIN THE NECESSARY PERMITS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE AND OTHER RISKS RELATING TO EXPORTING GOODS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCREASES AS OUR EXPORT BUSINESS GROWS AND EXPANDS. OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH PRODUCTS AND MAINTAIN SALES (ESPECIALLY IN THE JOINT CARE AND OMEGA-3 CATEGORIES) OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD AND COMPLYING WITH LOCAL REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 OUR FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND/OR SUSTAIN NEW PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO GROW IN EXISTING MARKETS IS PARTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION PROCESS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, IS BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF BUSINESS RISK. ALTHOUGH WE SEEK TO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS EACH YEAR, THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES, INCLUDING DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT WILL APPEAL TO CUSTOMERS, BE SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED IN A TIMELY MANNER, BE PRICED COMPETITIVELY, BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OR MAINTAIN MARKETING AND SPENDING PROGRAMS, A CONSISTENT SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIAL, COMPETITIVE CLAIMS OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF OUR BRANDED PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS OR EXISTING PRODUCT INNOVATIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, THAT CUSTOMERS WILL ACCEPT NEW PRODUCTS, OR, IF ACCEPTED, THAT CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO SELL THE NEW PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH, GAIN DISTRIBUTION OR MAINTAIN DISTRIBUTION FOR NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IF WE EXPERIENCE MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, FDA ACTION OR OTHER LITIGATION, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . AS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO BE INGESTED, WE FACE AN INHERENT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, FDA ACTION AND LITIGATION IF OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE CAUSED LOSS OR INJURY. IN ADDITION, THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS INVOLVE THE RISK OF INJURY TO CONSUMERS DUE TO TAMPERING BY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES OR PRODUCT CONTAMINATION. OUR PRODUCTS CONSIST OF VITAMINS, MINERALS, HERBS AND OTHER INGREDIENTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OR FOODS, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PRE-MARKET REGULATORY APPROVAL IN THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN INGREDIENTS THAT DO NOT HAVE LONG HISTORIES OF HUMAN CONSUMPTION. PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN ADVERSE REACTIONS RESULTING FROM HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF THESE, OTHER OF OUR INGREDIENTS, OR COMBINATIONS OF INGREDIENTS COULD OCCUR. WE HAVE BEEN, 
 13 

AND IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THAT OUR PRODUCTS CAUSED INJURY OR ILLNESS, THAT OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE INADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, OR THAT OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE INADEQUATE WARNINGS CONCERNING POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES. RECENTLY, THE FDA HAS TAKEN A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO ENFORCEMENT. A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM OR FDA ACTION AGAINST US COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE ARE PARTY TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND MAY BECOME PARTY TO OTHERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LITIGATION COULD ARISE, OR THAT DEVELOPMENTS COULD OCCUR IN EXISTING LITIGATION, THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COVER LOSSES WE MAY INCUR. WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE RELATING TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER COVERAGES, PROPERTY, GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' LIABILITY POLICIES. HOWEVER, OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE IS SUBJECT TO LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIM DEDUCTIBLES FOR CERTAIN POLICIES, INDIVIDUAL CLAIM AND AGGREGATE POLICY LIMITS, EXCLUSIONS AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LIABILITY COVERAGE EXCLUDES CLAIMS RELATING TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN CERTAIN INGREDIENTS. CERTAIN DAMAGES IN LITIGATION, SUCH AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ALSO ARE GENERALLY NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR INSURANCE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR LOSSES, THAT FUTURE INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL NOT CONTAIN ADDITIONAL EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE, OR THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE COST. IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE OR ANY INSURANCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, LITIGATION OR OTHER LOSSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING OR NEW REGULATIONS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, OR AN ADVERSE ACTION REGARDING PRODUCT FORMULATION, CLAIMS OR ADVERTISING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION . OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE FORMULATION, MANUFACTURING, PACKAGING, LABELING, ADVERTISING, DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND AGENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE FDA AND FTC, IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS FOREIGN ENTITIES AND AGENCIES. SEE ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION. FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGES TO OUR MARKETING, ADVERTISING OR PRODUCT CLAIMS IN LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENTAL, ADMINISTRATIVE OR OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS OR WITHSTAND SUCH CHALLENGES COULD RESULT IN CHANGES IN PRODUCT LABELING, PACKAGING, OR ADVERTISING, PRODUCT REFORMULATIONS, DISCONTINUATION OF OUR PRODUCT BY RETAILERS, LOSS OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT BY CONSUMERS, ADDITIONAL RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS, INJUNCTIONS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, PRODUCT SEIZURES, FINES, MONETARY SETTLEMENTS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE REFORMULATED, ELIMINATED OR RELABELED CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND REVISED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR SALES, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO MAKE SUCH CHANGES OR REVISIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IN JUNE 2007, THE FDA PUBLISHED EXTENSIVE GMPS FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. SEE ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION. THE EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE DATE FOR COMPANIES LIKE OURS WITH FEWER THAN 500 EMPLOYEES WAS JUNE 22, 2009. WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE COST OF ONGOING COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO BE MATERIAL, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT, IN COMPLYING WITH THE GMPS, WE WILL NOT INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR THAT OUR OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL RESPECTS AT ALL TIMES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A POTENTIAL RISK OF INCREASED AUDITS AS THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORS SEEK TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE GMPS. 
 
 IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, BEFORE COMMENCING OPERATIONS OR MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN APPROVALS, LICENSES OR CERTIFICATIONS FROM A COUNTRY'S MINISTRY OF HEALTH OR COMPARABLE AGENCY. APPROVALS OR LICENSING MAY BE CONDITIONED ON REFORMULATION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY BE UNAVAILABLE WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT INGREDIENTS. WE MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH PRODUCT LABELING AND PACKAGING REGULATIONS THAT VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. FURTHERMORE, THE REGULATIONS OF THESE COUNTRIES MAY CONFLICT WITH THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND WITH EACH OTHER. THE COST OF COMPLYING WITH THESE VARIOUS AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING REGULATIONS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THE REPEAL OR AMENDMENT OF LAWS OR REGULATIONS WHICH WE CONSIDER FAVORABLE, SUCH AS DSHEA, OR MORE 
 14 

STRINGENT INTERPRETATIONS OF CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL OR MORE STRINGENT LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PROPOSED. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE NATURE OF SUCH FUTURE LAWS, REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OR APPLICATIONS, NOR CAN WE PREDICT WHAT EFFECT ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, WHEN AND IF PROMULGATED, WOULD HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. ANY OR ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND THE RELATED COSTS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IF WE EXPERIENCE PRODUCT RECALLS OR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RETURNS, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT AND UNEXPECTED COSTS, AND OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO THE RECALL OR RETURN OF THEIR PRODUCTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEFECTS, SUCH AS INGREDIENT CONTAMINATION, UNINTENDED HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS OR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS, PACKAGING SAFETY AND INADEQUATE OR INACCURATE LABELING DISCLOSURE. IF ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE RECALLED DUE TO AN ALLEGED PRODUCT DEFECT OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR THE UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF THE RECALL AND ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MIGHT ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECALL. WE MAY LOSE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SALES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THOSE SALES. IN ADDITION, A PRODUCT RECALL MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE ACQUIRE ALL OF OUR RAW MATERIALS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE PRODUCED BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR QUALIFYING SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, AND FOR TESTING RAW MATERIALS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ANY QUALITY, POTENCY OR CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS WILL BE DETECTED IN TIME TO AVOID UNFORESEEN PRODUCT RECALLS, FDA ACTION OR LAWSUITS. ADDITIONALLY, IF ONE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT BRANDS WERE SUBJECT TO RECALL, THE IMAGE OF THAT BRAND AND OUR COMPANY COULD BE HARMED. A RECALL FOR ANY OF THE FOREGOING REASONS COULD LEAD TO DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, PRODUCT RECALLS MAY LEAD TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR OPERATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES, REQUIRING FURTHER MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND POTENTIAL LEGAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES. 
 
 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE MANUFACTURING FACILITY, AND ANY MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE MANUFACTURE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE UNINTERRUPTED AND EFFICIENT OPERATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY. POWER FAILURES, THE BREAKDOWN, FAILURE OR SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE OF EQUIPMENT, THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OR OPERATION OF EQUIPMENT, WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS, NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS, OR THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE REQUIREMENTS OR DIRECTIVES OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FDA, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WHILE WE DO CARRY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR COVERAGE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER LOSSES FROM THESE TYPES OF BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS OR THAT THIS INSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, IF AT ALL. 
 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONSUMMATE SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS IN THE FUTURE, OR INTEGRATE BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AN ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, GAINING SHELF SPACE, ENHANCING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND GAINING ACCESS TO NEW SKILLS AND OTHER RESOURCES THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS WHEN ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ATTRACTIVE TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OR OTHERWISE CONSUMMATE ANY TRANSACTIONS OR THAT ANY TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE CONSUMMATED WILL PROVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MANAGING ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT ACQUISITION OF AIRBORNE, INC. AS WELL AS ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, ENTAILS NUMEROUS OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS, INCLUDING: THE ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ESTIMATED COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE; THE INABILITY TO RETAIN OR REPLACE KEY EMPLOYEES OF ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES OR HIRE ENOUGH QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO STAFF ANY NEW OR EXPANDED OPERATIONS; THE IMPAIRMENT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY CUSTOMERS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES DUE TO CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; THE EXPOSURE TO FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACQUISITION OR THE INTEGRATION OF ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; THE EXPOSURE TO UNKNOWN LIABILITIES; THE FLUCTUATION OF QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS DUE TO HIGHER THAN EXPECTED ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS; THE COMBINING OF OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR OWN, WHICH COULD BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY; AND THE RISK OF ENTERING NEW MARKETS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO FTC CONSENT DECREES AND A NUMBER OF STATE CONSENT AGREEMENTS WHICH IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS UPON US AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ON MARCH 30, 2012, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AIRBORNE, INC., WHICH IS SUBJECT TO AN FTC CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO IN 2008, AND 32 CONSENT AGREEMENTS THAT SETTLE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY INDIVIDUAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. THE FTC CONSENT DECREE AND STATE CONSENT AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROHIBIT CERTAIN PRODUCT REPRESENTATIONS AND ADVERTISING CLAIMS AND IMPOSE SPECIFIC REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO AN FTC CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO IN 2000 GOVERNING DIET AND WEIGHT LOSS CLAIMS AND CERTAIN DISEASE, SAFETY AND COMPARATIVE 
 15

 WE ARE CURRENTLY PARTY TO A 200.0 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY, AND MAY ENTER INTO OTHER DEBT ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE, EACH OF WHICH MAY SUBJECT US TO RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE PARTY TO A 200.0 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY THAT IMPOSES VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS ON US THAT LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ENTER INTO ANY MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS OR SALES OF PROPERTY AND INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS CREDIT AGREEMENTS OR TERM LOANS THAT MAY ALSO IMPOSE SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY OR COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS, COVENANTS, FINANCIAL TESTS AND RATIOS OF OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY OR OTHER DEBT ARRANGEMENTS WE MAY ENTER INTO IN THE FUTURE. OUR FAILURE TO SATISFY OR COMPLY WITH SUCH PROVISIONS, COVENANTS, FINANCIAL TESTS AND RATIOS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IF WE LOSE KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND FILL KEY POSITIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE LOSS OR LIMITATION OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR KEY MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES, OR THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 DISRUPTIONS OR FAILURES IN OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS AFFECT MARINE PRODUCTS SALES BECAUSE MARINE PRODUCTS PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED WITH DISCRETIONARY INCOME. DURING AN ECONOMIC RECESSION OR WHEN AN ECONOMIC RECESSION IS PERCEIVED AS A THREAT, MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS CONSUMERS HAVE LESS DISCRETIONARY INCOME OR ARE MORE APT TO SAVE THEIR DISCRETIONARY INCOME RATHER THAN SPEND IT. DURING TIMES OF GLOBAL POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT CONSUMERS FOREGO OR DELAY LARGE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES. HISTORICAL VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND FINANCIAL RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MAY FORCE CONSUMERS TO DELAY RETIREMENT, OR TO CHOOSE MORE MODEST LIFESTYLES WHEN THEY DO RETIRE. IN SUCH A CASE, CONSUMERS MAY NOT PURCHASE BOATS, MAY PURCHASE BOATS LATER IN THEIR LIVES, OR MAY PURCHASE SMALLER OR LESS EXPENSIVE BOATS. TIGHT LENDING AND CREDIT STANDARDS, WHICH UNTIL RECENTLY HAVE BEEN IN USE BY LENDERS IN THE UNITED STATES, CAN MAKE LOANS FOR BOATS HARDER TO SECURE, AND SUCH LOANS MAY CARRY UNFAVORABLE TERMS, WHICH MAY FORCE CONSUMERS TO FOREGO BOAT PURCHASES. THESE FACTORS HAVE ALSO RESULTED IN THE PAST, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN THE FUTURE, IN A REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY AND NUMBER OF DEALERS UPON WHICH MARINE PRODUCTS RELIES TO SELL ITS PRODUCTS. MARINE PRODUCTS RELIES UPON THIRD-PARTY DEALER FLOOR PLAN LENDERS WHICH PROVIDE FINANCING TO ITS NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT DEALERS. MARINE PRODUCTS SELLS ITS PRODUCTS TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT DEALERS, MOST OF WHOM RELY ON ONE OR MORE THIRD-PARTY DEALER FLOOR PLAN LENDERS TO PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THEIR INVENTORY PRIOR TO ITS SALE TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS. IN GENERAL, THIS SOURCE OF FINANCING IS VITAL TO MARINE PRODUCTS ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS TO ITS DEALER NETWORK. WHILE DEALER FLOOR PLAN CREDIT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MANY OF OUR DEALERS DURING THE 2020 MODEL YEAR, THE COMPANY S SALES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A DECLINE IN FLOOR PLAN FINANCING AVAILABILITY, OR IF FINANCING TERMS CHANGE UNFAVORABLY. INTEREST RATES AND FUEL PRICES AFFECT MARINE PRODUCTS SALES. THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN FINANCED BY OUR DEALERS AND THE RETAIL BOAT CONSUMERS. HIGHER INTEREST RATES INCREASE THE BORROWING COSTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS FOR DEALERS AND THE COST OF BOAT PURCHASES FOR CONSUMERS. FUEL COSTS CAN REPRESENT A LARGE PORTION OF THE COSTS TO OPERATE OUR PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND FUEL COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMERS DECISIONS RELATING TO RECREATIONAL BOATING PURCHASES. MARINE PRODUCTS DEPENDENCE ON ITS NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT BOAT DEALERS MAY AFFECT ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND SALES. VIRTUALLY ALL MARINE PRODUCTS SALES ARE DERIVED FROM ITS NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT BOAT DEALERS. MARINE PRODUCTS HAS NO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH THESE DEALERS. COMPETITION FOR DEALERS AMONG RECREATIONAL POWERBOAT MANUFACTURERS CONTINUES TO INCREASE BASED ON THE QUALITY OF AVAILABLE PRODUCTS, THE PRICE AND VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS, AND ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER RECREATIONAL POWERBOAT MANUFACTURERS IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING INDEPENDENT BOAT DEALERS. THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT BOAT DEALERS SUPPORTING THE CHAPARRAL AND ROBALO TRADE NAMES AND THE QUALITY OF THEIR MARKETING AND SERVICING EFFORTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MARINE PRODUCTS ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES. A DETERIORATION IN THE NUMBER OF MARINE PRODUCTS NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT BOAT DEALERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BOAT SALES. MARINE PRODUCTS INABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW DEALERS AND RETAIN THOSE DEALERS, OR ITS INABILITY TO INCREASE SALES WITH EXISTING DEALERS, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLANS. ALTHOUGH MARINE PRODUCTS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE QUALITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE RECREATIONAL BOATING MARKET SHOULD PERMIT IT TO MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DEALERS AND ITS MARKET POSITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ITS CURRENT SALES LEVELS. MARINE PRODUCTS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY BOAT DEALER DEFAULTS. THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THESE DEALERS IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY S CONTINUED SUCCESS. THE COMPANY S RESULTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF A DEALER DEFAULTS BECAUSE MARINE PRODUCTS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE INVENTORY UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS, ALTHOUGH FOR BUSINESS REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL BOATS IN EXCESS OF THIS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION. 
 13 

MARINE PRODUCTS SALES ARE AFFECTED BY WEATHER CONDITIONS. MARINE PRODUCTS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO WEATHER PATTERNS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS SALES. FOR EXAMPLE, DROUGHT CONDITIONS, OR MERELY REDUCED RAINFALL LEVELS, OR EXCESSIVE RAIN, MAY CLOSE AREA BOATING LOCATIONS OR RENDER BOATING DANGEROUS OR INCONVENIENT, THEREBY CURTAILING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, UNSEASONABLY COOL WEATHER AND PROLONGED WINTER CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO A SHORTER SELLING SEASON IN SOME LOCATIONS. HURRICANES AND OTHER STORMS COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS OR DAMAGE TO OUR BOAT INVENTORIES AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. MARINE PRODUCTS ENCOUNTERS INTENSE COMPETITION WHICH AFFECTS OUR SALES AND PROFITS. THE RECREATIONAL BOAT INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, RESULTING IN INTENSE COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMERS, DEALERS AND BOAT SHOW EXHIBITION SPACE. THIS COMPETITION AFFECTS BOTH THE MARKETS WHICH WE CURRENTLY SERVE AND NEW MARKETS THAT WE MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH SEVERAL LARGE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES. MARINE PRODUCTS HAS POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE PRODUCTS WE SELL OR SERVICE MAY EXPOSE MARINE PRODUCTS TO POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS. HISTORICALLY, THE RESOLUTION OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS HAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED MARINE PRODUCTS BUSINESS. MARINE PRODUCTS MAINTAINS PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT IT BELIEVES TO BE ADEQUATE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MARINE PRODUCTS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE LEGAL CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE OR THAT CLAIMS WILL BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. FURTHERMORE, ANY SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AGAINST MARINE PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHICH COULD CAUSE MARINE PRODUCTS SALES TO DECLINE. BECAUSE MARINE PRODUCTS RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, MARINE PRODUCTS MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE RAW MATERIALS, ENGINES AND COMPONENTS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS. MARINE PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE RAW MATERIALS, ENGINES AND COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ITS VARIOUS POWERBOATS. ESPECIALLY CRITICAL ARE THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF MARINE ENGINES AND COMMODITY RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF MARINE PRODUCTS BOATS. WHILE MARINE PRODUCTS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS CURRENTLY IN PLACE ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE ENGINES AND MATERIALS NECESSARY TO MEET PRESENT PRODUCTION DEMANDS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE, THAT THESE SUPPLIERS WILL REMAIN IN OPERATION OR THAT THE QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THESE SUPPLIERS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET MARINE PRODUCTS FUTURE NEEDS. DISRUPTIONS IN CURRENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS OR THE INABILITY OF MARINE PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE TO PURCHASE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES TO MEET ONGOING PRODUCTION SCHEDULES COULD CAUSE A DECREASE IN SALES OR A SHARP INCREASE IN THE COST OF GOODS SOLD. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE OF THIS DEPENDENCE, THE VOLATILITY IN COMMODITY RAW MATERIALS OR CURRENT OR FUTURE PRICE INCREASES IN PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR THE INABILITY OF MARINE PRODUCTS MANAGEMENT TO PURCHASE ENGINES AND MATERIALS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ITS GROWTH AND ACQUISITION STRATEGIES COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BOATS MARINE PRODUCTS MAY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE FOR SALE OR CAUSE A REDUCTION IN MARINE PRODUCTS PROFIT MARGINS. MARINE PRODUCTS MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY, COMPLETE OR SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS. MARINE PRODUCTS INTENDS TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS AND FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCES THAT WILL ENABLE MARINE PRODUCTS TO ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES, OFFER NEW PRODUCTS, EXPAND ITS CUSTOMER BASE, AND OBTAIN OTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES OR STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OBTAIN FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, INTEGRATE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS, OR EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS. ONCE INTEGRATED, ACQUIRED OPERATIONS MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF SALES OR PROFITABILITY, OR OTHERWISE PERFORM AS EXPECTED. ACQUISITIONS ALSO INVOLVE SPECIAL RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENCIES, DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT RESOURCES, AND POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE RESULTING FROM INCREASED INTEREST COSTS, THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES, AND DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THE FAILURE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS SUCCESSFULLY MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM MARINE PRODUCTS EXISTING OPERATIONS AND MAY DAMAGE MARINE PRODUCTS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS KEY CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. 
 14 

MARINE PRODUCTS SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON ITS KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF ANY KEY PERSONNEL MAY AFFECT ITS POWERBOAT SALES. MARINE PRODUCTS SUCCESS WILL DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF THE SERVICES OF ANY SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL OR THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OTHER QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT, SALES, MARKETING AND TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES COULD DISRUPT MARINE PRODUCTS OPERATIONS AND CAUSE A DECREASE IN ITS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS. MARINE PRODUCTS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRUCIAL TO ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FUTURE GROWTH. MARINE PRODUCTS RELIES ON THE EXISTENCE OF AN AVAILABLE HOURLY WORKFORCE TO MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS. AS WITH MANY BUSINESSES, WE ARE CHALLENGED AT TIMES TO FIND QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES TO MEET CURRENT AND/OR FUTURE GROWTH NEEDS. IF MARINE PRODUCTS IS UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ITS BUSINESS MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITY AND FINES. MARINE PRODUCTS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND LICENSING UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL STATUTES, ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS. WHILE MARINE PRODUCTS BELIEVES THAT IT MAINTAINS ALL REQUISITE LICENSES AND PERMITS AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MARINE PRODUCTS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ALL REQUISITE LICENSES AND PERMITS AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FAILURE TO SATISFY THESE AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE MARINE PRODUCTS TO INCUR FINES OR PENALTIES OR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OPERATIONS. THE ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO INCREASE MARINE PRODUCTS COSTS. THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS AFFECTING MANY MARINE PROPULSION ENGINES. THIS REGULATION HAS INCREASED THE COST OF BOATS SUBJECT TO THE REGULATION, WHICH MAY EITHER REDUCE THE COMPANY S PROFITABILITY OR REDUCE SALES. AS WITH BOAT CONSTRUCTION IN GENERAL, OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES INVOLVE THE USE, HANDLING, STORAGE AND CONTRACTING FOR RECYCLING OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR WASTES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS REGARDING THESE SUBSTANCES, AND THE MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF SUCH SUBSTANCES COULD EXPOSE MARINE PRODUCTS TO LIABILITY OR FINES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN STATES HAVE REQUIRED OR ARE CONSIDERING REQUIRING A LICENSE IN ORDER TO OPERATE A RECREATIONAL BOAT. WHILE SUCH LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE UNDULY RESTRICTIVE, REGULATIONS MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL FIRST-TIME BUYERS, THEREBY REDUCING FUTURE SALES. MARINE PRODUCTS STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE. HISTORICALLY, THE MARKET PRICE OF COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES ENGAGED IN THE DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE. LIKEWISE, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST. IN ADDITION, THE AVAILABILITY OF MARINE PRODUCTS COMMON STOCK TO THE INVESTING PUBLIC IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT THAT SHARES ARE NOT SOLD BY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF MARINE PRODUCTS COMMON STOCK, INCREASE VOLATILITY AND AFFECT THE ABILITY OF MINORITY STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SHARES. FUTURE SALES BY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR SHARES COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF MARINE PRODUCTS COMMON STOCK. MARINE PRODUCTS MANAGEMENT HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST; PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE NO EFFECTIVE VOICE IN MARINE PRODUCTS MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED THE CONTROLLED CORPORATION EXEMPTION UNDER SECTION 303A OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE NYSE LISTED COMPANY MANUAL. THE COMPANY IS A CONTROLLED CORPORATION BECAUSE A GROUP THAT INCLUDES THE COMPANY S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, R. RANDALL ROLLINS AND HIS BROTHER, GARY W. ROLLINS, WHO IS ALSO A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, AND CERTAIN COMPANIES UNDER THEIR CONTROL, CONTROLS IN EXCESS OF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY S VOTING POWER. AS A CONTROLLED CORPORATION, THE COMPANY NEED NOT COMPLY WITH CERTAIN NYSE RULES INCLUDING THOSE REQUIRING A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. 
 15 

MARINE PRODUCTS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES HOLD DIRECTLY OR THROUGH INDIRECT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP, IN THE AGGREGATE, APPROXIMATELY 79 PERCENT OF MARINE PRODUCTS OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, THESE STOCKHOLDERS EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE OPERATIONS OF MARINE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND APPROVAL OF SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS. THIS CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A THIRD-PARTY FROM ACQUIRING CONTROL OF MARINE PRODUCTS AT A PREMIUM. PROVISIONS IN MARINE PRODUCTS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS MAY INHIBIT A TAKEOVER OF MARINE PRODUCTS. MARINE PRODUCTS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS INCLUDING ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND STAGGERED TERMS OF OFFICE FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THESE PROVISIONS MAY MAKE A TENDER OFFER, CHANGE IN CONTROL OR TAKEOVER ATTEMPT THAT IS OPPOSED BY MARINE PRODUCTS BOARD OF DIRECTORS MORE DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CYBER-ATTACKS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. WE USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSIONS, AS WELL AS IN OUR INTERACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CYBER-ATTACKS. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT TO BE SUFFICIENT, WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS: LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER, OR EMPLOYEE DATA; INTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS; AND INCREASED COSTS REQUIRED TO PREVENT, RESPOND TO, OR MITIGATE CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS. THESE RISKS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, AND MAY RESULT IN CLAIMS AGAINST US. THESE RISKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION.

 RISK FACTORS 

IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS STATED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, SET FORTH BELOW ARE CERTAIN
RISK FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE MATERIAL. IF ANY OF THESE RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND REPUTATION COULD BE HARMED. YOU SHOULD ALSO
CONSIDER THESE RISK FACTORS WHEN YOU READ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.
YOU CAN IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY TERMS SUCH AS MAY, HOPE, WILL, COULD, 
 SHOULD, EXPECT, PLAN, ANTICIPATE, INTEND, BELIEVE, ESTIMATE, PREDICT, POTENTIAL 
OR CONTINUE, THE NEGATIVE OF THOSE TERMS OR OTHER COMPARABLE TERMS. THOSE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ANY OF THESE RISKS OCCUR. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEFENDANTS IN ASBESTOS LITIGATION. 

THE HISTORICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARY, COLTEC
INDUSTRIES INC COLTEC ), PRINCIPALLY GARLOCK SEALING TECHNOLOGIES LLC AND THE ANCHOR PACKING
COMPANY ANCHOR ), HAVE RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL VOLUME OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION IN WHICH
PLAINTIFFS HAVE ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FIBERS. THOSE
SUBSIDIARIES MANUFACTURED AND/OR SOLD INDUSTRIAL SEALING PRODUCTS, PREDOMINATELY GASKETS AND
PACKING PRODUCTS, THAT CONTAINED ENCAPSULATED ASBESTOS FIBERS. ANCHOR IS AN INACTIVE AND INSOLVENT
INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF COLTEC. THERE IS NO REMAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO ANCHOR AND IT
HAS NO ASSETS. OUR SUBSIDIARIES EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS LITIGATION AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
INSURANCE CARRIERS ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED THROUGH ANOTHER COLTEC SUBSIDIARY, GARRISON LITIGATION
MANAGEMENT GROUP, LTD. SEVERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITIES TO US
IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THOSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT
COVERED BY INSURANCE BECAUSE INSURANCE COVERAGE IS, OR WILL BE, DEPLETED; 

7 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE NUMBER AND PER CLAIM VALUE OF PENDING AND POTENTIAL
FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS; 

THE RESULTS OF LITIGATION AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT
STRATEGIES; 

THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE ADVERSE JUDGMENTS AGAINST US NOT COVERED BY
INSURANCE AND ANY SURETY/APPEAL BONDS (AND RELATED CASH COLLATERAL) REQUIRED IN
CONNECTION WITH APPEALS; 

AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY
INSURANCE; 

THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES INSURANCE CARRIERS AND THEIR
REINSURANCE CARRIERS, AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ABILITY TO COLLECT ON CLAIMS FROM THEM; 

THE TIMING OF CLAIMS, PAYMENTS AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES, AND LIMITATIONS
IMPOSED ON THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE IN ANY YEAR; 

THE UNAVAILABILITY OF ANY INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS ALLEGING FIRST EXPOSURE TO
ASBESTOS AFTER JULY 1, 1984; 

THE POTENTIAL FOR ASBESTOS EXPOSURE TO EXTEND BEYOND SPECIFIC COLTEC
SUBSIDIARIES ARISING FROM CORPORATE VEIL PIERCING EFFORTS OR OTHER CLAIMS BY ASBESTOS
PLAINTIFFS; 

BANKRUPTCIES OF OTHER DEFENDANTS; AND 

THE PROSPECT FOR AND IMPACT OF ANY FEDERAL LEGISLATION PROVIDING NATIONAL
ASBESTOS LITIGATION REFORM. 

WHEN SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS EXCEED INSURANCE RECOVERIES FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES CARRIERS, OUR
SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO FUND THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM AVAILABLE CASH. THIS COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO USE CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES, INCLUDING GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS, AND ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND IS BASED ON SUBJECTIVE
ASSUMPTIONS. THE ACTUAL LIABILITY COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATE RECORDED IN OUR
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF POTENTIAL FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AS
WELL AS THE AMOUNT THAT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID TO SETTLE OR SATISFY ANY SUCH CLAIMS IN THE FUTURE
(INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT BONDS REQUIRED BY CERTAIN STATES WHILE WE APPEAL ADVERSE VERDICTS), AND THE
FINITE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE PAYMENTS, FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, SEE MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINGENCIES ASBESTOS. 

OUR BUSINESS AND SOME OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE ARE CYCLICAL AND DISTRESSED MARKET CONDITIONS COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CHEMICAL COMPANIES, PETROLEUM
REFINERIES, HEAVY-DUTY TRUCKING, SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING, CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND THE AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY, ARE, TO VARYING DEGREES, CYCLICAL AND HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED PERIODIC DOWNTURNS.
PRIOR DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DIMINISHED PRODUCT DEMAND, EXCESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY
AND

8 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

SUBSEQUENT EROSION OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN THESE MARKETS RESULTING IN NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON
OUR NET SALES, GROSS MARGINS AND NET INCOME. THE CURRENT DOWNWARD CYCLE HAS IMPACTED OUR RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR OUR MOST RECENT QUARTERLY PERIODS. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY AFFECT
OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ORGANIC GROWTH AND A CONTINUED DOWNWARD CYCLE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, A PROLONGED DOWNWARD CYCLE MAY CRITICALLY IMPAIR THE CONTINUED
VIABILITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH THESE
CUSTOMERS. A PROLONGED AND SEVERE DOWNWARD CYCLE IN OUR MARKETS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE ENCOUNTER INTENSE COMPETITION IN ALMOST ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. CUSTOMERS FOR MANY OF
OUR PRODUCTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VENDORS FROM WHICH THEY PURCHASE IN ORDER TO
REDUCE INVENTORIES. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE NEED TO INVEST CONTINUOUSLY IN MANUFACTURING,
MARKETING, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT AND OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP NEW
PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS AND DESIRES OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT
RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS OR MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. ADDITIONALLY,
SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE AND HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES
THAN WE DO. AS A RESULT, THEY MAY BE BETTER ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE EFFECTS OF PERIODIC ECONOMIC
DOWNTURNS. CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE TRANSFORMATION FROM UNIQUE BRANDED PRODUCTS
TO UNDIFFERENTIATED PRICE SENSITIVE PRODUCTS. THIS PRODUCTS COMMODITIZATION MAY BE ACCELERATED BY
LOW COST FOREIGN COMPETITION. INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH SUPERIOR
SERVICE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, INNOVATION, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TECHNOLOGY, NEW PRODUCT
ACQUISITIONS, BUNDLING WITH KEY SERVICES, LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR MARKET FOCUS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.
PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

IF WE FAIL TO RETAIN THE INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND DISTRIBUTORS UPON WHOM WE RELY TO MARKET OUR
PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY MAY
DECLINE. 

OUR MARKETING SUCCESS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD DEPENDS LARGELY UPON OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND
DISTRIBUTORS SALES AND SERVICE EXPERTISE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS IN OUR MARKETS. MANY OF
THESE AGENTS HAVE DEVELOPED STRONG TIES TO EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF THEIR
DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF OUR PRODUCTS. A LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE AGENTS OR
DISTRIBUTORS, OR OF A PARTICULAR AGENT OR DISTRIBUTOR IN A KEY MARKET OR WITH KEY CUSTOMER
RELATIONSHIPS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
AND CASH FLOWS.

INCREASED COSTS FOR RAW MATERIALS OR THE TERMINATION OF EXISTING SUPPLY AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

THE PRICES FOR SOME OF THE RAW MATERIALS WE PURCHASE INCREASED IN 2009. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN
SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING ALONG A PORTION OF THESE HIGHER COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE DOING SO WITHOUT LOSING CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY, THE LOSS OF A KEY SUPPLIER OR
THE UNAVAILABILITY OF A KEY RAW MATERIAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO SOME CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN
ANY FISCAL PERIOD. 

WE HAVE SOME CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF OUR PREDECESSORS,
INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND OTHER MATTERS. IN
SOME

9 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

INSTANCES WE HAVE INDEMNIFIED OTHERS AGAINST THOSE LIABILITIES, AND IN OTHER INSTANCES WE HAVE
RECEIVED INDEMNITIES FROM THIRD PARTIES AGAINST THOSE LIABILITIES.

CLAIMS COULD ARISE RELATING TO PRODUCTS OR OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO OUR DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS. SOME OF THESE CLAIMS COULD SEEK SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES. SPECIFICALLY, WE MAY
POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE FIREARMS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO 1990 BY
COLT FIREARMS, A FORMER OPERATION OF COLTEC, AND FOR ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO
1994 BY CENTRAL MOLONEY, ANOTHER FORMER COLTEC OPERATION. COLTEC ALSO HAS ONGOING OBLIGATIONS WITH
REGARD TO WORKERS COMPENSATION, RETIREE MEDICAL AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS THAT RELATE TO COLTEC S PERIODS OF OWNERSHIP OF THOSE OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE INSURANCE, RESERVES AND FUNDS HELD IN TRUST TO ADDRESS THESE LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, IF
OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE IS DEPLETED, OUR RESERVES ARE NOT ADEQUATE OR THE FUNDS HELD IN TRUST ARE
INSUFFICIENT, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LIABILITIES RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., WHICH SUBJECTS US TO
ADDITIONAL BUSINESS RISKS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR PROFITABILITY TO DECLINE. 

BECAUSE WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY. IN 2009, WE DERIVED APPROXIMATELY 48 OF OUR
REVENUES FROM SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE, AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING:

UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; 

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN TAX, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; 

DIFFICULTY IN PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; 

TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS; 

DIFFERING LABOR REGULATIONS; 

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY; AND 

ACTS OF HOSTILITY, TERROR OR WAR. 

ANY OF THESE FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE INTERNATIONAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR
EXPOSURE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS. AS WE EXPAND OUR
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WE MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER NEW RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES
AND PROFITABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS WE FOCUS ON BUILDING OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
NETWORKS IN NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MUST CONTINUE TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED LOCAL
AGENTS, DISTRIBUTORS AND TRADING COMPANIES. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING THESE
RELATIONSHIPS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE SALES IN THESE REGIONS.

EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, INVOLVE
NUMEROUS INHERENT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PROPERLY EVALUATING ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, SUCCESSFULLY
INTEGRATING NEW BUSINESSES OR PRODUCT LINES, RETAINING KEY EMPLOYEES, PROPERLY EVALUATING RISKS AND
OTHER

10 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

DILIGENCE MATTERS, ENSURING ADEQUATE CAPITAL AVAILABILITY AND BALANCING OTHER RESOURCE
CONSTRAINTS. ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT SUCCEED AS PLANNED. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THESE RISKS
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING RISING
HEALTHCARE COSTS, CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND UNFORESEEN BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS. 

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NUMEROUS OTHER RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAL AND
HEALTHCARE COSTS MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THESE COSTS, SUCH AS CONSUMER
DRIVEN HEALTH PLAN PACKAGES, MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE THESE EXPENSES AS NEEDED. FAILURE TO
OFFER COMPETITIVE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MAY RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO RECRUIT OR MAINTAIN KEY
EMPLOYEES. OTHER RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RULES OR
REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. USE OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS
AND OTHER SUBSTANCES COULD BECOME RESTRICTED OR SUCH CHANGES MAY OTHERWISE REQUIRE US TO INCUR
ADDITIONAL COSTS WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OFFER COMPETITIVELY
PRICED PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE GLOBAL OR LOCAL EVENTS WHICH COULD
SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS, POLITICAL
INSURGENCIES, PANDEMICS AND ELECTRICAL GRID FAILURES ARE SOME OF THE UNFORESEEN RISKS THAT COULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO OUR
PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 

WE BELIEVE THAT PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS. IF WE ARE
UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND KNOW-HOW, OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS
COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH PATENTS,
TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS, CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-COMPETE
AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS. PATENTS ISSUED TO THIRD PARTIES, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE ISSUE DATE OF OUR PATENTS,
COULD RENDER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LESS VALUABLE. QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OUR COMPETITORS 
PRODUCTS INFRINGE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE OUR
COMPETITORS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE DISPUTED. IN ADDITION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, LIMITED OR DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, WHICH COULD MAKE
IT EASIER FOR COMPETITORS TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

OUR COMPETITORS MAY CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM US BY SELLING PRODUCTS THAT CLAIM TO MIRROR THE
CAPABILITIES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT PROTECTION NATIONALLY AND
INTERNATIONALLY FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR COMPETITIVENESS WORLDWIDE COULD BE IMPAIRED,
WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROWTH AND FUTURE REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO
SPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MONITOR AND POLICE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK 

THE MARKET PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE. 

A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF SHARES TRADED IN ANY ONE DAY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON
THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD FLUCTUATE
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR MANY REASONS, INCLUDING IN RESPONSE TO THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION AND
ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT OR FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS REPORTS BY INDUSTRY
ANALYSTS, INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS OR NEGATIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, COMPETITORS OR SUPPLIERS
REGARDING THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GENERAL FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND
POLITICAL INSTABILITY. IN PARTICULAR, REPORTS CONCERNING ASBESTOS LITIGATION OR ASBESTOS REFORM
COULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

BECAUSE OUR QUARTERLY REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE PERIODS, OUR
STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE. 

OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. A HIGH
PROPORTION OF OUR COSTS ARE FIXED, DUE IN PART TO SIGNIFICANT SELLING AND MANUFACTURING COSTS.
SMALL DECLINES IN REVENUES COULD DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN A QUARTER AND THE
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FALL. WE MAY ALSO INCUR CHARGES TO INCOME TO COVER INCREASES IN THE
ESTIMATE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FUTURE ASBESTOS LIABILITY. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT QUARTERLY
OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS; 

THE TIMING AND EXECUTION OF CUSTOMER CONTRACTS; 

THE TIMING OF SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS; 

PAYMENTS RELATED TO ASBESTOS LITIGATION OR ANNUAL COSTS RELATED TO ASBESTOS
LITIGATION THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE; 

THE TIMING OF RECEIPT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS; 

INCREASES IN MANUFACTURING COSTS DUE TO EQUIPMENT OR LABOR ISSUES; 

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; 

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX RATES; 

UNANTICIPATED DELAYS OR PROBLEMS IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS; 

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS OF NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATIONS; 

CHANGES IN OUR PRICING POLICIES OR THE PRICING POLICIES OF OUR COMPETITORS; 

INCREASED EXPENSES, WHETHER RELATED TO SALES AND MARKETING, RAW MATERIALS
OR SUPPLIES, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR ADMINISTRATION; 

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE,
ASIA AND OTHER MAJOR REGIONS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS; 

COSTS RELATED TO POSSIBLE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES OF
TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESSES; 

AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OR MAGNITUDE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS; 

OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS AND THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF
EXPENDITURES RELATED TO EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED
STATES; AND 

ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND MARKET FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE POST-RETIREMENT
BENEFITS AND PENSION LIABILITIES. 

12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

VARIOUS PROVISIONS AND LAWS COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, OUR SHAREHOLDER
RIGHTS PLAN AND PROVISIONS OF NORTH CAROLINA LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR MAY
IMPEDE THE ABILITY OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO CHANGE OUR MANAGEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, OUR
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WILL:

REQUIRE A SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO APPROVE ANY BUSINESS
COMBINATION TRANSACTION WITH AN OWNER OF 5 OR MORE OF OUR SHARES UNLESS THE
TRANSACTION IS RECOMMENDED BY DISINTERESTED DIRECTORS; 

LIMIT THE RIGHT OF SHAREHOLDERS TO REMOVE DIRECTORS AND FILL VACANCIES; 

REGULATE HOW SHAREHOLDERS MAY PRESENT PROPOSALS OR NOMINATE DIRECTORS FOR
ELECTION AT SHAREHOLDERS MEETINGS; AND 

AUTHORIZE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OR MORE
SERIES, WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. 

OUR SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN WILL ALSO MAKE AN ACQUISITION OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN ENPRO
IN A TRANSACTION NOT APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MORE DIFFICULT.

FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET COULD LOWER THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON
STOCK AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES. 

IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SELL ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO RAISE CAPITAL. IN
ADDITION, A REASONABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER OUR
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, INCLUDING SHARES TO BE ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS,
VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK OR UNIT GRANTS, AND UPON CONVERSION OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES. WE
CANNOT PREDICT THE SIZE OF FUTURE ISSUANCES OR THE EFFECT, IF ANY, THAT THEY MAY HAVE ON THE MARKET
PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. THE ISSUANCE AND SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF COMMON STOCK, OR THE
PERCEPTION THAT SUCH ISSUANCES AND SALES MAY OCCUR, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF THE
DEBENTURES AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ABSENCE OF DIVIDENDS COULD REDUCE OUR ATTRACTIVENESS TO INVESTORS. 

WE HAVE NEVER DECLARED OR PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. MOREOVER, OUR CURRENT
SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK IF
AVAILABILITY UNDER THE FACILITY FALLS BELOW 20 MILLION. AS A RESULT, OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE LESS
ATTRACTIVE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS THAN THE STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH A HISTORY OF PAYING REGULAR
DIVIDENDS.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE 

OUR DEBT AGREEMENT IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND
TO MARKET CONDITIONS, ADDRESS UNANTICIPATED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND/OR PURSUE BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES. 

WE HAVE A 75 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON OUR
OPERATIONS, SUCH AS LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS, LIMITATIONS ON INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF
INDEBTEDNESS, AND MAINTENANCE OF A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE FINANCIAL RATIO. THESE LIMITATIONS COULD
IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKET CONDITIONS, ADDRESS UNANTICIPATED CAPITAL INVESTMENT NEEDS
AND/OR PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH TO REPURCHASE OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AT THE OPTION OF THE
HOLDER OR UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR TO PAY THE CASH PAYABLE UPON A CONVERSION. 

UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN OFFER
TO REPURCHASE FOR CASH ALL OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AT 100 OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT
PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, INCLUDING LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, IF ANY, UP TO BUT NOT INCLUDING THE
DATE OF REPURCHASE. UPON A CONVERSION, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A CASH PAYMENT OF UP TO 1,000
FOR EACH 1,000 IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES CONVERTED. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH
AVAILABLE CASH OR BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING AT THE TIME WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE REPURCHASES OF
TENDERED DEBENTURES OR SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTED DEBENTURES. ANY CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE AT THE
TIME OF A REPURCHASE OR CONVERSION OF THE DEBENTURES MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE BORROWINGS
TO PAY ANY CASH PAYABLE ON A REPURCHASE OR CONVERSION OF THE DEBENTURES AND MAY PROHIBIT US FROM
MAKING ANY CASH PAYMENTS ON THE REPURCHASE OR CONVERSION OF THE DEBENTURES IF A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF
DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED UNDER THAT FACILITY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS UNDER THAT CREDIT
FACILITY. OUR CURRENT 75 MILLION SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY PROHIBITS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR
SUBSIDIARIES TO US TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES IF A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT
EXISTS UNDER THE FACILITY. OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY ALSO PROHIBITS PREPAYMENTS OF THE
DEBENTURES OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO US TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OR PAYMENTS UPON
CONVERSION OF THE DEBENTURES IF A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER THE FACILITY OR THE
AMOUNT OF THE BORROWING BASE UNDER THE FACILITY, LESS THE AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER
THE FACILITY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AND RESERVES, IS LESS THAN 20 MILLION. OUR FAILURE TO
REPURCHASE TENDERED DEBENTURES AT A TIME WHEN THE REPURCHASE IS REQUIRED BY THE INDENTURE OR TO PAY
ANY CASH PAYABLE ON A CONVERSION OF THE DEBENTURES WOULD CONSTITUTE A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE.
A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE OR THE CHANGE OF CONTROL ITSELF COULD LEAD TO A DEFAULT UNDER THE
OTHER EXISTING AND FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS. IF THE REPAYMENT OF THE RELATED
INDEBTEDNESS WERE TO BE ACCELERATED AFTER ANY APPLICABLE NOTICE OR GRACE PERIODS, WE MAY NOT HAVE
SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO REPAY THE INDEBTEDNESS AND REPURCHASE THE DEBENTURES OR MAKE CASH PAYMENTS UPON
CONVERSION THEREOF.

RISKS RELATED TO THE RECENT GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 

THE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS AND ADVERSE CHANGES ARISING FROM THE CURRENT
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FINANCING AND EXPOSE US TO
UNEXPECTED RISKS. 

THE CURRENT GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND CREDIT CRISIS EXPOSES US TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. WE HAVE
HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR BUSINESS WITH CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF
OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES. WE HAVE A 75 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH A
GROUP OF LENDERS AS A BACKSTOP TO OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO BORROWINGS UNDER THIS
FACILITY TO DATE. IN LIGHT OF THE UNPRECEDENTED DISRUPTION OF GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS AND THE
INSTABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WERE OF UNQUESTIONED STRENGTH, THERE IS A
RISK THAT A BORROWING REQUEST PROPERLY MADE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WOULD NOT BE HONORED BY ONE
OR MORE OF OUR LENDERS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY, NO LENDER IS OBLIGATED TO FUND A
PORTION OF A BORROWING REQUEST THAT IS NOT FUNDED BY ANOTHER LENDER. ACCORDINGLY, IN SUCH AN
INSTANCE ACTUAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR LIQUIDITY
NEEDS AND WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ALTERNATE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT
CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT SUCH ALTERNATE
FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. AS OF THE
DATE OF THIS FILING WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A BORROWING REQUEST, PROPERLY SUBMITTED BY
US, WOULD NOT BE HONORED BY ANY OF OUR LENDERS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE ASSURED US OF THEIR CONTINUING
ABILITY TO FUND OUR FACILITY. IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WITH NUMEROUS FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD IN AMOUNTS THAT EXCEED APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE
LEVELS. WHILE WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIPS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS IN THE
EVENT OF THE UNANTICIPATED FAILURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN WHICH WE MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, WHICH
LOSS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES. 

WE ARE PARTY TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND CALL
OPTIONS (HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS) WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES, WITH FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO HEDGE AGAINST CERTAIN FINANCIAL RISKS. IN LIGHT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
AND POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FAILURES, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT OUR
COUNTERPARTY IN A DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION MAY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF
BEING PLACED IN RECEIVERSHIP OR OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT THAT A COUNTERPARTY TO A MATERIAL
DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL
LOSSES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

 FACTORS
 WHICH ARE PRESENTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. 

DEPRECIATION
 AND AMORTIZATION 

DEPRECIATION
 AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 WAS 0.5 MILLION
 AS
 COMPARED TO 0.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. THIS REPRESENTS
 AN
 INCREASE OF 0.3 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY AN INCREASE
 IN
 PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING THOSE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE
 ACQUISITIONS OF DIGITCOM AND RADIAN. FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE
 ACCOUNTING FOR THESE ACQUISITIONS, SEE NOTE 13 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS PRESENTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THE INCREASE ALSO INCLUDES
 APPROXIMATELY 0.1 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION OF
 CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND 0.5 MILLION OF COVENANTS NOT TO
 COMPETE ACQUIRED AS THE RESULT OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED
 ACQUISITIONS. 

INTEREST
 INCOME AND EXPENSE 

INTEREST
 INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 WAS 37 THOUSAND, AN INCREASE OF
 23
 THOUSAND FROM 14 THOUSAND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. THIS INCREASE
 WAS
 CAUSED BY THE ADDITIONAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WE RECEIVED AS A RESULT
 OF
 OUR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WITH SIGMA OPPORTUNITY FUND AND ITS AFFILIATES
 AND
 NON-AFFILIATED CO-INVESTORS DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL
 2007
 (THE SIGMA TRANSACTIONS ). FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE SIGMA
 TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 10 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED
 ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. 

INTEREST
 EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 WAS 1.2 MILLION. THIS REPRESENTS
 AN
 INCREASE OF 1.1 MILLION FROM 0.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006.
 THIS INCREASE WAS CAUSED BY ADDITIONAL DEBT INCURRED RELATED TO THE SIGMA
 TRANSACTIONS, OUR ISSUANCE OF A PROMISSORY NOTE AS PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE
 FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INC., AND OUR EXPANDED
 LINE OF CREDIT WITH PRESIDENTIAL FINANCIAL. INCLUDED IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE
 30,
 2007 RESULTS ARE 0.3 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING FEES
 AND
 0.5 MILLION IN INTEREST ACCRETION CAUSED BY THE ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS RELATED
 TO
 THE SIGMA TRANSACTIONS. 

FINANCING
 FEES 

DURING
 FISCAL 2007, WE ENTERED INTO A NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SIGMA OPPORTUNITY
 FUND, LLC, TO WHICH PACIFIC ASSET PARTNERS, LP, OPERIS PARTNERS I, LLC AND
 SIGMA
 BERLINER, LLC HAVE JOINED AND ARE EACH DEEMED A PARTY TO ISSUE IN
 AGGREGATE 6.0 MILLION WORTH OF 7 SENIOR SUBORDINATED SECURED CONVERTIBLE
 NOTES
 DUE ON DECEMBER 29, 2008 (COLLECTIVELY, THE NOTES ). THESE NOTES WERE INITIALLY
 CONVERTIBLE AT 1.10 PER SHARE (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT). IN THE AGGREGATE,
 THE
 NOTES WERE INITIALLY CONVERTIBLE INTO A TOTAL OF 5,454,545 SHARES OF OUR
 COMMON
 STOCK. IN ADDITION, WE ISSUED WARRANTS TO PURCHASE UP TO 3,000,000 SHARES
 OF OUR
 COMMON STOCK WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF 0.01 (THE WARRANTS ). 

PURSUANT
 TO THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ,
 WE
 AGREED
 TO REGISTER THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES
 AND
 UPON EXERCISE OF THE WARRANTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE REGISTRABLE SHARES FOR
 RESALE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. WE AGREED TO FILE WITH THE SEC A REGISTRATION
 STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTRABLE SHARES, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE
 SEC
 ON MARCH 19, 2007, AND TO CAUSE THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT TO BECOME EFFECTIVE
 ON OR BEFORE JUNE 15, 2007. 

WE
 WERE
 UNABLE TO HAVE THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC PRIOR
 TO
 JUNE 15, 2007. THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE BECAME
 SUBJECT TO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES EQUAL TO 2 OF THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE
 PAID
 BY EACH PURCHASER FOR EACH OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THAT WE FAILED TO MEET
 THE
 REQUIREMENT, RESULTING IN A MAXIMUM LIQUIDATED DAMAGES EXPOSURE OF 0.7 MILLION
 (THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ). ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2007, WE SIGNED A WAIVER AND
 AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE WAIVER WITH THE NOTEHOLDERS WHEREBY
 THE NOTEHOLDERS AGREED TO AMEND
 THE
 NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ELIMINATE THE PROVISION WHICH
 GAVE RISE TO THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR AGREEMENT TO AMEND
 THE
 NOTES TO LOWER THE CONVERSION PRICE FROM 1.10 TO 1.00 PER SHARE. PURSUANT
 TO
 THE WAIVER, WE HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO REGISTER
 THE
 SHARES UNDERLYING THE NOTES AND THE WARRANTS. WE ARE OBLIGATED TO REGISTER
 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SHARES THAT MAY BE REGISTERED ON THE FORM OF
 REGISTRATION STATEMENT (A) AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME OF SUCH REGISTRATION
 STATEMENT IS FILED, (B) UNDER WHICH AN AT THE MARKET OFFERING MAY BE MADE ON A
 DELAYED OR CONTINUOUS BASIS UNDER RULE 415, PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES
 ACT
 OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND (C) WHICH SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED OR DEEMED TO BE
 A
 PRIMARY OFFERING OF SECURITIES BY THE SEC. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH OUR
 OBLIGATION, WE ANTICIPATE FILING A NEW REGISTRATION STATEMENT TO REGISTER
 APPROXIMATELY 1,222,632 OF THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH UNDERLY THE
 WARRANTS SHORTLY FOLLOWING THE FILING OF OUR 2007 PROXY STATEMENT, EXPECTED
 TO
 BE AT THE END OF OCTOBER 2007. WE ALSO AGREED TO USE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO
 MAINTAIN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT WE FILE WITH RESPECT
 TO
 THOSE SHARES. THE REDUCTION IN THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES WILL RESULT
 IN
 THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK BEING DILUTED BY AN ADDITIONAL 545,455 SHARES
 IN
 THE EVENT ALL OF THE NOTES ARE CONVERTED. 

24 

THIS
 RESULTED IN OUR RECOGNIZING A FINANCING FEE OF 0.7 MILLION AS A NON-CASH
 CHARGE
 TO OTHER EXPENSE IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON
 THE
 ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE REDUCTION OF THE CONVERSION PRICE FROM 1.10 TO 1.00
 PER
 SHARE, WHICH WE ESTIMATED TO BE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE
 OF
 OUR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. 

INCOME
 (LOSS) IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS 

FOR
 THE
 YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS RESULTED FROM OUR
 MINORITY INVESTMENT IN PACIUGO THAT WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD
 OF
 ACCOUNTING. UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF EACH
 SUBSIDIARY S OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS IS INCLUDED IN INCOME OR LOSS FROM EQUITY
 INVESTMENTS. WE SOLD OUR INTEREST IN PACIUGO ON DECEMBER 30, 2005 AND RECORDED
 A
 GAIN OF 0.2 MILLION. 

DEEMED
 PREFERRED DIVIDENDS 

FOR
 THE
 YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, THE DEEMED DIVIDEND ON OUR SERIES B AND D CONVERTIBLE
 PREFERRED STOCK WAS RECORDED AS THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE
 CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED TO THE PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE CARRYING
 VALUE
 OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ON OUR BALANCE SHEET PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THIS
 AMOUNT
 WAS DEEMED TO REPRESENT A RETURN TO THE PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS AND, THEREFORE,
 WAS TREATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF THE
 PREFERRED STOCK IN THE CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE. 

INCOME
 TAX EXPENSE 

IN
 PRIOR
 YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THROUGH
 THE USE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE BECAUSE, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, BASED
 ON
 THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT AT THE TIME, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT
 THAT
 THE BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM THESE ASSETS WOULD NOT BE REALIZED. THIS
 OPINION
 WAS BASED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON THE HISTORY OF NET LOSSES. BASED ON
 INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO BCI MANAGEMENT, IT NOW APPEARS MORE LIKELY
 THAN NOT THAT THESE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED. THIS RESULTED
 IN
 THE REVERSAL OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THE COMPANY HAD RECOGNIZED IN PRIOR
 YEARS, RESULTING IN REDUCING OUR CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES BY 738
 THOUSAND. 

FISCAL
 YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
 2005 

REVENUES

WE
 HAD
 REVENUES OF 39.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, VERSUS 10.2
 MILLION
 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005. REVENUES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT
 CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 90 AND
 89 
 IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, AND IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005,
 RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE FROM REAL ESTATE SITE ACQUISITION AND ZONING SERVICES
 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 AND 11 OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THESE
 SAME PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE
 30,
 2006, VERSUS THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005, IS DUE TO AN ADDITIONAL
 SIX
 MONTHS OF OPERATIONS AND THE INCREASED SPENDING FROM OUR CUSTOMERS IN
 INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION AND RADIO FREQUENCY
 ENGINEERING IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR NETWORKS IN PREPARATION FOR FUTURE
 OFFERINGS OF VIDEO AND MUSIC AND REDUCED SPENDING IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION
 AND
 ZONING SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT
 CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION CONTRACTS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD
 OF ACCOUNTING AND REAL ESTATE SITE ACQUISITION AND ZONING SERVICES UPON THE
 IDENTIFICATION OF AN ACCEPTABLE SITE AND WHEN THE LEASE IS SIGNED BETWEEN
 THE
 LANDLORD AND THE CUSTOMER.

COST
 OF REVENUES 

OUR

 BERLINER

 ELMWOOD
 PARK, NEW JERSEY 

WE
 HAVE
 AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF BERLINER COMMUNICATIONS,
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2007 AND 2006 AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED
 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS
 ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 AND 2006, THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005, AND THE
 YEAR
 ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY
 OF
 THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. 

WE
 CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY
 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT
 WE PLAN
 AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS ARE FREE FROM MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED
 TO
 HAVE, NOR WERE WE ENGAGED TO PERFORM, AN AUDIT OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
 FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR AUDITS INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL
 OVER
 FINANCIAL REPORTING AS A BASIS FOR DESIGNING AUDIT PROCEDURES THAT ARE
 APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPRESSING AN
 OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
 REPORTING. ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPRESS NO SUCH OPINION. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES
 EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES
 IN
 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND
 SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL
 FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A
 REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION. 

IN
 OUR
 OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT
 FAIRLY,
 IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF BERLINER COMMUNICATIONS,
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AT JUNE 30, 2007 AND 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR
 OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 AND 2006, AND
 THE
 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005, AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, IN

SUMMARY
 OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
 POLICIES 

BASIS
 OF PRESENTATION 

THE
 PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
 GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO
 MAKE
 ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND
 LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE
 OF
 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES
 DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.
 SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES BEING MADE INCLUDE THE ALLOWANCE FOR
 DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION
 PROJECTS.

THE
 AMOUNTS PRESENTED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2004, IN THE ACCOMPANYING
 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS HAVE BEEN
 PREPARED BY US, WITHOUT AUDIT, PURSUANT TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENT
 RULES
 AND REGULATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SEC ).
 IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
 AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDE ALL ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO PRESENT
 FAIRLY
 THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
 2004. 

PRINCIPLES
 OF CONSOLIDATION 

THE
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE OUR ACCOUNTS AND THE ACCOUNTS OF
 OUR
 WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS
 HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. 

CASH
 AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

WE
 CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY
 OF
 THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. AT JUNE 30, 2007, CASH AND CASH
 EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION AND CONSISTED OF BANK BALANCES,
 A
 CORPORATE BOND AND A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT. WE MAINTAIN OUR CASH AND CASH
 EQUIVALENTS WITH TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT, AT TIMES, MAY HAVE AMOUNTS
 IN
 EXCESS OF THE FDIC INSURANCE LIMIT. 

RISKS
 AND UNCERTAINTIES 

FINANCIAL
 INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
 CONSIST
 PRIMARILY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE ROUTINELY ASSESS THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH
 OF
 OUR CUSTOMERS AND DO NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY TO SUPPORT
 CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES. CREDIT LOSSES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN OUR CONSOLIDATED
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FORM OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. OUR
 ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED UPON THE EXPECTED COLLECTIBILITY
 OF ALL
 OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE DETERMINE OUR ALLOWANCE BY CONSIDERING A NUMBER
 OF
 FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME IT IS PAST DUE, OUR PREVIOUS LOSS HISTORY
 AND THE CUSTOMER S CURRENT ABILITY TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE AND ANY PAYMENTS
 SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED ON SUCH RECEIVABLES ARE CREDITED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR
 DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. 

INVENTORIES 

INVENTORIES,
 WHICH CONSIST MAINLY OF PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS, ARE STATED AT THE LOWER
 OF COST
 OR MARKET. COST IS DETERMINED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. 

PREPAID
 EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS 

PREPAID
 EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS AND EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED
 SERVICES ARE RECEIVED. AT JUNE 30, 2007 AND 2006, CURRENT PREPAID EXPENSES
 AND
 OTHER CURRENT ASSETS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 0.8 MILLION AND 0.3 MILLION,
 RESPECTIVELY, AND CONSISTED MAINLY OF INSURANCE, DEFERRED FINANCING FEES
 AND
 RENTS. NON-CURRENT OTHER ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY 0.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30,
 2007,
 AND 0.2 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2006 ARE MAINLY DEPOSITS FOR OUR OFFICE AND
 WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS AND LONG-TERM INSURANCE. 

PROPERTY
 AND EQUIPMENT 

PROPERTY
 AND EQUIPMENT CONSIST OF AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, EQUIPMENT
 AND SOFTWARE, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. EACH CLASS
 OF
 ASSET IS RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD
 OVER
 THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS. LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
 ARE
 AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, WHICHEVER
 IS
 SHORTER. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. SIGNIFICANT
 RENEWALS AND BETTERMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED. AT THE TIME OF RETIREMENT OR OTHER
 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, THE COST AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION
 ARE
 REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND ANY RESULTING GAIN OR LOSS IS REFLECTED IN
 OPERATIONS.

LONG-LIVED
 ASSETS 

WE
 ASSESS
 THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, BY DETERMINING
 WHETHER THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CAN BE RECOVERED THROUGH PROJECTED
 UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS MEASURED
 BASED ON FAIR VALUE AND IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE
 IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. 

EQUITY
 INVESTMENTS 

SUBSIDIARIES
 WHOSE RESULTS ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED, BUT OVER WHOM WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT
 INFLUENCE, ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.
 WHETHER WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE WITH RESPECT TO A SUBSIDIARY DEPENDS
 ON AN EVALUATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 REPRESENTATION ON THE SUBSIDIARY S GOVERNING BOARD AND OWNERSHIP LEVEL, WHICH IS
 GENERALLY A 20 TO 50 INTEREST IN THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE SUBSIDIARY,
 INCLUDING VOTING RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR HOLDINGS IN COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED
 STOCK AND OTHER CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS IN THE SUBSIDIARY. UNDER THE EQUITY
 METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE SUBSIDIARY S ACCOUNTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF A SUBSIDIARY S
 OPERATING EARNINGS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION (INCOME) LOSS IN
 EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. DURING THE
 YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, WE SOLD OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN PACIUGO MANAGEMENT,
 LLC FOR A GAIN (SEE NOTE 6 - EQUITY INVESTMENTS). 

REVENUE
 RECOGNITION 

REVENUE
 FROM RADIO FREQUENCY AND NETWORK DESIGN AND ENGINEERING, INFRASTRUCTURE
 EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION, RADIO TRANSMISSION BASE STATION
 MODIFICATIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED AS WORK IS
 PERFORMED. REVENUE FROM REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION AND ZONING SERVICES IS
 RECOGNIZED UNDER THE COMPLETED CONTRACT METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. REVENUE ASSOCIATED
 WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENT CONTRACTS REFLECTS THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE SERVICES
 INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT. REVENUE FROM INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION
 AND
 INSTALLATION CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS, IS
 RECORDED UNDER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED
 PERCENTAGE THAT TOTAL DIRECT COSTS INCURRED TO DATE BEAR TO ESTIMATED TOTAL
 COSTS AT COMPLETION. LOSSES ON INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION AND
 INSTALLATION CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN SUCH LOSSES BECOME
 KNOWN. 

UNBILLED
 RECEIVABLES REPRESENT REVENUES ON UNCOMPLETED INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT
 CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT YET BILLED OR BILLABLE,
 PURSUANT TO CONTRACT TERMS. 

INCOME
 TAXES 

WE
 ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX
 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES
 ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS
 AND
 LIABILITIES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED
 TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING APPLICABLE TAX RATES EXPECTED
 TO
 APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES
 ARE
 EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT ON THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
 AND
 LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN THE STATEMENT OF
 OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE
 IS PROVIDED FOR SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN
 NOT
 THAT SUCH ASSETS WILL NOT BE RECOVERED.

 OLD BERLINER APPLIED THE INTRINSIC VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED
 BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING
 FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES ,
 AND
 RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR EMPLOYEE-BASED STOCK OPTIONS
 PLAN. AS SUCH, COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD BE RECORDED ON THE DATE OF GRANT

 BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. AS PERMITTED BY
 SFAS
 123, OLD BERLINER ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPLY THE INTRINSIC VALUE BASED
 METHOD
 OF ACCOUNTING FOR ITS EMPLOYEE-BASED STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND ADOPTED THE
 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 123. 

DURING
 2004 AND THROUGH THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, OLD BERLINER DID NOT GRANT
 ANY
 STOCK OPTIONS UNDER ITS PLANS. THE HOLDERS OF OLD BERLINER S PLANS FORFEITED ALL
 OF THEIR STOCK OPTIONS 90 DAYS AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE DUE TO ALL OF THE
 EMPLOYEES BECOMING EMPLOYEES OF BERLINER. THERE WERE NO STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED
 FROM THE ACQUISITION TO JUNE 30, 2005. DURING THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2007
 AND
 2006, WE GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS TOTALING 1,091,526 AND 530,300 SHARES,
 RESPECTIVELY, UNDER OUR PLANS. 

PRIOR
 TO
 JULY 31, 2005, WE ADOPTED THE DISCLOSURE-ONLY PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123. SFAS
 123
 REQUIRED PRO FORMA INFORMATION TO BE PRESENTED AS IF WE HAD ACCOUNTED FOR
 THE
 STOCK OPTIONS DURING THE FISCAL PERIODS PRESENTED USING THE FAIR VALUE METHOD.
 THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2005
 WERE ESTIMATED AS OF THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

THE

IN
 ASSESSING THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER WHETHER IT
 IS
 MORE LIKELY THAN NOT FOR SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL
 NOT
 BE REALIZED. THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS DEPENDENT
 UPON
 THE GENERATION OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME DURING THE PERIODS IN WHICH THOSE
 TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BECOME DEDUCTIBLE. 

IN
 PRIOR
 YEARS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 BOARD
 STATEMENT NO. 109 ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES (FASB 109), THE COMPANY HAS
 REDUCED ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THROUGH THE USE OF A VALUATION
 ALLOWANCE BECAUSE, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, BASED ON THE INFORMATION
 AVAILABLE TO IT AT THE TIME, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BENEFITS
 TO BE
 DERIVED FROM THESE ASSETS WOULD NOT BE REALIZED. THIS OPINION WAS BASED,
 AMONG
 OTHER THINGS, BY THE HISTORY OF NET LOSSES. 

BASED
 ON
 INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO BCI MANAGEMENT, IT NOW APPEARS MORE LIKELY
 THAN NOT THAT THESE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED. 

THEREFORE,
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD
 STATEMENT NO. 154 ACCOUNTING
 CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS - A REPLACEMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 20 AND FASB
 STATEMENT NO. 3 
 (FASB
 154), BCI MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF FUTURE
 TAX
 BENEFITS DERIVED FROM ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS SHALL BE REFLECTED
 IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2007.

RECAPITALIZATION 

IN

 (THE VOTING AGREEMENT WITH OLD BERLINER AS A HOLDER OF A MAJORITY OF OUR
 COMMON STOCK, AS SOLE HOLDER OF OUR NEWLY ISSUED SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK,
 AS
 SOLE HOLDER OF OUR SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK AND MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS HOLDER

 THINGS, THE APPROVAL OF CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
 AND THE CERTIFICATES OF DESIGNATION FOR THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK AND
 THE
 SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK (THE RECAPITALIZATION ). 

AS
 PART
 OF THE RECAPITALIZATION, WE RECORDED A DEEMED DIVIDEND OF APPROXIMATELY 19.9
 MILLION ON THE CONVERSION OF THE SERIES B AND SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK DUE
 TO
 THE REDUCTION IN THE CONVERSION PRICE THAT APPEARS ON THE ACCOMPANYING
 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN COMPUTING THE NET LOSS ALLOCABLE
 TO
 COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE DEEMED
 DIVIDEND ON THE SERIES B AND D CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WAS RECORDED AS
 THE
 EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED TO THE PREFERRED
 SHAREHOLDERS AS OF THE DATE OF THE VOTING AGREEMENT OVER THE CARRYING VALUE
 OF
 THE PREFERRED STOCK ON OUR BALANCE SHEET PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THIS AMOUNT
 IS
 DEEMED TO REPRESENT A RETURN TO THE PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS AND THEREFORE
 IS

 SUBSEQUENT
 EVENTS 

ON
 SEPTEMBER 27, 2007, WE SIGNED A WAIVER AND AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 WITH THE SIGMA OPPORTUNITY FUND, LLC, PACIFIC ASSET PARTNERS, LP, OPERIS
 PARTNERS I, LLC AND SIGMA BERLINER, LLC, (COLLECTIVELY THE "NOTEHOLDERS")
 WHEREBY THE NOTEHOLDERS AGREED TO WAIVE THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
 CLAUSE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY THE "NOTES")
 IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR AGREEMENT TO LOWER THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES
 FROM 1.10 TO 1.00 PER SHARE. PURSUANT TO THIS WAIVER AND AMENDMENT TO NOTE
 PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO
 REGISTER THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE NOTES AND THE ASSOCIATED WARRANTS, AND
 TO
 MAINTAIN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT WE FILE WITH RESPECT
 TO
 THESE SHARES. 

THIS
 RESULTED IN OUR RECOGNIZING A FINANCING FEE OF 0.7 MILLION AS A NON-CASH
 CHARGE
 TO OTHER EXPENSE IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON
 THE
 ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE REDUCTION OF THE CONVERSION PRICE FROM 1.10 TO
 1.00 PER
 SHARE, WHICH WE ESTIMATED TO BE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE
 OF
 OUR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

INVESTING IN DXP INVOLVES RISK. IN DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN DXP, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. ANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OR MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. THEY COULD ALSO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT DXP. THESE FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND THE OTHER REPORTS AND MATERIALS FILED BY US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. FURTHER, MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE INTERRELATED AND COULD OCCUR UNDER SIMILAR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OF THEM MAY IN TURN CAUSE THE EMERGENCE OR EXACERBATE THE EFFECT OF OTHERS. SUCH A COMBINATION COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT OF THESE RISKS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

DECREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE DEPENDS UPON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE UPSTREAM, MIDSTREAM, AND DOWNSTREAM PHASES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. THEREFORE, A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMERS CAPITAL AND OTHER EXPENDITURES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES. 

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECREASE IF THE MANUFACTURERS OF THOSE PRODUCTS SELL THEM DIRECTLY TO END USERS. 

TYPICALLY, MRO PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURERS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. IF CUSTOMERS WERE TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, OR IF MANUFACTURERS SOUGHT TO INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO SELL DIRECTLY TO END USERS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SALES AND EARNINGS.

CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMER AND PRODUCT MIX, OR ADVERSE CHANGES TO THE COST OF GOODS WE SELL, COULD CAUSE OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO FLUCTUATE, OR DECREASE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HISTORICAL MARGINS. 

CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMER MIX HAVE RESULTED FROM GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, DAILY SELLING ACTIVITIES WITHIN CURRENT GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, AND TARGETED SELLING ACTIVITIES TO NEW CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT MIX HAVE RESULTED FROM MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEEDS COMMUNICATED TO US FROM EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HISTORICAL GROSS MARGINS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO PRICE INCREASES FROM VENDORS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG TO OUR CUSTOMERS . 

WE RELY UPON THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS FOR OUR MERCHANDISE SHIPMENTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED SHIPPING COSTS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL INABILITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. 

WE RELY UPON INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS FOR OUR MERCHANDISE SHIPMENTS, INCLUDING SHIPMENTS TO AND FROM ALL OF OUR SERVICE CENTERS. OUR UTILIZATION OF THESE DELIVERY SERVICES FOR SHIPMENTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES, LABOR AVAILABILITY, LABOR STRIKES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER, WHICH MAY IMPACT A SHIPPING COMPANY S ABILITY TO PROVIDE DELIVERY SERVICES THAT ADEQUATELY MEET OUR SHIPPING NEEDS. IF WE CHANGE THE SHIPPING COMPANIES WE USE, WE COULD FACE LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DELIVERIES AND WE WOULD INCUR COSTS AND EXPEND RESOURCES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH CHANGE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE TERMS AS WE HAVE WITH OUR CURRENT THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS. 

ADVERSE WEATHER EVENTS OR NATURAL DISASTERS COULD NEGATIVELY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. 

CERTAIN AREAS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, TORNADOES, FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES. THESE EVENTS CAN DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTIES AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LOCAL ECONOMIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY EXPERIENCE COMMUNICATION DISRUPTIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND EMPLOYEES. 

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT DAMAGE CAUSED BY THESE EVENTS WILL AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR THE ECONOMIES IN REGIONS WHERE WE OPERATE. THESE ADVERSE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION OF OUR PURCHASING OR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, INTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS THAT EXCEEDS OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, OUR INABILITY TO COLLECT FROM CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED OPERATING COSTS. OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE EVENTS. 

THE LOSS OF OR THE FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO GROW SUCCESSFULLY WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL. THE FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH PERSONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE LOSS OF ANY KEY SUPPLIER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DXP S SALES AND PROFITABILITY. 

WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES AND DEPEND ON THESE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. MANY OF THESE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS ARE PURSUANT TO CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION UPON LITTLE OR NO PRIOR NOTICE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD OBTAIN ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A CANCELLATION, THE TERMINATION OR LIMITATION BY ANY KEY SUPPLIER OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY COULD RESULT IN A TEMPORARY DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND, IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN EVERY JURISDICTION WHERE WE OPERATE. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, LABOR LAWS AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS AND INQUIRIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CHANGES TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS, AND SUCH COSTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ANY SUCH VIOLATIONS COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FINES AND PENALTIES MAY BE IMPOSED FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND THE FAILURE TO HAVE OR TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF REQUIRED PERMITS. THE FAILURE BY US TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE AND PERSONAL INJURY, REQUIREMENTS TO CLEAN UP PROPERTY OR TO PAY FOR THE COSTS OF CLEANUP, OR REGULATORY OR JUDICIAL ORDERS REQUIRING CORRECTIVE MEASURES. 

A GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT DXP S SALES GROWTH. 

ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY TRENDS AFFECT DXP S BUSINESS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC TRENDS AFFECTING OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THEY COMPETE IN PARTICULAR. MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY WHILE OTHERS, SUCH AS THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY, ARE CYCLICAL AND MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY. AS A RESULT, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE MARKETS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE TRADITIONALLY DO NOT ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. 

10 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES 

WE CONDUCT A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC, LEGAL, POLITICAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN COUNTRIES THAT WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN. WE HAVE MEANINGFUL OPERATIONS IN CANADA IN WHICH THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS DENOMINATED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS. AS THE VALUE OF CURRENCIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS INCREASE OR DECREASE RELATED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE SALES, EXPENSES, PROFITS, LOSSES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCREASE OR DECREASE, ACCORDINGLY. 

THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THIS AND OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUATION OF COMPANIES PERCEIVED BY INVESTORS TO BE COMPARABLE TO US. FURTHERMORE, THE STOCK MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED AND CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE MARKET PRICES OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF MANY COMPANIES. THESE FLUCTUATIONS OFTEN HAVE BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THOSE COMPANIES. THESE BROAD MARKET AND INDUSTRY FLUCTUATIONS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS RECESSIONS, INTEREST RATE CHANGES OR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN THE PAST, MANY COMPANIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR STOCK HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. SECURITIES LITIGATION AGAINST US COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR INTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY. 

OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING OUR INTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY, WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDING OUR EXISTING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, SELLING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ADDING NEW CUSTOMERS. OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY WILL DEPEND ON OUR SUCCESS IN SELLING MORE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS, ACQUIRING NEW CUSTOMERS, HIRING QUALIFIED SALES PERSONS, AND MARKETING INTEGRATED FORMS OF SUPPLY MANAGEMENT SUCH AS THOSE BEING PURSUED BY US THROUGH OUR SMARTSOURCE SM PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH WE INTEND TO INCREASE SALES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. WE COULD EXPERIENCE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM US. COMPETITION COULD ALSO CAUSE US TO LOWER OUR PRICES, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY. CONSOLIDATION IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD HEIGHTEN THE IMPACTS OF COMPETITION ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT TRADITIONALLY ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR COMPETITORS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERSONAL INJURY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS INVOLVING ALLEGEDLY DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. 

A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE ARE USED IN POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS THAT CAN RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. A CATASTROPHIC OCCURRENCE AT A LOCATION WHERE THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE ARE USED MAY RESULT IN US BEING NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ASSERTING POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS, EVEN THOUGH WE DID NOT MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY RENDER US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES WITHOUT REGARD TO NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT. 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION STRATEGY 

OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUMMATE ACQUISITIONS AT RATES SIMILAR TO THE PAST, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR GROWTH RATE AND STOCK PRICE. THIS STRATEGY INCLUDES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A CONSOLIDATION TREND IN THE INDUSTRY AND EFFECTING ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY OR DESIRABLE PRODUCT LINES, STRATEGIC DISTRIBUTION LOCATIONS, ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES OR MANUFACTURER RELATIONSHIPS. PROMISING ACQUISITIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING HIGH VALUATIONS, COMPETITION AMONG PROSPECTIVE BUYERS, THE NEED FOR REGULATORY (INCLUDING ANTITRUST) APPROVALS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE FUNDING IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITIONS IN OUR BUSINESS AREAS IS SIGNIFICANT AND MAY RESULT IN HIGHER PURCHASE PRICES. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR INSTABILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION, ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF SPECIAL RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS, DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION, FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS, DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PERSONNEL OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, POTENTIAL LOSS OF CUSTOMERS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, PRESERVING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED EVENTS OR LIABILITIES, AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OBSOLETE INVENTORY OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS, SOME OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO GROW AT OR ABOVE OUR HISTORIC RATES DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE AND INTEGRATE COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES AT APPROPRIATE PRICES AND REALIZE ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS. 

RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION FINANCING 

WE MAY NEED TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS BY USING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR A PORTION OR ALL OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMMON STOCK DOES NOT MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT MARKET VALUE, OR POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES ARE OTHERWISE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT COMMON STOCK AS PART OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE SALE OF THEIR BUSINESSES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE MORE OF OUR CASH RESOURCES, IF AVAILABLE, TO MAINTAIN OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM. THESE CASH RESOURCES MAY INCLUDE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS. OUR CURRENT CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH OUR BANK LENDERS CONTAINS CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT AND FINANCE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. SUCH RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE PROVISIONS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH, OR ACQUIRE ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE PROPERTIES OR CAPITAL STOCK OF, OTHER ENTITIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LENDERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE LENDER S CONSENT TO ANY OF OUR PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH RESOURCES, OUR GROWTH COULD BE LIMITED UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCINGS. 

11 

ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS OF CREDIT FACILITY 

OUR CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN SPECIFIED COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS, FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING TESTS. THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS WILL DEPEND ON ITS FUTURE PERFORMANCE, WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANY S CONTROL. A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH COULD PERMIT ACCELERATION OF THE COMPANY S INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH SOME OF THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY (RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MAINTENANCE OF PRESCRIBED FINANCIAL RATIOS) AND HAS, WHEN NECESSARY, OBTAINED WAIVERS OR AMENDMENTS TO THE COVENANTS FROM ITS LENDERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, OF THE CREDIT FACILITY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IN THE FUTURE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO OR, IF IS NOT ABLE TO DO SO, THAT ITS LENDERS WILL BE WILLING TO WAIVE SUCH COMPLIANCE OR FURTHER AMEND SUCH COVENANTS. 

ABILITY TO REFINANCE 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR THE TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE AS THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING DEBT. IF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DUE AT MATURITY CANNOT BE REFINANCED, EXTENDED OR REPAID WITH PROCEEDS FROM OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS NEW EQUITY CAPITAL, OUR CASH FLOW MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY ALL MATURING DEBT IN YEARS WHEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS COME DUE. 

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS COULD BECOME IMPAIRED. 

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND THE RELATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IMPAIRMENT MAY HAVE OCCURRED. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR COMBINED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMOUNTED TO 257.8 MILLION, NET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO RECOVER THE NET AMOUNT OF ANY INVESTMENTS IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED, THE INVESTMENT COULD BE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND SUBJECT TO WRITE-OFF WHICH WOULD DIRECTLY IMPACT EARNINGS. WE EXPECT TO RECORD ADDITIONAL GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS A RESULT OF FUTURE BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. FUTURE AMORTIZATION OF SUCH OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OR IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. 

OUR BUSINESS HAS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. 

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE WITH A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY DISTRIBUTORS, SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN US. ALTHOUGH MANY OF OUR TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION COMPETITORS ARE SMALL ENTERPRISES SELLING TO CUSTOMERS IN A LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREA, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH LARGER DISTRIBUTORS THAT PROVIDE INTEGRATED SUPPLY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE OFFERED THROUGH OUTSOURCING SERVICES SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT ARE OFFERED BY OUR SCS SEGMENT. SOME OF THESE LARGE DISTRIBUTORS MAY BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THEIR PRODUCTS IN A MORE TIMELY AND COST-EFFICIENT MANNER THAN US. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE CATALOG SUPPLIERS, LARGE WAREHOUSE STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CERTAIN MANUFACTURERS. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DXP S SALES AND PROFITABILITY. 

INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS COULD DISRUPT OPERATIONS AND CAUSE INCREASES IN COSTS AND/OR DECREASES IN REVENUES. 

THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF DXP S INFORMATION SYSTEMS IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH DXP S INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE PROTECTED THROUGH PHYSICAL AND SOFTWARE SAFEGUARDS AND REMOTE PROCESSING CAPABILITIES EXIST, OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE STILL VULNERABLE TO NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSSES, TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS. IF CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS FAIL OR ARE OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE, DXP S ABILITY TO PROCURE PRODUCTS TO SELL, PROCESS AND SHIP CUSTOMER ORDERS, IDENTIFY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, MAINTAIN PROPER LEVELS OF INVENTORIES, COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND EXPENSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE 

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE AT TIMES MAY BECOME THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS CLAIMS, LAWSUITS OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS SEEKING DAMAGES OR OTHER REMEDIES CONCERNING OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AS A RESULT OF THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE OR OUR OPERATIONS. SOME OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RELATE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED, EVEN THOUGH THESE ACTIVITIES MAY HAVE OCCURRED PRIOR TO ACQUISITION. THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, POLLUTION, DEATH OR LOSS OF PRODUCTION. ANY DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE, POLLUTION OR LOSS OF PRODUCTION. 

WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER POTENTIAL LOSSES, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS DEDUCTIBLES AND CAPS UNDER OUR INSURANCE. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT JUDGMENTS COULD BE RENDERED AGAINST US IN CASES IN WHICH WE WOULD BE UNINSURED AND BEYOND THE AMOUNTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE RESERVED OR ANTICIPATE INCURRING FOR SUCH MATTERS. EVEN A PARTIALLY UNINSURED CLAIM, IF SUCCESSFUL AND OF SIGNIFICANT SIZE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE, AND WE MAY INCUR LOSSES FROM INTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS THAT EXCEED OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN CASES WHERE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE, OUR INSURERS MAY RAISE VARIOUS OBJECTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS TO COVERAGE WHICH COULD MAKE UNCERTAIN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF ANY POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERY. 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER-SECURITY 

THROUGH OUR SALES CHANNELS, AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY, WE COLLECT AND MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE TO US IN ORDER TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE ALSO ACQUIRE AND RETAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SUPPLIERS AND EMPLOYEES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. COMPUTER HACKERS MAY ATTEMPT TO PENETRATE OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR OUR VENDORS' INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, MISAPPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER, EMPLOYEE OR OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTY MAY ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT SECURITY MEASURES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUCH INFORMATION OR INADVERTENTLY CAUSE A BREACH INVOLVING SUCH INFORMATION. LOSS OF INFORMATION COULD EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REGULATORS, PAYMENT CARD ASSOCIATIONS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PERSONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS . 

 CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE THE SECOND
AND THIRD LARGEST MARKETS IN THE GLOBAL ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY, ACCOUNTING
FOR AN ESTIMATED 44 OF THE GLOBAL MARKET. APPROXIMATELY 4.2 BILLION
POUNDS OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS WERE PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IN 2006,
REPRESENTING A 4 COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM 2001.
THERE IS NO RELIABLE INDUSTRY DATA FOR THE CHINESE MARKET, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT
APPROXIMATELY 4.8 BILLION POUNDS OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS WERE PRODUCED IN
THAT MARKET IN 2006, AND THAT IT HAS EXPERIENCED A FASTER GROWTH RATE THAN THE
U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKET IN RECENT YEARS. 

 DESPITE RECENT CONSOLIDATION, THE U.S. AND CANADIAN
MARKET REMAINS FRAGMENTED, WITH APPROXIMATELY FIVE TO SEVEN LARGE ALUMINUM
EXTRUDERS SHIPPING OVER 200 MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR WORLDWIDE AND AN
ESTIMATED 120 TO 150 SMALL TO MID-SIZED REGIONAL ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS SHIPPING
LESSER AMOUNTS. GIVEN THE COST OF FREIGHT, SMALL TO MID-SIZED COMPETITORS GENERALLY
COMPETE FOR SMALLER VOLUME ORDERS WITH CUSTOMERS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC REACH.
THEY DO NOT BENEFIT FROM SCALE ADVANTAGES, AND GENERALLY HAVE A HIGHER COST
STRUCTURE THAN LARGER COMPETITORS. 

 WE ESTIMATE THE DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS IN THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADA FELL BY APPROXIMATELY 2 IN 2006, MEASURED BY SHIPMENT
VOLUME. THIS DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY AND
THE INCREASING ABILITY OF ALUMINUM TO BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER RAW
MATERIALS, PRIMARILY STEEL, WHICH HAS A LESS ATTRACTIVE STRENGTH TO WEIGHT
RATIO. 

 IN 2006, APPROXIMATELY 9 
OF THE TOTAL ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS, MEASURED BY SHIPMENT VOLUME, SOLD IN THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADA WERE IMPORTED FROM CHINA. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS
PERCENTAGE TO GROW OVER THE LONG TERM, WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS
THAT WILL LIMIT THE PENETRATION OF CHINESE IMPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES AND
CANADA. FIRST, SAVINGS IN LABOR AND MANUFACTURING COSTS MUST OFFSET SIGNIFICANT
INCREMENTAL FREIGHT AND DUTY COSTS. SECOND, OUTSOURCING TO CHINA IS LESS COST
EFFECTIVE IN THE PRODUCTION OF LOW VOLUME, CUSTOMIZED EXTRUSIONS. THIRD,
CERTAIN TYPES OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS DO NOT FIT EASILY OR AT ALL INTO STANDARD
SHIPPING CONTAINERS, MAKING IT IMPRACTICAL TO IMPORT THEM TO THE UNITED STATES
AND CANADA. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
OUTSOURCE CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE THESE CONSTRAINTS WILL LIMIT THE
THREAT OF LOSING U.S. CUSTOMERS TO CHINESE EXTRUDERS. 

10 

PROCESSES 

 WE OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING ALUMINUM
EXTRUSION, FABRICATION, PAINTING AND ANODIZING. IN 2006, APPROXIMATELY 94 OF
OUR PRODUCTS WERE CUSTOMIZED, MADE-TO-ORDER ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS FOR
USE IN A WIDE ARRAY OF END-USER MARKETS. 

 THE FIGURE BELOW
ILLUSTRATES THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PROCESS. OUR OPERATIONS ARE REPRESENTED BY
THE AREA SURROUNDED BY A DASHED LINE. 

ALUMINUM EXTRUSION. ALUMINUM
EXTRUSION IS THE PROCESS OF SHAPING ALUMINUM INTO PRODUCTS OR COMPONENT PARTS
BY HEATING IT AND FORCING IT TO FLOW THROUGH A SHAPED DIE AT THE END OF AN
EXTRUSION PRESS. IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PROCESS, AN ALUMINUM BILLET IS FIRST
HEATED TO APPROXIMATELY 900 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, PLACED INTO AN EXTRUSION PRESS,
AND THEN FORCED, OR EXTRUDED, THROUGH A UNIQUELY SHAPED DIE TO PRODUCE A PIECE
OF METAL IN THE SHAPE OF THE DIE. MOST OF THE EXTRUSIONS WE PRODUCE FOR OUR
CUSTOMERS HAVE THEIR OWN STEEL DIE DESIGNED ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY 45,000 DIES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. EXTRUSIONS ARE
THEN STRAIGHTENED BY STRETCHING AND CUT TO THE REQUIRED LENGTHS WHICH RANGE
FROM A FEW INCHES TO MORE THAN 50 FEET. MOST EXTRUSIONS ARE HARDENED BY AGING
IN LARGE OVENS FOR APPROXIMATELY SIX TO 12 HOURS WHERE THEY ARE RE-HEATED
TO A TEMPERATURE OF APPROXIMATELY 400 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. THESE EXTRUSIONS ARE
THEN PACKAGED AND SHIPPED, OR RECEIVE ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER SERVICES WE
PROVIDE, SUCH AS FABRICATION, PAINTING OR ANODIZING AS SPECIFIED BY THE
CUSTOMER. TYPICALLY, 75 OF THE RESULTS OF THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PROCESS ARE
SALABLE PRODUCTS, AND THE REMAINING 25 ARE ALUMINUM SCRAP, WHICH WE EITHER
RECAST INTO ALUMINUM BILLET IN ONE OF OUR TWO CASTING FACILITIES OR SELL ON THE
OPEN MARKET TO METAL DEALERS. 

 WE OFFER BOTH CUSTOM AND STANDARD ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS
IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SHAPES, INCLUDING SOLID, SEMI-HOLLOW AND HOLLOW
DESIGNS. THESE SHAPES ARE OFFERED AS ELONGATED PRODUCTS OR SHORT PARTS CUT FROM

11 

LENGTHY LONGER EXTRUSIONS,
AND CAN BE PRODUCED WITH CONSIDERABLE PRECISION AND TIGHT TOLERANCES. IF A
CUSTOMER NEEDS A CUSTOMIZED SHAPE, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ENGINEER A DIE
THAT WILL MEET THE SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PARTS THAT HINGE,
INTERLOCK OR SELF-ASSEMBLE. 

 WE REFER TO BOTH CUSTOM AND STANDARD ALUMINUM
EXTRUSIONS THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OF OUR VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AS MILL
FINISH EXTRUSIONS. MILL FINISH EXTRUSIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 57 OF OUR
SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND 59 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006. APPROXIMATELY
43 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND 41 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006
UNDERWENT AN ADDITIONAL FABRICATION, PAINTING OR ANODIZING PROCESS. 

 FABRICATED
COMPONENTS. ONCE THE ALUMINUM BILLET HAS BEEN
SHAPED THROUGH THE EXTRUSION PROCESS, IT IS OFTEN FABRICATED TO MAKE THE RAW
METAL SUITABLE FOR THE END USER. WE USE A VARIETY OF FABRICATION PROCESSES,
INCLUDING CUTTING, PUNCHING, NOTCHING, BENDING, DRILLING, TIGHT TOLERANCE
CUTTING, COMPUTERIZED NUMERICAL CONTROL, MACHINING AND MANUAL AND ROBOTIC
WELDING AND ASSEMBLY TO SERVE A CUSTOMIZED NEED OR FIT A CERTAIN USE. WE HAVE
THE FABRICATION KNOWLEDGE AND FACILITIES TO TRANSFORM EXTRUDED ALUMINUM INTO
PRECISELY ENGINEERED COMPONENTS. EXAMPLES OF FABRICATED PRODUCTS INCLUDE A
SIMPLE CUT-TO-LENGTH EXTRUSION NOTCHED AND PUNCHED FOR USE AS A
DOOR FRAME, A STEP ASSEMBLY FOR A TRUCK CAB, A CURVED AND FULLY FORMED TRIM CAP
FOR USE ON AN OFFICE PARTITION AND COMPONENTS USED IN HEAT SINKS FOR USE IN KEY
ELECTRONICS. OUR FABRICATION CAPABILITIES RANGE FROM ASSISTANCE WITH CONCEPT
DESIGN TO THE DELIVERY OF A FINISHED, READY-TO-ASSEMBLE PART. WE
BELIEVE OUR FABRICATION OPERATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE TO CUSTOMERS INTERESTED IN
OUTSOURCING CERTAIN MANUFACTURING IN ORDER TO BETTER CONTROL OPERATING COSTS,
MANAGE INVENTORY OR ACCOMMODATE GROWTH. APPROXIMATELY 11 OF OUR SHIPMENT
VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006 UNDERWENT A FABRICATION PROCESS. 

 OUR MILL FINISH EXTRUSIONS AND FABRICATED COMPONENTS
CAN THEN BE EITHER PAINTED OR ANODIZED. 

 PAINT SERVICES. WE BELIEVE WE
ARE THE LEADING PAINTER OF EXTRUDED ALUMINUM IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA
ACCORDING TO ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS COUNCIL DATA AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE HAVE
NINE WET PAINT LINES IN OUR FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE
MAJORITY OF OUR PAINT LINES HAVE MULTIPLE PAINT BOOTHS, PROVIDING QUICK
THROUGHPUT FOR MULTI-COAT APPLICATIONS SUCH AS KYNAR , A HIGH
VALUE-ADDED WET PAINT USED IN COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION
APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPLY SMALL BATCHES OF CUSTOM COLOR OR
HIGH VOLUME RUNS ON STANDARD COLORS, USING A WIDE VARIETY OF TYPES OF LIQUID
PAINT FROM ACRYLIC TO POLYESTER TO FLUOROPOLYMER FINISHERS. WET PAINT S PRIMARY
ADVANTAGE IS ITS ABILITY TO BE CUSTOM MADE TO MEET THE SPECIFIC COLOR AND
DURABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 28 OF OUR SHIPMENT
VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006 WAS PAINTED IN ONE OF OUR PAINTING FACILITIES. 

 WE HAVE INSTALLED IN OUR GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA
FACILITY, WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST VERTICAL POWDER COAT PAINT
LINES IN THE UNITED STATES. POWDER PAINT IS MORE DURABLE THAN WET PAINT AND
WILL PERMIT OUR DOOR AND WINDOW CUSTOMERS TO OFFER LONGER WARRANTIES AT A LOWER
PRICE. IN POWDER COATING, A POWDERED PAINT IS SPRAYED AND BONDED
ELECTROSTATICALLY. WE HAVE A PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE LEADING GLOBAL
PAINT AND COATING MANUFACTURERS TO SUPPLY US WITH POWDER PAINT. WE ARE JOINTLY
DEVELOPING AND CO-BRANDING A SPECIALLY FORMULATED HIGH-PERFORMANCE
POWDER THAT REQUIRES ONLY ONE COAT COMPARED TO UP TO FOUR COATS FOR WET PAINTS.
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENT, THE SUPPLIER WILL CO-INVEST IN
THE POWDER PAINT LINE AND THEIR INVESTMENT WILL BE REPAID QUARTERLY OVER FIVE
YEARS. 

 ANODIZING SERVICES. ANODIZING IS
AN ELECTRO-CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT CONVERTS ALUMINUM SURFACE INTO ALUMINUM
OXIDE, A CERAMIC-LIKE MATERIAL. WE OFFER A RANGE OF ANODIZING
CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING BASIC ETCHING, ARCHITECTURAL ANODIZING AND BRIGHT DIP,
A TYPE OF ANODIZING WHICH PROVIDES A POLISHED, MIRRORED FINISH IN A VARIETY OF
COLORS. WE HAVE FOUR ANODIZING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, EACH WITH A
RANGE OF CAPABILITIES. FOR HIGH VALUE-ADDED SUB-SEGMENTS SUCH AS
SHOWER AND TUB ENCLOSURES, WE PRODUCE NUMEROUS SPECIALTY FINISHES, SUCH AS
CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL BUFFING AND POLISHING, AND MECHANICAL GRAINING AND
SANDING. WE ALSO PRODUCE A BRUSHED NICKEL FINISH THAT REPLICATES THE POPULAR
LOOK OF STAINLESS STEEL AT A LOWER COST. APPROXIMATELY 8 OF OUR SHIPMENT
VOLUME IN 2005 AND 7 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006 UNDERWENT AN ANODIZING
PROCESS.

TRANSPORTATION (NON-AUTOMOTIVE). WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS FOR TRUCK TRAILERS, TRUCK BODIES, RECREATIONAL VEHICLES, RAILCARS,
DELIVERY VEHICLES, VAN CONVERSIONS, EMERGENCY VEHICLES, MILITARY VEHICLES,
LIVESTOCK TRAILERS AND MOTOR HOMES TO MANUFACTURERS OF VEHICLES AND THEIR
SUPPLIERS. OUR PRINCIPAL FOCUS IS ON TRUCK TRAILER AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE
MANUFACTURING, AND WE PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO MOST MAJOR TRAILER AND RECREATIONAL
VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS SOLD
TO TRAILER AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 75 
OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME WITHIN THIS END-USER MARKET IN 2005 AND 80 OF OUR
SHIPMENT VOLUME WITHIN THIS END-USER MARKET IN 2006. TRANSPORTATION WAS THE
FASTEST GROWING OF OUR END-USER MARKETS IN 2005 ACCORDING TO DATA
COMPILED BY THE ALUMINUM ASSOCIATION. THESE CUSTOMERS HAVE MULTIPLE PRODUCTION
LOCATIONS AND TYPICALLY REQUIRE THEIR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE MANUFACTURING
CAPABILITIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEIR LOCATION. WE BELIEVE RECENT INCREASES
IN STEEL AND FUEL PRICES HAVE CAUSED MANUFACTURERS TO FIND WAYS TO USE ALUMINUM
AS A CHEAPER AND LIGHTER SUBSTITUTE FOR STEEL. FOR EXAMPLE, BY SUBSTITUTING
ALUMINUM FOR STEEL, TRAILER MANUFACTURERS CAN INCREASE THE FUEL EFFICIENCY OF
THEIR TRAILERS AS INCREASED ALUMINUM CONTENT REDUCES THE WEIGHT OF A TRAILER,
WHICH IN TURN REDUCES FUEL COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CUSTOMERS IN THE
TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER END-USER MARKETS WE SERVE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND
NEW WAYS TO REPLACE HEAVIER, MORE EXPENSIVE STEEL COMPONENTS WITH ALUMINUM. OUR
PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE TRANSPORTATION END-USER MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR
APPROXIMATELY 30 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND 31 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME
IN 2006, AND 26 AND 28 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006. 

 WE BELIEVE THE RECENT
INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS
IN THE TRANSPORTATION END-USER MARKET TO SUBSTITUTE ALUMINUM FOR STEEL IN
CERTAIN APPLICATIONS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR
ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS. 

 RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION. WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS FOR NEW AND REPLACEMENT WINDOWS, STORM DOOR FRAMES, STORM SHUTTERS,
RAILINGS, STRUCTURAL BEAMS, PATIO ENCLOSURES, SUNROOMS, SKY LIGHTS, TUB 

13 

ENCLOSURES,
HURRICANE SECURITY SHELTERS, BOAT DOCKS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FOR MANUFACTURERS,
ASSEMBLERS AND CONTRACTORS IN THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION MARKET.
COMPONENTS USED IN DOORS AND WINDOWS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 57 AND 55 OF
OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME WITHIN THIS END-USER MARKET IN 2005 AND IN 2006.
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION REPRESENTED THE SECOND LARGEST END-USER MARKET
FOR ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS IN 2005 ACCORDING TO DATA COMPILED BY THE ALUMINUM
ASSOCIATION AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. TYPICALLY, ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PRODUCTS
FOR THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION END-USER MARKET HAVE HIGHER
MARGINS AND ARE SUBJECT TO LOWER RISK OF SUBSTITUTION DUE TO THE BUYERS 
PRODUCT ORIENTATION AND ALUMINUM S HIGH TOLERANCE REQUIREMENTS. OUR PRODUCTS
SOLD TO THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION END-USER MARKET
ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 28 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006, AND
29 AND 28 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006. 

 COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION. WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS FOR REPLACEMENT WINDOWS, WALL PARTITIONS, DOOR FRAMES, BALCONY
RAILINGS, STRUCTURAL BEAMS, SKYLIGHTS, CURTAIN WALL AND STORE FRONTS TO
MANUFACTURERS, ASSEMBLERS AND CONTRACTORS FOR USE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. SIMILAR TO THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION END-USER
MARKET, ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PRODUCTS FOR THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND
CONSTRUCTION END-USER MARKET TYPICALLY HAVE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE MARGINS.
OUR PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION END-USER
MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN
2006, AND 8 AND 7 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006. 

 ELECTRIC AND CABLE. WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS FOR HEAT SINKS, CABLE SHEATHING, CONDUIT, LIGHTING FIXTURES AND
ELECTRICAL FIXTURES TO ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND UTILITIES. WE
HAVE BEEN SELLING BRANDED ALUMINUM CONDUIT, WHICH IS THE METAL PIPE USED TO
ENCLOSE ELECTRICAL WIRE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FIRE CODE REGULATIONS,
UNDER THE INDALEX RIGID ALUMINUM CONDUIT PRIVATE LABEL, FOR APPROXIMATELY
25 YEARS. HISTORICALLY, ALUMINUM CONDUIT HAD NOT BEEN PRICE COMPETITIVE
WITH STEEL CONDUIT, BUT RECENT RISES IN STEEL COSTS AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
BENEFITS OF ALUMINUM HAVE INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF ALUMINUM CONDUIT IN
COMMERCIAL MARKETS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SUPERIOR CORROSION RESISTANCE AND LONGER
USABLE PRODUCT LIFE, AND ITS MATERIAL COSTS ARE UP TO APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 50 
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN RIGID STEEL. IN ADDITION, DUE TO ALUMINUM S LIGHTER WEIGHT
AND EASE OF HANDLING, THE COST OF INSTALLATION LABOR IS UP TO 35 LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN RIGID STEEL. CABLE SHEATHING IS USED AS THE PROTECTIVE COVER FOR
UNDERGROUND CABLE SYSTEMS AND HAS VERY LITTLE SUBSTITUTION RISK BECAUSE IT IS
THIN WALLED AND FLEXIBLE, WHICH FACILITATES INSTALLATION. THE INHERENT
ADVANTAGES OF ALUMINUM, SUCH AS ITS WEIGHT TO STRENGTH RATIO AND ITS CORROSION
RESISTANCE, ARE ADDITIONAL FACTORS REDUCING ALUMINUM S SUBSTITUTION RISK IN
CABLE SHEATHING. OUR PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE ELECTRICAL AND CABLE END-USER
MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND 7 OF
OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006, AND 8 AND 7 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN
2006. 

 CONSUMER DURABLES. WE TYPICALLY
PROVIDE COMPONENTS FOR OFFICE FURNITURE AND PARTITIONS, REFRIGERATORS, BOATS,
HEALTHCARE EQUIPMENT AND SPORTING AND ATHLETIC GOODS TO MANUFACTURERS AND
ASSEMBLERS OF CONSUMER GOODS. THESE CUSTOMERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING ALUMINUM
TO GIVE THEIR PRODUCTS A DECORATIVE APPEARANCE WHILE IMPROVING RESISTANCE TO
CORROSION AND MECHANICAL WEAR. THE ALUMINUM CONTENT IN EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS
TENDS TO BE LOW, AND CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY LESS CONCERNED WITH PRICE AND MORE
CONCERNED WITH ON-TIME DELIVERY. WE SERVE A MAJORITY OF THESE CUSTOMERS
THROUGH OUR INDALEX DIRECT PROGRAM, WHICH FOCUSES ON CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE
LOW VOLUMES OF EXTRUSIONS AND PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON QUALITY AND ON-TIME
DELIVERY THAN ON PRICE SENSITIVITY. OUR PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE CONSUMER DURABLES
END-USER MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN
2005 AND IN 2006, AND 6 AND 7 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006. 

 MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS FOR LADDERS, SCAFFOLDS AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT SUCH AS CONVEYORS TO
MANUFACTURERS OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF
FABRICATION WORK REQUIRED FOR THESE PRODUCTS, AND, AS A RESULT, THERE IS
TYPICALLY A LONG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO DESIGN THE EXTRUSION TO BE USED IN
MANUFACTURING MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. OUR ENGINEERING TEAM WORKS WITH THE
CUSTOMER TO DEVELOP PRODUCT DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS. OUR PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE
MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT END-USER MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 
AND 5 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006, AND 6 AND 5 OF OUR NET
SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006.

AUTOMOTIVE. WE PROVIDE
COMPONENTS TO SUPPLIERS WHO PRODUCE COMPONENT SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMOBILE AND LIGHT
TRUCK MANUFACTURERS. WHILE THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET IS NOT A PRIMARY FOCUS FOR
INDALEX, WE SELECTIVELY PURSUE NICHE AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS WHERE WE CAN
PROVIDE HIGHER MARGIN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS SOLD TO
AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2 OF OUR
SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006, AND 2 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN
2006. 

 DISTRIBUTION. WE ALSO SHIP
PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, WHO IN TURN SELL THOSE PRODUCTS TO END USERS.
THESE PRODUCTS ARE BOTH STANDARD ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS SUCH AS ROD, BAR, ANGLES,
CHANNELS AND TUBES AND CUSTOM ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS. THE DISTRIBUTORS OF STANDARD
ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS TYPICALLY SELL TO SMALL END USERS, WHO MAY BUY AS LITTLE AS
50 POUNDS AT A TIME, PROVIDING A VALUABLE STOCK CARRYING SERVICE. THE
DISTRIBUTORS OF CUSTOM ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS PROVIDE AGGREGATING SERVICES SUCH AS
SHORT LEAD TIMES, CREDIT OR, IN SOME CASES, VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS
PAINTING OR FABRICATING. OUR PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS ACCOUNTED FOR
APPROXIMATELY 14 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2005 AND IN 2006, AND 14 OF OUR
NET SALES IN 2005 AND IN 2006. 

 CUSTOMERS 

 WE SERVE OVER 3,500
CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ACCOUNTS.
OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 6 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND
2006, AND OUR TOP 10 CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 28 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005 AND 29 
OF OUR NET SALES IN 2006. 

 WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON
CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT INNOVATION, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAVE HELPED US TO
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS VARIOUS END-USER
MARKETS. WE DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING THEM A NETWORK
OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, DEVELOPING
CUSTOMIZED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AND FOCUSING OUR SALES EFFORTS AT THE
CUSTOMER LEVEL. WE HAVE SPECIFIC DIES, PAINT COLORS AND OTHER CUSTOM FEATURES
FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS FOR MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE
WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS, AND WE OFTEN RETOOL OUR
FACILITIES TO PROVIDE A CUSTOMIZED SET OF SOLUTIONS. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS IN
2006 HAVE BEEN PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS FOR AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS. WE
SELL STANDARD ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS FOR USE IN A WIDE
VARIETY OF END-USER MARKETS. 

 DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF
MADE-TO-ORDER BUSINESS OUR STOCKING REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT ORDER FULFILLMENT
ARE MINIMAL. THE CUSTOMER S RIGHT TO RETURN RELATES TO PRODUCTION DEFECTS OR
VARIANCES FROM SPECIFICATION THAT ARE TO BE REPORTED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF
SHIPMENT. STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE ALSO 30 DAYS FROM SHIPMENT. 

 RAW MATERIALS 

 ALUMINUM 

 OUR PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIAL
IS ALUMINUM BILLET PURCHASED ON THE OPEN MARKET OR SUPPLIED BY ONE OF OUR TWO
CASTING FACILITIES, WHICH USE ALUMINUM SCRAP AND INGOT TO PRODUCE BILLET.
ALUMINUM IS A COMMODITY AND, AS SUCH, HAS A VALUE BASED UPON A VARIETY OF
MARKET DRIVEN FACTORS. THE PRICE OF ALUMINUM INGOT IS PRIMARILY SET BY SUPPLY
AND DEMAND ON THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE, OR THE LME. LIKE MANY EXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITIES,
THE PRICE IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FLUCTUATION IN THE SHORT-TERM, OFTEN DUE
TO THE ACTIONS OF COMMODITY MARKET SPECULATORS. ALUMINUM BILLET AND INGOT
REPRESENTED 596.2 MILLION OR 63 OF OUR COST OF SALES IN 2005 AND 763.9 MILLION
OR 66 OF OUR COST OF SALES IN 2006. ALUMINUM SCRAP IS GENERATED IN OUR
EXTRUSION OPERATIONS AND IS USED, TOGETHER WITH PURCHASES OF ALUMINUM INGOT
FROM THIRD PARTIES, IN OUR CASTING FACILITIES TO MANUFACTURE ALUMINUM BILLETS. 

 WE HAVE ALUMINUM BILLET
CASTING CAPABILITY AT TWO CASTING FACILITIES. IN 2005, WE SOLD APPROXIMATELY
12 , OR 23 MILLION POUNDS, OF OUR MANUFACTURED BILLET TO THIRD PARTY CUSTOMERS,
WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2005. IN 2006, WE SOLD
APPROXIMATELY 10 , OR 19 MILLION POUNDS, OF OUR MANUFACTURED BILLET TO THIRD
PARTY CUSTOMERS, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2006.
THE FIRST STEP IN THE CASTING PROCESS IS TO MELT PRIMARY ALUMINUM INGOT AND
ALUMINUM SCRAP IN A LARGE FURNACE. MOLTEN ALUMINUM MUST BE AT LEAST 10 TO 15 
ALUMINUM INGOT WITH APPROXIMATELY 80 TO 90 ALUMINUM SCRAP TO MEET THE PURITY
REQUIREMENT FOR 6000 SERIES SOFT ALLOY ALUMINUM. THE MOLTEN ALUMINUM 

15 

IS
EITHER DIRECTLY ALLOYED IN THE FURNACE OR TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FURNACE WHERE
THE ALLOYING MATERIALS ARE ADDED. THE ALUMINUM IS THEN CAST INTO LOGS OF
VARYING DIAMETERS WITH LENGTHS OF UP TO 16 FEET. THESE LOGS ARE HEATED AND THEN
COOLED AT A CONTROLLED RATE TO ALLOW THE CAST ALUMINUM TO ACHIEVE THE OPTIMALLY
DISTRIBUTED CHEMICAL COMPOSITION FOR EXTRUSION. AFTERWARDS, THE ALUMINUM LOGS
ARE EITHER CUT INTO SHORTER LENGTHS CALLED ALUMINUM BILLETS, THE PRIMARY RAW
MATERIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS, OR TRANSFERRED TO OUR
EXTRUSION PLANT IN LOG FORM FOR SUBSEQUENT PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS AS
WELL AS TO THIRD PARTY CUSTOMERS. OUR IN-HOUSE BILLET CASTING
CAPABILITIES SUPPLIED US WITH APPROXIMATELY 21 OF OUR ALUMINUM BILLET NEEDS IN
2005 AND IN 2006. 

 WE SEEK TO REDUCE OUR
EXPOSURE TO THE VOLATILITY IN BASE ALUMINUM PRICES BY PASSING COST INCREASES
THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS OR BY HEDGING AGAINST COMMITTED FIXED PRICE SALES. WE
LIMIT OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES TO COMMITTED PURCHASES AND SALES AND DO NOT ENGAGE
IN SPECULATIVE HEDGING. WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN INVENTORY AT LEVELS CONSISTENT
WITH OPERATING NEEDS THROUGH CENTRALIZED PURCHASING AND LOGISTICS. 

 ELECTRICITY AND
NATURAL GAS 

 WE USE ELECTRICITY AND
NATURAL GAS TO HEAT ALUMINUM BILLETS AS PART OF THE EXTRUSION PROCESS. WE ALSO
USE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AT OUR CASTING FACILITIES TO PRODUCE ALUMINUM
BILLETS. WE PURCHASE NATURAL GAS USED FOR HEATING DURING THE EXTRUSION PROCESS
FROM A THIRD PARTY USING 36-MONTH FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS THAT WE
ENTER INTO ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THIS HEDGING PROGRAM HAS INSULATED US FROM
RECENT INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS PRICES. WE PURCHASE A PORTION OF OUR
ELECTRICITY REQUIREMENTS PURSUANT TO LONG TERM CONTRACTS IN THE REGIONS IN WHICH
WE OPERATE. A NUMBER OF OUR FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REGIONS WITH REGULATED
PRICES. WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY 25.9 MILLION ON ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL
GAS IN 2005, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2.7 OF OUR COST OF SALES FOR THAT
YEAR, AND 31.2 MILLION IN 2006, WHICH REPRESENTED 2.7 OF OUR COST OF SALES
FOR THAT PERIOD. 

 PAINT 

 WE PURCHASE PAINT FOR USE
IN OUR PAINTING OPERATION IN SEVEN OF OUR FACILITIES. PAINT IS CURRENTLY
PURCHASED IN LIQUID FORM AND APPLIED BY SPRAYING IN LARGE VERTICAL PAINT
BOOTHS. WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY 9.2 MILLION ON PAINT IN 2005, WHICH
REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1 OF OUR COST OF SALES FOR THAT YEAR, AND
APPROXIMATELY 12.8 MILLION IN 2006, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1 OF OUR COST OF SALES FOR THAT
PERIOD. 

 PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS 

 OUR PRINCIPAL RAW
MATERIAL, ALUMINUM BILLET, IS A GLOBAL COMMODITY AND IS WIDELY AVAILABLE. THERE
ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF GLOBAL, LARGE SCALE ALUMINUM BILLET SUPPLIERS FOR THE
EXTRUSION INDUSTRY. WE PURCHASE OUR ALUMINUM BILLET FROM APPROXIMATELY 15
DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING SUPPLIERS IN THE UNITED STATES,
CANADA, SOUTH AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, INCLUDING THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
AND BAHRAIN. APPROXIMATELY 76 OF OUR ALUMINUM BILLET THAT WE PURCHASED FROM
THIRD PARTIES WAS PURCHASED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IN 2006. WE
PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 14 OF OUR ALUMINUM BILLET REQUIREMENTS THAT WE
PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN 2006. WE
PURCHASED 63 OF OUR ANNUAL ALUMINUM BILLET REQUIREMENTS FROM FIVE SUPPLIERS IN
2006. OUR LARGEST BILLET SUPPLIER IS ALCOA INC. WHICH REPRESENTED 26 OF
OUR ALUMINUM BILLET SUPPLY IN 2006. WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 650 MILLION
POUNDS OF ALUMINUM BILLET FROM THIRD PARTIES IN 2006, WHICH PERMITS US TO
MAINTAIN NUMEROUS STRATEGIC SOURCING ARRANGEMENTS AND CAPITALIZE ON REGIONAL
PRICE AND SUPPLY IMBALANCES AND SOURCE LOW COST ALUMINUM BILLET WITHOUT
SACRIFICING QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, OUR INTERNAL CASTING CAPABILITIES, WHICH
PROVIDE LOW COST BILLET BY CONVERTING PRODUCTION SCRAP GENERATED THROUGH THE
EXTRUSION PROCESS, PROVIDED 21 OF OUR TOTAL ALUMINUM BILLET SUPPLY IN 2006.
THE CASTING FACILITIES PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY OF SUPPLY DURING PERIODS OF
ALUMINUM BILLET SHORTAGES. 

 OUR LARGEST SUPPLIER OF
LIQUID PAINT, PPG INDUSTRIES, PROVIDES US WITH APPROXIMATELY 90 OF OUR PAINT
REQUIREMENTS. OUR CONTRACT WITH PPG INDUSTRIES EXPIRES IN 2008. WE PURCHASE
PAINT FROM THREE OTHER SUPPLIERS, AND SINCE LIQUID PAINT IS LARGELY A
COMMODITY, WE CAN SHIFT OUR PURCHASES AMONG SUPPLIERS.

ASIA ALUMINUM GROUP 

 WE HAVE AN 25.01 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASIA ALUMINUM
GROUP LIMITED, OR AAG, BY VIRTUE OF AN INVESTMENT DECISION BY A PRIOR OWNER.
OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT PARTNER, ASIA ALUMINUM HOLDINGS LIMITED, OR AAH, WAS
FOUNDED IN 1992 AND WAS A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY LISTED ON THE MAIN BOARD OF
THE STOCK EXCHANGE OF HONG KONG, UNTIL THE PRIVATIZATION DISCUSSED BELOW TOOK
PLACE. AAG IS RECOGNIZED BY THE MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION OF CHINA AS ONE OF THE
LARGEST INVESTOR-OWNED ALUMINUM EXTRUSION BUSINESSES IN ASIA AND SERVES
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORTATION, INDUSTRIAL AND HOME IMPROVEMENT END-USER
MARKETS IN CHINA, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE PACIFIC RIM. AAG CURRENTLY
OPERATES FIVE PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN NANHAI IN CHINA S GUANGDONG PROVINCE WITH
AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF 150,000 METRIC TONS PER YEAR. AAG IS STARTING UP A NEW
FACILITY IN THE NEIGHBORING CITY ZHAOQING, WHICH WILL INCLUDE MODERN EXTRUSION
AND CASTING EQUIPMENT AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS EXTRUSION CAPACITY TO
300,000 METRIC TONS PER YEAR. 

 WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE ANY CONTROL
OVER THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF AAG THROUGH OUR MINORITY
OWNERSHIP INTEREST. HOWEVER, SO LONG AS WE RETAIN AT LEAST A 10 OWNERSHIP
INTEREST OF AAG, CERTAIN SPECIFIED ACTIONS BY AAG REQUIRE OUR PRIOR APPROVAL.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE MUST APPROVE ANY ISSUANCE OF ANY NEW SHARES OR SECURITIES, ANY
CHANGES TO THE AUTHORIZED OR ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL, THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL
DEBT THAT WOULD CAUSE AAG S AGGREGATE DEBT TO EXCEED HK 10.0 MILLION AND
ANY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN AGGREGATE THAT EXCEED HK 15.0 MILLION. IF A
DISAGREEMENT ARISES BETWEEN US AND AAH WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION REQUIRING OUR
CONSENT, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THIS DISAGREEMENT, WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SELL OUR ENTIRE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AAG TO AAH. IN THE EVENT WE EXERCISE
THIS RIGHT, AAH WILL PURCHASE OUR SHARES OF AAG AT A PRICE AGREED UPON BY US
AND AAH, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, AT A PRICE DETERMINED BY AN
INDEPENDENT INTERNATIONAL FIRM OF ACCOUNTANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF
THE AAG SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT. IF AAG COMMITS A MATERIAL BREACH OF THE
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT AND DOES NOT REMEDY THE BREACH WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER WE
SERVE A DEFAULT NOTICE, WE MAY EXERCISE A CALL OPTION TO PURCHASE ALL OF AAH S
SHARE OF AAG AT 95 OF THEIR FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY AN INTERNATIONAL FIRM
OF ACCOUNTANTS. IF AAG INCURS ADDITIONAL DEBT THAT DOES NOT CAUSE AAG S
AGGREGATE DEBT TO EXCEED HK 10.0 MILLION, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO
GUARANTEE OUR PRO RATA SHARE OF SUCH ADDITIONAL DEBT. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED
TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF AAG. SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS WE
MAY BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF AAG. AAG IS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE NOT LESS THAN
40 OF ITS REALIZED PROFITS IN EACH FISCAL YEAR TO US AND AAH. WE ARE ENTITLED
TO RECEIVE AN ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND EQUAL TO OUR APPROXIMATELY 25 SHARE OF AT
LEAST 40 OF THE NET REALIZED PROFITS OF AAG. 

 PURSUANT TO THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH AAH, WE
HAVE AGREED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY COMPETING ALUMINUM EXTRUSION ACTIVITIES IN
CHINA SO LONG AS WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AAG. 

 WE ALSO HAVE A NON-EXCLUSIVE
LONG-TERM SUPPLY ARRANGEMENT WITH AAG TO IMPORT ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS.
PURCHASES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE DONE BY PURCHASE ORDER. THIS NON-EXCLUSIVE
SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH AAG PROVIDES FOR ARMS-LENGTH PRICING, WHICH IS
BASED ON THE PREVAILING THREE MONTH FORWARD PRICE QUOTED ON THE LME AT THE TIME
OUR ORDER IS CONFIRMED PLUS A PROCESSING FEE BASED ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE
EXTRUSION PRODUCTS. THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ANY SPECIFIED
QUANTITY AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AAG TO SUPPLY ANY SPECIFIED QUANTITY. WE USED AAG
FOR APPROXIMATELY 87 AND 93 OF OUR TOTAL IMPORT VOLUME IN 2005 AND FOR 2006,
RESPECTIVELY. OUR ORDERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 4.2 OF AAG S SALES FOR ITS
FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. SEE OUR COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. 

17 

PRICING AND HEDGING 

 WE OFFER OUR
CUSTOMERS FOUR BASIC PRICING ALTERNATIVES. ON APPROXIMATELY 90 OF OUR SHIPMENT
VOLUME, WE EITHER PASS ON THE COST OF BASE ALUMINUM DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS
OR SPECIFICALLY HEDGE THE COST OF BASE ALUMINUM THAT IS CHARGED TO OUR
CUSTOMERS. OUR FOUR PRICING MECHANISMS AND OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PERCENTAGE OF
OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EACH ARE AS FOLLOWS: 

 FORMULA
PRICING. FORMULA PRICING IS BASED ON: (1) THE PRIOR MONTH
SIMPLE AVERAGE OF ALUMINUM INGOT COST PUBLISHED ON THE LME, (2) THE MWP,
WHICH IS THE PUBLISHED PRIOR MONTH SIMPLE AVERAGE OF COST OF ALUMINUM SHIPPING
AND WAREHOUSING, AND (3) A CONVERSION MARGIN FOR OUR SERVICES, WHICH IS
THE NEGOTIATED COST FOR MILL FINISH EXTRUSION AND ANY VALUE-ADDED
SERVICES WE PROVIDE. THE COST PUBLISHED ON THE LME PLUS THE MWP IS REFERRED TO
AS THE BASE ALUMINUM COST. IN FORMULA PRICING, THE BASE ALUMINUM COST IS
PASSED ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE USE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE
TO CHANGES IN THE BASE ALUMINUM PRICE FOR THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN OUR PURCHASE
OF ALUMINUM BILLET AND WHEN WE PROCESS IT FOR A CUSTOMER ORDER. FORMULA BASED
PRICING IS A COMMON FORM OF PRICING IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY AND
REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 65 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME. 

 FIXED
PRICE CONTRACTS. WITH A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT, THE CUSTOMER IS CHARGED A
FLAT PRICE FOR A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD, AND THERE IS A FIXED PRICE FOR THE BASE
ALUMINUM. WE USE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS TRADED ON THE LME TO SPECIFICALLY HEDGE OUR
EXPOSURE UNDER FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS. WE ALSO ATTEMPT TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO
CHANGES IN THE MWP THROUGH THE USE OF HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS
REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 20 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME. 

 SPOT
PRICING. IN SPOT PRICING, THE PRICE FOR AN ALUMINUM EXTRUSION IS SET IN
ADVANCE. WE REVIEW THE SPOT PRICE MONTHLY AND ADJUST THE SPOT PRICE
PERIODICALLY FOR CHANGES IN THE BASE ALUMINUM PRICE. SPOT PRICING IS PRIMARILY
USED FOR CUSTOMERS WHO WANT THE CERTAINTY OF A PRICE AT ORDER TIME BUT CANNOT
COMMIT TO THE VOLUME REQUIRED OF A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. BECAUSE THE SPOT PRICE
IS SET IN ADVANCE, SPOT PRICING DOES NOT PASS INCREASES IN THE COST OF BASE
ALUMINUM TO THE CUSTOMER. RATHER, WE ADJUST SPOT PRICES AS BASE ALUMINUM COSTS
INCREASE. SPOT PRICING REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 10 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME. 

 TOLL
CONVERSION. TOLL CONVERSION IS AN ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH CUSTOMERS PROVIDE
ALUMINUM INGOT TO FILL EXISTING AND FUTURE EXTRUSION ORDERS. WHEN THE EXTRUSION
IS SHIPPED, WE BILL ONLY FOR THE CONVERSION MARGIN ON THE EXTRUSION. TOLL
CONVERSION REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 5 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME. 

 SALES AND MARKETING 

 TRADITIONALLY, SALES
PERSONNEL WORKED AT EACH MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND WERE RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR
THE PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FACILITIES. IN 2002,
WE SHIFTED OUR EFFORTS FROM SELLING PLANT CAPACITY TO SELLING CUSTOMER
SOLUTIONS BY CENTRALIZING OUR SALES EFFORT AND ASSIGNING SALES PERSONNEL TO A
SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. 

 IN 2004, WE FURTHER
REFINED OUR SALES EFFORT BY SEGMENTING THE SALES PERSONNEL BY CUSTOMER TYPE AS
WELL AS BY SERVICE. WE CREATED A STRUCTURE WITH THREE CUSTOMER GROUPS: NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INDALEX DIRECT.
SEPARATELY, THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL SALES FORCE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING THE
ASIA SECURE PROGRAM AS WELL AS WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS THAT SEEK OFFSHORE
SOURCING SOLUTIONS. THIS SALES STRUCTURE KEEPS THE SALES FORCE FOCUSED ON
CUSTOMERS BASED ON HOW THOSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE FROM US. 

 OUR
SALES FORCE DIVISIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THREE CUSTOMER GROUPS AS FOLLOWS: 

 THE
NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DIVISION COMPRISED TEN ACCOUNTS AND APPROXIMATELY 24 OF OUR
SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006. THE DIVISION MARKETS TO LARGE, CONSOLIDATED, MULTI-LOCATION
BUYERS THAT TYPICALLY REQUIRE THEIR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE NATIONWIDE SOURCING,
PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY CAPABILITIES. 

18 

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE
SERVICED IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OUT OF MULTIPLE FACILITIES AND ARE LOOKING TO
SET SHARED OBJECTIVES AND WORK WITH US AS PARTNERS TOWARD THEIR GOALS. THE
PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS DIVISION IS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS, BY
INCREASING ACCOUNT SHARE, INCREASING SALES OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AND
INCREASING THE USE OF OUTSOURCING FROM CHINA FOR SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS. 

 THE
REGIONAL ACCOUNTS DIVISION COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 1,800 ACCOUNTS AND
APPROXIMATELY 67 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006. THE DIVISION FOCUSES ON
MEDIUM TO LARGE CUSTOMERS THAT BUY PRIMARILY BASED ON PLANT LOCATION AND
RELATIONSHIPS. THIS DIVISION SOLICITS NEW ACCOUNTS AND ALSO STRIVES TO GROW
ACCOUNT SHARE WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS. A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE REGIONAL ACCOUNTS
DIVISION IS TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND DEVELOP INCREMENTAL VALUE-ADDED
SOLUTIONS. 

 THE
INDALEX DIRECT DIVISION COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 1,700 ACCOUNTS AND
APPROXIMATELY 9 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006. THE DIVISION ACTIVELY SOLICITS
NEW ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THE ACCOUNTS SERVED BY THE REGIONAL ACCOUNTS
DIVISION. A TYPICAL INDALEX DIRECT CUSTOMER PURCHASES LESS THAN 200,000 POUNDS
OF EXTRUSION ANNUALLY AND IS GENERALLY LESS PRICE SENSITIVE THAN LARGER
CUSTOMERS. THESE CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY USE ALUMINUM FOR A SMALL PART OF THEIR END
PRODUCT AND PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON ON-TIME DELIVERY. THE INDALEX DIRECT
SALES DIVISION GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 400 NEW CUSTOMERS DURING 2006. 

 TO FURTHER DEVELOP OUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS WE LAUNCHED OUR PRODUCTS TEAM IN 2004. THE PRODUCTS
TEAM IS A GROUP OF FIELD-BASED EXPERTS FOCUSING ON THE FABRICATION,
PAINTING AND ANODIZING BUSINESSES WHICH REPORT TO EACH OF THE SALES FORCE
GROUPS. 

 COMPETITION 

 OUR COMPETITORS IN THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADIAN MARKET INCLUDE ALCOA INC., NORSK HYDRO ASA,
SAPA AB, KAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND TREDEGAR CORPORATION. WE ALSO COMPETE
WITH APPROXIMATELY 120 TO 150 SMALL TO MID-SIZED REGIONAL OPERATORS. THE
NORTH AMERICAN ALUMINUM EXTRUDING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH PRESSURE
COMING FROM INTERNATIONAL PRODUCERS LOOKING TO GROW THEIR NORTH AMERICAN
CAPABILITIES. DESPITE SOME RECENT CONSOLIDATION, THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION
INDUSTRY REMAINS FRAGMENTED, WITH A HANDFUL OF MAJOR COMPETITORS AND MANY
SMALLER, REGIONAL AND LOCAL OPERATORS. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY COMPETED AGAINST
FULLY INTEGRATED ALUMINUM PROVIDERS AS WELL AS OTHER INDEPENDENT ALUMINUM
EXTRUDERS. 

 WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF
PRODUCT QUALITY, ON-TIME DELIVERY PERFORMANCE AND PRICE, WITH PRICE
REPRESENTING A MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS AND FOR SALES OF
STANDARD ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS. SMALLER OEM CUSTOMERS TEND TO BE MORE CONCERNED
WITH ON-TIME DELIVERY, WHEREAS LARGER CUSTOMERS THAT ORDER LARGE VOLUME
SHIPMENTS TEND TO BE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE. 

 IN 2006, APPROXIMATELY 9 
OF THE TOTAL ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA WERE
IMPORTED FROM CHINA, UP FROM LESS THAN 1 IN 2000. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS
PERCENTAGE TO GROW OVER THE LONG TERM, WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS
THAT WILL LIMIT THE PENETRATION OF CHINESE IMPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES AND
CANADA. FIRST, SAVINGS IN LABOR AND MANUFACTURING COSTS MUST OFFSET SIGNIFICANT
INCREMENTAL FREIGHT AND DUTY COSTS. SECOND, OUTSOURCING TO CHINA IS LESS COST
EFFECTIVE IN THE PRODUCTION OF LOW VOLUME, CUSTOMIZED EXTRUSIONS. THIRD,
CERTAIN TYPES OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS DO NOT FIT EASILY OR AT ALL INTO STANDARD
SHIPPING CONTAINERS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO OUTSOURCE CERTAIN PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE THESE CONSTRAINTS WILL
LIMIT THE THREAT OF LOSING U.S. CUSTOMERS TO CHINESE SUPPLIERS. 

 EMPLOYEES 

 AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 1,900, OR 64 , OF
WHOM WERE COVERED UNDER UNION CONTRACTS. OUR FACILITIES ARE COVERED BY 13 UNION
AGREEMENTS, WITH NO ONE 

19 

AGREEMENT
COVERING MORE THAN 10 OF OUR OVERALL WORK FORCE. THE CONTRACT AT OUR
MOUNTAINTOP, PENNSYLVANIA FACILITY EXPIRED ON MARCH 1, 2006. DESPITE
REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION BARGAINING COMMITTEE, THE EMPLOYEES DID
NOT RATIFY THE AGREEMENT, AND THE EMPLOYEES AT THIS FACILITY WENT ON STRIKE
EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2006. WE FINALIZED AN AGREEMENT ON MAY 5, 2006, AND
THE EMPLOYEES AT THIS FACILITY RETURNED TO WORK THAT DAY. THE CONTRACT COVERING
OUR NILES, OHIO AND VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA FACILITIES WERE SUCCESSFULLY RENEGOTIATED
DURING 2006. THREE MORE CONTRACTS WILL EXPIRE IN 2007, INCLUDING EXPIRATIONS OF
OUR CONTRACTS COVERING OUR BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND CALGARY, ALBERTA
FACILITIES, WHICH EACH EXPIRE ON APRIL 30, 2007. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY
MAINTAINED SATISFACTORY RELATIONS WITH ALL OF OUR UNIONS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED
FOUR WORK STOPPAGES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, INCLUDING THE ONE DESCRIBED
ABOVE, AND PRIOR TO THAT, A ONE-WEEK WORK STOPPAGE IN MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO
IN 2003. IN JANUARY 2006, WE SUCCESSFULLY RENEGOTIATED THE CONTRACT AT OUR
MISSISSAUGA PLANT AND IN APRIL 2006, WE SUCCESSFULLY RENEGOTIATED THE
CONTRACT AT OUR MODESTO, CALIFORNIA PLANT. 

 BACKLOG 

 WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT
BACKLOG OF ORDERS, WHICH DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO MORE
THAN OUR AVERAGE MONTHLY SHIPMENT VOLUME DURING THAT PERIOD. THE BACKLOG ALLOWS
US TO EFFECTIVELY PLAN OUR PRODUCTION SHIFTS AND TO TRANSFER BUSINESS AROUND
OUR NETWORK OF FACILITIES. OUR BACKLOG IS GENERALLY LOWER IN THE WINTER MONTHS
BUT GENERALLY DOES NOT FALL BELOW 60 OF OUR MONTHLY SHIPMENTS DURING THAT
PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR BACKLOG HAD A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY
 77.0 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO SHIP DURING FISCAL 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2005, OUR BACKLOG HAD A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 82.0 MILLION. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

 WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE
AND EVOLVING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES THAT HAVE BEEN
ENACTED IN RESPONSE TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND INCREASED CONCERN OVER
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THESE REGULATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OR THE EPA, AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND
LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, TRANSPORTATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AGENCIES. WE BELIEVE
THAT OVER TIME THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCREASED LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND
REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. 

 IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR
BUSINESS, WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN ONE OR MORE PERMITS FOR EACH OF OUR
FACILITIES AND COMPLY WITH COMPLEX REGULATIONS AND RULES GOVERNING AIR
EMISSIONS, WASTE WATER DISCHARGES, THE USE, STORAGE, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF
SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER ITEMS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY. AS A RESULT, WE ARE, FROM TIME TO TIME, REQUIRED TO MAKE EXPENDITURES
FOR POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES RELATED TO OUR PERMITS
AND COMPLIANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, BY THE END OF 2007, CERTAIN OF OUR MANUFACTURING
FACILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE IN GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA; MONTREAL, QUEBEC; AND
GIRARD, OHIO MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT AIR EMISSION
REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO METAL PARTS COATING OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE
REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE CERTAIN OPERATIONAL UPGRADES AT THESE FACILITIES. IN
ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR PENALTIES
FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE PAID AN
 80,000 PENALTY TO THE EPA IN JANUARY 2005 TO SETTLE ALLEGATIONS THAT OUR
FACILITY IN MODESTO, CALIFORNIA HAD FAILED TO ACCURATELY REPORT CERTAIN
CHEMICALS HANDLED AT THAT FACILITY. 

20 

AMONG THE LAWS THAT MAY
AFFECT US ARE THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND
LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, OR CERCLA, AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS THAT, IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY IMPOSE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT,
ON PERSONS WHO OWN OR OPERATE LOCATIONS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN, OR IS THREATENED
TO BE, A RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS ON
PERSONS WHO DISPOSED OF OR ARRANGED FOR THE DISPOSAL OF SUCH SUBSTANCES AT SUCH
LOCATIONS. THESE PERSONS MAY BECOME LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATING AND
REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT THESE LOCATIONS. THERE ARE OFTEN ALSO SUBSTANTIAL
LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCURRED IN DEALING WITH REMEDIATION CLAIMS
AND ACTIVITIES. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT SOME OF OUR CURRENT
AND FORMER PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS AT SITES TO WHICH WE HAVE SENT WASTES FOR
DISPOSAL. AS PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, WE ARE CURRENTLY
INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATORY OR REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATORY ACTIONS AT OUR OWNED AND
OPERATED FACILITY IN WATSONVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND AT A PROPERTY THAT WE FORMERLY
OWNED AND OPERATED AS A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DAYTON, NEW JERSEY. WE HAVE
ESTABLISHED A RESERVE IN THE AMOUNT OF 1,190,000 TO COVER THE COST OF CLEANING
UP CONTAMINATION AT THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT AND FORMER PROPERTIES. WE
HAVE ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY UNDER CERCLA WITH
RESPECT TO APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN OFFSITE LOCATIONS TO WHICH WE SENT WASTE
MATERIALS FOR DISPOSAL IN THE PAST. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RESERVE TOTALING 480,000
TO COVER OUR ANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AT CERTAIN OF THESE SITES. 

 WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS WILL BE ENACTED IN THE FUTURE, HOW
EXISTING AND FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS WILL BE ADMINISTERED OR INTERPRETED, OR
WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS MAY BE FOUND TO EXIST. ENACTMENT OF MORE
STRINGENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR MORE STRICT INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS
AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES BY US, SOME OF WHICH
COULD BE MATERIAL. WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ANY JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. 

 ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS 

 RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE NOTES 

 OUR SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR ABILITY TO
OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS AND MAKE
PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES. 

 WE ARE
A HIGHLY LEVERAGED COMPANY, AND OUR SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS INCREASES
THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE CASH SUFFICIENT TO PAY AMOUNTS DUE
IN RESPECT OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF
OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS WAS 328.6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS, COMBINED WITH OUR OTHER FINANCIAL
OBLIGATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS COULD HAVE OTHER IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES
TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES. FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD: 

 MAKE IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS,
INCLUDING UNDER THE NOTES, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF
ANY OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE
COVENANTS, COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING
THE NOTES OR UNDER THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS WHICH, IF
NOT CURED OR WAIVED, COULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS UNDER
THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND UNDER THE NOTES; 

 MAKE US MORE
VULNERABLE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE
CONDITIONS AND TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION; 

 REQUIRE US TO
DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO PAYMENTS ON
OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING ANY INDEBTEDNESS WE MAY INCUR IN THE FUTURE,
THEREBY REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH FLOWS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL,
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES; 

21 

INCREASE OUR
INTEREST EXPENSE IF INTEREST RATES IN GENERAL INCREASE BECAUSE ALL OF OUR
INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT FLOATING
RATES; 

 LIMIT OUR
FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE
INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE; 

 PLACE US AT A
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS DEBT; AND 

 LIMIT OUR
ABILITY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OR TO SELL CAPITAL STOCK FOR WORKING
CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS,
EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. 

 ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED
FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 TO SERVICE OUR
INDEBTEDNESS, WE WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH. OUR ABILITY TO
GENERATE CASH DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND ANY FAILURE TO
MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 WE MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT
CASH TO SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATION. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON
AND TO REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND
THE NOTES, AND TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS, WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
AND ACQUISITIONS WILL PRINCIPALLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW
FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, OUR CASH FLOW IS SUBJECT TO
GENERAL ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY, FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE, OPERATING, LEGISLATIVE,
REGULATORY AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN
ADDITION, ALL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEARS
INTEREST AT FLOATING RATES, AND THEREFORE IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE, OUR DEBT
SERVICE REQUIREMENTS WILL ALSO INCREASE. 

 IF WE DO NOT GENERATE
SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OR IF FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR FROM OTHER SOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO US IN AN
AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS
ON THE NOTES, OR TO FUND OUR OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE
ACTIONS, SUCH AS REFINANCING OR RESTRUCTURING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE
NOTES, SELLING ASSETS, REDUCING OR DELAYING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND
ACQUISITIONS OR SEEKING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECT ANY OF THESE ACTIONS, IF NECESSARY, ON
COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. OUR ABILITY TO RESTRUCTURE OR
REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE
NOTES, WILL DEPEND ON THE CONDITION OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AT SUCH TIME. 

 ANY REFINANCING OF OUR
DEBT COULD BE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND MAY REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH MORE
ONEROUS COVENANTS, WHICH COULD FURTHER RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE
TERMS OF EXISTING OR FUTURE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE CREDIT AGREEMENT
GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES,
MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT US FROM TAKING ANY OF THESE ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY FAILURE
TO MAKE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUR OUTSTANDING
INDEBTEDNESS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF OUR CREDIT RATING, WHICH
COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS ON COMMERCIALLY
REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO
SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO REFINANCE OR RESTRUCTURE OUR
OBLIGATIONS ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ON OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS IN
RESPECT OF THE NOTES OR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. 

22 

DESPITE OUR
SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS, WE MAY STILL INCUR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DEBT, WHICH
COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 

 ALTHOUGH COVENANTS UNDER
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE
GOVERNING THE NOTES LIMIT OUR ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR PRESENT AND FUTURE
SUBSIDIARIES TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT AND THE INDENTURE PERMIT US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL
INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET
OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD 95.3
MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
(AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO 55.7 MILLION OF BORROWINGS AND 10.4 MILLION OF
OUTSTANDING UNDRAWN LETTERS OF CREDIT), ALL OF WHICH WAS FIRST-PRIORITY
SECURED, AND THEREFORE, EFFECTIVELY SENIOR TO THE NOTES. IN ADDITION, NEITHER
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT NOR THE INDENTURE PREVENT US FROM INCURRING OBLIGATIONS
THAT DO NOT CONSTITUTE INDEBTEDNESS AS DEFINED IN THOSE DOCUMENTS. TO THE
EXTENT THAT WE INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR SUCH OTHER OBLIGATIONS, THE
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, INCLUDING
OUR POSSIBLE INABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT, WOULD INCREASE. 

 INDALEX HOLDING
CORP. IS A HOLDING COMPANY, AND THEREFORE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING
THE NOTES, IS DEPENDENT ON CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR
ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO INDALEX HOLDING CORP. 

 IN THE EVENT THAT INDALEX
HOLDING CORP. DOES NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OR TO THE
EXTENT THAT THE EARNINGS FROM, OR OTHER AVAILABLE ASSETS OF, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
ARE INSUFFICIENT, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE REQUIRED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES. INDALEX HOLDING CORP. IS A
HOLDING COMPANY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OR MATERIAL ASSETS OTHER THAN
THE CAPITAL STOCK OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT, ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS
INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES, IS DEPENDENT ON THE GENERATION OF CASH FLOW
BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SUCH CASH AVAILABLE TO INDALEX
HOLDING CORP., BY DIVIDEND, DEBT REPAYMENT OR OTHERWISE. UNLESS THEY ARE
GUARANTORS OF THE NOTES, ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO PAY
AMOUNTS DUE ON THE NOTES OR TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE. 

 FURTHER, WHILE HOLDINGS
AND EACH OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEE THE NOTES AND
THE GUARANTEES ARE SECURED ON A SECOND-PRIORITY BASIS BY SUBSTANTIALLY
ALL OF THE GUARANTORS ASSETS, SUCH GUARANTEES AND THE RELATED SECURITY
INTERESTS COULD BE RENDERED UNENFORCEABLE FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN
THE EVENT THAT SUCH GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS WERE RENDERED
UNENFORCEABLE, THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WOULD LOSE THEIR DIRECT CLAIM AGAINST
THE ENTITIES HOLDING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS. 

 IN ADDITION, OUR
SUBSIDIARIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO, OR BE PERMITTED TO, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO
ENABLE US TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES.
EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS A DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITY AND, UNDER CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES, LEGAL AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY
TO OBTAIN CASH FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WHILE THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES
LIMITS THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO INCUR CONSENSUAL RESTRICTIONS ON
THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE OTHER INTERCOMPANY PAYMENTS TO US, THESE
LIMITATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES, INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S FOREIGN
SUBSIDIARIES ARE PERMITTED TO INCUR INDEBTEDNESS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO
EXCEED 15 MILLION AND THE TERMS OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS MAY INCLUDE, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR
PARENT ENTITIES AND INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE PERMITTED
TO INCUR PURCHASE MONEY INDEBTEDNESS, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS DESCRIBED UNDER DESCRIPTION
OF THE NOTES, THAT LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS BEING FINANCED. 

 IN ADDITION, HOLDINGS ALSO
GUARANTEES THE NOTES. HOWEVER, HOLDINGS IS ALSO A HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE ENTIRE
OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOW IS DERIVED FROM INDALEX HOLDING CORP. AND WHOSE
ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS THE CAPITAL STOCK OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP. THEREFORE,
YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON HOLDINGS GUARANTEE IN EVALUATING
WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE NOTES. 

23 

THERE MAY NOT BE
SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL TO PAY ALL OR ANY OF THE NOTES. 

 IN THE EVENT OF A
FORECLOSURE, LIQUIDATION, BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING, THE PROCEEDS FROM
ANY SALE OR LIQUIDATION OF THE COLLATERAL MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY OUR
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES, IN FULL OR AT ALL, AFTER FIRST SATISFYING OUR
OBLIGATIONS IN FULL UNDER THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS AND ANY OTHER
OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON THE COLLATERAL. INDEBTEDNESS
UNDER THE U.S. PORTION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, GUARANTEES BY THE
GUARANTORS OF THE NOTES OF THE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT
SUB-FACILITY AND OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF HEDGING OBLIGATIONS OR CERTAIN
CASH MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE SECURED BY (I) A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS DIRECTLY OWNED BY INDALEX HOLDING CORP. AND
EACH GUARANTOR AND (II) A FIRST-PRIORITY PLEDGE OF 100 OF THE
CAPITAL STOCK OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP. AND INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S DOMESTIC
SUBSIDIARIES AND OF 65 OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S FOREIGN
SUBSIDIARIES DIRECTLY OWNED BY INDALEX HOLDING CORP. OR ANY OF ITS DOMESTIC
SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT SUB-FACILITY
IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP., EACH
GUARANTOR OF THE NOTES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF INDALEX HOLDING
CORP. AND BY A FIRST-PRIORITY PLEDGE OF 100 OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF INDALEX
HOLDING CORP., EACH GUARANTOR OF THE NOTES AND ALL FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF INDALEX
HOLDING CORP. THE NOTES ARE SECURED BY A SECOND-PRIORITY LIEN ON THE
ASSETS DIRECTLY OWNED BY INDALEX HOLDING CORP. AND EACH GUARANTOR TO THE EXTENT
SUCH ASSETS SECURE THE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND A
SECOND-PRIORITY PLEDGE OF 100 OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S AND ITS
DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL STOCK AND 65 OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF OUR
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DIRECTLY OWNED BY INDALEX HOLDING CORP. OR ANY DOMESTIC
SUBSIDIARY (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS). IN THE EVENT OF A
BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION, REORGANIZATION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING
AGAINST US OR ANY EXISTING OR FUTURE DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY, THE ASSETS AND
CAPITAL STOCK THAT ARE PLEDGED AS SHARED COLLATERAL SECURING THE FIRST-PRIORITY
LIEN OBLIGATIONS AND THE NOTES MUST BE USED FIRST TO PAY THE APPLICABLE FIRST-PRIORITY
LIEN OBLIGATIONS IN FULL BEFORE MAKING ANY PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES. 

 AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006, INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS WAS 328.6 MILLION, ALL
OF WHICH WAS SECURED. OF THE 328.6 MILLION IN SECURED INDEBTEDNESS,
 5.9 MILLION WERE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AND 55.7 MILLION WERE
FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS AND, THEREFORE, EFFECTIVELY SENIOR IN RIGHT
OF PAYMENT TO THE NOTES. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES ALLOW US TO
INCUR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS,
INCLUDING THE REMAINING AVAILABILITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND
ADDITIONAL SECOND-PRIORITY SECURED INDEBTEDNESS IN AN AMOUNT THAT MAY BE
SIGNIFICANT. ANY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY A LIEN ON
THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES (WHETHER SENIOR TO OR EQUAL WITH THE SECOND-PRIORITY
LIEN OF THE NOTES) WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE HOLDERS
OF THE NOTES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES. 

 THE ASSETS OWNED BY OUR
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT PART OF THE INITIAL COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES
BUT CERTAIN OF SUCH ASSETS DO, AS OF THE CLOSING DATE, SECURE THE CANADIAN
BORROWER S BORROWINGS UNDER THE CANADIAN REVOLVING CREDIT SUB-FACILITY.
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HAD 271.3 MILLION
OF TOTAL ASSETS AND 235.4 MILLION OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER
LIABILITIES, INCLUDING TRADE PAYABLES. OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE PERMITTED
TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS UNDER OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES. ALTHOUGH THE
NOTES ARE SECURED BY A SECOND-PRIORITY PLEDGE OF 65 OF THE CAPITAL STOCK
OF INDALEX HOLDING CORP. S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DIRECTLY OWNED BY INDALEX
HOLDING CORP. OR ANY OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, IN THE EVENT OF A
LIQUIDATION, BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING, THE HOLDERS OF NOTES WOULD NOT
RECEIVE ANY AMOUNTS WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES FROM THE ASSETS OF SUCH FOREIGN
SUBSIDIARY UNTIL AFTER THE PAYMENT IN FULL OF SUCH FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES 
CREDITORS, INCLUDING PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS, AND THE LENDERS UNDER OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT PART OF
THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES BUT WHICH SECURE OTHER OBLIGATIONS, THE NOTES
ARE EFFECTIVELY JUNIOR TO THESE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF SUCH
ASSETS. 

24 

THERE IS
NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE HOLDERS OF THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS
FIRST LOOK TO THESE EXCLUDED ASSETS BEFORE FORECLOSING, SELLING, OR OTHERWISE
ACTING UPON THE COLLATERAL SHARED WITH THE NOTES. 

 THE VALUE OF THE
COLLATERAL AT ANY TIME WILL DEPEND ON MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,
INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE BUYERS FOR THE COLLATERAL. BY THEIR
NATURE, SOME OR ALL OF THE PLEDGED ASSETS MAY BE ILLIQUID AND MAY HAVE NO
READILY ASCERTAINABLE MARKET VALUE. THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS PLEDGED AS
COLLATERAL FOR THE NOTES COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF
CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY,
COMPETITION AND OTHER FUTURE TRENDS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT
COLLATERAL TO PAY ALL OR ANY OF THE AMOUNTS DUE ON THE NOTES. ANY CLAIM FOR THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, REALIZED BY HOLDERS OF THE NOTES FROM
THE SALE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES AND THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
NOTES WILL RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OF OUR OTHER UNSECURED
UNSUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING TRADE PAYABLES. 

 HOLDERS OF NOTES
WILL NOT CONTROL DECISIONS REGARDING COLLATERAL. 

 THE HOLDERS OF THE FIRST-PRIORITY
LIEN OBLIGATIONS CONTROL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE COLLATERAL
SECURING THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS AND THE NOTES. TO THE EXTENT
SHARED COLLATERAL IS RELEASED FROM SECURING THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN
OBLIGATIONS, THE SECOND-PRIORITY LIENS SECURING THE NOTES WILL ALSO
AUTOMATICALLY BE RELEASED. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., THE INTERCREDITOR
AGENT UNDER THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT UNDER THE
FIRST-LIEN SECURITY AGREEMENTS, IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LENDERS UNDER OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE HOLDERS OF THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN
OBLIGATIONS MAY CAUSE THE COLLATERAL AGENT TO DISPOSE OF, RELEASE OR FORECLOSE
ON, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARED COLLATERAL WITH WHICH
HOLDERS OF THE NOTES MAY DISAGREE OR THAT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF
HOLDERS OF THE NOTES. IN ADDITION, THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE
THAT, SO LONG AS THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS ARE IN EFFECT, THE
HOLDERS OF THE FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN OBLIGATIONS MAY CHANGE, WAIVE, MODIFY
OR VARY THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES,
PROVIDED THAT ANY SUCH CHANGE, WAIVER OR MODIFICATION DOES NOT MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES AND NOT THE OTHER
SECURED CREDITORS IN A LIKE OR SIMILAR MANNER. 

 FURTHERMORE, THE SECURITY
DOCUMENTS GENERALLY ALLOW US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO REMAIN IN POSSESSION OF,
RETAIN EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER, TO FREELY OPERATE, AND TO COLLECT, INVEST AND
DISPOSE OF ANY INCOME FROM, THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES. IN ADDITION, TO
THE EXTENT WE SELL ANY ASSETS THAT CONSTITUTE COLLATERAL, THE PROCEEDS FROM
SUCH SALE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SECOND-PRIORITY LIEN SECURING THE NOTES
ONLY TO THE EXTENT SUCH PROCEEDS WOULD OTHERWISE CONSTITUTE COLLATERAL 
SECURING THE NOTES UNDER THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THE PROCEEDS
FROM ANY SUCH SALE OF COLLATERAL DO NOT CONSTITUTE COLLATERAL UNDER THE
SECURITY DOCUMENTS, THE POOL OF ASSETS SECURING THE NOTES WOULD BE REDUCED AND
THE NOTES WOULD NOT BE SECURED BY SUCH PROCEEDS. IN ADDITION, IF WE SELL ANY OF
OUR DOMESTIC ASSETS WHICH CONSTITUTE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES AND, WITH
THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH SALE, PURCHASE ASSETS WHICH WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE
COLLATERAL, THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WOULD NOT RECEIVE A SECURITY INTEREST IN
SUCH ASSETS PURCHASED. 

 THE CAPITAL STOCK
SECURING THE NOTES WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE RELEASED FROM THE SECOND-PRIORITY
LIEN AND NO LONGER BE DEEMED TO BE COLLATERAL TO THE EXTENT THE PLEDGE OF SUCH
CAPITAL STOCK WOULD REQUIRE THE FILING WITH THE SEC OF SEPARATE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FOR THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. 

 RULE 3-16 OF
REGULATION S-X PROMULGATED BY THE SEC REQUIRES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OF AN ENTITY TO BE PROVIDED IF THE CAPITAL STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES OF SUCH
ENTITY CONSTITUTE COLLATERAL FOR A CLASS OF REGISTERED SECURITIES AND IF THE
GREATEST OF THE PAR VALUE, BOOK VALUE OR MARKET VALUE OF SUCH CAPITAL STOCK OR
SECURITIES EQUALS 20 OR MORE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SECURED CLASS OF
SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES AND THE SECURITY
DOCUMENTS PROVIDE THAT, TO THE EXTENT THAT SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INDALEX
HOLDING CORP. OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE RULES OF
THE SEC (OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY) DUE TO THE FACT THAT INDALEX HOLDING
CORP. S OR SUCH SUBSIDIARY S CAPITAL STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES SECURE THE
NOTES, THEN SUCH CAPITAL STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE DEEMED
NOT TO BE PART OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
NOT 

25 

BE
SUBJECT TO SUCH REQUIREMENT. IN SUCH EVENT, THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS MAY BE
AMENDED, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ANY HOLDER OF NOTES, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
RELEASE THE SECOND-PRIORITY LIENS ON SUCH CAPITAL STOCK OR SECURITIES.
THE BOOK VALUE AND MARKET VALUE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF EACH OF INDALEX HOLDING
CORP. AND INDALEX INC. CURRENTLY EXCEEDS 20 OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF THE NOTES. AS A RESULT, THE PLEDGE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER
SECURITIES OF THESE ENTITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES IS LIMITED SUCH THAT THE
PERCENTAGE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF EACH SUCH ENTITY THAT IS PLEDGED HAS A VALUE
OF LESS THAN 20 OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES. AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006 THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK SECURING THE NOTES WAS 59.3
MILLION AND THE BOOK VALUE OF ALL OTHER PROPERTY AND ASSETS SECURING THE NOTES
WAS 260.8 MILLION. 

 RIGHTS OF HOLDERS
OF NOTES IN THE COLLATERAL MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. 

 THE RIGHT OF THE
COLLATERAL AGENT TO REPOSSESS AND DISPOSE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES
UPON ACCELERATION IS LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED BY FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY
LAW IF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE COMMENCED BY OR AGAINST US PRIOR TO OR
POSSIBLY EVEN AFTER THE COLLATERAL AGENT HAS REPOSSESSED AND DISPOSED OF THE
COLLATERAL. CONSEQUENTLY, RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF NOTES IN THE COLLATERAL MAY BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, A
SECURED CREDITOR, SUCH AS THE COLLATERAL AGENT, IS PROHIBITED FROM REPOSSESSING
ITS SECURITY FROM A DEBTOR IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE, OR FROM DISPOSING OF SECURITY
REPOSSESSED FROM A DEBTOR, WITHOUT BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL. 

 MOREOVER, BANKRUPTCY LAW
PERMITS THE DEBTOR TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND TO USE COLLATERAL, AND THE
PROCEEDS, PRODUCTS, RENTS OR PROFITS OF THE COLLATERAL, EVEN THOUGH THE DEBTOR
IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE APPLICABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, PROVIDED THAT THE SECURED
CREDITOR IS GIVEN ADEQUATE PROTECTION. THE MEANING OF THE TERM ADEQUATE
PROTECTION MAY VARY ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IT IS INTENDED IN GENERAL
TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE SECURED CREDITOR S INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL AND
MAY INCLUDE CASH PAYMENTS OR THE GRANTING OF ADDITIONAL SECURITY, IF AND AT
SUCH TIME AS THE COURT IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINES, FOR ANY DIMINUTION IN THE
VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL AS A RESULT OF THE STAY OF REPOSSESSION OR DISPOSITION
OR ANY USE OF THE COLLATERAL BY THE DEBTOR DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE
BANKRUPTCY CASE. IN VIEW OF THE BROAD DISCRETIONARY POWERS OF A BANKRUPTCY
COURT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW LONG PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES COULD BE
DELAYED FOLLOWING COMMENCEMENT OF A BANKRUPTCY CASE, WHETHER OR WHEN THE
COLLATERAL AGENT WOULD REPOSSESS OR DISPOSE OF THE COLLATERAL, OR WHETHER OR TO
WHAT EXTENT HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR ANY DELAY IN PAYMENT
OF LOSS OF VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ADEQUATE
PROTECTION. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT DETERMINES THAT THE
VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE ON THE
NOTES, THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WOULD HAVE UNDERSECURED CLAIMS AS TO THE
DIFFERENCE. FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS DO NOT PERMIT THE PAYMENT OR ACCRUAL OF
INTEREST, COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES FOR UNDERSECURED CLAIMS DURING THE
DEBTORS BANKRUPTCY CASE. 

 RIGHTS OF HOLDERS
OF NOTES IN THE COLLATERAL MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE TO PERFECT
SECURITY INTERESTS IN CERTAIN COLLATERAL ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE. 

 THE SECURITY INTEREST IN
THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE NOTES INCLUDES DOMESTIC ASSETS, BOTH TANGIBLE AND
INTANGIBLE, WHETHER NOW OWNED OR ACQUIRED OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE. THE FAILURE
TO PERFECT THE SECURITY INTEREST IN AFTER-ACQUIRED COLLATERAL MAY RESULT IN THE
LOSS OF THE SECURITY INTEREST THEREIN OR THE PRIORITY OF THE SECURITY INTEREST
IN FAVOR OF THE NOTES AGAINST THIRD PARTIES. APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES THAT
CERTAIN PROPERTY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED AFTER THE GRANT OF A GENERAL SECURITY
INTEREST CAN ONLY BE PERFECTED AT THE TIME SUCH PROPERTY AND RIGHTS ARE
ACQUIRED AND IDENTIFIED. THE TRUSTEE OR THE COLLATERAL AGENT MAY FAIL TO
MONITOR OUR FUTURE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND RIGHTS THAT CONSTITUTE
COLLATERAL, AND THE NECESSARY ACTION MAY NOT BE TAKEN TO PROPERLY PERFECT THE
SECURITY INTEREST IN SUCH AFTER-ACQUIRED COLLATERAL. 

26 

RESTRICTIVE
COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND
THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES MAY LIMIT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS,
PARTICULARLY OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR TO PURSUE OUR
BUSINESS STRATEGIES. 

 OUR
CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE
GOVERNING THE NOTES CONTAIN, AND ANY FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS OF OURS MAY CONTAIN, A
NUMBER OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND FINANCIAL
RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT WE
BELIEVE MAY BE IN OUR INTEREST. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE INDENTURE, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO: 

 INCUR
ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND GUARANTEE INDEBTEDNESS; 

 PAY DIVIDENDS
ON OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS IN RESPECT OF CAPITAL STOCK OR MAKE CERTAIN OTHER
RESTRICTED PAYMENTS OR INVESTMENTS; 

 ENTER INTO
AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT DISTRIBUTIONS FROM RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES; 

 SELL OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ASSETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL STOCK OF RESTRICTED
SUBSIDIARIES; 

 ENTER INTO
TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; 

 CREATE OR
INCUR LIENS; 

 ENTER INTO
SALE/LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS; 

 MERGE,
CONSOLIDATE OR SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS; 

 MAKE
INVESTMENTS AND ACQUIRE ASSETS; 

 MAKE CERTAIN
PAYMENTS ON INDEBTEDNESS; 

 AMEND CERTAIN
MATERIAL AGREEMENTS; 

 ISSUE CERTAIN
PREFERRED STOCK OR SIMILAR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND 

 CHANGE OUR
FISCAL YEAR. 

 ALSO, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT
GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH
A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO IF EITHER AN AVERAGE BORROWING AVAILABILITY OVER
A THREE-CALENDAR-MONTH PERIOD (OR TWELVE-CALENDAR-WEEK
PERIOD, AS THE CASE MAY BE) OR ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY FOR FOUR
CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS FALLS BELOW 25.0 MILLION. OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY
WITH THIS RATIO MAY BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND WE CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL MEET THIS RATIO. 

 THE
RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY AND IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
ABILITY TO: 

 FINANCE OUR
OPERATIONS; 

 MAKE NEEDED
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; 

 MAKE STRATEGIC
ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES; 

 WITHSTAND A
FUTURE DOWNTURN IN OUR BUSINESS OR THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL; 

 ENGAGE IN
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES, THAT MAY BE IN OUR
INTEREST; AND 

 PLAN FOR OR
REACT TO MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES. 

27 

A BREACH OF THE
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY OR THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES, OR OUR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH
THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WOULD HAVE ADVERSE
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU AS A HOLDER OF THE NOTES. 

 A BREACH OF ANY OF THE
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OR OUR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE FIXED CHARGE RATIO IF
EITHER AN AVERAGE BORROWING AVAILABILITY OVER A THREE-CALENDAR-MONTH
PERIOD (OR TWELVE-CALENDAR-WEEK PERIOD, AS THE CASE MAY BE) OR
ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS FALLS BELOW
 25.0 MILLION COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT
OCCURS THAT IS NOT CURED OR WAIVED, THE LENDERS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY MAY ELECT TO DECLARE ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED
INTEREST AND OTHER FEES, TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE, WHICH WOULD RESULT
IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES AND COULD RESULT
IN A CROSS DEFAULT UNDER ANY OF OUR OTHER MATERIAL DEBT AGREEMENTS. 

 IF, WHEN REQUIRED, WE ARE
UNABLE TO REPAY OR REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS UNDER, OR AMEND THE COVENANTS
CONTAINED IN, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR
IF A DEFAULT OTHERWISE OCCURS THAT IS NOT CURED OR WAIVED, THE LENDERS UNDER
THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD ELECT TO TERMINATE THEIR COMMITMENTS
THEREUNDER, CEASE MAKING FURTHER LOANS, DECLARE ALL BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING,
TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER FEES, TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND
PAYABLE OR INSTITUTE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THOSE ASSETS THAT SECURE
THE BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ANY SUCH ACTIONS COULD
FORCE US INTO BANKRUPTCY OR LIQUIDATION, AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE
THAT WE COULD REPAY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES IN SUCH AN EVENT. 

 NOT ALL OF OUR
SUBSIDIARIES ARE GUARANTORS AND THEREFORE THE NOTES ARE STRUCTURALLY
SUBORDINATED IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF
OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE SUBSIDIARIES THAT DO NOT GUARANTEE THE NOTES. 

 THE GUARANTORS INCLUDE
ONLY HOLDINGS AND OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES THAT INCUR
INDEBTEDNESS (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS), AND EACH OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
THAT ENTERS INTO A GUARANTEE OF ANY OF OUR SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS (OTHER THAN
INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED BY ANOTHER FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY). IN ADDITION, ANY
SUBSIDIARY THAT WE PROPERLY DESIGNATE AS AN UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY UNDER THE
INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES, WILL NOT PROVIDE GUARANTEES OF THE NOTES. AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2006, EACH OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES AND NONE OF OUR
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTEED THE NOTES. 

 THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS OF
ANY ENTITY THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE NOTES, INCLUDING INDALEX LIMITED AND OUR
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT GUARANTEE THE CANADIAN SUB-FACILITY PORTION OF
OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE PAID BEFORE THE HOLDERS
OF THE NOTES HAVE A CLAIM, IF ANY, AGAINST THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR ASSETS.
THEREFORE, IF THERE WAS A DISSOLUTION, BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION OR
REORGANIZATION OF ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY, THE HOLDERS OF NOTES WOULD NOT RECEIVE
ANY AMOUNTS WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES FROM THE ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY UNTIL
AFTER THE PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS, INCLUDING PREFERRED
STOCKHOLDERS, OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY. 

 ON A PRO FORMA BASIS, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO
THE HONEYWELL ACQUISITION AND THE TRANSACTIONS, THE AGGREGATE NET SALES AND
OPERATING INCOME OF OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES WERE 376.0 MILLION AND 4.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR
THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 450.6 MILLION AND 6.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR
2006, AND THEIR TOTAL ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS 271.3 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006, OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES HAD 235.4 MILLION OF TOTAL
INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING TRADE PAYABLES. 

 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES UPON ANY CHANGE OF CONTROL AS REQUIRED BY THE INDENTURE
GOVERNING THE NOTES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE
GOVERNING THE NOTES AND WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION. 

 UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CHANGE
OF CONTROL , AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES, WE WILL BE
REQUIRED TO MAKE AN OFFER TO REPURCHASE ALL OUTSTANDING NOTES AT A PRICE EQUAL
TO 101 OF THE PRINCIPAL 

28 

AMOUNT
THEREOF, PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, AND ADDITIONAL INTEREST, IF ANY,
TO THE DATE OF REPURCHASE. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MAKE
ANY REQUIRED REPURCHASES OF THE NOTES, AND RESTRICTIONS UNDER OUR CREDIT
AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MAY NOT ALLOW THAT
REPURCHASE. IF WE FAIL TO REPURCHASE NOTES IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, WE WILL BE IN
DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES AND, IN TURN, UNDER OUR CREDIT
AGREEMENT. 

 IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT CERTAIN CHANGE
OF CONTROL EVENTS, INCLUDING A CHANGE OF CONTROL UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING
THE NOTES, WILL CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. SUCH A DEFAULT UNDER OUR CREDIT
AGREEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES IF
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS ACCELERATE THE DEBT UNDER OUR REVOLVING
CREDIT FACILITY. IN ADDITION, ANY FUTURE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR OTHER AGREEMENTS
RELATING TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO WHICH WE BECOME A PARTY WOULD LIKELY CONTAIN
SIMILAR PROVISIONS. 

 IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE
OF CONTROL, WE COULD SEEK TO OBTAIN A WAIVER OF SUCH DEFAULT FROM THE LENDERS
OR YOU AS A HOLDER OF THE NOTES OR SEEK TO REFINANCE THE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE NOTES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT WE
WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER OR TO REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS ON
COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, AND IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO
OBTAIN SUCH A WAIVER OR TO REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS ON COMMERCIALLY
REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, SUCH DEFAULT COULD RESULT IN ALL AMOUNTS
OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE NOTES BEING DECLARED
DUE AND PAYABLE. 

 HOLDERS OF NOTES
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHEN A CHANGE OF CONTROL HAS OCCURRED. 

 UNDER THE INDENTURE,
WITHIN 30 DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE ON WHICH A CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURS, WE ARE
REQUIRED TO SEND HOLDERS OF NOTES AND THE TRUSTEE A NOTICE OF THE OFFER TO
REPURCHASE THE NOTES. IN SOME CASES, SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A SALE OF
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS, HOLDERS OF NOTES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE
WHEN A CHANGE OF CONTROL GIVING RISE TO THE RIGHT TO HAVE US REPURCHASE NOTES
HAS OCCURRED, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF HOLDERS OF NOTES
ABILITY TO ENFORCE THIS PROVISION OF THE INDENTURE. 

 THE TERMS OF THE
NOTES MAY NOT PROTECT YOU IF WE ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS,
REFINANCINGS OR OTHER RECAPITALIZATIONS THAT WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE A CHANGE OF
CONTROL UNDER THE INDENTURE. 

 WE MAY ENTER INTO
TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, REFINANCINGS, RECAPITALIZATIONS OR OTHER
HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS. SUCH A TRANSACTION MAY NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE
DEFINITION OF CHANGE OF CONTROL IN THE INDENTURE OR OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY THE
TERMS OF THE INDENTURE BUT COULD
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING OR OTHERWISE AFFECT OUR CAPITAL
STRUCTURE OR CREDIT RATINGS AND MAY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO REPAY
THE NOTES. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE INDENTURE WILL NOT AFFORD HOLDERS OF NOTES
PROTECTION FROM ANY ADVERSE ASPECTS OF SUCH TRANSACTION. 

 FEDERAL AND STATE
STATUTES ALLOW COURTS, UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, TO VOID THE GUARANTEES AND
SECURITY INTERESTS, SUBORDINATE CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF THE GUARANTEES AND
SECURITY INTERESTS AND REQUIRE NOTEHOLDERS TO RETURN PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE
GUARANTORS. 

 THE
NOTES ARE GUARANTEED BY HOLDINGS AND, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, EACH OF INDALEX
HOLDING CORP. S EXISTING AND FUTURE DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES THAT INCURS
INDEBTEDNESS, AND EACH OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENTERS INTO A GUARANTEE
OF ANY OF OUR SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS (OTHER THAN INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED BY ANOTHER
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, EACH OF OUR DOMESTIC
SUBSIDIARIES AND NONE OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTEED THE NOTES ON A
SECOND-PRIORITY SECURED BASIS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE
RELATED SECURITY INTEREST BY ANY GUARANTOR MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW UNDER STATE
AND FEDERAL LAWS IF A BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION CASE OR A
LAWSUIT, INCLUDING IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH BANKRUPTCY IS NOT INVOLVED, WERE
COMMENCED AT SOME FUTURE DATE BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, THE UNPAID CREDITORS OF SUCH
GUARANTOR. UNDER THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS AND COMPARABLE PROVISION OF STATE
FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS, A COURT MAY VOID OR OTHERWISE DECLINE TO ENFORCE A
GUARANTOR S GUARANTEE OR THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST, SUBORDINATE SUCH
GUARANTEE TO THE GUARANTOR S EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS OR 

29 

TAKE OTHER ACTION DETRIMENTAL TO THE NOTEHOLDERS.
WHILE THE RELEVANT LAWS MAY VARY FROM STATE TO STATE, A COURT MIGHT DO SO IF IT
FOUND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WHEN THE GUARANTOR ENTERED INTO ITS GUARANTEE
AND THE RELATED SECURITY AGREEMENTS OR, IN SOME STATES, WHEN PAYMENTS BECAME
DUE UNDER SUCH GUARANTEE, THE GUARANTOR RECEIVED LESS THAN REASONABLY
EQUIVALENT VALUE OR FAIR CONSIDERATION AND EITHER: 

 THE GUARANTOR
WAS INSOLVENT, OR RENDERED INSOLVENT, BY REASON OF SUCH INCURRENCE; 

 THE GUARANTOR
WAS ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS OR TRANSACTION FOR WHICH THE GUARANTOR S REMAINING
ASSETS CONSTITUTED UNREASONABLY SMALL CAPITAL; OR 

 THE GUARANTOR
INTENDED TO INCUR, OR BELIEVED OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE
GUARANTOR WOULD INCUR DEBTS BEYOND SUCH GUARANTOR S ABILITY TO PAY SUCH DEBTS
AS THEY MATURE. 

 THE COURT MIGHT ALSO VOID
A GUARANTEE OR THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST OF A GUARANTOR WITHOUT REGARD TO
ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, IF THE COURT FOUND THAT THE GUARANTOR ENTERED INTO
ITS GUARANTEE OR THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST WITH ACTUAL INTENT TO HINDER,
DELAY OR DEFRAUD ITS CREDITORS. IN ADDITION, ANY PAYMENT BY A GUARANTOR
PURSUANT TO ITS GUARANTEE COULD BE VOIDED AND REQUIRED TO BE RETURNED TO SUCH
GUARANTOR OR TO A FUND FOR THE BENEFIT OF SUCH GUARANTOR S CREDITORS. 

 A COURT WOULD LIKELY FIND
THAT A GUARANTOR DID NOT RECEIVE REASONABLY EQUIVALENT VALUE OR FAIR
CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH GUARANTEE AND THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST IF SUCH
GUARANTOR DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFIT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE
ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES AND THE APPLICABLE GUARANTEE AND SECURITY INTEREST
THEREUNDER. IF A COURT WERE TO VOID A GUARANTEE AND THE RELATED SECURITY
INTEREST, YOU WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST THE APPLICABLE GUARANTOR.
SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO REPAY THE NOTES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES,
INCLUDING THE REMAINING GUARANTORS, IF ANY. IN ADDITION, THE COURT MIGHT DIRECT
YOU TO REPAY ANY AMOUNTS THAT YOU ALREADY RECEIVED FROM ANY GUARANTOR. 

 THE
MEASURES OF INSOLVENCY FOR PURPOSES OF THESE FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS WILL VARY
DEPENDING UPON THE LAW APPLIED IN ANY PROCEEDING TO DETERMINE WHETHER A
FRAUDULENT TRANSFER HAS OCCURRED. GENERALLY, HOWEVER, AN ENTITY WOULD BE
CONSIDERED INSOLVENT IF: 

 THE SUM OF ITS
EXISTING DEBTS, INCLUDING CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WAS GREATER THAN THE FAIR
SALEABLE VALUE OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS; 

 THE PRESENT
FAIR SALEABLE VALUE OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS WERE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD
BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE PROBABLE LIABILITY ON ITS EXISTING DEBTS, INCLUDING
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, AS THEY BECOME ABSOLUTE AND MATURE; OR 

 IT CANNOT PAY
ITS DEBTS AS THEY BECOME DUE. 

 THE INDENTURE GOVERNING
THE NOTES LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF EACH SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR ON ITS GUARANTEE TO
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR CAN INCUR WITHOUT RISK THAT
THE GUARANTEE AND THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST WILL BE SUBJECT TO AVOIDANCE AS
A FRAUDULENT TRANSFER. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THIS LIMITATION WILL PROTECT
THE GUARANTEES FROM FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ATTACK OR, IF IT DOES, THAT THE
REMAINING AMOUNT DUE AND COLLECTIBLE UNDER THE GUARANTEES WOULD SUFFICE, IF
NECESSARY, TO PAY THE NOTES WHEN DUE. 

 TO THE EXTENT A COURT
VOIDS ANY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE RELATED SECURITY INTEREST AS FRAUDULENT
TRANSFERS OR HOLDS ANY OF THE GUARANTEES OR SECURITY AGREEMENTS UNENFORCEABLE
FOR ANY OTHER REASON, HOLDERS OF NOTES WOULD CEASE TO HAVE ANY DIRECT CLAIM
AGAINST THE APPLICABLE GUARANTOR. IF A COURT WERE TO TAKE THIS ACTION, THE
APPLICABLE GUARANTOR S ASSETS WOULD BE APPLIED FIRST TO SATISFY THE APPLICABLE
GUARANTOR S LIABILITIES BEFORE ITS REMAINING ASSETS, IF ANY, COULD BE APPLIED
TO THE PAYMENT OF THE NOTES. 

30 

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

 THE
ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL AND HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS OF END-USER MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AND THE
CYCLICALITY AND VOLATILITY OF THESE MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

 OUR PROFITABILITY DEPENDS
IN PART ON THE VARYING ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS OF THE END-USER
MARKETS WE SERVE. ALL OF THE END-USER MARKETS WE SERVE, INCLUDING OUR TWO
LARGEST MARKETS, THE TRANSPORTATION AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION
END-USER MARKETS, ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND, AS A RESULT, OUR
CUSTOMERS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY CHANGE DUE TO CHANGES IN GENERAL AND
REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, THE HOUSING MARKET, FUEL AND
ENERGY PRICES AND AVAILABILITY, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME GROWTH TRENDS AND
INTEREST RATES, EACH OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN THE EVENT OF AN
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN ANY OF THE END-USER MARKETS WE SERVE, OUR CUSTOMERS
MAY DELAY PURCHASE ORDERS, EXTEND SEASONAL SHUTDOWNS OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS
AT CERTAIN OF THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND OTHERWISE REDUCE PRODUCTION
LEVELS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND CASH
FLOWS. 

 FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2001, THE
22 DECLINE IN SHIPMENT VOLUME IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ALUMINUM
EXTRUSION MARKET HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR NET SALES, WHICH DROPPED 21 , AND
ON OUR PLANT OPERATING EARNINGS, WHICH DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF, COMPARED TO
2000. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN THE TRANSPORTATION END-USER
MARKET IS TO MANUFACTURERS OF TRUCK TRAILERS, WHICH EXPERIENCED SHIPMENT VOLUME
DECLINES OF 48 IN THE U.S. IN 2001 FROM 2000, WHICH WAS GREATER THAN THE
OVERALL INDUSTRY VOLUME DECLINE DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE DOWNTURN FROM 2000
TO 2001 WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SINGLE YEAR DOWNTURN SINCE 1975, WHEN OUR
INDUSTRY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY 31 IN SHIPMENT VOLUME COMPARED
TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW LESS SIGNIFICANT SINGLE YEAR DOWNTURNS
SINCE 1975. DECLINES IN SHIPMENT VOLUME CAN HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO THE FIXED OPERATING COST REQUIREMENTS INHERENT
IN OUR OPERATIONS. 

 DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING
AND CONSTRUCTION END-USER MARKET IS DRIVEN BY NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND
REMODELING ACTIVITY, WHICH ARE IMPACTED BY DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, INTEREST RATE
LEVELS, AND OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 
IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED STRONG DEMAND IN THIS END-USER
MARKET DUE TO STRONG NEW HOUSING STARTS, THE INCREASING SIZE OF NEW HOMES AND
INCREASED REMODELING AND REPAIR ACTIVITY. 
HOWEVER, AFTER SHOWING STRONG GROWTH DURING RECENT YEARS, THAT MARKET
SLOWED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2006, AND OUR SHIPMENTS TO THAT
MARKET WERE DOWN 26 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 AS COMPARED TO THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF 2005. ACCORDING TO DATA
PUBLISHED BY THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, HOUSING STARTS IN THE UNITED STATES WERE
DOWN 32 YEAR OVER YEAR IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 2007. REMODELING ACTIVITY HAS SLOWED, AS WELL. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS GOOD
LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION
MARKET, BUT WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF WHEN THE CURRENT DOWNTURN IN THIS MARKET
WILL END. 

 IN THE EVENT OF AN
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WE WOULD ALSO EXPERIENCE A HIGHER LEVEL OF BAD DEBTS THAT
USUALLY ACCOMPANY A DOWNTURN. ANY DECREASE IN DEMAND WITHIN ONE OR MORE OF OUR
END-USER MARKETS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND MAY LAST FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF
TIME. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY WILL
NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND AS A RESULT OF THE VOLATILITY IN ANY
OF THE END-USER MARKETS WE SERVE, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING OR
MAINTAINING OUR LEVEL OF SALES OR PROFITABILITY IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DIVERT
SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN OTHER END-USER MARKETS WHEN ONE OR
MORE OF OUR END-USER MARKETS IS EXPERIENCING A DECLINE. IN ADDITION, WE
ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE TIMING, EXTENT AND DURATION OF THE ECONOMIC CYCLES
IN ANY OF THE END-USER MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. 

 OUR INDUSTRY HISTORICALLY
EXPERIENCES A SEASONALLY DRIVEN SLOW DOWN, AND WE EXPERIENCE LOWER NET SALES
FROM NOVEMBER THROUGH FEBRUARY. THIS SLOW DOWN IS LARGELY DUE TO THE
SEASONAL NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FOR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE,
SLOWER MANUFACTURING DURING THE HOLIDAY PERIOD, REDUCED YEAR END INVENTORY AND
SLOW RAMP UP BY OUR CUSTOMERS. COLD WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS CAUSES
SLOW DOWNS IN THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
IN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, QUARTER TO QUARTER
COMPARISONS OF OUR NET SALES, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS 

31 

SHOULD
NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND THE RESULTS OF ANY
QUARTERLY PERIOD MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF EXPECTED RESULTS FOR A FULL YEAR. 

 THE
MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND OUR INABILITY TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF
CUSTOMERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 

 THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION
INDUSTRY IS FRAGMENTED AND WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM REGIONAL, NATIONAL
AND GLOBAL COMPANIES IN EACH OF THE END-USER MARKETS WE SERVE. THIS
COMPETITION COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF OUR CUSTOMER AND THE TYPE
OF PRODUCT WE SELL, WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT QUALITY, ON-TIME
DELIVERY PERFORMANCE AND PRICE, WITH PRICE REPRESENTING A MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR
FOR OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS AND FOR SALES OF STANDARD ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS. OUR
COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER INDEPENDENT ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS AS WELL AS CERTAIN
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ALUMINUM COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE EXTRUSION
INDUSTRY. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES
THAN WE DO, AND VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN
ALUMINUM BILLET AT LOWER PRICES THAN WE CAN. OUR COMPETITORS MAY FORESEE THE
COURSE OF MARKET DEVELOPMENT MORE ACCURATELY THAN WE DO, PRODUCE SIMILAR
PRODUCTS AT A LOWER COST THAN WE CAN OR ADAPT MORE QUICKLY TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES
OR INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. 

 WE OPERATE IN A
MARKETPLACE THAT IS BECOMING MORE GLOBAL, AND THE THREAT OF LOWER COST IMPORTS
IS INCREASING. FOR EXAMPLE, IMPORTS OF EXTRUSIONS FROM CHINA NOW REPRESENT
APPROXIMATELY 9 OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ALUMINUM EXTRUSION MARKET
BASED ON SHIPMENT VOLUME, UP FROM LESS THAN 1 IN 2000. CHINESE EXTRUSIONS ARE
TYPICALLY GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT ARE PRICED LOWER THAN THOSE MANUFACTURED
IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN THE FUTURE, CHINESE ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS MAY
DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF PACKAGING AND TRANSPORTING ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS THAT COULD
MITIGATE THE FREIGHT COST AND OTHER SHIPPING LIMITATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE
CURRENTLY LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO MORE FULLY PENETRATE THE U.S. AND CANADIAN
ALUMINUM EXTRUSION MARKET. IF OUR CUSTOMERS IN ANY OF THE END-USER
MARKETS WE SERVE SHIFT THEIR PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA,
THEN THOSE CUSTOMERS WOULD LIKELY SOURCE ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS OVERSEAS, AND, AS
A RESULT, OUR NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

 IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO
CONTINUE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES IN WAYS OTHER THAN BY REDUCING PRICES, WE
MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE AND SUFFER REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS. IF OUR COMPETITORS
LOWER THEIR PRICES, IT COULD INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH
HIGHER VALUE-ADDED SALES. IF OUR PRODUCT MIX CHANGED AS A RESULT OF
COMPETITIVE PRICING, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGINS AND
PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WITH THE GLOBAL ALUMINUM
EXTRUSION INDUSTRY MAY BE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RECENT TREND
TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION AMONG OUR COMPETITORS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL
BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY OR THAT COMPETITION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

 THE
WILLINGNESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCEPT SUBSTITUTES FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS. 

 ALUMINUM COMPETES WITH
OTHER MATERIALS, SUCH AS VINYL, STEEL, PLASTICS AND GLASS, AMONG OTHERS, FOR
VARIOUS APPLICATIONS IN OUR END-USER MARKETS. IN THE PAST, CUSTOMERS HAVE
DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO SUBSTITUTE OTHER MATERIALS FOR ALUMINUM. FOR
EXAMPLE, OVER THE PAST DECADE, VINYL, WITH ITS PENETRATION OF THE RESIDENTIAL
WINDOW AND DOOR MARKET, HAS BEEN THE MOST COMMONLY USED SUBSTITUTE FOR ALUMINUM
EXTRUSIONS. STEEL MAY BE ANOTHER SUBSTITUTE FOR ALUMINUM IF ALUMINUM COSTS RISE
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT STEEL BECOMES A VIABLE ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE FOR CERTAIN
MANUFACTURING NEEDS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION MARKET. IF STEEL PRICES
FALL OR IF ALUMINUM PRICES INCREASE, STEEL COULD BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE TO OUR
CUSTOMERS THAN ALUMINUM. THE STEEL INDUSTRY HAS RESPONDED TO THE INCREASED USE
OF ALUMINUM AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR STEEL BY DEVELOPING LIGHTER WEIGHT STEEL
PRODUCTS. LIGHTER WEIGHT STEEL PRODUCTS, LOWER STEEL COSTS OR HIGHER ALUMINUM
COSTS COULD SLOW OR REVERSE THE RATE AT WHICH ALUMINUM IS USED AS A SUBSTITUTE
FOR STEEL. AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF SUBSTITUTES FOR ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND
RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS. 

32 

EQUIPMENT
FAILURES, DELAYS IN DELIVERIES OR CATASTROPHIC LOSS AT ANY OF OUR FACILITIES
COULD LEAD TO PRODUCTION OR SERVICE CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS, WHICH WOULD HAVE
AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS. 

 WE HAVE 15 MANUFACTURING
FACILITIES AND TWO CASTING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. AN
INTERRUPTION IN PRODUCTION OR SERVICE CAPABILITIES AT ANY OF THESE FACILITIES
AS A RESULT OF EQUIPMENT FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS COULD RESULT IN OUR INABILITY
TO PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR NET SALES AND RESULTS FROM
OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT OF A STOPPAGE IN PRODUCTION AT ANY OF OUR
FACILITIES, EVEN IF ONLY TEMPORARY, OR IF WE EXPERIENCE DELAYS AS A RESULT OF
EVENTS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, DELIVERY TIMES TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD BE
SEVERELY AFFECTED. ANY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN DELIVERIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD
LEAD TO INCREASED RETURNS OR CANCELLATIONS, COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR
REPUTATION OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMERS THAT SEEK OUT ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS.
FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE, TO VARYING DEGREES, DEPENDENT
ON DELIVERIES FROM OUR FACILITIES, CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE TO RESCHEDULE THEIR OWN
PRODUCTION DUE TO OUR MISSED DELIVERIES COULD PURSUE FINANCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST
US. 

 OUR FACILITIES ARE ALSO
SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC LOSS DUE TO UNANTICIPATED EVENTS SUCH AS
FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR OTHER EVENTS. WE HAVE
EXPERIENCED, AND MAY EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE, PERIODS OF REDUCED PRODUCTION AS
A RESULT OF EXTRUSION PRESS FAILURES, DELAYS IN ALUMINUM BILLET DELIVERIES,
PROLONGED POWER OUTAGES, WORK STOPPAGES OR PAINT FIRES. IF ANY OF THESE
EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN
INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PHYSICAL DAMAGE, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTIONS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY, THESE POLICIES MAY NOT COVER ALL OF OUR
LOSSES AND WE COULD INCUR UNINSURED LOSSES AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM SUCH
EVENTS. WE HAVE FOUR FACILITIES WHICH EACH CONTRIBUTE FROM 10 TO 21 OF OUR
PLANT OPERATING EARNINGS FROM MANUFACTURING, AND LOSS OF OR REDUCTION IN
PRODUCTION AT ANY OF THESE FACILITIES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN GAINESVILLE,
GEORGIA; BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA; ELKHART, INDIANA; AND GIRARD, OHIO;. 

 WE
RELY ON ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS TO PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS, AND RISING COSTS
OR SHORTAGES OF ELECTRIC POWER AND NATURAL GAS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 

 AS PART OF THE EXTRUSION
PROCESS, ALUMINUM BILLETS ARE HEATED BY ELECTRIC AND GAS HEATERS WHICH REQUIRE
A LARGE AND CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION, OUR
TWO CAST HOUSES, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH APPROXIMATELY 21 OF OUR ALUMINUM
BILLETS, USE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NATURAL GAS DURING THE BILLET PRODUCTION PROCESS.
INTERRUPTIONS OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CAN RESULT IN LENGTHY PRODUCTION SHUTDOWNS,
INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTARTING PRODUCTION AND WASTE OF PRODUCTION
IN PROGRESS. IN EXTREME CASES, INTERRUPTIONS OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CAN ALSO
CAUSE DAMAGE TO OR DESTRUCTION OF OUR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. WE DO NOT
MAINTAIN BACK-UP GENERATORS OR OTHER SOURCES OF SECONDARY POWER SUPPLY AT
ANY OF OUR FACILITIES. ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY
 25.9 MILLION IN 2005, AND APPROXIMATELY 31.2 MILLION FOR 2006.
WHILE WE HAVE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS THAT INSULATE US IN THE SHORT TERM FROM THE
RECENT INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS PRICES, IF THE RECENT INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS
PRICES CONTINUE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOW WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPACTED. WE DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY CONTRACTS AT SOME OF OUR FACILITIES, WE DO
NOT HAVE A GUARANTEED SUPPLY AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED ROLLING POWER OUTAGES IN
THE PAST. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN FUEL OIL COSTS HAVE A CORRESPONDING
INCREASE ON OUR FREIGHT COSTS. SHORTAGES OF ELECTRICAL GENERATING CAPACITY IN
OUR FACILITIES OR INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 RISING
COSTS OF ALUMINUM AND DISRUPTIONS IN OUR ALUMINUM SUPPLY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT
OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

 THE PRIMARY RAW MATERIAL
IN THE MANUFACTURING OF ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS IS ALUMINUM BILLETS AND INGOT,
WHICH REPRESENTED 63 OF OUR COST OF SALES IN 2005 AND 66 OF OUR COSTS OF
SALES FOR 2006. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH
METAL SUPPLIERS TO PURCHASE ALUMINUM BILLET AT THE MARKET PRICE OF BASE
ALUMINUM PLUS A NEGOTIATED BILLET PREMIUM. IF OUR ALUMINUM SUPPLY IS DISRUPTED,
OR IF THE COST OF ALUMINUM INCREASES, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY
IMPACTED. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RENEW THESE CONTRACTS
WHEN THEY EXPIRE, ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL. 

33 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE
SHORT-TERM COMMODITY RISK OF CARRYING ALUMINUM IN OUR INVENTORY WHICH WE
ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THROUGH THE USE OF HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE SEEK TO
TIME OUR HEDGES TO COINCIDE WITH THE PERIOD WE EXPECT TO CARRY OUR INVENTORY,
WE MAY NOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE TIMING IN ALL CASES. IF WE EXPERIENCE DELAYS
IN PRODUCTION OR SHIPMENTS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF BASE ALUMINUM DECLINES, WE
COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS IF WE HAVE NOT HEDGED OUR EXPOSURE TO PRICE INCREASES
CORRECTLY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE CHANGES IN BASE ALUMINUM PRICES ARE GENERALLY
PASSED THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, BUT OUR CUSTOMER BILLINGS ARE CARRIED AS
RECEIVABLES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, INCREASES OR DECREASES IN BASE ALUMINUM
PRICES CAUSE CORRESPONDING INCREASES AND DECREASES IN REPORTED NET SALES AND
FLUCTUATIONS IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS
ACTIVITY. AS BASE ALUMINUM PRICES RISE, WHICH CAUSES SALES DOLLARS TO INCREASE,
OUR CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES AND RAW MATERIAL INVENTORY CARRYING VALUE INCREASE,
HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WORKING CAPITAL, AND, CONVERSELY, AS PRICES AND NET
SALES FALL, OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASES. WE EXPECT THAT THE RECENT INCREASES
IN NATURAL GAS PRICES WILL AFFECT THE BILLET PREMIUMS CHARGED BY OUR SUPPLIERS,
AND SINCE WE DO NOT PASS THE BILLET PREMIUM DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS ANY
UNWILLINGNESS BY OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCEPT HIGHER PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS WOULD
HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 RECENTLY, PRODUCERS OF
BASE ALUMINUM HAVE INCURRED INCREASED COSTS OF PRODUCTION DUE TO THE RISING
PRICE OF ENERGY AND ALUMINA, WHICH HAVE INCREASED THE PRICE OF BASE ALUMINUM.
ALUMINUM PRICES ON THE LME REACHED AN EIGHTEEN-YEAR HIGH OF 3,240 PER
METRIC TON AS OF MAY 11, 2006. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THE
FULL COST OF BASE ALUMINUM TO CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY
HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER BASE ALUMINUM COSTS, THE
INCREASING PRICE OF PRIMARY ALUMINUM COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
RESULTS. AS A RESULT OF OUR INCREASED LEVERAGE, OUR HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES MAY
CEASE TO TRADE ALUMINUM FUTURES WITH US OR MAY CHOOSE NOT TO OFFER CREDIT TO
US. AN INABILITY TO HEDGE OUR BASE ALUMINUM PRICE RISK WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
STATEMENT ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO RECORD OUR HEDGE
INSTRUMENTS AT CURRENT MARKET VALUE, KNOWN AS MARK TO-MARKET, IN OUR
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RULES REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, WHILE THE PHYSICAL POSITION
WHICH CREATED THE NEED FOR THE DERIVATIVE, IS NOT MARKED TO MARKET VALUE. DUE
TO VOLATILE MARKET PRICES OF BASE ALUMINUM, THIS MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT CAN
RESULT IN A MATERIAL POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO OUR OPERATING EARNINGS. 

 ANY MAJOR DISRUPTION IN
THE AVAILABILITY OF ALUMINUM MAY CAUSE A SHORTAGE OF ALUMINUM BILLETS AND COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BILLET PREMIUM WE PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2004, A
SHORTAGE OF ALUMINUM BILLETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA CAUSED SOME OF OUR
COMPETITORS TO HAVE DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY WHICH RESULTED IN PRODUCTION OUTAGES,
AND WE MAY FACE SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, WE PURCHASED
APPROXIMATELY 14 OF OUR THIRD PARTY ALUMINUM BILLET REQUIREMENTS FROM SOUTH
AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN 2006, AND WE INTEND TO INCREASE THAT PERCENTAGE
IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SHIPPING BILLET FROM OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS INCREASES
TRANSPORTATION RISK, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EASILY REPLACE BILLET FROM OUR
SUPPLIERS IN SOUTH AMERICA OR THE MIDDLE EAST WITH BILLET FROM OTHER SOURCES.
UNEXPECTED DELAYS OR LOSSES IN THE DELIVERY OF FOREIGN-SOURCED BILLET DUE
TO FACTORS SUCH AS WEATHER, WORK STOPPAGES, THEFT, CUSTOMS ISSUES OR WAR COULD
CAUSE ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES TO RUN OUT OF BILLET. A SHORTAGE OF
ALUMINUM BILLETS OR AN INCREASE IN THE BILLET PREMIUM COULD RESULT IN TEMPORARY
OR PERMANENT FACILITY SHUTDOWNS OR HIGHER COSTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS
ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

 WE
HAVE RESTRUCTURED OUR OPERATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST, AND EXPECT TO
CONTINUE TO DO SO FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. THE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH
THESE RESTRUCTURINGS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND
LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. 

 WE HAVE CLOSED,
CONSOLIDATED OR IDLED FIVE PLANTS SINCE 1999. WE HAVE ALSO WORKED TO CENTRALIZE
OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING FUNCTIONS AND HAVE ELIMINATED A SIGNIFICANT
NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS SINCE 2000. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, WE
INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF 2.9 MILLION, 6.1 

34 

MILLION,
 0.5 MILLION, AND 1.8 MILLION IN 2003, 2004, 2005 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. WE
CURRENTLY EMPLOY OVER 3,000 EMPLOYEES AND CURRENTLY OPERATE 15 EXTRUSION
FACILITIES AND TWO SECONDARY REMELT FACILITIES, AND WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES,
OPERATE 39 EXTRUSION PRESSES, NINE PAINT LINES AND SIGNIFICANT PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN THE AGE OF OUR EQUIPMENT AND THE
PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR PLANTS AND PRESSES. SOME OF OUR FACILITIES ALSO HAVE
OVERLAPPING CUSTOMER BASES AND GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO
RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO MAKE OUR
OPERATIONS MORE PRODUCTIVE AND MORE PROFITABLE. WHILE RESTRUCTURINGS ARE
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATING RESULTS OVER TIME, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES MAY
BE INCURRED BEFORE THE BENEFITS, IF ANY, ARE REALIZED. AS A RESULT, WE MAY
INCUR MATERIAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND
LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE HAVE NOT FINALIZED ANY RESTRUCTURING PLANS FOR
2007, BUT EXPECT TO INCUR RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN 2007 WITHIN THE RANGE OF
CHARGES THAT WE HAVE INCURRED OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. FUTURE RESTRUCTURINGS
MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, AND FUTURE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS AND LIQUIDITY. 

 OUR
OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS COMPLEX AND INCREASINGLY STRINGENT
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENTS AND
CLEANUPS OF SITES, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FUTURE. 

 WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE
VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS,
INCLUDING THOSE GOVERNING AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, THE GENERATION,
STORAGE, HANDLING, USE AND TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, AND EMPLOYEE
HEALTH AND SAFETY. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FINES OR PENALTIES
ASSESSED FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND TO CLAIMS AND
LITIGATION BASED UPON THOSE LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE PAID AN 80,000 PENALTY TO
THE EPA IN JANUARY 2005 TO SETTLE ALLEGATIONS THAT OUR FACILITY IN
MODESTO, CALIFORNIA HAD FAILED TO ACCURATELY REPORT CERTAIN CHEMICALS HANDLED
AT THAT FACILITY. AS AN OWNER OF REAL PROPERTY AND A GENERATOR OF HAZARDOUS
WASTES, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS IMPOSING LIABILITY FOR THE CLEANUP OF
CONTAMINATED PROPERTY, INCLUDING OUR CURRENTLY AND FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED
PROPERTIES AS WELL AS OFFSITE LOCATIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE SENT OUR WASTES FOR
DISPOSAL. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT SOME OF OUR CURRENT AND
FORMER PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS AT SITES TO WHICH WE HAVE SENT WASTES FOR
DISPOSAL. AS PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, WE ARE CURRENTLY
INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATORY OR REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES. 

 FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATORY ACTIONS AT OUR OWNED AND OPERATING FACILITY
IN WATSONVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND AT A PROPERTY THAT WE FORMERLY OWNED AND
OPERATED AS A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DAYTON, NEW JERSEY. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
A RESERVE IN THE AMOUNT OF 1,190,000 TO COVER THE COST OF CLEANING UP
CONTAMINATION AT THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT AND FORMER PROPERTIES. WE HAVE
ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY UNDER CERCLA WITH
RESPECT TO APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN OFFSITE LOCATIONS TO WHICH WE SENT WASTE
MATERIALS FOR DISPOSAL IN THE PAST. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RESERVE TOTALING 480,000
TO COVER OUR ANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AT CERTAIN OF THESE SITES. THE TOTAL COST
OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF REGULATORY,
TECHNICAL AND FACTUAL ISSUES, SOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED. WHILE WE
BELIEVE THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER PRESENTLY IDENTIFIED
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, THE DISCOVERY OF ADDITIONAL CONTAMINANTS OR THE
IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL CLEANUP OBLIGATIONS AT THESE OR OTHER SITES COULD
RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT RESERVED AMOUNTS WILL BE
ADEQUATE TO COVER THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF THESE LIABILITIES OR THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE OR BE IDENTIFIED IN THE FUTURE. 

 FURTHERMORE, FUTURE
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPOSE STRICTER COMPLIANCE
REQUIREMENTS ON THE ALUMINUM INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, BY THE END OF 2007, CERTAIN
OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE FACILITIES IN GAINESVILLE,
GEORGIA; MONTREAL, QUEBEC, AND GIRARD, OHIO, MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH
MORE STRINGENT AIR EMISSION REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO METAL PARTS COATING
OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE PRECISE EFFECT OF THESE OR OTHER
FUTURE CHANGES TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THESE OR OTHER
FUTURE REQUIREMENTS MAY MAKE IT NECESSARY, AT COSTS WHICH MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL
AND IN EXCESS OF OUR ESTIMATES, TO RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES WITH ADDITIONAL

35 

POLLUTION-CONTROL
EQUIPMENT AND TO UNDERTAKE NEW MEASURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE STORAGE,
TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF BY-PRODUCTS AND WASTES. WE ARE NOT A PARTY
TO ANY JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. 

 WE
HAVE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNEXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT
PLANS AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS,
OR IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE ARE INACCURATE. 

 WE PROVIDE A NUMBER OF
QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND
OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS TO CERTAIN UNION, NON-UNION AND
EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO
MAKE UNEXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS. BASED ON OUR VALUATION AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006, THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED DEFINED BENEFIT
PENSION HAD AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY 18.3 MILLION ON A
PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BASIS. IN ADDITION, OUR UNFUNDED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
WITH RESPECT TO OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.9 MILLION
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN 2006, WE MADE CASH PAYMENTS OF 11.0 MILLION
AND IN 2007, WE EXPECT TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS OF 6.1 MILLION FOR THESE BENEFIT
OBLIGATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS
INCLUDING THE RATE USED TO DISCOUNT OUR FUTURE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, THE LONG-TERM
RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEE
WORKFORCE, INCLUDING SALARY INCREASES, MEDICAL COSTS, RETIREMENT AGE AND
MORTALITY. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY IN A
PARTICULAR PERIOD COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BECAUSE OF ADDITIONAL REQUIRED
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AS A RESULT
OF CAPITAL MARKET RETURNS THAT ARE LESS THAN THEIR ASSUMED LONG-TERM RATE
OF RETURN, BY A DECLINE IN THE INTEREST RATE USED TO DISCOUNT OUR FUTURE
ESTIMATED LIABILITY, INCREASED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER CHANGES MANDATED
BY LAW OR BY CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE
REQUIRED TO MAKE UNEXPECTED CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS IN THE
FUTURE, WE WOULD BE PREVENTED FROM USING SUCH CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES, WHICH
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

 WE
MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY WORK STOPPAGES AND OTHER LABOR MATTERS. 

 AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2006, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 1,900, OR 64 , OF
WHOM WERE COVERED UNDER UNION CONTRACTS. THE CONTRACT AT OUR MOUNTAINTOP,
PENNSYLVANIA FACILITY EXPIRED ON MARCH 1, 2006. DESPITE REACHING AN
AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION BARGAINING COMMITTEE, THE EMPLOYEES DID NOT RATIFY THE
AGREEMENT, AND THE EMPLOYEES AT THIS FACILITY WENT ON STRIKE EFFECTIVE MAY 1,
2006. WE FINALIZED AN AGREEMENT ON MAY 5, 2006, AND THE EMPLOYEES AT THIS
FACILITY WENT BACK TO WORK THAT DAY. THE CONTRACTS COVERING OUR NILES, OHIO AND
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA FACILITIES WERE SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED DURING 2006.
THREE MORE CONTRACTS WILL EXPIRE IN 2007, INCLUDING EXPIRATIONS OF OUR
CONTRACTS COVERING OUR BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND CALGARY, ALBERTA FACILITIES,
WHICH EACH EXPIRE ON APRIL 30, 2007. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RESOLVE ANY OF
THESE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT WORK STOPPAGES OR SIGNIFICANT
INCREASES IN COSTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND OPERATING RESULTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FOUR WORK STOPPAGES IN
THE LAST TEN YEARS, INCLUDING THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND PRIOR TO THAT, A ONE-WEEK
WORK STOPPAGE IN MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO IN 2003. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS WILL BE SATISFACTORY OR
THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOUNTER FURTHER STRIKES, UNIONIZATION EFFORTS OR OTHER TYPES
OF CONFLICTS WITH LABOR UNIONS OR OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHER, EXISTING UNION
AGREEMENTS MAY NOT PREVENT A STRIKE OR WORK STOPPAGE AT ANY OF OUR
FACILITIES IN THE FUTURE. 

 WE
DEPEND ON THE SERVICE OF KEY INDIVIDUALS, THE LOSS OF WHOM COULD MATERIALLY
HARM OUR BUSINESS. 

 OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND,
IN PART, ON THE EFFORTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES,
INCLUDING TIMOTHY R.J. STUBBS, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT
ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO REPLACE ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE
NEAR FUTURE, THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR OTHER
KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

36 

WE
ARE CONTROLLED BY OUR PRINCIPAL EQUITYHOLDER, WHICH HAS THE POWER TO TAKE
UNILATERAL ACTION. 

 AFFILIATES OF SUN CAPITAL
OWN 90.4 OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND 100 OF OUR VOTING COMMON STOCK, AND, AS A
RESULT, CONTROL OUR BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND POLICIES. THREE OF OUR DIRECTORS ARE
EMPLOYED BY AFFILIATES OF SUN CAPITAL. CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR IN WHICH THE
INTERESTS OF AFFILIATES OF SUN CAPITAL COULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS
OF THE HOLDERS OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES. IN ADDITION, AFFILIATES OF SUN CAPITAL
MAY PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY, IN THEIR
JUDGMENT, ENHANCE THEIR EQUITY INVESTMENT, EVEN THOUGH SUCH TRANSACTIONS MIGHT
INVOLVE RISKS TO HOLDERS OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES. SEE CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND
RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITY OWNERSHIP AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS. 

 OUR INVESTMENT IN
AND RELATIONSHIP WITH AAG MAY FACE UNCERTAINTIES. 

 WE HAVE A 25.01 OWNERSHIP
INTEREST IN ASIA ALUMINUM GROUP LIMITED, OR AAG BY VIRTUE OF AN INVESTMENT BY
A PRIOR OWNER. ANY DECREASE OR LOSS IN THE DIVIDEND WE RECEIVE FROM AAG WOULD
NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CASH FLOW. OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT PARTNER, ASIA
ALUMINUM HOLDINGS LIMITED, OR AAH WAS FOUNDED IN 1992, AND WAS A PUBLICLY
TRADED COMPANY LISTED ON THE MAIN BOARD OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE OF HONG KONG,
UNTIL IT WAS PRIVATIZED IN 2006. AAG IS CURRENTLY INVESTING SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
IN A NEW FACILITY IN MAINLAND CHINA, AND THE SIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENT
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INVESTMENT MAY DECREASE OR ELIMINATE AAG S EXCESS CASH,
WHICH MAY DECREASE OR ELIMINATE CASH AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF THE ANNUAL
DIVIDEND WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY
TO EXERCISE ANY CONTROL OVER THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF AAG
THROUGH OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST. HOWEVER, SO LONG AS WE RETAIN AT LEAST
A 10 OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF AAG, CERTAIN SPECIFIED ACTIONS BY AAG REQUIRE OUR
PRIOR APPROVAL. IF A DISAGREEMENT ARISES BETWEEN US AND AAH WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ACTION REQUIRING OUR CONSENT, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THIS DISAGREEMENT,
WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL OUR ENTIRE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AAG TO AAH. IN
THE EVENT WE EXERCISE THIS RIGHT, AAH WILL PURCHASE OUR SHARES OF AAG AT A
PRICE AGREED UPON BY US AND AAH, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, AT A
PRICE DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT INTERNATIONAL FIRM OF ACCOUNTANTS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AAG SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT. IF WE WERE TO SELL
OUR INVESTMENT IN AAG, WE WOULD LOSE OUR RIGHT TO THE ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND. 

 THE OPERATIONS OF AAG ARE
SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY, WHICH MAY
INCLUDE: DEPENDENCE ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF END-USER MARKETS; SEASONAL
SLOWDOWNS IN THE END-USER MARKETS; THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE
ALUMINUM EXTRUSION INDUSTRY; WILLINGNESS OF CUSTOMERS TO ACCEPT SUBSTITUTES FOR
EXTRUSIONS; EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR CATASTROPHIC LOSS AT ANY OF OUR FACILITIES;
RISING COSTS OR SHORTAGES OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS; RISING COSTS OR
SHORTAGES OF ALUMINUM BILLET; AND LABOR STOPPAGES. AS A RESULT OF THESE
FACTORS, AAG S PROFITS MAY BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE CASH AVAILABLE TO
PAY THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND OR MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF AAG TO FUND ITS
OPERATIONS THROUGH ITS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. 

 IN
ADDITION, OUR INVESTMENT IN AAG IS SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT
IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

 FLUCTUATIONS
IN CURRENCY VALUATION; 

 CURRENCY
INCONVERTIBILITY; 

 EXPROPRIATION
AND CONFISCATORY TAXATION; 

 LAWS RELATING
TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT; 

 REGULATION OR
REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, PERMITS AND LICENSES; AND 

 POLITICAL
INSTABILITY. 

 WE MAY BE REQUIRED
TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF AAG. 

 PURSUANT TO THE AAG
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, WE AGREED IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES UPON THE
REQUEST OF AAG S LENDERS TO PROVIDE GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN BORROWINGS OF AAG
THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON JUNE 8, 2001, THE DATE WE ENTERED INTO THE AAG
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, IN PROPORTION TO OUR APPROXIMATELY 25 EQUITY OWNERSHIP
IN AAG IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF SUCH BORROWINGS ARE CANCELLED BY A LENDER OR
ARE REQUIRED BY A LENDER TO BE RESTRUCTURED OR RENEWED. WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED
OR BEEN ASKED TO GUARANTEE ANY BORROWINGS OF AAG UNDER THIS PROVISION SINCE THE
EXECUTION OF THE AAG SHAREHOLDERS 

37 

AGREEMENT
ON JUNE 8, 2001. THE AGGREGATE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT (BASED ON
EXCHANGE RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006) OF THE BORROWINGS WE POTENTIALLY
COULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE AT THE TIME WE ENTERED INTO THE AAG
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT WAS OUR APPROXIMATELY 25 SHARE OF APPROXIMATELY
 71.6 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 17.9 MILLION. BASED ON THE
INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM AAG TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE BORROWINGS
HAVE BEEN CANCELLED, REPAID, RESTRUCTURED OR REFINANCED. BASED ON OUR
INTERPRETATION OF THE AAG SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR POTENTIAL
OBLIGATION TO GUARANTEE ANY ITEM OF THE SPECIFIED BORROWINGS APPLIES ONLY TO
THE FIRST SUCH CANCELLATION, RESTRUCTURING OR RENEWAL THEREOF AND IS THEREAFTER
EXTINGUISHED. AS A RESULT, BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM AAG
TO DATE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE ANY AMOUNTS
OUTSTANDING AS OF THE DATE HEREOF. BASED ON A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE
AAG SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT BY THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER AND BASED ON INFORMATION
WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM AAG TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THE MAXIMUM U.S. DOLLAR
EQUIVALENT (BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006) OF THE
BORROWINGS WE POTENTIALLY COULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE AT THIS TIME IS OUR
APPROXIMATELY 25 SHARE OF APPROXIMATELY 88.3 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY
 22.1 MILLION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE CORRECTLY INTERPRETED THE AAG
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, THE AAG SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT AND OUR INTERPRETATION
THEREOF ARE NOT FREE FROM DOUBT AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER WILL NOT CHALLENGE OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE AAG
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE INDEBTEDNESS OF AAG
AND AAG WERE TO DEFAULT ON SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION. 

 AAG
AND OUR OTHER CHINA SOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY
TO EFFECTIVELY OUTSOURCE ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS FROM THEM. 

 THROUGH OUR SUPPLY
ARRANGEMENT WITH AAG, WE USE AAG FOR APPROXIMATELY 93 OF OUR TOTAL IMPORT
VOLUME, WHICH AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 5 OF OUR SHIPMENT VOLUME IN 2006. AAG
AND OUR OTHER CHINA SOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF CHINA S POLITICAL,
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AND THESE RISKS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
EFFECTIVELY OUTSOURCE ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS FROM AAG AND OUR OTHER CHINA SOURCES.
THE ROLE OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS SIGNIFICANT, AND
ITS POLICIES TOWARD ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION COULD CHANGE, RESULTING IN GREATER
RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF AAG AND OTHER CHINA SOURCES TO DO BUSINESS WITH
US. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT COULD REDUCE ITS EXPORT SUBSIDIES, WHICH WOULD MAKE
IT MORE COSTLY FOR US TO OUTSOURCE ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS TO CHINA. ALUMINUM
EXTRUSIONS FROM AAG AND OUR OTHER CHINA SOURCES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO SHIPPING
AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION DELAYS AND RISKS, AND THERE MAY BE PRODUCTION
DISRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF CONSTRUCTION OR OTHER DELAYS AT AAG S NEW FACILITY.
IF OUR CHINA SOURCES ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH EXTRUSIONS OR IF THEIR
SHIPMENTS WERE TO EXPERIENCE PROLONGED DELAYS OR SUFFER DAMAGES WHILE IN
TRANSIT, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AN EQUIVALENT
SHIPMENT VOLUME IN OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA FACILITIES. OUR SUPPLY
AGREEMENT WITH AAG DOES NOT REQUIRE AAG TO SUPPLY US WITH ANY SPECIFIED
QUANTITY OF EXTRUSIONS. IF THE VOLUME OF EXTRUSIONS AAG IS WILLING TO SUPPLY US
WERE TO DECREASE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO NEW SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER SUPPLIERS IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT VOLUME OF QUALITY
PRODUCTS AT PRICES THAT ARE SATISFACTORY TO US. 

 FLUCTUATIONS
IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
RECORDED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPARABILITY
OF OUR RESULTS BETWEEN FINANCIAL PERIODS. 

 WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN
CANADA. APPROXIMATELY 11 OF OUR NET SALES IN 2006 WERE MADE IN CANADIAN
DOLLARS. WE INCUR CURRENCY TRANSACTION RISK WHENEVER WE ENTER INTO EITHER A
PURCHASE OR SALE TRANSACTION USING A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF
THE TRANSACTING ENTITY. THE U.S. DOLLAR TO CANADIAN DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE MAY
VARY FROM THE TIME WE INVOICE THE SHIPMENT AND THE TIME WE ARE PAID, WHICH
COULD RESULT IN A REALIZED CURRENCY LOSS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IF WE
HAVE NOT HEDGED OUR EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS CORRECTLY. IN ADDITION,
WE MAY SET PRICES FOR OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS IN U.S. DOLLARS AND IF THESE PRICES
ARE NOT ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF THE CURRENCIES, WE COULD
EXPERIENCE REDUCED OPERATING MARGINS. THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR SALES IN
CANADA VARIES WITH CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR
AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR. THE RESULTS OF THE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL
POSITION OF OUR CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES ARE REPORTED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS AND THEN
TRANSLATED INTO 

38 

U.S.
DOLLARS AT THE APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES FOR INCLUSION IN OUR COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE REPORT OUR RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS AND OUR FINANCIAL
RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND
THE CANADIAN DOLLAR. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS, WE WILL HAVE CANADIAN-DOLLAR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING
CREDIT FACILITY. TO THE EXTENT THE U.S. DOLLAR DECLINES AGAINST THE
CANADIAN DOLLAR, OUR INTEREST EXPENSE FOR OUR CANADIAN DOLLAR-DENOMINATED
INDEBTEDNESS WILL INCREASE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. FOR A DESCRIPTION
OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, SEE CAPITALIZATION. 

 WE
MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES OPERATING AS A STAND ALONE COMPANY. 

 WE HAVE HISTORICALLY
OPERATED AS A BUSINESS UNIT OF NOVAR PLC AND SUBSEQUENTLY HONEYWELL. PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 2,
2006, WE HAD NOT OPERATED AS A STAND-ALONE COMPANY, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE
DIFFICULTY OPERATING AS A STAND-ALONE COMPANY. WE RECEIVED FINANCIAL SUPPORT
AND TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FROM NOVAR PLC AND HONEYWELL,
INCLUDING CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT, TAX, LEGAL AND TREASURY SERVICES. ALTHOUGH
WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM ALL OF THESE SERVICES INTERNALLY OR
THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE
SERVICES AT COMPARABLE COSTS AFTER FEBRUARY 2, 2006. 

 BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO LEVERAGE OUR STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION WITH NOVAR PLC AND HONEYWELL IN THE
PAST, THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT MAY NOT
REFLECT WHAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS WOULD
HAVE BEEN HAD WE OPERATED AS A SEPARATE, STAND-ALONE COMPANY WITHOUT THE SHARED
RESOURCES OF NOVAR PLC AND HONEYWELL, AS APPLICABLE, FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED,
AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. 

 WE WILL INCUR
SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING COSTS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW REQUIREMENTS. 

 IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION
OF OUR 11 1 2 
SECOND-PRIORITY SENIOR SECURED NOTES, WE BECAME SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT OF 2002. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT, SYSTEMS
AND RESOURCES AND CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING COSTS. THE EXCHANGE ACT
REQUIRES THAT WE FILE ANNUAL, QUARTERLY AND CURRENT REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT REQUIRES THAT WE
MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING, SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT WILL BE REQUIRED.
THIS MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS. UPON
ISSUANCE OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES, WE WILL BEGIN TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING
COSTS AS A RESULT OF HAVING TO COMPLY WITH THE EXCHANGE ACT AND THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INCUR APPROXIMATELY 1.0 MILLION
OF COSTS IN 2007 AND APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION OF COSTS IN 2008 AS A
RESULT OF HAVING TO COMPLY WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE
THAT WE WILL INCUR APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION OF COSTS ANNUALLY AS A
RESULT OF HAVING TO COMPLY WITH THE EXCHANGE ACT. 

 WE
MAY PURSUE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
BUSINESS. 

 WE
MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONSIDER ACQUIRING COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES OR BUSINESSES.
TO DO SO, WE WOULD NEED TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, NEGOTIATE
ACCEPTABLE ACQUISITION TERMS AND OBTAIN APPROPRIATE FINANCING. ANY ACQUISITION
THAT WE PURSUE, WHETHER OR NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, MAY INVOLVE RISKS,
INCLUDING: 

 THE DIVERSION
OF OUR CAPITAL AND OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS ISSUES AND
OPPORTUNITIES; 

 DIFFICULTIES
IN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATING COMPANIES OR BUSINESSES THAT WE ACQUIRE, INCLUDING
PERSONNEL, FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS; 

 MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FISCAL QUARTERS
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION AS IT IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS;
AND 

 THE INCURRENCE
OF DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION.

 BUSINESS 

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE TERMS THE COMPANY, WE, OUR, AND US ARE USED IN THIS 2020 FORM 10-K TO REFER TO NORTHWEST PIPE COMPANY OR ONE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OR TO ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF OREGON IN 1966. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 NORTHWEST PIPE COMPANY IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER FOR WATER RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO BEING THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF ENGINEERED STEEL WATER PIPELINE SYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA, WE PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY PRECAST AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCTS, PERMALOK STEEL CASING PIPE, BAR-WRAPPED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE, AS WELL AS LININGS, COATINGS, JOINTS, AND ONE OF THE LARGEST OFFERINGS OF FITTINGS AND SPECIALIZED COMPONENTS. OUR TEN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED TO MEET GROWING WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. WE PROVIDE SOLUTION-BASED PRODUCTS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MARKETS INCLUDING WATER TRANSMISSION AND INFRASTRUCTURE, WATER AND WASTEWATER PLANT PIPING, STRUCTURAL STORMWATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS, TRENCHLESS TECHNOLOGY, AND PIPELINE REHABILITATION. OUR PROMINENT POSITION IS BASED ON A WIDELY-RECOGNIZED REPUTATION FOR QUALITY, SERVICE, AND MANUFACTURING TO MEET PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS IN ALL CATEGORIES INCLUDING HIGHLY-CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENTS. 
 
 OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GENERALLY TO INSTALLATION CONTRACTORS, WHO INCLUDE OUR PRODUCTS IN THEIR BIDS TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND MUNICIPAL AGENCIES, PRIVATELY-OWNED WATER COMPANIES, OR DEVELOPERS FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE OUR SALES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DRIVEN BY SPENDING ON URBAN GROWTH AND NEW WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A RECENT TREND TOWARDS SPENDING ON WATER INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENT, REPAIR, AND UPGRADE. WITHIN THE TOTAL RANGE OF PRODUCTS, OUR STEEL PIPE TENDS TO FIT THE LARGER-DIAMETER, HIGHER-PRESSURE PIPELINE APPLICATIONS, WHILE OUR PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS MAINLY SERVE STORMWATER AND SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS. 
 
 WITH STEADY POPULATION GROWTH AND REGIONAL COMMUNITY EXPANSION, AS WELL AS CONTINUED DROUGHT CONDITIONS, EXISTING WATER SOURCES HAVE BECOME STRESSED, AND WE SEE CONTINUED OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
 RECENT STRATEGIC ACTIONS 
 
 ON JANUARY 31, 2020, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF 100 OF GENEVA PIPE AND PRECAST COMPANY (FKA GENEVA PIPE COMPANY, INC.) FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF 49.4 MILLION. GENEVA IS A CONCRETE PIPE AND PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURER BASED IN UTAH. THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDED OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCT CAPABILITIES BY ADDING ADDITIONAL REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE CAPACITY AND A FULL LINE OF PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS INCLUDING STORM DRAINS AND MANHOLES, CATCH BASINS, VAULTS, AND CURB INLETS AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE LINED PRODUCTS THAT EXTEND THE LIFE OF CONCRETE PIPE AND MANHOLES FOR SEWER APPLICATIONS. OPERATIONS HAVE CONTINUED WITH GENEVA'S PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT AND WORKFORCE AT ITS THREE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. 
 
 IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 P ANDEMIC ON O UR BUSINESS 
 
 IN MARCH 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED COVID-19 A PANDEMIC. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD IMPLEMENTING INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEASURES TO HELP CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, INCLUDING QUARANTINES, SHELTER IN PLACE AND STAY AT HOME ORDERS, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, BUSINESS CURTAILMENTS, SCHOOL CLOSURES, AND OTHER MEASURES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE ENACTED FISCAL AND MONETARY STIMULUS MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. 
 
 CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES AND WITH STATE AND LOCAL ORDERS TO DATE, WE CURRENTLY CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AS WE PRODUCE CRITICAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS. WE HAVE TAKEN PROACTIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING FREQUENT CLEANING AND DISINFECTION OF WORKSPACES, PROVIDING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, INSTITUTING SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES, AND OFFERING REMOTE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. 
 
 IN EARLY APRIL 2020, WE WERE ORDERED TO CLOSE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SAN LUIS R O COLORADO, MEXICO SLRC AS A RESULT OF MANDATES MADE BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES THAT COMPANIES THAT DO NOT CARRY OUT ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO MUST SUSPEND BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO COMBAT AND ERADICATE THE EXISTENCE AND TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19. WE DIVERTED ORDERS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO OUR UNITED STATES-BASED FACILITIES DURING THIS CLOSURE. IN EARLY JUNE 2020, THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DETERMINED OUR SLRC FACILITY WAS ESSENTIAL, AND ALLOWED WEEKLY INCREASES TO OUR WORKFORCE. BY JULY 2020, OPERATIONS AT OUR SLRC FACILITY WERE FULLY RESTORED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WHILE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED, INCLUDING NEW INFORMATION WHICH MAY EMERGE CONCERNING THE SEVERITY OF THE PANDEMIC AND ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES TO CONTAIN THE PANDEMIC OR TREAT ITS IMPACT. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPACTS ON GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE LONG-TERM POTENTIAL TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUNDING OF MUNICIPAL PROJECTS, AND THE CONTINUED DISRUPTIONS TO AND VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS REMAIN UNKNOWN. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON ALL ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 OUR INDUSTRY 
 
 MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS ANTIQUATED AND MANY AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY EPA ), BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN CRITICAL NEED OF UPDATE, REPAIR, OR REPLACEMENT. IN ITS 2015 DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT RELEASED IN MARCH 2018, THE EPA ESTIMATED THE NATION WILL NEED TO SPEND 473 BILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BY 2034 TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THE PUBLIC. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS ASCE HAS GIVEN POOR RATINGS TO MANY ASPECTS OF THE UNITED STATES WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR 2017 INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT CARD FOR DRINKING WATER . IN ITS FAILURE TO ACT: CLOSING THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT GAP FOR AMERICA S ECONOMIC FUTURE STUDY PUBLISHED IN 2016, THE ASCE CONCLUDES THAT SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF MANY MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEMS ARE 40 TO 50 YEARS OLD AND ARE NEARING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES, AND ESTIMATES THERE WILL BE 150 BILLION IN CAPITAL INVESTMENT NEEDS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE BY 2025, AND 204 BILLION IN CAPITAL INVESTMENT NEEDS BY 2040. THE AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION CONCLUDED IN THEIR 2012 REPORT, BURIED NO LONGER: CONFRONTING AMERICA S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE , THAT FROM 2011 TO 2035 MORE THAN 1 TRILLION WILL BE NEEDED TO REPAIR AND EXPAND DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
 A COMBINATION OF NEW POPULATION CENTERS, RISING DEMAND ON DEVELOPED WATER SOURCES, SUBSTANTIAL UNDERINVESTMENT IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, AND INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATORY POLICIES ARE DRIVING DEMAND FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE TRENDS ARE INTENSIFYING THE NEED FOR NEW WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE NEED TO UPGRADE, REPAIR, AND REPLACE EXISTING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS RELATED TO WATER TRANSMISSION, BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD IMPACT GOVERNMENTAL AND PUBLIC WATER AGENCY PROJECTS IN THE NEAR-TERM. 
 
 ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU, THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY 56 MILLION PEOPLE BETWEEN 2021 AND 2050. THE RESULTING INCREASE IN DEMAND WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, AS THE EXISTING UNITED STATES WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE WATER TO MILLIONS OF NEW RESIDENTS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOURCES OF WATER AT GREATER DISTANCES FROM POPULATION CENTERS WILL DRIVE THE DEMAND FOR NEW WATER TRANSMISSION LINES. THE 2021 DODGE CONSTRUCTION OUTLOOK FORECASTS U.S. PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION STARTS IN 2021 WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS 2020 LEVELS. 
 
 AS WATER SYSTEMS DEGRADE OVER TIME AND CAUSE FAILURES, MANY CURRENT WATER SUPPLY SOURCES ARE IN DANGER OF BEING EXHAUSTED. MUCH OF THE DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN MAJOR CITIES WAS BUILT IN THE MID-20TH CENTURY WITH A LIFESPAN OF 75 TO 100 YEARS. IN ITS 2017 INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT CARD FOR DRINKING WATER , THE ASCE ESTIMATES THERE ARE 240,000 WATER MAIN BREAKS PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, WASTING OVER TWO TRILLION GALLONS OF TREATED DRINKING WATER, WHICH EQUATES TO 14 TO 18 OF EACH DAY S TREATED WATER. THE ASCE ALSO REPORTS THAT WITH UTILITIES AVERAGING A PIPE REPLACEMENT RATE OF 0.5 PER YEAR, IT WILL TAKE AN ESTIMATED 200 YEARS TO REPLACE THE SYSTEM NEARLY DOUBLE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE PIPES. THESE AGING WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS WILL DRIVE DEMAND FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT. 
 
 FINALLY, THE INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE QUALITY OF DRINKING WATER AND EFFICIENT WATER USAGE HAS RESULTED IN MORE STRINGENT APPLICATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF HEIGHTENED PUBLIC AWARENESS IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO DEMAND IN THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INDUSTRY. 
 
 OUR LARGE-DIAMETER, ENGINEERED WELDED STEEL PIPELINE SYSTEMS ARE UTILIZED IN WATER, ENERGY, STRUCTURAL, AND PLANT PIPING APPLICATIONS. OUR CORE MARKET IS THE LARGE-DIAMETER, HIGH-PRESSURE PORTION OF A WATER TRANSMISSION PIPELINE THAT IS TYPICALLY AT THE UPPER END OF A PIPELINE SYSTEM. THIS IS THE PORTION OF THE OVERALL WATER PIPELINE THAT GENERALLY TRANSPORTS WATER FROM THE SOURCE TO A TREATMENT PLANT OR FROM A TREATMENT PLANT INTO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, RATHER THAN THE SMALL LINES THAT DELIVER WATER DIRECTLY INTO HOUSEHOLDS. WE BELIEVE THE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR THE ENGINEERED WELDED STEEL PIPELINE SYSTEM PRODUCTS SOLD WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 1.4 BILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR HIGH-QUALITY PRECAST AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCTS AND BAR-WRAPPED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE ARE TYPICALLY USED IN NON-PRESSURE, GRAVITY FED SEWER AND STORMWATER APPLICATIONS. DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS HOUSING STARTS, POPULATION GROWTH, AND INTEREST RATES. IN 2020, ANNUAL HOUSING STARTS IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED TO 1.4 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 7.0 FROM 2019, ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU. 
 
 FEDERAL INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF THE AGING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDE THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCY FINANCE CENTER AT THE EPA AND THE WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. THE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE NATION ACT SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER 2016, AUTHORIZES NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND CONTAINS SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS IN REGARDS TO DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCORDING TO ITS 2020 ANNUAL REPORT , THE EPA S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION ACT PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES CREDIT ASSISTANCE FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, CLOSED 27 LOANS TOTALING OVER 4 BILLION IN 2020. ADDITIONALLY, THE DRINKING WATER STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUND, A FEDERAL-STATE PARTNERSHIP AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP WATER SYSTEMS AND STATES ACHIEVE THE HEALTH PROTECTION OBJECTIVES OF THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, AWARDED 6.1 BILLION IN GRANTS FOR INTENDED USE PLANS DURING THE 2019-2020 FISCAL YEAR, ACCORDING TO BLUEFIELD RESEARCH S JULY 2020 DATA INSIGHT STATE REVOLVING FUNDS: BREAKING DOWN PROJECT DATA BY REQUESTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS . 
 
 IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL INITIATIVES, INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE ALSO TAKING ACTION. IN NOVEMBER 2014, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPROVED THE WATER QUALITY, SUPPLY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT WHICH AUTHORIZES 7.5 BILLION IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS TO FUND STATE WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, SUCH AS PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS, SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER STORAGE, DRINKING WATER PROTECTION, WATER RECYCLING AND ADVANCED WATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY, WATER SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND CONVEYANCE, WASTEWATER TREATMENT, DROUGHT RELIEF, EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES, AND ECOSYSTEM AND WATERSHED PROTECTION AND RESTORATION. THE STATE OF TEXAS HAS EARMARKED 27 BILLION OF FUTURE BOND FUNDING FOR STATE WATER PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS THROUGH THEIR STATE WATER IMPLEMENTATION FUND FOR TEXAS (SWIFT). THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES LOW-INTEREST AND DEFERRED LOANS TO STATE AGENCIES MAKING APPROVED INVESTMENTS IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR STRATEGICALLY LOCATED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN DEMAND. 
 
 BACKLOG 
 
 WE MEASURE BACKLOG AS A KEY METRIC TO EVALUATE THE COMMERCIAL HEALTH OF OUR BUSINESS. BACKLOG REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER SIGNED CONTRACTS FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. BINDING AGREEMENTS RECEIVED BY US MAY BE SUBJECT TO CANCELATION OR POSTPONEMENT; HOWEVER, CANCELATION WOULD OBLIGATE THE CUSTOMER TO PAY THE CONTRACT CONSIDERATION PROPORTIONAL TO THE COSTS WE HAVE INCURRED THROUGH THE CANCELATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019, BACKLOG WAS APPROXIMATELY 167 MILLION AND 199 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY FISCAL PERIOD. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY AMOUNT OF BACKLOG ULTIMATELY WILL BE REALIZED. SEPARATE FROM OUR BACKLOG, WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT WE ARE THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER ON ADDITIONAL PROJECTS, BUT BINDING AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED CONFIRMED ORDERS ). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019, BACKLOG INCLUDING CONFIRMED ORDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 221 MILLION AND 258 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. PROJECTS FOR WHICH A BINDING AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED COULD BE CANCELED.

 MANUFACTURING 
 
 WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE MANUFACTURING BEGINS WITH THE PREPARATION OF ENGINEERED DRAWINGS OF EACH UNIQUE PIECE OF PIPE IN A PROJECT. THESE DRAWINGS ARE PREPARED ON OUR PROPRIETARY COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN SYSTEM AND ARE USED AS BLUEPRINTS TO MANUFACTURE PIPE. AFTER THE DRAWINGS ARE COMPLETED AND APPROVED, THE MANUFACTURING OF ENGINEERED STEEL WATER PIPE BEGINS BY FEEDING A STEEL COIL CONTINUOUSLY AT A SPECIFIED ANGLE INTO A SPIRAL WELD MILL WHICH COLD-FORMS THE BAND INTO A TUBULAR CONFIGURATION WITH A SPIRAL SEAM. AUTOMATED ARC WELDERS, POSITIONED ON BOTH THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE OF THE TUBE, ARE USED TO WELD THE SEAM. THE WELDED PIPE IS THEN CUT AT THE SPECIFIED LENGTH. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FORMING AND WELDING PHASES, THE FINISHED CYLINDER IS TESTED AND INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE 100 RADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF THE WELD SEAM. THE CYLINDERS ARE THEN COATED AND LINED AS SPECIFIED. POSSIBLE COATINGS INCLUDE POLYURETHANE PAINT, POLYETHYLENE TAPE, EPOXIES, CEMENT MORTAR, COAL-TAR ENAMEL, AND PRITEC . THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE CYLINDERS CAN BE LINED WITH CEMENT MORTAR, POLYURETHANE, OR EPOXIES. FOLLOWING COATING AND LINING, CERTAIN PIECES MAY BE CUSTOM FABRICATED AS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT. THIS PROCESS IS PERFORMED AT OUR ON-SITE FABRICATION FACILITIES. COMPLETED PIPES ARE EVALUATED FOR STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY WITH A HYDROTESTER PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. 
 
 WE MANUFACTURE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LINED MANHOLE SYSTEMS, BOX CULVERTS, UTILITY VAULTS, MANHOLES, CATCH BASINS AND INLETS, AND OTHER CUSTOM PRECAST STRUCTURES. PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED USING EITHER A DRY CAST OR WET CAST CONCRETE MIX, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PIECE AND THE NUMBER OF IDENTICAL PIECES TO BE MANUFACTURED. IN THE DRY CAST METHOD, A CONCRETE MIX WITH LOW WATER CONTENT, KNOWN AS ZERO-SLUMP CONCRETE, IS POURED INTO A MOLD AND THEN DENSELY COMPACTED AROUND THE STEEL REINFORCEMENT USING A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING METHODS. THE CONCRETE STRUCTURE IS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE MOLD AND ALLOWED TO CURE IN A HIGH HUMIDITY ENVIRONMENT TO ENSURE PROPER HYDRATION OF THE CONCRETE. THIS METHOD ALLOWS MULTIPLE PIECES TO BE PRODUCED FROM THE SAME MOLD EACH DAY AND IS MOST SUITABLE FOR HIGH VOLUME, REPETITIVE MANUFACTURING. IN THE WET CAST METHOD, A CONCRETE MIX WITH RELATIVELY HIGH WATER CONTENT IS POURED INTO A MOLD AND ALLOWED TO CURE IN THE MOLD, WHICH CAN TAKE FROM FOUR TO 16 HOURS. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE BY PRODUCING A STEEL MESH CAGE, ENCLOSING IT IN A FORM OR MOLD, AND THEN POURING CONCRETE AROUND IT TO PRODUCE THE PIPE. 
 
 TECHNOLOGY. ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HELP US PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. WE HAVE INVESTED IN MODERN WELDING AND INSPECTION EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE BOTH PRODUCTIVITY AND PRODUCT QUALITY. WE OWN INTERLOCKING PIPE JOINING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES (PERMALOK THAT PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE JOINT SOLUTION USED FOR CONNECTING STEEL PIPES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE LICENSED TO MANUFACTURE A CONVENTIONAL REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE WITH A HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE HDPE COMPOSITE LINER TO PROTECT CONCRETE PIPE FROM CORROSION, AND A LINED MANHOLE SYSTEM, WHICH INTEGRATES A PRECAST CONCRETE MONOLITHIC BASE WITH A PLASTIC LINER THAT IS CHEMICALLY RESISTANT TO RAW SEWAGE. 
 
 TO STAY CURRENT WITH TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, WE PARTICIPATE IN TRADE SHOWS, INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS, RESEARCH PROJECTS, AND VENDOR TRIALS OF NEW PRODUCTS. OUR STAFF INCLUDES SOME OF THE MOST TENURED AND EXPERIENCED PIPE MANUFACTURING PROFESSIONALS IN THE NATION.

 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 
 OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOCUS ON INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CONTINUALLY STRIVE TO IMPROVE EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS TO SATISFY CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPAND REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, MAINTAIN OR EXTEND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, INCREASE MARKET SHARE, AND REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS. 
 
 IN OCTOBER 2020, WE INTRODUCED OUR NEW PERFECT PIPE AND PERFECT LINED MANHOLE SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED OF REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE LINED WITH EITHER A HDPE OR PLASTIC LINING SYSTEM THAT IMPROVES HYDRAULICS. THE SMOOTH INTERNAL SURFACE PROVIDES OPTIMAL FLOW COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE. ADDITIONALLY, THE SUPER-STRONG INTEGRATED STRUCTURE ELIMINATES PIPE DEFLECTION POTENTIAL AND MINIMIZES THE RISK OF LONG-TERM FLOW RESTRICTION. TOGETHER, THESE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OFFER A LINED SYSTEM THAT CAN CONNECT TO ANY MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER SYSTEM AND ELONGATES THE SYSTEM'S LIFE. 
 
 ALSO IN 2020, WE OBTAINED A PATENT FOR OUR PERMALOK PR JOINT, CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR PIPE RAMMING. WE TEAMED WITH PIPE RAMMING CONTRACTORS AND EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF ENERGY TRANSFER LOSS DURING RAMMING A MECHANICAL JOINT, WHICH TYPICALLY RESULTED IN A JACKING LIMITATION OF LESS THAN 200 LINEAR FEET DEPENDING ON SOIL CONDITIONS. THE PERMALOK PR JOINT UTILIZES A PROPRIETARY NEGATIVE INTERFERENCE FIT CONNECTION TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL TO REDUCE ENERGY TRANSFER LOSS DURING RAMMING OPERATIONS. THE RESULT IS LONGER DRIVES WITHOUT WELDING, ENABLING TEAMS TO COMPLETE PIPE RAM PROJECTS FASTER THAN EVER. 
 
 MARKETING 
 
 OUR STEEL PIPE MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATIONS IN OREGON, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, WEST VIRGINIA, MISSOURI, AND MEXICO ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY SERVE CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. THE PRIMARY CUSTOMERS FOR OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE PRODUCTS ARE INSTALLATION CONTRACTORS FOR PROJECTS FUNDED BY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. OUR MARKETING STRATEGY EMPHASIZES EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL WATER PROJECTS, PROMOTION OF SPECIFICATIONS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCTS, AND CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE PROJECT DESIGNERS AND OWNERS THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PHASE. OUR IN-HOUSE SALES FORCE IS COMPRISED OF SALES REPRESENTATIVES, ENGINEERS, AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES, CONTRACTORS, AND ENGINEERING FIRMS, OFTEN YEARS IN ADVANCE OF PROJECTS BEING BID. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE PLANNED PROJECTS AT EARLY STAGES, AND PURSUE THESE PROJECTS BY OFFERING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES. AFTER AN AGENCY COMPLETES A DESIGN, THEY PUBLICIZE THE UPCOMING BID FOR A WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECT. WE THEN OBTAIN DETAILED PLANS AND DEVELOP OUR ESTIMATE FOR THE PIPE PORTION OF THE PROJECT. WE TYPICALLY BID TO INSTALLATION CONTRACTORS WHO INCLUDE OUR BID IN THEIR PROPOSALS TO PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. A PUBLIC WATER AGENCY GENERALLY AWARDS THE ENTIRE PROJECT TO THE CONTRACTOR WITH THE LOWEST RESPONSIVE BID.

COMPETITION 
 
 MOST WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE COMPETITIVELY BID AND PRICE COMPETITION IS VIGOROUS. PRICE COMPETITION MAY REDUCE THE GROSS MARGIN ON SALES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL PROFITABILITY. OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE TIMELY DELIVERY, ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMIZED SPECIFICATIONS, AND HIGH FREIGHT COSTS WHICH MAY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN OTHER MARKET AREAS TO COMPETE WITH US. WITH WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN OREGON, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, WEST VIRGINIA, MISSOURI, AND MEXICO, WE BELIEVE WE CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY COMPETE THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND SOUTHWESTERN CANADA ARE IMPERIAL PIPE AND WEST COAST PIPE. EAST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS ARE THOMPSON PIPE GROUP, AMERICAN SPIRALWELD PIPE, AND MID AMERICA PIPE FABRICATING SUPPLY, LLC. OUR THREE PRECAST AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN UTAH HAVE SEVERAL COMPETITORS WHICH ARE PRIMARILY OTHER PRECAST CONCRETE MANUFACTURERS IN THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. 
 
 NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT NEW OR EXISTING COMPETITORS WILL NOT BUILD NEW FACILITIES OR EXPAND CAPACITY WITHIN OUR MARKET AREAS. IN 2019, A COMPETITOR BROKE GROUND ON A NEW SPIRAL WELDED STEEL PIPE PLANT IN TEXAS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL IN 2021. NEW OR EXPANDED FACILITIES OR NEW COMPETITORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE AND MAINTAIN PRODUCT PRICING. 
 
 RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES 
 
 THE MAIN RAW COMPONENT IN OUR STEEL PIPE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS STEEL. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY PURCHASED HOT ROLLED AND GALVANIZED STEEL COIL FROM BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN STEEL MILLS. OUR SUPPLIERS INCLUDE ARCELORMITTAL USA LLC, BIG RIVER STEEL, NUCOR CORPORATION, STEEL DYNAMICS, INC., ALTOS HORNOS DE M XICO S.A.B DE C.V., AND SSAB. STEEL IS NORMALLY PURCHASED AFTER PROJECT AWARD. PURCHASED STEEL REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR COST OF SALES. THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL IN NATURE AND STEEL PRICES FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, INFLUENCED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY COSTS, IMPORT DUTIES, OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAIN RAW COMPONENTS IN OUR PRECAST AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCTS ARE CEMENT AND AGGREGATE, WHICH ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE COMMODITIES. WHEN POSSIBLE, WE SOURCE THESE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS NEAR OUR FACILITIES. WE ALSO RELY ON CERTAIN SUPPLIERS OF COATING MATERIALS, LINING MATERIALS, AND CERTAIN CUSTOM FABRICATED ITEMS. 
 
 WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO SUPPLIERS FOR MOST OF OUR RAW MATERIALS. WE BELIEVE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE POSITIVE AND HAVE NO INDICATION THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR THAT WE WILL BE FORCED TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY. ANY SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS MAY RESULT IN PRODUCTION DELAYS AND COSTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 OUR OPERATIONS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL VARIATIONS AND OUR RESULTS TEND TO BE STRONGER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH YEAR DUE TO TYPICALLY MILDER WEATHER IN THE REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY WEATHER EXTREMES, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE RAIN, HURRICANES, SNOW AND ICE, OR FRIGID TEMPERATURES, WHICH MAY CAUSE TEMPORARY, SHORT-TERM ANOMALIES IN OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN CERTAIN LOCALIZED GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. HOWEVER, THESE IMPACTS USUALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS AS A WHOLE. SEE PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OF THIS 2020 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. 
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND EMPLOYEE SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN MATERIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND DO NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT FUTURE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. NEVERTHELESS, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT, IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR COMPLIANCE OR THAT SUCH COSTS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL.

 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD 956 EMPLOYEES, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE FULL-TIME. APPROXIMATELY 71 OF OUR WORKFORCE IS EMPLOYED ON AN HOURLY BASIS, WHILE 29 IS SALARIED. APPROXIMATELY 7 OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH A SINGLE LABOR UNION. WE CONSIDER OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND THE LABOR UNION TO BE GOOD. 
 
 WE OFFER A WIDE ARRAY OF COMPANY-PAID BENEFITS TO OUR EMPLOYEES BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. BENEFITS MAY VARY BETWEEN COUNTRIES DUE TO CUSTOMARY LOCAL PRACTICES AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE COMPETITIVE RELATIVE TO OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY. 
 
 CULTURE. OUR KEY VALUES ARE CAPTURED IN THE ACRONYM ACT, WHICH STANDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, COMMITMENT, AND TEAMWORK, WHICH WE SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE IN OUR DAILY ACTIONS. 
 
 HEALTH AND SAFETY. OUR GOAL IS TO SEND EACH EMPLOYEE HOME SAFE AT THE END OF THE DAY. AS SUCH, SAFETY IS AT THE CENTRAL CORE OF OUR CULTURE, AND IS INFUSED AT EVERY LEVEL OF OUR ORGANIZATION. MORE THAN JUST POLICY AND PROCEDURE, OUR SAFETY PROGRAM GIVES EQUAL FOCUS TO THE HUMAN SIDE OF SAFETY, INTEGRATING COACHING AND MENTORING EFFORTS WITH COMPLIANCE-DRIVEN APPROACHES. BY INSTILLING A DEEP COMMITMENT TO SAFETY THAT REACHES FROM OUR CEO TO AN APPRENTICE ON THE FLOOR, WE HAVE ACHIEVED INDUSTRY-LEADING SAFETY PERFORMANCE. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, OUR AVERAGE TOTAL RECORDABLE INCIDENT RATE WAS 2.43 AND OUR AVERAGE DAYS AWAY RATE WAS 0.60 , CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION S RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. 
 
 AS A MANUFACTURER, WE WORK HARD TO ELIMINATE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-RISK WORK AND HAVE MEASURES IN PLACE THAT INCLUDE PROGRAMS FOR FALL PROTECTION, HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATION, AND LOCKOUT/TAGOUT. WE ALSO FOCUS ON PERSONAL SAFETY ISSUES, SUCH AS COMPLACENCY AND FATIGUE. WE SEEK TO KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES HEALTHY DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC BY TAKING PROACTIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES INCLUDING FREQUENT CLEANING AND DISINFECTION OF WORKSPACES, PROVIDING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, INSTITUTING SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES, AND OFFERING REMOTE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. 
 
 EACH OF OUR PLANTS UTILIZE VARIOUS INTERACTIONS TO ACHIEVE THIS PERFORMANCE, FROM A TOOLBOX MEETING TO COVER THE DAY S WORK AND ANY PARTICULAR SAFETY CONCERN, TO MONTHLY SAFETY PLAN MEETINGS, NO DAYS AWAY SAFETY AWARDS, AND OUR EMPLOYEE-FAVORITE, SAFETY DAY. EACH YEAR, A PLANT MAY CLOSE FOR ONE FULL DAY TO COVER SAFETY TRAINING AND UPDATES. OUTSIDE VENDORS DEMONSTRATE THE LATEST SAFETY PROCEDURES AND EQUIPMENT IN A HANDS-ON FUN ATMOSPHERE. 
 
 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE, AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR DIVERSE WORKFORCE. COMPANIES THAT ARE DIVERSE IN AGE, GENDER IDENTITY, RACE, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABILITY, ETHNICITY, AND PERSPECTIVE ARE SHOWN TO BE MORE RESILIENT. WE BELIEVE THAT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ARE IMPORTANT IN BUILDING THE MOST EFFECTIVE, HIGH PERFORMING TEAMS AS PART OF OUR ACT CULTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, 47 OF OUR EMPLOYEES SELF-IDENTIFIED AS BELONGING TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS: AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKAN NATIVE, AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK, ASIAN, HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, 10 OF OUR EMPLOYEES SELF-IDENTIFIED AS FEMALE. 
 
 OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD A SKILLED AND STRONG WORKFORCE THAT IS NOT ONLY DIVERSE IN RACE AND ETHNICITY, BUT ALSO DIVERSE IN AGE, GENDER IDENTITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABILITY, AND PERSPECTIVE. OUR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM STRIVES TO HIRE, RECRUIT, TRAIN, AND PROMOTE EMPLOYEES IN JOB CLASSIFICATIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN, DISABILITY, OR VETERAN S STATUS. TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS, THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS FOR OUR FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY A THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT, ESTABLISHING ANNUAL HIRING GOALS FOR WOMEN, MINORITIES, VETERANS, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES.

 RISK FACTORS 

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, TOGETHER WITH ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS 20 20 FORM 10 - K, IN EVALUATING OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK COULD DECLINE. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE THOSE THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR COMPANY. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL ALSO MAY IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. AS SUCH, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS LIST TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
 
 PROJECT DELAYS IN PUBLIC WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES CONSTRUCTING WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS GENERALLY ANNOUNCE THE PROJECTS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE BIDDING AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR PROJECTS TO BE DELAYED AND RESCHEDULED. PROJECTS ARE DELAYED AND RESCHEDULED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PROJECT PRIORITIES, DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE PROJECT FUNDING, AND ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE RIGHTS-OF-WAY OR PROPERTY RIGHTS. DELAYS IN PUBLIC WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS MAY OCCUR WITH INSUFFICIENT NOTICE TO ALLOW US TO REPLACE THOSE PROJECTS IN OUR MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNPLANNED DOWNTIME. 
 
 A DOWNTURN IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING RELATED TO PUBLIC WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT UPON SPENDING ON PUBLIC WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS, INCLUDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES, REPAIRS, AND REPLACEMENT AND NEW WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

THE NEED FOR NEW OR REPLACEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE; 

THE PRIORITIES PLACED ON VARIOUS PROJECTS BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES; 

FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING LEVELS, INCLUDING BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO CAPITAL PROJECTS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING; AND 

THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO OBTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS, RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMITS, AND OTHER REQUIRED APPROVALS AND PERMITS.

DECREASES IN THE NUMBER OF, OR GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF, PUBLIC WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE FACE RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF GENEVA AND FUTURE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES. ACQUIRING BUSINESSES THAT EXPAND AND/OR COMPLEMENT OUR OPERATIONS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT MAY EXPAND AND/OR COMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES OR NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ADEQUACY OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, THE ABILITY OF OUR MANAGEMENT TO OVERSEE AND OPERATE EFFECTIVELY THE COMBINED OPERATIONS, AND OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE DESIRED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY HAVE LIABILITIES, ADVERSE OPERATING ISSUES, OR OTHER MATTERS OF CONCERN ARISE FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION THAT WE FAIL TO DISCOVER THROUGH DUE DILIGENCE PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. FURTHER, OUR ACQUISITION TARGETS MAY NOT HAVE AS ROBUST INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS WOULD BE EXPECTED OF A PUBLIC COMPANY. ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE RECORDING OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE MAY ALSO CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR BUSINESS IN ORDER TO STRATEGICALLY POSITION OUR BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO COMPETE IN OUR MARKETS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE JOINT VENTURES AND/OR DIVESTITURES. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF ANY BUSINESSES THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE OR OUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT A BUSINESS PARTNER IN WHICH TO ENTER INTO A JOINT VENTURE OR A BUYER WILLING TO PURCHASE OUR ASSETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ACQUIRED GENEVA ON JANUARY 31, 2020. THE SUCCESS OF THIS ACQUISITION DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THIS BUSINESS WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, INCLUDING SYNERGIES, FROM THE ACQUISITION ON A TIMELY BASIS. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THESE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND THEY MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN WE EXPECT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND RISKS INVOLVED IN OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE GENEVA WITH OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDING ALL OF THE RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH. ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS FACES AN OVERCAPACITY SITUATION DUE TO RECENT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED COMPETITION FROM SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OF CONCRETE PRESSURE PIPE, DUCTILE IRON, POLYVINYL CHLORIDE PVC ), AND HIGH - DENSITY POLYETHYLENE PIPE. ORDERS IN OUR BUSINESS ARE COMPETITIVELY BID AND PRICE COMPETITION CAN BE VIGOROUS. IN A MARKET THAT ALREADY HAS OVERCAPACITY ISSUES, RECENT INCREASES IN CAPACITY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR SALES, GROSS MARGINS, AND OVERALL PROFITABILITY. OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE TIMELY DELIVERY, ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMIZED SPECIFICATIONS, AND HIGH FREIGHT COSTS. ALTHOUGH OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN OREGON, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, WEST VIRGINIA, UTAH, MISSOURI, AND MEXICO ALLOW US TO COMPETE THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT NEW OR EXISTING COMPETITORS WILL NOT ESTABLISH NEW FACILITIES OR EXPAND CAPACITY FURTHER WITHIN OUR MARKET AREAS. IN 2019, A COMPETITOR BROKE GROUND ON A NEW SPIRAL WELDED STEEL PIPE PLANT IN TEXAS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL IN 2021. NEW OR EXPANDED FACILITIES OR NEW COMPETITORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR MARKET SHARE, PRODUCT PRICING, SALES, GROSS MARGINS, AND OVERALL PROFITABILITY IN OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WATER TRANSMISSION PIPE IS MANUFACTURED GENERALLY FROM STEEL, CONCRETE, DUCTILE IRON, PVC, OR HDPE. EACH PIPE MATERIAL HAS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. STEEL AND CONCRETE ARE MORE COMMON MATERIALS FOR LARGER-DIAMETER WATER TRANSMISSION PIPELINES BECAUSE DUCTILE IRON PIPE GENERALLY IS LIMITED IN DIAMETER DUE TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ENGINEERS WHO DETERMINE THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR WATER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS ANALYZE THESE PIPE MATERIALS FOR SUITABILITY FOR EACH PROJECT. INDIVIDUAL PROJECT CIRCUMSTANCES NORMALLY DICTATE THE PREFERRED MATERIAL. IF WE EXPERIENCE COST INCREASES IN RAW MATERIALS, LABOR, AND OVERHEAD SPECIFIC TO OUR INDUSTRY OR THE LOCATION OF OUR FACILITIES, WHILE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR COMPANIES DO NOT EXPERIENCE SIMILAR CHANGES, WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE DEMAND, PRICE, AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE HAVE A FOREIGN OPERATION WHICH EXPOSES US TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. OUR FACILITY IN SAN LUIS R O COLORADO, MEXICO PRIMARILY EXPORTS PRODUCTS TO THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY OPERATE IN ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN THE FUTURE. ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE QUOTAS, REGULATIONS, TARIFFS, OR DUTIES ON IMPORTS IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND OUR AGENCIES, OR ON EXPORTS IMPOSED BY THESE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR AGENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE ALSO SELL SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY. OUR FOREIGN ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OTHER RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, INCLUDING: 

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS; 

THE IMPOSITION OF DUTIES, TARIFFS, AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS; 

TRANSPORTATION DELAYS AND INTERRUPTIONS;

POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND DISRUPTIONS; 

GOVERNMENT EMBARGOES OR FOREIGN TRADE RESTRICTIONS; 

IMPORT AND EXPORT CONTROLS; 

LABOR UNREST AND CURRENT AND CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS; 

LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES; AND 

POTENTIALLY ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. 

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR OPERATIONS MAY NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE BY REDUCING THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DECREASING THE PRICES AT WHICH WE CAN SELL OUR PRODUCTS, OR INCREASING COSTS SUCH THAT THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE CUSTOMS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS, TRANSFER PRICING REGULATIONS, OR ANY OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE MAY BE SUBJECT, OR THAT ANY SUCH REGULATIONS OR LAWS WILL NOT BE MODIFIED. ANY FAILURE BY US TO COMPLY WITH ANY SUCH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS OR LAWS, OR ANY CHANGES IN ANY SUCH REGULATIONS OR LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 FLUCTUATIONS IN STEEL PRICES AND AVAILABILITY MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PURCHASED STEEL REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR COST OF SALES. THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL IN NATURE, AND AT TIMES, PRICING CAN BE HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, IMPORT DUTIES, OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, STEEL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR AVERAGE COST FOR A TON OF STEEL WAS APPROXIMATELY 655 PER TON IN 2020, 803 PER TON IN 2019, AND 818 PER TON IN 2018. IN 2020, OUR MONTHLY AVERAGE STEEL PURCHASING COSTS RANGED FROM A HIGH OF APPROXIMATELY 735 PER TON TO A LOW OF APPROXIMATELY 601 PER TON. THIS VOLATILITY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR GROSS PROFIT. 
 
 ALTHOUGH WE SEEK TO RECOVER INCREASES IN STEEL PRICES THROUGH PRICE INCREASES IN OUR PRODUCTS, WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. ANY INCREASE IN STEEL PRICES THAT IS NOT OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR PRICES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE TIMELY STEEL SUPPLIES, WE MAY NEED TO DECLINE BID AND ORDER OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION. PERIODS OF ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION IN THE UNITED STATES, OR THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT ONE MAY OCCUR, HAVE AND COULD FURTHER DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY THE GENERAL SLOWING OF THE ECONOMY, AND THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HAS HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PRECAST AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCTS BUSINESS IN UTAH, WHICH WE ESTIMATE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 15 OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020. LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LOCAL AND STATE BUDGETS, INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING, AND THE IMPACT OF FEDERAL CUTBACKS. ANY DECREASE IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN UTAH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATION. OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: 

THE COMMENCEMENT, COMPLETION, OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS DURING ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER; 

UNPLANNED DOWN TIME DUE TO PROJECT DELAYS OR MECHANICAL FAILURE; 

UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY OR FACTORY PRODUCTIVITY;

ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS; 

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COST OF STEEL AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS; AND 

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF RESULTS FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD, AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN ANY TWO PERIODS MAY NOT BE MEANINGFUL. 
 
 OPERATING PROBLEMS IN OUR BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO TYPICAL HAZARDS AND RISKS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS SUCH AS: 

EXPLOSIONS, FIRES, INCLEMENT WEATHER, AND NATURAL DISASTERS; 

MECHANICAL FAILURE; 

UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME; 

LABOR DIFFICULTIES; 

LOSS OF PROCESS CONTROL AND QUALITY; 

DISRUPTIONS TO SUPPLY; 

RAW MATERIALS QUALITY DEFECTS; 

SERVICE PROVIDER DELAYS OR FAILURES; 

TRANSPORTATION DELAYS OR FAILURES; 

AN INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN REQUIRED LICENSES OR PERMITS; AND 

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS SUCH AS CHEMICAL SPILLS, DISCHARGES, OR RELEASES OF TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR GASES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR WORKPLACE. 

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE OPERATING PROBLEMS AT OUR FACILITIES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY OF A PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING FACILITY OR ON OUR OPERATIONS AS A WHOLE, DURING AND AFTER THE PERIOD OF THESE OPERATING DIFFICULTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS 2020 FORM 10-K, ON APRIL 21, 2019, THERE WAS AN ACCIDENTAL FIRE AT OUR SAGINAW, TEXAS FACILITY WHICH RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THE COATINGS BUILDING. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, BUT THE ABILITY TO COAT AT THIS FACILITY WAS IMPAIRED WHILE WE REPAIRED THE DAMAGE. THE OPERATING PROBLEMS LISTED ABOVE MAY ALSO CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND LOSS OF LIFE, SEVERE DAMAGE TO OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS COULD SEEK DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. FURTHERMORE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO PRESENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO WORKPLACE INJURY, EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND OTHER MATTERS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OF THE TYPES AND IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE CUSTOMARY FOR OUR INDUSTRIES, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE ADEQUATE FOR LIABILITY THAT MAY BE ULTIMATELY INCURRED OR THAT SUCH COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. ANY CLAIMS THAT RESULT IN LIABILITY EXCEEDING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OVER TIME INCLUDES ESTIMATES. REVENUE FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS PROGRESSES, AND IS MEASURED BY THE COSTS INCURRED TO DATE RELATIVE TO THE ESTIMATED TOTAL DIRECT COSTS TO FULFILL EACH CONTRACT (COST-TO-COST METHOD). ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS OF EACH CONTRACT ARE REVIEWED ON A MONTHLY BASIS BY PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FOR ALL ACTIVE PROJECTS. ALL COST REVISIONS THAT RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN GROSS PROFIT ARE REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. 

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING TOTAL COSTS AND MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF PROJECT COMPLETION, AS WELL AS WHETHER A LOSS IS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED ON THE CONTRACT. CHANGES IN JOB PERFORMANCE, JOB CONDITIONS, AND ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM CONTRACT CHANGE ORDERS, CONTRACT PENALTY PROVISIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN RAW MATERIALS COSTS, AND FINAL CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS MAY RESULT IN REVISIONS TO ESTIMATES OF REVENUE, COSTS, AND INCOME, AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REVISIONS ARE DETERMINED. DUE TO THE VARIABILITY OF EVENTS AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATES WHICH HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO REDUCTION AND CANCELATION. BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER SIGNED CONTRACTS FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STEEL PIPE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, WAS APPROXIMATELY 167 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020. OUR BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS; MOREOVER, CANCELATIONS OF PURCHASE ORDERS, CHANGE ORDERS ON CONTRACTS, OR REDUCTIONS OF PRODUCT QUANTITIES COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR BACKLOG AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FUTURE REVENUES. OUR FAILURE TO REPLACE CANCELED OR REDUCED BACKLOG COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING OUR PROFITS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE USE, HANDLING, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISCHARGE, AND DISPOSAL OF SUBSTANCES AND HAZARDOUS WASTES USED OR GENERATED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE INCURRED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR, SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, INCLUDING REGULATORY OR JUDICIAL ORDERS ENJOINING OR CURTAILING OPERATIONS OR REQUIRING CORRECTIVE MEASURES, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, OR REMEDIAL ACTIONS. 
 
 WE ARE CURRENTLY, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, REQUIRED TO INCUR COSTS RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OF OUR PROPERTY, AND FOR ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PORTLAND, OREGON FACILITY AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS 2020 FORM 10-K. SOME ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IMPOSE LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY ON PRESENT AND FORMER OWNERS, OPERATORS, OR USERS OF FACILITIES AND SITES FOR CONTAMINATION AT SUCH FACILITIES AND SITES WITHOUT REGARD TO CAUSATION OR KNOWLEDGE OF CONTAMINATION. CONSEQUENTLY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT EXISTING OR FUTURE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FACTS, OR THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTIES TO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES OR PROPERTIES WILL NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES BY US. 
 
 WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASINGLY STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE INTERPRETATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THEIR IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND OPERATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS. ANY INCREASE IN THESE COSTS, OR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES ARISING, FOR EXAMPLE, OUT OF DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CONDITIONS OR MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. WE WARRANT OUR PRODUCTS TO BE FREE OF CERTAIN DEFECTS. WE HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, HAD CLAIMS ALLEGING DEFECTS IN OUR PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSSES IN THE FUTURE OR THAT WE WILL NOT INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO DEFEND SUCH CLAIMS. WHILE WE CURRENTLY HAVE PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE ADEQUATE FOR LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE OR THAT SUCH COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT RESULT IN LIABILITIES EXCEEDING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER COSTS AND DAMAGES FROM VENDORS THAT SUPPLY DEFECTIVE MATERIALS. WE MAY RECEIVE DEFECTIVE MATERIALS FROM OUR VENDORS THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO OUR PRODUCTS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE COST TO REPAIR, REMAKE, OR REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS COULD BE GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE RECOVERED FROM THE VENDOR. SUCH EXCESS COSTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CYBERSECURITY THREATS. INCREASED GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, VULNERABILITIES, THREATS, AND A RISE IN SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY, AND INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND CONFIDENTIAL AND PERSONAL DATA, OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES. THIS COULD LEAD TO DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION, OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPRIETARY, EMPLOYEE, AND OTHER KEY INFORMATION AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COMPETITIVENESS, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY DISRUPTION OR SECURITY BREACH RESULTS IN A LOSS OR DAMAGE TO OUR DATA, OR AN INAPPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL OR PROTECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION, IT COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES, LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US, AND ULTIMATELY HARM OUR BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO PROTECT AGAINST DAMAGE CAUSED BY THESE DISRUPTIONS OR SECURITY BREACHES IN THE FUTURE. ANY OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY WORK STOPPAGES, STAFFING SHORTAGES, AND OTHER LABOR MATTERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 63 EMPLOYEES THAT WERE REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE LABOR UNION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND THE LABOR UNION ARE GOOD, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE CONFLICTS WITH THE LABOR UNION, OTHER GROUPS REPRESENTING EMPLOYEES, OR OUR EMPLOYEES IN GENERAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LABOR UNION. WE CAN ALSO MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LABOR UNION WILL NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF LABOR. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, THE EMPLOYEES OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNIONIZED. ANY STRIKES, WORK STOPPAGES, OR OTHER LABOR MATTERS EXPERIENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO WORK ON PROJECTS AND, AS A RESULT, HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OR SUCCESSFULLY MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR OUR PRODUCTS MIGHT NOT OBTAIN NECESSARY APPROVALS OR ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TO EXPAND OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS INTO NEW MARKETS, BUT WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE EFFORTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING AND MARKETING NEW PRODUCTS, EXPANDING INTO NEW MARKETS, OR WE DO NOT OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN REQUISITE APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON ALL ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING HOW IT WILL IMPACT OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLY CHAIN, AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THESE IMPACTS COULD INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISRUPTIONS IN OR CLOSURES OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, DISRUPTIONS WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, LIMITATIONS ON OUR EMPLOYEES ABILITY TO WORK AND TRAVEL, POTENTIAL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IMPACTING PROJECT OWNERS ABILITY TO FUND FUTURE PROJECTS, AND RELATED FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY VOLATILITY, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. 
 
 WE HAVE TAKEN PROACTIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING FREQUENT CLEANING AND DISINFECTION OF WORKSPACES, PROVIDING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, INSTITUTING SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES, AND OFFERING REMOTE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. THESE MEASURES MAY REDUCE THE ABILITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO OPERATE AT THE SAME LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY. IN EARLY APRIL 2020, WE WERE ORDERED TO CLOSE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SAN LUIS R O COLORADO, MEXICO AS A RESULT OF MANDATES MADE BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES RELATED TO COVID-19. IN EARLY JUNE 2020, THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DETERMINED OUR SLRC FACILITY WAS ESSENTIAL, AND ALLOWED WEEKLY INCREASES TO OUR WORKFORCE. BY JULY 2020, OPERATIONS AT OUR SLRC FACILITY WERE FULLY RESTORED. 
 
 WHILE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS. THE SEVERITY OF IMPACTS ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE CONTINUED DISRUPTIONS TO AND VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS REMAIN UNKNOWN. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED, INCLUDING NEW INFORMATION WHICH MAY EMERGE CONCERNING THE SEVERITY OF THE PANDEMIC AND ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES TO CONTAIN THE PANDEMIC OR TREAT ITS IMPACT. 
 
 THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY ALSO EXACERBATE OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THIS 2020 FORM 10-K, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON US. THIS SITUATION IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AND ADDITIONAL IMPACTS MAY ARISE THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF CURRENTLY.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 WE WILL NEED TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE WORKING CAPITAL IF MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER ORDER LEVELS IMPROVE. IF MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER ORDER LEVELS WERE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE, WE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL SUBSTANTIALLY, AS IT TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS FOR NEW ORDERS TO BE TRANSLATED INTO CASH RECEIPTS. IN GENERAL, REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A. WELLS FARGO DATED OCTOBER 25, 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT ), AS AMENDED ON JANUARY 31, 2020 BY THE CONSENT AND AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO (COLLECTIVELY THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT ), ARE LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF 74 MILLION, SUBJECT TO A BORROWING BASE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ADDITIONAL REVOLVING LOAN BORROWING CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY 53 MILLION. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BORROW THE AMOUNTS WE NEED, AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE EQUITY MARKETS MAY BE LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. A SHORTAGE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF WORKING CAPITAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE BORROWINGS, AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020, WE HAD 13.8 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, NO OUTSTANDING REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS, 1.7 MILLION OF FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, AND 30.1 MILLION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES. WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE FUTURE TO FINANCE INCREASES IN WORKING CAPITAL, FINANCE MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FUND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, OR FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE BORROWINGS COULD BECOME SIGNIFICANT IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD: 

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL OR OTHER PURPOSES IN THE FUTURE; 

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES; 

INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, ILLIQUID CAPITAL MARKETS, AND ADVERSE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS; 

LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN RESPONDING TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION; 

PLACE US AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS DEBT; AND 

WITH RESPECT TO OUR BORROWINGS THAT BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES, CAUSE US TO BE VULNERABLE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES. 

OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS ON OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE DEBT WILL DEPEND ON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATE LEVELS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE, AND BUSINESS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. OUR INABILITY TO MAKE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT OR ANY OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 IN ADDITION, UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, OUR VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS USES DAILY THREE MONTH LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE LIBOR AS A BENCHMARK FOR ESTABLISHING THE RATE. THE UNITED KINGDOM S FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY, WHICH REGULATES LIBOR, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT INTENDS TO STOP PUBLISHING DAILY THREE MONTH LIBOR RATES ON JUNE 30, 2023. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE SOFR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LIBOR. THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING AN ALTERNATIVE BENCHMARK RATE TO LIBOR, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SOFR. IT IS NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN WHETHER SOFR OR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WILL ATTAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE AS REPLACEMENTS OF LIBOR. AS SUCH, THE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVES TO LIBOR COULD BE MODESTLY DISRUPTIVE TO THE CREDIT MARKETS. WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE MATERIAL TO US, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LIBOR CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PREDICTED AND SPAN MULTIPLE FUTURE PERIODS, AND COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DISRUPTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND A GENERAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN COULD CAUSE US TO BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND EXPOSE US TO RISKS RELATED TO THE OVERALL MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. THE UNITED STATES EQUITY AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY, DISLOCATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY DISRUPTIONS, WHICH HAVE CAUSED MARKET PRICES OF MANY EQUITIES TO FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY AND THE SPREADS ON PROSPECTIVE DEBT FINANCINGS TO WIDEN CONSIDERABLY. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE MATERIALLY IMPACTED LIQUIDITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, MAKING TERMS FOR CERTAIN FINANCINGS LESS ATTRACTIVE, AND IN SOME CASES HAVE RESULTED IN THE UNAVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, EVEN FOR COMPANIES WHO ARE OTHERWISE QUALIFIED TO OBTAIN FINANCING. THESE EVENTS MAY MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND ALSO MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR PROHIBITIVELY COSTLY FOR US TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. 
 
 OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS COULD RESULT IN OUR INDEBTEDNESS BEING IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR DEBT INCLUDE COVENANTS THAT IMPOSE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE COVENANTS PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO INCUR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DEBT AND TO CREATE LIENS OR OTHER ENCUMBRANCES ON ASSETS. IN ADDITION, OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE SECURED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY OWNED BY US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES' OTHER ASSETS. 
 
 OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS WELL AS OTHER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE COVENANTS MAY BE IMPAIRED. A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE COVENANTS, IF NOT WAIVED OR CURED, COULD PERMIT ACCELERATION OF THE RELATED DEBT. IF ANY OF OUR DEBT IS ACCELERATED, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY SUCH DEBT OR THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REFINANCE SUCH DEBT ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE ACCELERATION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE DEBT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IF IN THE FUTURE WE IDENTIFY ONE OR MORE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ASSERT THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THERE WILL NOT BE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE FUTURE. ANY FAILURE TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD SEVERELY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. IF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM DETERMINES WE HAVE A MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE COULD LOSE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS OR INVESTIGATIONS BY NASDAQ, THE SEC, OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. FAILURE TO REMEDY ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, OR TO IMPLEMENT OR MAINTAIN OTHER EFFECTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS REQUIRED OF PUBLIC COMPANIES, COULD ALSO RESTRICT OUR FUTURE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. 
 
 FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT INTERNAL CONTROLS AT ACQUIRED COMPANIES COULD INCREASE RISK OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 SARBANES-OXLEY ACT REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANIES WE ACQUIRE. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, WE WILL NEED TO IMPLEMENT OR ENHANCE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT ANY COMPANY WE ACQUIRE AND EVALUATE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS. WE DO NOT CONDUCT A FORMAL EVALUATION OF COMPANIES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING PRIOR TO AN ACQUISITION. WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AS PART OF OUR INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS FROM PRIVATE COMPANIES, AS THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE COMPLYING WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO HIRE OR ENGAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT THE NECESSARY NEW INTERNAL CONTROLS SHOULD WE ACQUIRE ANY COMPANIES. ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED INTERNAL CONTROLS, OR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR INCREASE THE RISK OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH COULD, IF NOT REMEDIATED, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A TIMELY AND ACCURATE MANNER. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 
 THE RELATIVELY LOW TRADING VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO SELL YOUR SHARES. ALTHOUGH OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET NASDAQ ), WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED A RELATIVELY LOW TRADING VOLUME. IF WE HAVE A LOW TRADING VOLUME IN THE FUTURE, HOLDERS OF OUR SHARES MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE MANNER OR AT A PRICE THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ATTAINABLE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE ARE: 

OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS; 

QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN THE RATE OF GROWTH OF OUR FINANCIAL INDICATORS, SUCH AS EARNINGS PER SHARE, NET INCOME, AND NET SALES; 

CHANGES IN REVENUE OR EARNINGS ESTIMATES OR PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH REPORTS BY ANALYSTS; 

LOSS OF ANY MEMBER OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM; 

SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY; 

STRATEGIC ACTIONS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS OR RESTRUCTURING; 

SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK BY SHAREHOLDERS; 

RELATIVELY LOW TRADING VOLUME; 

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR INDUSTRY AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND 

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC, LEGAL, AND REGULATORY FACTORS UNRELATED TO OUR PERFORMANCE. 

THE STOCK MARKETS IN GENERAL HAVE EXPERIENCED BROAD FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR COMPANIES. THESE BROAD MARKET FLUCTUATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND OREGON LAW COULD DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT: 

CLASSIFY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INTO THREE CLASSES, EACH OF WHICH SERVES FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM WITH ONE CLASS ELECTED EACH YEAR; 

PROVIDE THAT DIRECTORS MAY BE REMOVED BY SHAREHOLDERS ONLY FOR CAUSE AND ONLY UPON THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF 75 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK; AND 

PERMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OR MORE SERIES, FIX THE NUMBER OF SHARES CONSTITUTING ANY SUCH SERIES, AND DETERMINE THE VOTING POWERS AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF ANY SUCH SERIES, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER VOTE OR ACTION BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS. 

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE OREGON BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT THAT COULD DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION PROPOSALS, COULD DETER, DELAY, OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT OUR SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDER FAVORABLE, AND COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PROVISIONS OF OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND THE OREGON BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT IS SET FORTH IN THE DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 FILED AS EXHIBIT 4.2 TO OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE SEC ON MARCH 3, 2020.

1A. RISK FACTORS. 

AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY BY THOSE PERSONS
WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD A LOSS OF THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER
THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. 

6 

RISKS
RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS 

WE
HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WHICH MAY NOT SERVE AS AN ADEQUATE BASIS TO JUDGE OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

DANIELS
CORPORATE ADVISORY COMPANY, INC., WHICH WAS INCORPORATED ON AUGUST 22, 2002, HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH AN EVALUATION
OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS CAN BE MADE. WE ARE AN EARLY-STAGE OPERATING COMPANY WITH LIMITED REVENUE HISTORY.OUR
PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE RISKS, EXPENSES, DELAYS, PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW BUSINESS. AS AN EARLY-STAGE OPERATING COMPANY , DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY FACES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RELATING TO ITS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. 

SINCE
INCEPTION, AS A SUBSIDIARY OF INFE HUMAN RESOURCES, INC., DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OPERATING COMPANY, FURNISHING
ITS ADVISORY TO ALL PHASES OF OPERATIONS, FINANCE AND IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STAFFING INDUSTRY ROLL-UP FOR ITS PARENT COMPANY
FOR WHICH REVENUES WERE ELIMINATED DURING CONSOLIDATIONS. 

LIMITED
REVENUES AND ONGOING LOSSES. 

SINCE
INCEPTION, DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY HAS GENERATED LIMITED REVENUE. DANIELS EARNINGS POTENTIAL WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER; HOWEVER,
ITS FOCUS HAD BEEN IN A FINANCIAL ADVISORY CAPACITY TO ITS PARENT COMPANY INFE HUMAN RESOURCES, WHICH CONCENTRATED IN STAFFING
AND EXECUTIVE PLACEMENTS INDUSTRIES. DANIELS WAS SPUN OFF TO CONCENTRATE ON ITS CORE CORPORATE STRATEGY CONSULTING BUSINESS. DANIELS
HAS INCURRED CONSISTENT OPERATING LOSSES TO DATE. 

OUR
BUSINESS STRATEGY IS UNPROVEN AND OUR PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. 

OUR
BUSINESS STRATEGY IS UNPROVEN, AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING EARLY STAGE CHALLENGES, SUCH AS ESTABLISHING OUR POSITION
IN THE MARKET AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE MARKETING OF OUR SERVICES. TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN, CAPITAL MAY BE PROVIDED FROM
EXISTING AND POSSIBLY NEW CONSULTING BUSINESS REVENUE AND THROUGH OUTSIDE FINANCING. WE HAVE NOT YET LOCATED ADDITIONAL FINANCING
TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY. INITIAL GROWTH MAY BE VERY LIMITED AND BASED SOLELY ON COMPENSATION FROM A SMALL,
EXISTING, CONSULTING ASSIGNMENT WITH NO GUARANTEE OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE OTHER POTENTIAL
GROWTH SEGMENT OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN, THE ACQUISITION OF MARKETING RIGHTS FOR OUR SERVICES THROUGH THE CLIENT NETWORKS OF OTHER
BUSINESS SERVICES COMPANIES, WILL ONLY OCCUR IF WE CAN OBTAIN OUTSIDE FINANCING. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, ALONE, WILL NOT BE
SUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT THIS PHASE OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

OUR
PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE, CONSIDERING THE RISKS, EXPENSES, AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A NEW BUSINESS, SPECIFICALLY THE RISKS INHERENT IN DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE COMPANIES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT
OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT SIGNIFICANT NET LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS OR, IF PROFITABILITY IS ACHIEVED, THAT IT WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT
PERIOD, OR AT ALL. 

OUR
AUDITORS HAVE STATED WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. 

OUR
AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION, WHICH MEANS THAT THERE IS DOUBT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE AS AN ONGOING BUSINESS FOR
THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.UNLESS WE CAN RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES AND MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND
OR CEASE OPERATIONS. SEE MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

7 

THE
JOBS ACT ALLOWS US TO DELAY THE ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTIVE DATES FOR PUBLIC
AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. 

SINCE,
WE HAVE ELECTED TO USE THE EXTENDED TRANSITION PERIOD FOR COMPLYING WITH NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UNDER SECTION 102(B)(1)
OF THE JOBS ACT, THIS ELECTION ALLOWS US TO DELAY THE ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTIVE
DATES FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES UNTIL THOSE STANDARDS APPLY TO PRIVATE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS ELECTION, OUR FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO COMPANIES THAT COMPLY WITH PUBLIC COMPANY EFFECTIVE DATES. 

WE
HAVE DIFFERENT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAN OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES AS AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY(EGC). 

PURSUANT
TO SECTION 107 OF THE JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT (THE JOBS ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON APRIL 5, 2012,
WE HAVE ELECTED TO CLAIM THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. 

THE
JOBS ACT PROVIDES AN IPO ON RAMP FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES (A NEWLY CREATED CATEGORY OF ISSUER
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT), WHICH ARE ISSUERS WITH ANNUAL GROSS REVENUES OF LESS THAN 1 BILLION DURING THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED
FISCAL YEAR. EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SCALED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALREADY HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE
TO SMALLER REPORTING COMPANIES (DEFINED BY THE SECURITIES ACT AS COMPANIES HAVING A PUBLIC FLOAT OF LESS THAN 75
MILLION). THE SCALED DISCLOSURE INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT TO INCLUDE ONLY TWO, RATHER THAN THREE, YEARS OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THE ISSUER S INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IPO REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND, DURING THE IPO ON RAMP 
PERIOD, THE ABILITY TO OMIT THE AUDITOR S ATTESTATION ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIRED BY THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT OF 2002. 

ALSO
DURING THE IPO ON RAMP PERIOD, EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WOULD NOT NEED TO SUBMIT SAY-ON-PAY VOTES TO THEIR STOCKHOLDERS
(INCLUDING SAY-ON-PAY FREQUENCY OR GOLDEN PARACHUTE VOTES) AND WOULD FACE MORE LIMITED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
THAN LARGER COMPANIES. 

WE
MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, EITHER OF
WHICH WILL IMPEDE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH. 

DANIELS
CORPORATE ADVISORY IS ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF OFFERING CORPORATE FINANCIAL CONSULTING SERVICES AND MERCHANT BANKING SERVICES. 

WE
DO NOT KNOW WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR WHETHER OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
WILL ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ASSESSING OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, A POTENTIAL INVESTOR SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
OUR LACK OF OPERATING HISTORY, OUR MANAGEMENT S RELATIVE INEXPERIENCE, THE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS EXISTING IN OUR INDUSTRY
AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. OUR GROWTH IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.
OUR REVENUES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE FAIL TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR IF WE DIVERT RESOURCES TO A BUSINESS STRATEGY
THAT ULTIMATELY PROVES UNSUCCESSFUL. 

OUR
SERVICE OFFERINGS MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

WE
CONSTANTLY SEEK TO MODIFY OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS IS TYPICALLY THE CASE EVOLVING SERVICE OFFERINGS, ANTICIPATION
OF DEMAND AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY. THE SUCCESS OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS PRIMARILY DEPENDS
ON THE INTEREST OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN GENERAL, ACHIEVING MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR SERVICES WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL MARKETING
EFFORTS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF SIGNIFICANT FUNDS, WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE AVAILABLE, TO CREATE AWARENESS AND DEMAND AMONG CUSTOMERS. 

WE
HAVE LIMITED MARKETING EXPERIENCE, AND HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED FINANCIAL, PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE
MARKETING ACTIVITIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF ANY OF OUR SERVICES OR OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE THE
REVENUES NECESSARY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS. 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPANSION AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS. 

THE
GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPANSION, CONTROL COSTS IN OUR OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATE
ACQUISITIONS INTO EXISTING OPERATIONS. THIS STRATEGY WILL ENTAIL REVIEWING AND POTENTIALLY REORGANIZING ACQUIRED OPERATIONS, CORPORATE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL CONTROLS. UNFORESEEN EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATION AND DELAYS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED
IN CONNECTION WITH THE RAPID EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS COULD INHIBIT OUR GROWTH AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOW. 

8 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES. 

WE
MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ACQUISITION CANDIDATES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMBINATIONS OR BE UNABLE TO CONSUMMATE
ACQUISITIONS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. THE MAGNITUDE, TIMING AND NATURE OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL DEPEND UPON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING
OUR SUCCESS IN ESTABLISHING THE CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT PILOT PROGRAMS FOR CONSULTING CLIENTS AS A VIABLE MEANS OF
GROWTH ACCELERATION, THE AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES THAT HAVE THE CLIENT BASE SUITABLE FOR CROSS-MARKETING
OPPORTUNITIES, THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES, THE AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED EMPLOYEES TO MANAGE
ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS. 

WE
MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US. 

WE
ARE CURRENTLY ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR CORPORATE FINANCIAL CONSULTING AND MERCHANT BANKING SERVICES LINES OF BUSINESS
AS WELL AS FOR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. WE MAY BE UNABLE
TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPOSED SERVICES AND FOR ANY ACQUISITION FOR CROSS-MARKETING OF SERVICES
PURPOSES, OR THAT, IF AVAILABLE, SUCH FINANCING WILL BE ON FAVORABLE TERMS. 

OUR
FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE UNCERTAIN AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONSUMER TRENDS, SEASONAL
FLUCTUATIONS AND MARKET DEMAND. 

AS
A RESULT OF OUR SHORT AND SPORADIC OPERATING HISTORY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY FORECAST OUR REVENUE. FURTHER, WE HAVE LITTLE
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA UPON WHICH TO BASE PLANNED OPERATING EXPENSES.WE BASE OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE EXPENSE LEVELS ON OUR OPERATING
PLANS AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE EXPENSES. OUR EXPENSES ARE DEPENDENT IN LARGE PART UPON EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPOSED MARKETING
EXPENDITURES AND RELATED OVERHEAD EXPENSES, AND THE COSTS OF HIRING AND MAINTAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO CARRY OUT OUR RESPECTIVE
SERVICES. SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST BECAUSE THEY WILL DEPEND ON THE GROWTH OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE, CHANGES
IN CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND CONSUMER TRENDS, THE DEGREE OF UTILIZATION OF OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES AS WELL AS THE MIX OF SERVICES
AND SERVICES SOLD. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE ACCURATE FINANCIAL FORECASTS AND ADJUST OUR SPENDING IN A TIMELY MANNER
TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY UNEXPECTED REVENUE SHORTFALL. THIS INABILITY COULD CAUSE OUR NET LOSSES IN A GIVEN QUARTER TO BE GREATER
THAN EXPECTED. 

WE
RELY ON THE SERVICES OF ARTHUR D. VIOLA. 

OUR
BUSINESS RELIES ON THE EFFORTS AND TALENTS OF OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, ARTHUR D. VIOLA. THE LOSS OF HIS SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND COULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ON OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

WE
MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MANAGEMENT AND OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS A RESULT
OF THEIR CONCERNS RELATING TO THEIR INCREASED PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO LAWSUITS AND STOCKHOLDER CLAIMS BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THESE
POSITIONS IN A PUBLICLY QUOTED COMPANY. 

THE
DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLICLY QUOTED CORPORATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THE EXTENT OF THEIR PERSONAL EXPOSURE
TO LAWSUITS AND STOCKHOLDER CLAIMS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL AND CREDITOR CLAIMS WHICH MAY BE MADE AGAINST THEM, PARTICULARLY IN
VIEW OF RECENT CHANGES IN SECURITIES LAWS IMPOSING ADDITIONAL DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES ON MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS.
DUE TO THESE PERCEIVED RISKS, DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT ARE ALSO BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF DIRECTORS 
AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE TO PAY ON A TIMELY BASIS THE COSTS INCURRED IN DEFENDING SUCH CLAIMS. WE CURRENTLY DO
CARRY LIMITED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE
HAS RECENTLY BECOME MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OR PROVIDE DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE AT AFFORDABLE RATES OR AT ALL, IT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN
QUALIFIED OUTSIDE DIRECTORS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

9 

WE
MAY LOSE POTENTIAL INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS AND MANAGEMENT CANDIDATES TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE GREATER DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE TO INSURE THEM FROM LIABILITY OR TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE REVENUES OR HAVE RECEIVED GREATER
FUNDING TO DATE WHICH CAN OFFER MORE LUCRATIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. THE FEES OF DIRECTORS ARE ALSO RISING IN RESPONSE TO THEIR
INCREASED DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS INCREASED EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS. AS A COMPANY WITH LIMITED OPERATING
HISTORY AND RESOURCES, WE WILL HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT TIME ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MANAGEMENT AND OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS
THAN A MORE ESTABLISHED COMPANY DUE TO THESE ENHANCED DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES. 

WE
MAY FAIL TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS. 

WE
BELIEVE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WILL GREATLY BENEFIT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE INTEND TO SEEK
OUT AND ENTER INTO STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THESE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE
TERMS, OR AT ALL. EVEN IF WE ENTER INTO STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, OUR PARTNERS MAY NOT ATTRACT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CUSTOMERS OR
OTHERWISE PROVE ADVANTAGEOUS TO OUR BUSINESS. OUR INABILITY TO ENTER INTO NEW DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS OR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 

WE
MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS. 

WE
MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLIC COMPANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEWLY APPLICABLE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND OTHER RULES IMPLEMENTED BY
THE SEC. WE EXPECT ALL OF THESE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO INCREASE OUR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND TO MAKE
SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THESE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT REDUCED POLICY
LIMITS AND COVERAGE OR INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER COSTS TO OBTAIN THE SAME OR SIMILAR COVERAGE. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT
FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. WE ARE CURRENTLY
EVALUATING AND MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE NEWLY APPLICABLE RULES, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT
OF ADDITIONAL COSTS WE MAY INCUR OR THE TIMING OF SUCH COSTS.

MR.VIOLA
OWNS 2,454,500 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS I 00,000 SHARES OF THE DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY PREFERRED STOCK WHICH HAS
VOTING RIGHTS EQUAL TO 500 SHARES OF THE DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY COMMON STOCK FOR EVERY ONE SHARE OF DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY
PREFERRED STOCK HELD, WHICH EQUATES TO COMMON STOCK VOTING RIGHTS OF 52,454,500 SHARES OF THE DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY COMMON
STOCK WHICH AMOUNT EXCEEDS OUR CURRENT OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE RESULT OF MR. VIOLA S THE OWNERSHIP AND
VOTING RIGHTS TO OUR COMMON STOCK ALLOWS MR. VIOLA TO HAVE VOTING CONTROL ON ALL MATTERS SUBMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL
AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL OUR MANAGEMENT AND AFFAIRS, INCLUDING EXTRAORDINARY TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS MERGERS AND OTHER CHANGES OF
CORPORATE CONTROL, AND GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS CONCENTRATION OF VOTING POWER COULD DISCOURAGE OR PREVENT
A POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE RESULT IN YOUR RECEIVING A PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE
FOR YOUR COMMON STOCK.

WE
MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL OR OUR OPERATING
RESULTS AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

BECAUSE
WE ARE A NEWLY OPERATIONAL COMPANY, WE NEED TO SECURE ADEQUATE FUNDING. SELLING ADDITIONAL STOCK, EITHER PRIVATELY OR PUBLICLY,
WOULD DILUTE THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE BORROW MORE MONEY, WE WILL HAVE TO PAY INTEREST AND MAY ALSO HAVE
TO AGREE TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING, WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL
OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD FAIL. 

OUR
ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES OR TO REPAY DEBT WOULD DILUTE YOUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING
RIGHTS AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

OF 40 STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD HOLDING AT LEAST 100 SHARES EACH (NOTE: THIS NUMBER IS INFORMAL AND HAS BEEN MOVING UP); 

DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, AND STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE SCRUTINIZED FOR PREVIOUS INVOLVEMENTS IN OTHER OTCBB COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, BLANK CHECK
COMPANIES; AND 

MUST
HAVE A MARKET MAKER SUBMIT A RULE 15C211 APPLICATION TO FINRA AND AGREE TO ACT AS MARKET MAKER FOR SECURITIES OF COMPANY. 

EVEN
IF OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, YOUR SHARES MAY NOT BE FREE-TRADING. 

INVESTORS
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL NOT BECOME FREE-TRADING MERELY BECAUSE DANIELS CORPORATE
ADVISORY IS A PUBLICLY-QUOTED COMPANY. IN ORDER FOR THE SHARES TO BECOME FREE-TRADING, THE SHARES MUST BE REGISTERED,
OR ENTITLED TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. SEE SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE. 

WE
MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL OR OUR OPERATING
RESULTS AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

BECAUSE
WE ARE A NEWLY OPERATIONAL COMPANY, WE NEED TO SECURE ADEQUATE FUNDING. SELLING ADDITIONAL STOCK, EITHER PRIVATELY OR PUBLICLY,
WOULD DILUTE THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE BORROW MORE MONEY, WE WILL HAVE TO PAY INTEREST AND MAY ALSO HAVE
TO AGREE TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING, WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL
OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD FAIL. 

OUR
ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES OR TO REPAY DEBT WOULD DILUTE YOUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING
RIGHTS AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
SOLE DIRECTOR, MR. VIOLA, MAY GENERALLY ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO PAY FOR DEBT OR SERVICES, WITHOUT FURTHER APPROVAL BY
OUR STOCKHOLDERS BASED UPON SUCH FACTORS AS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT AT THAT TIME. IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL ISSUE
ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO PAY FOR SERVICES AND REDUCE DEBT IN THE FUTURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF
COMMON STOCK UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME. 

11 

WE
HAVE NEVER PAID OR DECLARED ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WE
HAVE NEVER PAID OR DECLARED ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. LIKEWISE, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, DIVIDENDS
OR DISTRIBUTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK OR OUR COMMON STOCK TO BE SOLD IN THIS OFFERING. ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE DECLARED AT
THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON OUR EARNINGS, OUR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
FUTURE OPERATIONS AND GROWTH, AND OTHER FACTS AS WE MAY THEN DEEM APPROPRIATE. 

OUR
DIRECTORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK AND ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
SOLE DIRECTOR, MR. VIOLA, WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND WITHOUT FURTHER
ACTION BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN ONE OR MORE SERIES AND TO
FIX THE NUMBER OF SHARES AND THE RELATIVE RIGHTS, CONVERSION RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, AND TERMS OF REDEMPTION, LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES
AND ANY OTHER PREFERENCES, SPECIAL RIGHTS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF ANY SUCH SERIES. WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF ISSUING SHARES OF PREFERRED
STOCK AT THE PRESENT TIME. ANY ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON
STOCK. 

SHOULD
WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A LATER TIME, EACH INVESTOR S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR STOCK WOULD BE
PROPORTIONALLY REDUCED. NO INVESTOR WILL HAVE ANY PREEMPTIVE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR ANY OF
OUR OTHER SECURITIES. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED AND OUR SHARES ARE QUOTED ON THE PINK SHEETS OR THE OTCBB, AND WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT IN
OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTCBB, WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES
AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. 

COMPANIES
WHOSE SHARES ARE QUOTED FOR SALE ON THE OTCBB AND SOME WHOSE SHARES ARE QUOTED FOR SALE ON THE PINK SHEETS MUST BE REPORTING ISSUERS
UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, AND MUST BE CURRENT IN THEIR REPORTS UNDER SECTION 13 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
PRICE QUOTATION PRIVILEGES ON THE PINK SHEETS AND OTCBB. IF OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED AND OUR SHARES ARE QUOTED FOR SALE
ON THE OTCBB, AND WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT IN OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTCBB. AS A RESULT, THE
MARKET LIQUIDITY FOR OUR SECURITIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES
AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK WILL MOST LIKELY BE PARTICULARLY VOLATILE GIVEN OUR STATUS
AS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMPANY WITH A SMALL AND THINLY QUOTED PUBLIC FLOAT, LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF NET REVENUES
WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR SHARE PRICE. THE PRICE AT WHICH YOU PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE
OF THE PRICE THAT WILL PREVAIL IN THE TRADING MARKET. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK WILL MOST LIKELY BE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY
WHEN COMPARED TO SEASONED ISSUERS, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR SHARE PRICE WILL BE MORE VOLATILE THAN A SEASONED ISSUER FOR THE INDEFINITE
FUTURE. THE VOLATILITY IN OUR SHARE PRICE WOULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS. FIRST, AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SHARES OF OUR
COMMON STOCK WILL LIKELY BE SPORADICALLY AND/OR THINLY QUOTED. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THE TRADING OF RELATIVELY
SMALL QUANTITIES OF SHARES BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY DISPROPORTIONATELY INFLUENCE THE PRICE OF THOSE SHARES IN EITHER DIRECTION.
THE PRICE FOR OUR SHARES COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY IN THE EVENT THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
ARE SOLD ON THE MARKET WITHOUT COMMENSURATE DEMAND, AS COMPARED TO A SEASONED ISSUER WHICH COULD BETTER ABSORB THOSE SALES WITHOUT
ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS SHARE PRICE. 

12 

SECONDLY,
WE WILL MOST LIKELY BE A SPECULATIVE OR RISKY INVESTMENT DUE TO OUR DEPENDENCE ON AN INITIAL FLOW OF CORPORATE CONSULTING
ASSIGNMENTS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PRODUCING POSITIVE RESULTS TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ENHANCED RISK,
MORE RISK-ADVERSE INVESTORS MAY, UNDER THE FEAR OF LOSING ALL OR MOST OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF NEGATIVE NEWS OR LACK
OF PROGRESS, BE MORE INCLINED TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE MARKET MORE QUICKLY AND AT GREATER DISCOUNTS THAN WOULD BE THE CASE
WITH THE STOCK OF A SEASONED ISSUER. 

AS
A CONSEQUENCE, THERE MAY BE PERIODS OF SEVERAL DAYS OR MORE WHEN TRADING ACTIVITY IN OUR SHARES IS MINIMAL OR NON-EXISTENT, AS
COMPARED TO A MATURE ISSUER WHICH HAS A LARGE AND STEADY VOLUME OF TRADING ACTIVITY THAT WILL GENERALLY SUPPORT CONTINUOUS SALES
WITHOUT AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SHARE PRICE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A BROADER OR MORE ACTIVE PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK
WILL NOT DEVELOP OR BE SUSTAINED, OR THAT CURRENT TRADING LEVELS WILL CONTINUE. 

SHARES
ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE BY OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE . 

THE
SALE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME COULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AT THE MARKET PRICES
PREVAILING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SUCH SHARES ARE OFFERED. IN ADDITION, SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES
ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND WARRANTS, UNDER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 144 OR OTHERWISE COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AT THAT TIME THROUGH
THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES. 

OUR
ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES OR TO REPAY DEBT WOULD DILUTE YOUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING
RIGHTS AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

OUR
SOLE DIRECTOR, MR. VIOLA, MAY GENERALLY ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO PAY FOR DEBT OR SERVICES, WITHOUT FURTHER APPROVAL BY
OUR STOCKHOLDERS BASED UPON SUCH FACTORS AS MR. VIOLA MAY DEEM RELEVANT AT THAT TIME. WE HAVE ISSUED SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
IN PAYMENT FOR SERVICES IN THE PAST. IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL ISSUE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO PAY FOR SERVICES AND REDUCE DEBT
IN THE FUTURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE
AT THE TIME. 

ANTI-TAKEOVER
PROVISIONS MAY IMPEDE THE ACQUISITION OF DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY. 

CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF THE NEVADA REVISED STATUTES HAVE ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS AND MAY INHIBIT A NON-NEGOTIATED MERGER OR OTHER BUSINESS
COMBINATION. THESE PROVISIONS ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE ANY PERSON INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY TO NEGOTIATE
WITH, AND TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF, OUR SOLE DIRECTOR, MR. VIOLA, IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH A TRANSACTION. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN
OF THESE PROVISIONS MAY DISCOURAGE A FUTURE ACQUISITION OF DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY, INCLUDING AN ACQUISITION IN WHICH THE STOCKHOLDERS
MIGHT OTHERWISE RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR SHARES. 

YOU
MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR COMMON STOCK AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU. 

THE
FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY ADD TO THE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK: ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY
OR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS; GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS OR JOINT
VENTURES; OUR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS; AND ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL. MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL
AND MAY DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, REGARDLESS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE CANNOT MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS
OR PROJECTIONS AS TO WHAT THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT ANY TIME, INCLUDING AS TO WHETHER OUR COMMON
STOCK WILL SUSTAIN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE, OR AS TO WHAT EFFECT THE SALE OF SHARES OR THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMON STOCK FOR SALE
AT ANY TIME WILL HAVE ON THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE. 

13 

WE
MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL OR OUR OPERATING
RESULTS AND OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE
MAY NEED TO SECURE ADEQUATE FUNDING. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FUNDING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND
MARKET OUR PROPOSED PRODUCTS AND OUR BUSINESS WILL MOST LIKELY FAIL. WE DO NOT HAVE COMMITMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING. TO SECURE
ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WE MAY NEED TO BORROW MONEY OR SELL MORE SECURITIES, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING SECURITIES.
WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. 

SELLING
ADDITIONAL STOCK, EITHER PRIVATELY OR PUBLICLY, WOULD DILUTE THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE BORROW MORE MONEY,
WE WILL HAVE TO PAY INTEREST AND MAY ALSO HAVE TO AGREE TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY. IF WE ARE UNABLE
TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING, WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OPERATING
RESULTS AND MOST LIKELY RESULT IN A LOWER STOCK PRICE. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SHARES MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SHARES MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED. FACTORS SUCH AS THOSE DISCUSSED
IN THIS RISK FACTORS SECTION MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES TO BE DISTRIBUTED
BY US. MANY BROKERAGE FIRMS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS IN A SECURITY IF A LOW PRICE DEVELOPS IN THE TRADING
OF THE SECURITY. EVEN IF A PURCHASER FINDS A BROKER WILLING TO EFFECT A TRANSACTION IN OUR SECURITIES, THE COMBINATION OF BROKERAGE
COMMISSIONS, STATE TRANSFER TAXES, IF ANY, AND ANY OTHER SELLING COSTS MAY EXCEED THE SELLING PRICE. FURTHER, MANY LENDING INSTITUTIONS
WILL NOT PERMIT THE USE OF OUR SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL FOR ANY LOANS. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, OUR COMMON STOCK WILL MOST LIKELY BE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES OF THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LIMITED, WHICH WOULD MAKE TRANSACTIONS
IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF OUR STOCK. 

IF
OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY QUOTED, OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WILL MOST LIKELY BE PENNY STOCKS BECAUSE THEY MOST
LIKELY WILL NOT BE REGISTERED ON A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE OR LISTED ON AN AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM SPONSORED BY A REGISTERED
NATIONAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATION, PURSUANT TO RULE 3A51-1(A) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. FOR ANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING A PENNY STOCK,
UNLESS EXEMPT, THE RULES REQUIRE: 

THAT
A BROKER OR DEALER APPROVE A PERSON S ACCOUNT FOR TRANSACTIONS IN PENNY STOCKS; AND 

THAT
THE BROKER OR DEALER RECEIVES FROM THE INVESTOR A WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION, SETTING FORTH THE IDENTITY AND QUANTITY
OF THE PENNY STOCK TO BE PURCHASED. 

THE
BROKER OR DEALER MUST ALSO DELIVER, PRIOR TO ANY TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK, A DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE PRESCRIBED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELATING TO THE PENNY STOCK MARKET, WHICH, IN HIGHLIGHT FORM: 

SETS
FORTH THE BASIS ON WHICH THE BROKER OR DEALER MADE THE SUITABILITY DETERMINATION; AND 

THAT
THE BROKER OR DEALER RECEIVED A SIGNED, WRITTEN AGREEMENT FROM THE INVESTOR PRIOR TO THE TRANSACTION. 

GENERALLY,
BROKERS MAY BE LESS WILLING TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES. THIS MAY MAKE
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO DISPOSE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK. 

DISCLOSURE
ALSO HAS TO BE MADE ABOUT THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN PENNY STOCKS IN BOTH PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND IN SECONDARY TRADING AND ABOUT THE
COMMISSIONS PAYABLE TO BOTH THE BROKER-DEALER AND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, CURRENT QUOTATIONS FOR THE SECURITIES AND THE
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO AN INVESTOR IN CASES OF FRAUD IN PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS. FINALLY, MONTHLY STATEMENTS HAVE TO
BE SENT DISCLOSING RECENT PRICE INFORMATION FOR THE PENNY STOCK HELD IN THE ACCOUNT AND INFORMATION ON THE LIMITED MARKET IN PENNY
STOCKS. 

14 

THE
MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS FROM PATTERNS OF FRAUD AND ABUSE. 

STOCKHOLDERS
SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ACCORDING TO SEC RELEASE NO. 34-29093, THE MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS FROM PATTERNS
OF FRAUD AND ABUSE. SUCH PATTERNS INCLUDE: 

CONTROL
OF THE MARKET FOR THE SECURITY BY ONE OR A FEW BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE OFTEN RELATED TO THE PROMOTER OR ISSUER; 

MANIPULATION
OF PRICES THROUGH PREARRANGED MATCHING OF PURCHASES AND SALES AND FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES; 

BOILER
ROOM PRACTICES INVOLVING HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND UNREALISTIC PRICE PROJECTIONS BY INEXPERIENCED SALESPERSONS; 

EXCESSIVE
AND UNDISCLOSED BID-ASK DIFFERENTIAL AND MARKUPS BY SELLING BROKER-DEALERS; AND 

THE
WHOLESALE DUMPING OF THE SAME SECURITIES BY PROMOTERS AND BROKER-DEALERS AFTER PRICES HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED TO A DESIRED LEVEL,
ALONG WITH THE RESULTING INEVITABLE COLLAPSE OF THOSE PRICES AND WITH CONSEQUENTIAL INVESTOR LOSSES. 

OUR
MANAGEMENT IS AWARE OF THE ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HISTORICALLY IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN
A POSITION TO DICTATE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MARKET OR OF BROKER-DEALERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET, IF OUR SHARES BECOME PUBLICLY
QUOTED, MANAGEMENT WILL STRIVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS TO PREVENT THE DESCRIBED PATTERNS FROM BEING ESTABLISHED
WITH RESPECT TO OUR SECURITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE PATTERNS OR PRACTICES COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE. 

SUBSCRIPTIONS
TO PURCHASE SHARES IN THIS OFFERING ARE IRREVOCABLE AND WILL BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR OUR USE WITHOUT ANY ESCROW. 

THE
EXECUTION OF A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT BY AN INVESTOR CONSTITUTES A BINDING OFFER TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ONCE
AN INVESTOR SUBSCRIBES FOR OUR SHARES, THE INVESTOR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REVOKE HIS SUBSCRIPTION. AS STATED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, THE
PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR SHARES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY ESCROW, BUT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR OUR USE. CONSEQUENTLY,
THOSE INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE SHARES EARLIER IN THE OFFERING WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AT RISK THAN THOSE INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE
LATER IN THE OFFERING, INASMUCH AS THE LATER INVESTORS WILL HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFERING BEFORE
MAKING AN INVESTMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL THE SUBSCRIBED AMOUNTS BE RETURNED TO INVESTORS. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS DURING SLOW ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 

OUR
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING POTENTIAL REAL ESTATE PROJECTS ARE RUNNING AT AN EXTREMELY SLOW ECONOMIC PACE AND MAY CONTINUE
TO DO SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK AND IN LIGHT OF THE RISKS, EXPENSES,
DELAYS, PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE FACE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RELATING TO OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

OUR
AUDITORS ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION WHICH MEANS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES AND MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE
OPERATIONS. 

OUR
AUDITORS ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2015 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2014 THIS MEANS THAT THERE
IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE AS AN ONGOING BUSINESS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND/OR GENERATING PROFITS. IF WE
CANNOT RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OPERATE PROFITABLY, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.
IF THAT OCCURS, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. 

15 

WE
MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE SUCH FINANCING, WE MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS . 

FUTURE
EVENTS, INCLUDING THE PROBLEMS, DELAYS, EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY GROWING COMPANIES, MAY LEAD TO COST
AND EXPENSE INCREASES THAT COULD MAKE OUR REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PLANS. WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL
CAPITAL, INCLUDING AN OFFERING OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES, AN OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OR OBTAINING FINANCING THROUGH A BANK
OR OTHER ENTITY. WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A LIMIT AS TO THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE MAY INCUR NOR HAVE WE ADOPTED A RATIO OF OUR EQUITY
TO A DEBT ALLOWANCE. IF WE NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM ANY
SOURCE, THAT IT WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR THAT ANY FUTURE OFFERING OF SECURITIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. 

WE
MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND/OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE
ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FINANCING MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
DILUTION TO THE EXISTING HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHO DO NOT HAVE ANTI-DILUTION RIGHTS. THOSE ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON
STOCK WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF AN EXISTING HOLDER S PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN BROADLEAF CAPITAL PARTNERS, INC.. OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
WHEN NEEDED. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY LIMITED TRADING VOLUME AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

THERE
HAS BEEN A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, AND AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP. AS A
RESULT, THIS COULD REDUCE OUR SHAREHOLDERS ABILITY TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK IN SHORT TIME PERIODS, OR POSSIBLY AT ALL.
OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED, AND IS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE, SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS WHICH COULD
REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITHOUT REGARD TO OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT FACTORS
SUCH AS QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY OR THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY. 

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS DEEMED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO RESELL THEIR SHARES DUE
TO SUITABILITY REQUIREMENTS. 

THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SEC HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS WHICH GENERALLY DEFINE PENNY STOCK TO BE AN EQUITY
SECURITY THAT HAS A MARKET PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK ON THE BULLETIN BOARD HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE AND THEREFORE WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERED A PENNY
STOCK ACCORDING TO SEC RULES. THIS DESIGNATION REQUIRES ANY BROKER-DEALER SELLING THESE SECURITIES TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE TRANSACTION, OBTAIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT FROM THE PURCHASER AND DETERMINE THAT THE PURCHASER IS REASONABLY
SUITABLE TO PURCHASE THE SECURITIES. THESE RULES LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SOLICIT PURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR SHARES. 

16 

NEVADA
LAW AND OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION MAY PROTECT OUR DIRECTORS FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF LAWSUITS WHICH COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY
FOR DANIELS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR OPERATIONS. 

NEVADA
LAW PROVIDES THAT OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO US OR OUR STOCKHOLDERS FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ALL BUT CERTAIN
TYPES OF CONDUCT AS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. OUR BYLAWS PERMIT US BROAD INDEMNIFICATION POWERS TO ALL PERSONS AGAINST ALL DAMAGES
INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED OR ALLOWED BY LAW. THESE EXCULPATION PROVISIONS MAY HAVE
THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING STOCKHOLDERS FROM RECOVERING DAMAGES AGAINST OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CAUSED BY THEIR NEGLIGENCE, POOR
JUDGMENT OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE OUR LIMITED ASSETS TO DEFEND OUR OFFICERS
AND DIRECTORS AGAINST CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE, POOR JUDGMENT, OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. 

SINCE
WE HAVE NOT PAID ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND DO NOT INTEND TO DO SO IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, A PURCHASER OF OUR COMMON
STOCK WILL ONLY REALIZE AN ECONOMIC GAIN ON HIS OR HER INVESTMENT FROM AN APPRECIATION, IF ANY, IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK. 

WE
HAVE NEVER PAID, AND HAVE NO INTENTIONS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE TO PAY, ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. THEREFORE AN
INVESTOR IN OUR COMMON STOCK, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, WILL ONLY REALIZE A PROFIT ON HIS INVESTMENT IF THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK INCREASES IN VALUE. 

IF
WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. AS
A RESULT, CURRENT AND POTENTIAL STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND
THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WE
ARE SUBJECT TO REPORTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AS REQUIRED BY SECTION
404(A) OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING EVERY PUBLIC COMPANY TO INCLUDE A MANAGEMENT REPORT ON SUCH
COMPANY S INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH CONTAINS MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT
OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY S INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. SINCE OUR ELECTION TO BE TREATED AS AN
EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY WE ARE EXEMPT FROM SECTION 404(B) WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ATTESTING
TO AND REPORTING ON MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY S INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING. THESE APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS MAY FIRST APPLY TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-KSB FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER
31, 2002. OUR MANAGEMENT MAY CONCLUDE THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. MOREOVER, EVEN
IF OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE EFFECTIVE, OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM MAY STILL DECLINE TO ATTEST TO OUR MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OR MAY ISSUE A REPORT THAT IS QUALIFIED IF THEY
ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR CONTROLS OR THE LEVEL AT WHICH OUR CONTROLS ARE DOCUMENTED, DESIGNED, OPERATED OR REVIEWED, OR IF IT
INTERPRETS THE RELEVANT REQUIREMENTS DIFFERENTLY FROM US. 

OUR
REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY WILL PLACE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
AND SYSTEMS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF WE FAIL TO TIMELY ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT A REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL. MOREOVER,
EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO PRODUCE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ARE IMPORTANT
TO HELP PREVENT FRAUD. AS A RESULT, OUR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IN TURN COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS
AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FURTHERMORE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL INCUR CONSIDERABLE COSTS
AND USE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT TIME AND OTHER RESOURCES IN AN EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 404(A) AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS PROSPECTUS WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO THE COMPANY OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE ACT. 

WE
ARE PREPARING FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 404(A) BY STRENGTHENING, ASSESSING AND TESTING OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS TO PROVIDE
THE BASIS FOR OUR REPORT. THE PROCESS OF STRENGTHENING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND COMPLYING WITH SECTION 404(A) IS EXPENSIVE AND
TIME CONSUMING, AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT THESE MEASURES WILL ENSURE THAT WE WILL
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CONTROLS OVER OUR FINANCIAL PROCESSES AND REPORTING IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, AS WE RAPIDLY GROW OUR BUSINESS,
OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES TO ENSURE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVERALL
REMAIN EFFECTIVE. FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION,
COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR CAUSE US TO FAIL TO MEET OUR REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. IF WE OR OUR AUDITORS DISCOVER A MATERIAL
WEAKNESS, THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT FACT, EVEN IF QUICKLY REMEDIED, COULD REDUCE THE MARKET S CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND HARM OUR STOCK PRICE. 

17 

INVESTORS
IN OUR SECURITIES MAY SUFFER DILUTION. 

THE
ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING WARRANTS, OPTIONS OR PREFERRED STOCK WILL DILUTE
THE EQUITY INTEREST OF EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANTI-DILUTION RIGHTS AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT
ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ACQUIRED AT A DISCOUNT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE
MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL
FINANCING WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND/OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL SHARES
OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FINANCING MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO
THE EXISTING HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHO DO NOT HAVE ANTI-DILUTION RIGHTS. THOSE ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF AN EXISTING HOLDER S PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN DANIELS CORPORATE ADVISORY, INC.. OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
WHEN NEEDED.

1A. RISK FACTORS. 

THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE LEVELS OF REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT
ACTIVITY AND NEW CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY WHICH HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS. 

CRITICAL
FACTORS IN THE LEVEL OF THE COMPANY S SALES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS ARE
THE LEVELS OF RESIDENTIAL REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT ACTIVITY AND NEW
RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. THE LEVEL OF
NEW RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND, TO A LESSER
EXTENT, THE LEVEL OF RESIDENTIAL REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT ACTIVITY ARE
AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL FACTORS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,
CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS,
OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL. ANY DECLINE IN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY AS A RESULT OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A DECLINE IN
NEW CONSTRUCTION AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, RESIDENTIAL REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT
PURCHASES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE COMPANY S SALES,
PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCED LEVELS OF HOME
SALES AND HOUSING STARTS AND OTHER SOFTENING IN THE HOUSING MARKETS IN 2007
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2007 AND THESE
FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS IN 2008. 

IN
ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY IN THE MORTGAGE
MARKETS AND THE RESULTANT IMPACT ON THE OVERALL CREDIT MARKET COULD CONTINUE TO
ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT
STANDARDS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A DECLINE IN CONSUMER SPENDING FOR HOME
REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT PROJECTS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S
OPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, INCREASES IN THE COST OF HOME
MORTGAGES AND THE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING FINANCING FOR NEW HOMES COULD CONTINUE
TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE SALES OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL
CONSTRUCTION MARKET. 

FLUCTUATIONS
IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS AND INCREASES IN
FREIGHT AND OTHER COSTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS. 

THE
COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON RAW MATERIALS AND PURCHASED COMPONENTS, INCLUDING,
AMONG OTHERS, STEEL, MOTORS, COMPRESSORS, COPPER, PACKAGING MATERIAL, ALUMINUM,
PLASTICS, GLASS AND VARIOUS CHEMICALS AND PAINTS THAT IT PURCHASES FROM THIRD
PARTIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN COSTS OF RAW
MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS, OR IN LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR
COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY ENTER INTO LONG-TERM
SUPPLY CONTRACTS FOR RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, THE
COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT HEDGE AGAINST ITS SUPPLY
REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN RAW
MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS FROM ITS CURRENT OR ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS AT REASONABLE
PRICES IN THE FUTURE, OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS
ON THE SCALE AND WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES THE COMPANY
REQUIRES. FURTHER, IF THE COMPANY S SUPPLIERS ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE
COMPANY S SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS
AND/OR COSTS INCREASES WHICH (TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO FIND
ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS OR PASS ALONG THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS) COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION. 

FOR
EXAMPLE, DURING 2005 THROUGH 2007, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES
IN THE PRICES IT PAID FOR STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM AND STEEL FABRICATED
PARTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AND MAY CONTINUE TO
EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN FREIGHT AND OTHER COSTS DUE TO RISING OIL AND OTHER
ENERGY PRICES. WHILE THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO OFFSET A PORTION OF
THESE COST INCREASES IN THESE PERIODS BY RAISING PRICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR
SOME PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVES AND
IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE
COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OFFSET ALL MATERIAL COST INCREASES IN 2008 OR IN ANY
FUTURE PERIODS. 

THE A VAILABILITY OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AND
COMPONENT PARTS FROM SOLE OR LIMITED SOURCES OF SUPPLY MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. 

SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMPONENT
PARTS FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON LIMITED OR
SOLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE
FINISHED PRODUCT. WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ALTERNATIVE
SOURCES OF SUPPLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT FACE
DISRUPTIONS IN SOURCES OF SUPPLY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. 

WEATHER
FLUCTUATIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. 

WEATHER
FLUCTUATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S OPERATING RESULTS AND ITS
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SALES VOLUME. IN THE COMPANY S HVAC SEGMENT,
OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER IN THE MONTHS
OF NOVEMBER TO FEBRUARY AND UNSEASONABLY COOL WEATHER IN THE MONTHS OF MAY TO
AUGUST, WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF DIMINISHING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR HEATING AND AIR
CONDITIONING PRODUCTS. IN ALL OF THE COMPANY S SEGMENTS, ADVERSE
WEATHER CONDITIONS AT ANY TIME OF THE YEAR MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OVERALL LEVELS
OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT ACTIVITY, WHICH IN TURN MAY
LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SALES. MANY OF THE COMPANY S OPERATING EXPENSES
ARE FIXED AND CANNOT BE REDUCED DURING PERIODS OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR ITS
PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
FLOWS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN QUARTERS WITH LOWER SALES DUE TO WEATHER
FLUCTUATIONS. 

IF
THE COMPANY FAILS TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, OR TO INTEGRATE
THE BUSINESSES IT HAS ACQUIRED OR WILL ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, IT COULD
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. 

HISTORICALLY,
THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS, AND THOSE
ACQUISITIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANY S GROWTH IN SALES AND
PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE HTP SEGMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES
THAT ACQUISITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF ITS GROWTH
STRATEGY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO
LOCATE AND SECURE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE
ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY
ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, ITS GROWTH, PARTICULARLY IN THE HTP SEGMENT,
COULD BE IMPAIRED. 

THERE
ARE SEVERAL RISKS IN ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING: 

THE
 DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE THAT THE COMPANY INCURS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
 ACQUISITION, 

THE
 DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE THAT THE COMPANY INCURS IN THE SUBSEQUENT
 ASSIMILATION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY INTO THE COMPANY S
 OPERATIONS, 

ADVERSE
 ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES OF CONFORMING THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING
 POLICIES TO THE COMPANY S, 

THE
 DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING, IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING
 SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AT ACQUIRED COMPANIES, INCLUDING DISCLOSURE
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
 REPORTING, 

THE
 DIFFICULTY IN OPERATING ACQUIRED
BUSINESSES, 

THE
 DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANY S OTHER BUSINESS
 CONCERNS, 

THE
 POTENTIAL LOSS OF CUSTOMERS OR KEY EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED
 COMPANIES, 

THE
 IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE
 ACQUISITION OR THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATING EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ACQUIRED
 BUSINESS, AND 

THE
 ASSUMPTION OF UNKNOWN LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED
 COMPANY. 

THE
COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THAT ANY ACQUISITION IT HAS MADE OR MAY MAKE WILL BE
SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY S ON-GOING OPERATIONS OR THAT THE
COMPANY WILL ACHIEVE ANY EXPECTED COST SAVINGS FROM ANY
ACQUISITION. IF THE OPERATIONS OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS DO NOT MEET
EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY S PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS MAY BE IMPAIRED AND THE
COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS OR WRITE-OFF THE
VALUE OF SOME OR ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. 

BECAUSE
THE COMPANY COMPETES AGAINST COMPETITORS WITH SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES,
THE COMPANY FACES EXTERNAL COMPETITIVE RISKS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS
BUSINESS. 

THE
COMPANY S RVP AND HTP SEGMENTS COMPETE WITH MANY DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
SUPPLIERS IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH SUPPLIERS OF
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF QUALITY, DISTRIBUTION, DELIVERY
AND PRICE. SOME OF THE COMPANY S COMPETITORS IN THESE MARKETS HAVE
GREATER FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY DOES. 

IN THE
HVAC SEGMENT, THE COMPANY S RESIDENTIAL HVAC PRODUCTS COMPETE IN BOTH THE
SITE-BUILT AND MANUFACTURED HOUSING MARKETS ON THE BASIS OF BREADTH AND QUALITY
OF PRODUCT LINE, DISTRIBUTION, PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND PRICE. MOST OF THE
COMPANY S RESIDENTIAL HVAC COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND MARKETING
RESOURCES AND THE PRODUCTS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY S COMPETITORS MAY ENJOY
GREATER BRAND AWARENESS THAN THE COMPANY S RESIDENTIAL HVAC
PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY S COMMERCIAL HVAC PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY ON
THE BASIS OF ENGINEERING SUPPORT, QUALITY, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION FLEXIBILITY
AND TOTAL INSTALLED SYSTEM COST. MOST OF THE COMPANY S COMPETITORS IN
THE COMMERCIAL HVAC MARKET HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES AND
ENJOY GREATER BRAND AWARENESS THAN THE COMPANY DOES. 

COMPETITIVE
FACTORS COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE PRICES OR INCREASE SPENDING ON
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SALES, EITHER OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
ITS OPERATING RESULTS. 

FLUCTUATIONS
IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S REVENUES,
PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS. 

THE
COMPANY S FOREIGN OPERATIONS EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY
EXCHANGE RATES AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS
FINANCIAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, BUT A PORTION OF ITS SALES AND EXPENSES ARE
DENOMINATED IN EUROS, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND OTHER CURRENCIES. AS A
RESULT, CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS, CANADIAN DOLLARS
AND OTHER CURRENCIES WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY S LEVELS OF REVENUES AND
PROFITABILITY. IF THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASES RELATIVE TO
THE VALUE OF THE EURO, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND OTHER CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY S
LEVELS OF REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WILL DECLINE SINCE THE TRANSLATION OF A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF EUROS OR UNITS OF SUCH OTHER CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR
FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL REPRESENT FEWER U.S.
DOLLARS. CONVERSELY, IF THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DECREASES
RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF THE EURO, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND OTHER CURRENCIES, THE
COMPANY S LEVELS OF REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WILL INCREASE SINCE THE
TRANSLATION OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF EUROS OR UNITS OF SUCH OTHER CURRENCIES INTO
U.S. DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL REPRESENT ADDITIONAL U.S.
DOLLARS. IN ADDITION, IN THE CASE OF SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN CERTAIN
LOCATIONS, THE COMPANY S SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS OR
CANADIAN DOLLARS BUT ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY S ASSOCIATED
COSTS ARE DENOMINATED IN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY. AS A RESULT, CHANGES
IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS AND CANADIAN DOLLARS AND ANY SUCH
DIFFERENT CURRENCY WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY S PROFITABILITY AND CASH
FLOWS. 

BECAUSE
THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS
SUBJECT TO THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF FOREIGN
NATIONS. 

THE
COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED
STATES. IN 2007, THE COMPANY SOLD PRODUCTS IN APPROXIMATELY 100
COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. FOREIGN NET SALES, WHICH ARE
ATTRIBUTED BASED UPON THE LOCATION OF THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE SALE, WERE APPROXIMATELY 19.5 AND 21.5 OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY S
FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING
RISKS THAT: 

FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO REPATRIATE
 FUNDS, 

FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPOSE WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON REMITTANCES AND OTHER
 PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY, OR THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH TAXES MAY
 INCREASE, 

AN
 OUTBREAK OR ESCALATION OF ANY INSURRECTION, ARMED CONFLICT OR ACT OF
 TERRORISM, OR ANOTHER FORM OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY, MAY
 OCCUR, 

NATURAL
 DISASTERS MAY OCCUR, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN
 RESPONDING TO THESE EVENTS, 

FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS MAY NATIONALIZE FOREIGN ASSETS OR ENGAGE IN OTHER FORMS OF
 GOVERNMENT PROTECTIONISM, 

FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPOSE OR INCREASE INVESTMENT BARRIERS, CUSTOMS OR TARIFFS
 OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING THE COMPANY S BUSINESS,
 AND 

DEVELOPMENT,
 IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING OF SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OF THE
 COMPANY S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
 PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, MAY BE
 DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. 

THE
OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS IN
PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OR REGIONS OF THE WORLD, OR PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM
CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE SALES
AND ADVERSELY AFFECT PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RELIES
ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET
ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. IF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON
THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO REPATRIATE FUNDS OR IMPOSE OR INCREASE TAXES ON
REMITTANCES OR OTHER PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER
DISTRIBUTIONS THE COMPANY RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD BE REDUCED, WHICH
COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY TO MEET ITS DEBT
OBLIGATIONS. 

VARYING
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PRACTICES. 

THE
COMPANY CURRENTLY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS, COMPONENTS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS FROM
VARIOUS FOREIGN SUPPLIERS. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH FOREIGN
SUPPLIER UTILIZES LABOR OR OTHER PRACTICES THAT VARY FROM THOSE COMMONLY
ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED
STATES , THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS AND REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY RESULTING LITIGATION,
NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, POLITICAL PRESSURE OR OTHERWISE. 

A
DECLINE IN THE COMPANY S RELATIONS WITH ITS KEY DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS OR LOSS
OF MAJOR CUSTOMERS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. 

THE
COMPANY S OPERATIONS DEPEND UPON ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ITS
INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY ENTER
INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH THEM. IF THE COMPANY S KEY DISTRIBUTORS
OR DEALERS ARE UNWILLING TO CONTINUE TO SELL THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS OR IF ANY OF
THEM MERGE WITH OR ARE PURCHASED BY A COMPETITOR, THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE A
DECLINE IN SALES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO REPLACE SUCH
DISTRIBUTORS OR DEALERS OR OTHERWISE REPLACE THE RESULTING LOSS OF SALES, THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 54 OF
THE COMPANY S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES WERE MADE THROUGH ITS INDEPENDENT
DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS, AND THE COMPANY S LARGEST DISTRIBUTOR OR DEALER
ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 4.9 OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2007. 

IN
ADDITION, THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY S OTHER MAJOR CUSTOMERS, OR A
SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN SUCH CUSTOMERS' PURCHASES FROM THE COMPANY, COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
FLOWS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT GENERALLY HAVE BINDING LONG-TERM
PURCHASING AGREEMENTS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE
COMPANY S EXISTING CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM THE
COMPANY. THE COMPANY S LARGEST CUSTOMER (OTHER THAN A DISTRIBUTOR OR
DEALER) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 4.9 OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. 

LABOR
DISRUPTIONS OR COST INCREASES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS. 

A WORK
STOPPAGE AT ONE OF THE COMPANY S FACILITIES THAT LASTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD
OF TIME COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO LOSE SALES, INCUR INCREASED COSTS AND
ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. A PLANT
SHUTDOWN OR A SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION TO EMPLOYMENT TERMS (INCLUDING THE
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY S UNIONIZED EMPLOYEES)
COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES OR THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET
IMPAIRMENT. AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS EXPIRE AND UNTIL
NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETED, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ON THE SAME OR MORE FAVORABLE TERMS
AS THE CURRENT AGREEMENTS OR AT ALL WITHOUT PRODUCTION INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING
LABOR STOPPAGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 6.2 OF THE
COMPANY S EMPLOYEES ARE UNIONIZED, AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES
UNION ORGANIZING EFFORTS DIRECTED AT THE COMPANY S NON-UNION
EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE LABOR COST INCREASES OR
DISRUPTIONS IN ITS NON-UNION FACILITIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE COMPANY MUST
COMPETE FOR EMPLOYEES WITH NECESSARY SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE OR IN TIGHT LABOR
MARKETS. 

THE
COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND IMPROVE ITS PRODUCTS TO MAINTAIN ITS
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. 

THE
COMPANY S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW ITS MARKET SHARES DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY
TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP HIGH QUALITY, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS. AN
IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPANY S COMPETITIVE STRATEGY INCLUDES LEVERAGING ITS
DISTRIBUTOR AND DEALER RELATIONSHIPS AND ITS EXISTING BRANDS TO INTRODUCE NEW
PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE COMPANY S HVAC PRODUCTS ARE
SUBJECT TO FEDERAL MINIMUM EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND/OR PROTOCOLS CONCERNING THE
USE OF OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES THAT HAVE AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO
BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME. THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THAT ITS
INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT WILL BE
SUFFICIENT OR THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS TO ENABLE
THE COMPANY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED
BY THE COMPANY S COMPETITORS OR MEET HEIGHTENED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN THE
FUTURE. 

THE
COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL
OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS A RESULT OF VIOLATIONS OF OR LIABILITIES UNDER
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. 

THE
COMPANY S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE
THAT IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE AIR AND WATER,
ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR THE USE, TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTES AND GOVERN THE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED
SITES. THE COMPANY HAS USED AND CONTINUES TO USE VARIOUS SUBSTANCES
IN ITS PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, AND HAS GENERATED AND CONTINUES TO
GENERATE WASTES, WHICH HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE DEEMED TO BE HAZARDOUS OR
DANGEROUS. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO AND MAY BE
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER
LIABILITIES UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND
REGULATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT ONGOING OPERATIONS AND
REQUIRE CAPITAL COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE AND
MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER
COUNTRIES HAVE ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FOR LIMITING THE PRODUCTION, IMPORTATION AND
USE OF CERTAIN OZONE DEPLETING CHEMICALS, INCLUDING HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS, OR
HCFCS, A REFRIGERANT USED IN THE COMPANY S AIR CONDITIONING AND HEAT PUMP
PRODUCTS. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN BANNED COMPLETELY, AND
OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE PHASED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE YEAR
2010. MODIFICATIONS TO THE DESIGN OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS MAY BE
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO UTILIZE ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS. 

IN
ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,
FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AND THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR
PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, AS A RESULT OF VIOLATIONS OF OR LIABILITIES UNDER
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS REQUIRED AT ITS
FACILITIES. CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO IMPOSE
LIABILITY, WITHOUT REGARD TO KNOWLEDGE OR FAULT, RELATING TO THE EXISTENCE OF
CONTAMINATION AT OR ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES USED IN THE COMPANY S CURRENT AND
FORMER OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF THE COMPANY S PREDECESSORS, OR AT LOCATIONS TO
WHICH CURRENT OR FORMER OPERATIONS OR THOSE OF THE COMPANY S PREDECESSORS HAVE
SHIPPED WASTE FOR DISPOSAL. CONTAMINANTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT
CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY S FORMER SITES, AND THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A
POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AT SEVERAL THIRD-PARTY WASTE DISPOSAL
SITES. WHILE THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY SUCH SITES AS
TO WHICH MATERIAL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS OR OBLIGATIONS EXIST, THE DISCOVERY OF
ADDITIONAL CONTAMINANTS OR THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL CLEANUP OBLIGATIONS AT
THESE OR OTHER SITES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY. IN
ADDITION, THE COMPANY CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT IDENTIFICATION OF PRESENTLY
UNIDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, MORE VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT BY REGULATORY
AGENCIES, ENACTMENT OF MORE STRINGENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER
UNANTICIPATED EVENTS WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE AND GIVE RISE TO MATERIAL
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
FLOWS. 

THE
COMPANY FACES RISKS OF LITIGATION AND LIABILITY CLAIMS ON PRODUCT LIABILITY,
WORKERS COMPENSATION AND OTHER MATTERS, THE EXTENT OF WHICH EXPOSURE CAN BE
DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE AND WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
FLOWS. 

THE
COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ITS BUSINESSES
THAT COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS, INCLUDING CONTRACT AND EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS,
PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, WARRANTY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS FOR MODIFICATION,
ADJUSTMENT OR REPLACEMENT OF COMPONENT PARTS OF UNITS SOLD. PRODUCT
LIABILITY AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO BUSINESSES THE
COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED OR PROPERTIES IT HAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED OR
OPERATED. 

THE
DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, SALE AND USE OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS INVOLVE RISKS
OF PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WARRANTY CLAIMS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY
DAMAGE ARISING FROM FIRE, SOOT, MOLD AND CARBON MONOXIDE. THE COMPANY
CURRENTLY CARRIES INSURANCE AND MAINTAINS RESERVES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT
LIABILITY CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY S INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE
INADEQUATE IF SUCH CLAIMS DO ARISE AND ANY LIABILITY NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. THE
ACCOUNTING FOR SELF-INSURED PLANS REQUIRES THAT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND
ESTIMATES BE MADE BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE FUTURE LIABILITIES TO BE PAID FOR
KNOWN CLAIMS AND INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED CLAIMS AS OF THE REPORTING
DATE. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE IN
AMOUNTS IT BELIEVES TO BE APPROPRIATE TO COVER SUCH
LIABILITY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY S INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY INCREASE IN
THE FUTURE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS GENERALLY OR
THE COMPANY S SITUATION IN PARTICULAR. ANY SUCH INCREASE COULD RESULT
IN LOWER PROFITS OR CAUSE THE NEED TO REDUCE THE COMPANY S INSURANCE
COVERAGE. IN ADDITION, A FUTURE CLAIM MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST THE
COMPANY WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY. ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM MAY ALSO INCLUDE THE IMPOSITION
OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES, THE AWARD OF WHICH, PURSUANT TO CERTAIN STATE LAWS, MAY NOT
BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. THE COMPANY S PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE
POLICIES HAVE LIMITS THAT IF EXCEEDED, MAY RESULT IN MATERIAL COSTS THAT WOULD
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON FUTURE PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, WARRANTY
CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY NOT COVERED BY THE COMPANY S PRODUCT LIABILITY
INSURANCE. FURTHER, ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY OR WARRANTY ISSUES MAY
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S REPUTATION AS A MANUFACTURER OF HIGH-QUALITY,
SAFE PRODUCTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS
BUSINESS. 

PRODUCT
RECALLS OR REWORKS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S BUSINESS. 

IN THE
EVENT THE COMPANY PRODUCES A PRODUCT THAT IS ALLEGED TO CONTAIN A DESIGN OR
MANUFACTURING DEFECT, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR COSTS INVOLVED TO
RECALL OR REWORK THAT PRODUCT. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN
SEVERAL VOLUNTARY PRODUCT RECALLS AND REWORKS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS,
ADDITIONAL PRODUCT RECALLS AND REWORKS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL
COSTS. MANY OF THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY CERTAIN MODELS OF
BATH FANS, RANGE HOODS AND RESIDENTIAL FURNACES AND AIR CONDITIONERS, HAVE A
LARGE INSTALLED BASE, AND ANY RECALLS AND REWORKS RELATED TO PRODUCTS WITH A
LARGE INSTALLED BASE COULD BE PARTICULARLY COSTLY. THE COSTS OF
PRODUCT RECALLS AND REWORKS ARE NOT GENERALLY COVERED BY
INSURANCE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY S REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND
QUALITY IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING ITS MARKET SHARE AND PROTECTING ITS
BRANDS. ANY RECALLS OR REWORKS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
REPUTATION AS A MANUFACTURER OF HIGH-QUALITY, SAFE PRODUCTS AND COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
CASH FLOWS. 

THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED IF IT LOST
MEMBERS OF ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM. 

THE
COMPANY S SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UPON THE CONTINUED
CONTRIBUTIONS OF ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS, BOTH
INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A GROUP. THE COMPANY S FUTURE PERFORMANCE WILL BE
SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE
THEM. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF THESE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR
KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS, PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RICHARD L. BREADY, AND THE COMPANY S OTHER EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS, COULD PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM EXECUTING ITS BUSINESS
STRATEGY. 

THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF IT FAILS TO
ADEQUATELY PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, IF IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH
THE TERMS OF ITS LICENSES OR IF THIRD PARTIES CLAIM THAT THE COMPANY IS IN
VIOLATION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 

THE
COMPANY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CERTAIN OF THE BRAND NAMES UNDER WHICH IT SELLS
ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BROAN AND NUTONE . FAILURE TO PROTECT THESE
BRAND NAMES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR TO PREVENT THEIR
UNAUTHORIZED USE BY THIRD PARTIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TRADEMARK, COPYRIGHT, PATENT AND TRADE SECRET
LAWS, AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. THESE PROTECTIONS MAY
NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM USING THE COMPANY S BRAND NAMES AND
TRADEMARKS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR FROM COPYING THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS OR
DEVELOPING PRODUCTS EQUIVALENT TO OR SUPERIOR TO THE COMPANY S. THE
COMPANY LICENSES SEVERAL BRAND NAMES FROM THIRD PARTIES. IN THE EVENT
THE COMPANY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THESE LICENSES, THE COMPANY COULD
LOSE THE RIGHT TO USE THESE BRAND NAMES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY
FACES THE RISK OF CLAIMS THAT THE COMPANY IS INFRINGING THIRD PARTIES'
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ANY SUCH CLAIM, EVEN IF IT IS WITHOUT
MERIT, COULD BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING; COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO CEASE
MAKING, USING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE THE DISPUTED
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REDESIGN ITS PRODUCTS, IF
FEASIBLE; COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT TIME AND ATTENTION; AND COULD REQUIRE THE
COMPANY TO ENTER INTO COSTLY ROYALTY OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS. 

THE
COMPANY S SUBSTANTIAL DEBT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS BUSINESS, PREVENT THE
COMPANY FROM FULFILLING ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT
ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

THE
COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,
THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 1,445.4 MILLION OF TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING AND A
DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 2.3:1. THE TERMS OF THE
COMPANY S OUTSTANDING DEBT, INCLUDING NORTEK'S 8 1/2 SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES
AND NORTEK'S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY LIMIT, BUT DO NOT PROHIBIT, THE
COMPANY FROM INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT. 

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD
APPROXIMATELY 35.0 MILLION OUTSTANDI NG (WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF
APPROXIMATELY 7.4 5 AND APPROXIMATELY 133.4 MILLION OF
AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE U.S. REVOLVING PORTION OF ITS SENIOR SECURED
CREDIT FACILITY, WITH APPROXIMATELY 21.6 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF
CREDIT. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING PORTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED
CREDIT FACILITY ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING
BORROWINGS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THE CANADIAN REVOLVING PORTION OF
ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND
APPROXIMATELY 10.0 MILLION OF AVAILABLE BORROWING
CAPACITY. L ETTERS OF CREDIT HAVE BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE
COMPANY S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS ADDITIONAL SECURITY FOR (1) APPROXIMATELY
 17.2 MILLION RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY S INSURANCE PROGRAMS, (2)
APPROXIMATELY 3.6 MILLION RELATING TO LEASES OUTSTANDING FOR CERTAIN OF THE
COMPANY S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND (3) APPROXIMATELY 0.8 MILLION RELATING
TO CERTAIN OF THE SUBSIDIARIES PURCHASES AND OTHER
REQUIREMENTS. LETTERS OF CREDIT REDUCE BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER
THE COMPANY S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR
BASIS. IF ADDITIONAL
DEBT IS ADDED TO CURRENT DEBT LEVELS, THE RELATED RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW COULD
INTENSIFY. SEE
ALSO THE DISCUSSION IN RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
CONCERNING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE COMPANY S DEBT COVENANTS INCLUDED
ELSEWHERE HEREIN. 

THE
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY S DEBT COULD HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES,
INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

THE
 COMPANY S ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL,
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS, OR OTHER
 PURPOSES COULD BE IMPAIRED, 

A
 SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY S CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE
 DEDICATED TO PAYING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON ITS DEBT, THEREBY REDUCING
 FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR EXPANSION OR OTHER
PURPOSES, 

THE
 COMPANY MAY BE MORE LEVERAGED THAN SOME OF ITS COMPETITORS, WHICH MAY
 RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE
DISADVANTAGE, 

THE
 COMPANY MAY BE VULNERABLE TO INTEREST RATE INCREASES, AS CERTAIN OF ITS
 BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THOSE UNDER THE NORTEK SENIOR SECURED CREDIT
 FACILITY, ARE AT VARIABLE RATES, 

THE
 COMPANY S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIONS IN ITS FINANCING
 AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
 COMPANY, 

THE
 COMPANY S SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT COULD MAKE IT MORE VULNERABLE TO
 CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS, 

THE
 COMPANY MAY BE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, INVESTING IN
 NEW PRODUCTS OR CAPITAL ASSETS OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS
 OPPORTUNITIES, AND 

THE
 COMPANY MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO,
 CHANGES IN ITS BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH IT
 OPERATES. 

THE
COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL NEED TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FUTURE
TO RAISE THE FUNDS TO REPAY ITS DEBT THAT REMAINS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,
2007. THE COMPANY HAS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE A
REFINANCING OR THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCING,
PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE COMPANY S ANTICIPATED HIGH LEVELS OF DEBT AND THE
RESTRICTIONS UNDER ITS CURRENT DEBT AGREEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY IS
UNABLE TO SATISFY OR REFINANCE ITS CURRENT DEBT AS IT COMES DUE, THE COMPANY MAY
DEFAULT ON ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY DEFAULTS ON NORTEK S
SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY OR NORTEK S 8 1/2 SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES THEN
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY S OTHER DEBT WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND
PAYABLE. ANY DEFAULT ON THE COMPANY S DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR THE
ACCELERATION OF ITS DEBT WILL LIKELY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
FLOWS. 

THE
TERMS OF THE COMPANY S DEBT COVENANTS COULD LIMIT HOW THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS
BUSINESS AND ITS ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. 

THE
AGREEMENTS WHICH GOVERN THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY S DEBT, INCLUDING THE INDENTURE
THAT GOVERNS THE COMPANY S 8 1/2 
SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES AND THE AGREEMENT THAT GOVERNS THE COMPANY S SENIOR
SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT THE COMPANY S ABILITY
AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES TO: 

INCUR
 ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, 

PAY
 DIVIDENDS OR MAKE OTHER
DISTRIBUTIONS, 

MAKE
 LOANS OR INVESTMENTS, 

INCUR
 CERTAIN LIENS,

 INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES,
AND 

CONSOLIDATE,
 MERGE OR SELL ASSETS. 

IN ADDITION, THE
COMPANY S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS TWO FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE
COVENANTS, WHICH BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE OVER TIME, AND THE COMPANY CANNOT
ASSURE THAT THESE COVENANTS WILL ALWAYS BE MET PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FURTHER
DETERIORATION OF THE NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR AND REMODELING
INDUSTRIES, PLUS THE INSTABILITY IN THE OVERALL CREDIT MARKETS. THESE
TWO COVENANTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER,
CALCULATED BASED ON THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, A LEVERAGE RATIO AND AN INTEREST
COVERAGE RATIO, EACH AS DEFINED. THE LEVERAGE RATIO MUST NOT EXCEED A
DEFINED RATIO AMOUNT AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO MUST NOT BE LESS THAN A
DEFINED RATIO AMOUNT. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING
THE COMPANY S TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS, NET OF CASH, (AS DEFINED) BY EBITDA (AS
DEFINED) AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING EBITDA (AS
DEFINED) BY INTEREST EXPENSE, NET (AS DEFINED). AT DECEMBER 31, 2007
THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO NOT GREATER THAN 5.85:1
AND AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF NOT LESS THAN 2.10:1. AT DECEMBER
31, 2007 THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEVERAGE RATIO AND THE INTEREST
COVERAGE RATIO COVENANTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY S
LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 5.37:1 AND ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WAS
2.32:1. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 5.85:1 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007
TIGHTENS TO 5.60:1 AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND FURTHER TIGHTENS
TO 5.25:1 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHILE THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF
2.10:1 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TIGHTENS TO 2.20:1 AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER
OF 2008 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008. SHOULD THE COMPANY NOT SATISFY
EITHER OF THESE COVENANTS, THE COMPANY S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS A
CURE, WHEREBY A SUBSEQUENT CASH EQUITY INVESTMENT EQUAL TO THE EBITDA SHORTFALL,
WILL BE TREATED AS EBITDA FOR PURPOSES OF THE COMPLIANCE CALCULATIONS IN THE
CURRENT AND FUTURE PERIODS. THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS
FOR SUCH A CURE TO OCCUR TWICE WITHIN A CONSECUTIVE TWELVE-MONTH
PERIOD. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE
FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WHICH WILL BE FILED WITH ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM
10-Q ON OR ABOUT MAY 15, 2008, WILL INDICATE THAT ITS EBITDA FOR SUCH QUARTER
(AS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY) WILL BE
BELOW THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO
AND THE LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANTS AS OF THE END OF SUCH QUARTER. ANY
SUCH SHORTFALL IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT AND THE COMPANY PLANS TO
UTILIZE THE EQUITY CURE RIGHT UNDER ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY TO AVOID
ANY DEFAULT OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF SUCH SHORTFALL. THE COMPANY
EXPECTS THAT IT MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER EVENTS OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTEREST
COVERAGE RATIO AND THE LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANTS AS OF THE END OF THE SECOND
QUARTER OF 2008 AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT MAY SEEK TO USE THE EQUITY CURE RIGHT
AGAIN TO REMEDY ANY SUCH NON-COMPLIANCE. BASED UPON THE COMPANY S
CURRENT FORECAST REGARDING ITS OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE BALANCE OF 2008
FOLLOWING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER EVENTS OF
NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANTS AS
OF THE END OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2008. TO THE EXTENT
THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES EVENTS OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH COVENANTS, WHICH ARE
NOT RESOLVED THROUGH THE USE OF THE EQUITY CURE FEATURE OR OTHER ALTERNATIVES,
THE COMPANY WOULD NEED TO SEEK WAIVERS OR AMENDMENTS FROM THE LENDERS UNDER ITS
SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY OR REFINANCE SUCH FACILITY. SHOULD AN
EVENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE OCCUR, THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO BORROW UNDER
ITS CREDIT FACILITY UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT A CURE HAPPENS. IF THESE
EVENTS OF NON-COMPLIANCE WERE TO OCCUR, AND WERE NOT CURED, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT
WOULD EXIST UNDER THE COMPANY S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND WOULD ALLOW
THE LENDERS TO ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING. IN
ADDITION, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WOULD RESULT IN A CROSS
DEFAULT UNDER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY S OTHER SENIOR AND SENIOR
SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS. IN LIGHT OF THE INSTABILITY AND
UNCERTAINTY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS AND
THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT STANDARDS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY
SUCH WAIVERS OR AMENDMENTS OR ANY SUCH REFINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE
TERMS. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCH WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS OR REFINANCING MAY
INVOLVE TERMS WHICH WOULD HAVE A FURTHER ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS
OF THE COMPANY. 

A
BREACH OF THE COVENANTS UNDER THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE COMPANY S 8 1/2 
SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES OR UNDER THE AGREEMENT THAT GOVERNS THE COMPANY S
SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE
APPLICABLE INDEBTEDNESS. SUCH DEFAULT MAY ALLOW THE CREDITORS TO
ACCELERATE THE RELATED DEBT AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF ANY OTHER DEBT
TO WHICH A CROSS-ACCELERATION OR CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION APPLIES. IN
ADDITION, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE COMPANY S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY
WOULD PERMIT THE LENDERS TO TERMINATE ALL COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND FURTHER CREDIT
UNDER THAT FACILITY. FURTHERMORE, IF THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO REPAY
THE AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE UNDER ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, THOSE
LENDERS COULD PROCEED AGAINST THE COLLATERAL GRANTED TO THEM TO SECURE THAT
INDEBTEDNESS. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY S LENDERS OR NOTEHOLDERS
ACCELERATE THE REPAYMENT OF THEIR BORROWINGS, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE
COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO REPAY SUCH
INDEBTEDNESS. THE COMPANY S FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WILL LIKELY
CONTAIN SIMILAR OR MORE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE
RESTRICTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE: 

LIMITED
 IN HOW THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS
BUSINESS, 

UNABLE
 TO RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO OPERATE DURING GENERAL
 ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS DOWNTURNS, OR 

UNABLE
 TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW BUSINESS
 OPPORTUNITIES. 

THESE
RESTRICTIONS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO GROW IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS
PLANS. REFER TO NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS, ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS REPORT, INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCE. 

THE
COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH TO SERVICE ALL OF ITS
INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY BE FORCED TO TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS
UNDER SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

THE
COMPANY S ABILITY TO PAY INTEREST, MAKE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS ON OR TO REFINANCE
ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS DEPENDS ON THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES' FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE
COMPANY S CONTROL. THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THAT ITS SUBSIDIARIES
WILL MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES SUFFICIENT TO
PERMIT THE COMPANY TO PAY INTEREST AND PAY OR REFINANCE ITS
INDEBTEDNESS. IF THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES' CASH FLOWS AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY S DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, THE
COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD FACE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND MAY
BE FORCED TO REDUCE OR DELAY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SELL ASSETS, SEEK ADDITIONAL
CAPITAL OR RESTRUCTURE OR REFINANCE ITS INDEBTEDNESS. THESE
ALTERNATIVE MEASURES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY NOT PERMIT THE COMPANY TO
MEET ITS SCHEDULED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. 

IF
THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ACCESS FUNDS GENERATED BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES THE COMPANY
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. 

BECAUSE
THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ALL OF ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY
DEPENDS ON THOSE ENTITIES FOR DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS TO
GENERATE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. LEGAL
RESTRICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS APPLICABLE TO THE
COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS IN CERTAIN AGREEMENTS
GOVERNING CURRENT AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL
AS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY S
SUBSIDIARIES, MAY LIMIT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO OBTAIN CASH FROM ITS
SUBSIDIARIES. ALL OF THE COMPANY S SUBSIDIARIES ARE SEPARATE AND
INDEPENDENT LEGAL ENTITIES AND HAVE NO OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER TO PAY ANY
DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS OR OTHER PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10 K AND PRESENTED ELSEWHERE BY OUR MANAGEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR FFO, AND PROSPECTS, WHICH WE REFER TO HEREIN AS A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OR AS MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING US, AND YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THEM. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR WHICH ARE CURRENTLY NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS. WE MAY UPDATE THESE FACTORS IN OUR FUTURE PERIODIC REPORTS. 

RISKS RELATING TO RETAIL OPERATIONS 

OVERALL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GENERAL RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. 

OUR CONCENTRATION IN THE RETAIL REAL ESTATE MARKET MEANS THAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: 

CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; 

TENANT BANKRUPTCIES AND A RESULTING REJECTION OF OUR LEASES; 

THE IMPACT ON OUR RETAIL TENANTS AND DEMAND FOR RETAIL SPACE AT OUR PROPERTIES FROM THE INCREASING USE OF THE INTERNET BY RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS; 

LOCAL REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS, SUCH AS AN OVERSUPPLY OF, OR REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR, RETAIL SPACE OR RETAIL GOODS, DECREASES IN RENTAL RATES, DECLINING REAL ESTATE VALUES AND THE AVAILABILITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS OF TENANTS; 

LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING, CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND FLUCTUATIONS IN SEASONAL SPENDING; 

THE WILLINGNESS OF RETAILERS TO LEASE SPACE IN OUR PROPERTIES; 

INCREASED OPERATING COSTS; 

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TAX, ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND ZONING; 

PERCEPTIONS BY CONSUMERS OF THE SAFETY, CONVENIENCE AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PROPERTIES; 

CASUALTIES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS; AND 

THE POTENTIAL FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 

WE DERIVE OUR OPERATING RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM RETAIL TENANTS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE UNDER SOME DEGREE OF ECONOMIC STRESS. A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR RETAIL TENANTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

SOME OF OUR PROPERTIES DEPEND ON ANCHOR STORES OR OTHER MAJOR TENANTS TO ATTRACT SHOPPERS AND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE ANCHOR STORES OR MAJOR TENANTS. 

OUR PROPERTIES ARE TYPICALLY ANCHORED BY DEPARTMENT STORES AND OTHER LARGE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED TENANTS. THE VALUE OF SOME OF OUR PROPERTIES COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THESE ANCHORS OR OTHER MAJOR TENANTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR CEASE THEIR OPERATIONS. 

FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG DEPARTMENT STORES AND OTHER LARGE STORES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS BIG BOX STORES CORPORATE MERGER ACTIVITY TYPICALLY RESULTS IN THE CLOSURE OF DUPLICATE OR GEOGRAPHICALLY OVERLAPPING STORE LOCATIONS. FURTHER, SUSTAINED ADVERSE PRESSURE ON THE RESULTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT STORES AND MAJOR TENANTS MAY HAVE A SIMILARLY SUSTAINED ADVERSE IMPACT UPON OUR OWN RESULTS. CERTAIN DEPARTMENT STORES AND OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE GIVEN CURRENT MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND LESS THAN DESIRABLE LEVELS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CONSIDERABLE DECREASES IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC IN THEIR RETAIL STORES, INCREASED COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE RETAIL OPTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ACCESSIBLE VIA THE INTERNET AND OTHER FORMS OF PRESSURE ON THEIR BUSINESS MODELS. AS PRESSURE ON THESE DEPARTMENT STORES AND NATIONAL RETAILERS INCREASES, THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR STORES, MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS BOTH TO US AND TO THEIR EXTERNAL LENDERS AND SUPPLIERS, WITHSTAND TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS BY INVESTORS OR RIVALS OR AVOID BANKRUPTCY AND/OR LIQUIDATION MAY BE IMPAIRED AND RESULT IN CLOSURES OF THEIR STORES OR THEIR SEEKING OF A LEASE MODIFICATION WITH US. ANY LEASE MODIFICATION COULD BE UNFAVORABLE TO US AS THE LESSOR AND COULD DECREASE RENTS OR EXPENSE RECOVERY CHARGES. OTHER TENANTS 

11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

MAY BE ENTITLED TO MODIFY THE ECONOMIC OR OTHER TERMS OF, OR TERMINATE, THEIR EXISTING LEASES WITH US IN THE EVENT OF SUCH CLOSURES. 

IF A DEPARTMENT STORE OR MAJOR TENANT WERE TO CLOSE ITS STORES AT OUR PROPERTIES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY AND DELAY AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE IN REPLACING THE TENANT, AS WELL AS IN LEASING SPACES IN AREAS ADJACENT TO THE VACANT DEPARTMENT STORE OR MAJOR TENANT, AT ATTRACTIVE RATES, OR AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY, DEPARTMENT STORE OR MAJOR TENANT CLOSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, WHICH COULD LEAD TO DECREASED SALES AT OUR PROPERTIES. IF THE SALES OF STORES OPERATING IN OUR PROPERTIES WERE TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE CLOSING OF ANCHOR STORES OR OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OR OTHER REASONS, TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR MINIMUM RENTS OR EXPENSE RECOVERY CHARGES. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULT BY A TENANT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY RECOVER, AND/OR MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS AND COSTS IN ENFORCING OUR RIGHTS AS LANDLORD TO RECOVER, AMOUNTS DUE TO US UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH PARTIES. 

WE FACE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM TENANT BANKRUPTCIES. 

BANKRUPTCY FILINGS BY RETAILERS CAN OCCUR REGULARLY IN THE COURSE OF OUR OPERATIONS. IF A TENANT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY, THE TENANT MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT AND TERMINATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS LEASES WITH US, AND WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT IT WILL AFFIRM ONE OR MORE OF ITS LEASES AND CONTINUE TO MAKE RENTAL PAYMENTS TO US IN A TIMELY MANNER. A BANKRUPTCY FILING BY, OR RELATING TO, ONE OF OUR TENANTS WOULD BAR ALL EFFORTS BY US TO COLLECT PRE BANKRUPTCY DEBTS FROM THAT TENANT, OR FROM THEIR PROPERTY, UNLESS WE RECEIVE AN ORDER PERMITTING US TO DO SO FROM THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT EVICT A TENANT SOLELY BECAUSE OF ITS BANKRUPTCY. IF A LEASE IS ASSUMED BY THE TENANT IN BANKRUPTCY, ALL PRE BANKRUPTCY BALANCES DUE UNDER THE LEASE MUST BE PAID TO US IN FULL. HOWEVER, IF A LEASE IS REJECTED BY A TENANT IN BANKRUPTCY, WE WOULD HAVE ONLY A GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIM FOR DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH BALANCES. IF A BANKRUPT TENANT VACATES A SPACE, IT MIGHT NOT DO SO IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO RE LEASE THE VACATED SPACE DURING THAT TIME AT ATTRACTIVE RATES, OR AT ALL. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE IN REPLACING THE BANKRUPT TENANT. ANY UNSECURED CLAIM WE HOLD AGAINST A BANKRUPT TENANT MIGHT BE PAID ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AND ONLY IN THE SAME PERCENTAGE AS IS PAID TO ALL OTHER HOLDERS OF UNSECURED CLAIMS, AND THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS THAT LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM WE CAN MAKE IF A LEASE IS REJECTED. AS A RESULT, IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WOULD RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE FULL VALUE OF ANY UNSECURED CLAIMS WE HOLD. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO RE LEASE VACANT SPACES RESULTING FROM TENANT TERMINATIONS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF A TENANT, PARTICULARLY AN ANCHOR TENANT OR A NATIONAL TENANT WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, MAY MAKE THE RE LEASING OF THEIR SPACE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY, AND IT ALSO MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE THE REMAINDER OF THE SPACE AT THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES. FUTURE TENANT BANKRUPTCIES MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR RE LEASING STRATEGY AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

WE FACE A WIDE RANGE OF COMPETITION THAT COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. 

OUR PROPERTIES COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL PROPERTIES AND OTHER FORMS OF RETAILING SUCH AS CATALOGS AND E COMMERCE WEBSITES. COMPETITION MAY COME FROM MALLS, OUTLET CENTERS, COMMUNITY/LIFESTYLE CENTERS, AND OTHER SHOPPING CENTERS, BOTH EXISTING AS WELL AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION PROJECTS, AS WELL AS CATALOGS AND E COMMERCE. THE PRESENCE OF COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE AND THE LEVEL OF RENTS WE CAN OBTAIN. NEW CONSTRUCTION, RENOVATIONS AND EXPANSIONS AT COMPETING SITES COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROPERTIES. 

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER MAJOR REAL ESTATE INVESTORS AND DEVELOPERS FOR ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND PRIME DEVELOPMENT SITES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF EXISTING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT SITES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED PURCHASE PRICES AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL PROPERTY COMPANIES FOR TENANTS AND QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEASE NEWLY DEVELOPED PROPERTIES AND RENEW LEASES AND RELET SPACE AT EXISTING PROPERTIES. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEASE NEW PROPERTIES TO AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF TENANTS. ALSO, WHEN LEASES FOR OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES EXPIRE, THE PREMISES MAY NOT BE RELET OR THE TERMS OF RELETTING, INCLUDING THE COST OF ALLOWANCES AND CONCESSIONS TO TENANTS, MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE CURRENT LEASE TERMS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR LEASING GOALS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

RISKS RELATING TO REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND OPERATIONS 

OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES MAY SUBJECT US TO DIFFERENT OR GREATER RISK FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HELD INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AND JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES THAT OPERATE IN AUSTRIA, ITALY, GERMANY, JAPAN, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, THE NETHERLANDS, SOUTH KOREA, CANADA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY STAKE IN KL PIERRE, A PUBLICLY TRADED EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE COMPANY, WHICH OPERATES IN 16 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE. ACCORDINGLY, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY ANY UNHEDGED MOVEMENTS IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH THOSE OPERATIONS TRANSACT AND IN WHICH OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATION IS HELD. WE MAY PURSUE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT, OWNERSHIP, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION ACTIVITIES CARRY RISKS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WE FACE WITH OUR DOMESTIC PROPERTIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: 

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES; 

CHANGES IN FOREIGN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, REGIONALLY, NATIONALLY, AND LOCALLY; 

CHALLENGES OF COMPLYING WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS, INCLUDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, OPERATIONS, TAXES AND LITIGATION; 

DIFFERING LENDING PRACTICES; 

DIFFERENCES IN CULTURES; 

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT AFFECT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; 

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THESE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS; 

DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND 

OBSTACLES TO THE REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS AND CASH. 

OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 6.1 OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND 8.4 OF OUR NET OPERATING INCOME, OR NOI, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, THE ABOVE RISKS COULD INCREASE IN SIGNIFICANCE, WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY. 

OUR PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SOME OF WHICH MAY CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER OR BE SUBJECT TO VARYING JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INCLUDE ZONING LAWS, BUILDING CODES, COMPETITION LAWS, RULES AND AGREEMENTS, LANDLORD-TENANT LAWS, PROPERTY TAX REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND ANY ASSOCIATED LITIGATION COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY. 

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF PROPERTIES. 

WE REGULARLY ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP NEW PROPERTIES AND REDEVELOP AND EXPAND EXISTING PROPERTIES, AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN PURSUING ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, NEWLY ACQUIRED, DEVELOPED OR REDEVELOPED/EXPANDED PROPERTIES MAY NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS EXPECTED, IMPACTING OUR ANTICIPATED RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE ARE SUBJECT TO OTHER RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

ACQUISITION OR CONSTRUCTION COSTS OF A PROJECT MAY BE HIGHER THAN PROJECTED, POTENTIALLY MAKING THE PROJECT UNFEASIBLE OR UNPROFITABLE; 

DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSIONS MAY TAKE CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN EXPECTED, DELAYING THE COMMENCEMENT AND AMOUNT OF INCOME FROM THE PROPERTY; 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO REFINANCE LOANS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL; 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ZONING, OCCUPANCY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; 

13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OCCUPANCY RATES AND RENTS MAY NOT MEET OUR PROJECTIONS AND THE PROJECT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE; AND 

WE MAY NEED THE CONSENT OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS DEPARTMENT STORES, ANCHOR TENANTS, MORTGAGE LENDERS AND JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, AND THOSE CONSENTS MAY BE WITHHELD. 

IF A DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION PROJECT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, EITHER BECAUSE IT IS NOT MEETING OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN OPERATIONAL OR WAS NOT COMPLETED ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT PLANNING, WE COULD LOSE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. FURTHER, IF WE GUARANTEE THE PROPERTY S FINANCING, OUR LOSS COULD EXCEED OUR INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. 

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID. 

OUR PROPERTIES REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES OR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE IN RESPONSE TO ANY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY, OR OTHER CONDITIONS MAY BE LIMITED. THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY AND TERMS OF FINANCING, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR SPACE, THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF WE WANT TO SELL A PROPERTY, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF IT IN THE DESIRED TIME PERIOD OR AT ALL OR THAT THE SALES PRICE OF A PROPERTY WILL BE ATTRACTIVE AT THE RELEVANT TIME OR EVEN EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT. MOREOVER, IF A PROPERTY IS MORTGAGED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A RELEASE OF THE LIEN ON THAT PROPERTY WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND/OR A SUBSTANTIAL PREPAYMENT PENALTY, WHICH COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY, EVEN THOUGH THE SALE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DESIRABLE. 

RISKS RELATING TO DEBT AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 

WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL DEBT BURDEN THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR CONSOLIDATED MORTGAGES AND UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS, EXCLUDING RELATED PREMIUM, DISCOUNT AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, TOTALED 23.1 BILLION. AS A RESULT OF THIS INDEBTEDNESS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOWS FOR DEBT SERVICE, INCLUDING SELECTED REPAYMENT AT SCHEDULED MATURITIES, WHICH LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO USE THOSE CASH FLOWS TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT FINANCING, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE SUCH INDEBTEDNESS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. OUR DEBT SERVICE COSTS GENERALLY WILL NOT BE REDUCED IF DEVELOPMENTS AT THE APPLICABLE PROPERTY, SUCH AS THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS OR THE LOSS OF MAJOR TENANTS, CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE INCOME FROM THE PROPERTY. OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ALSO HAVE OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON US, INCLUDING REDUCING OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL OR INCREASING OUR VULNERABILITY TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, IF A PROPERTY IS MORTGAGED TO SECURE PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS AND INCOME FROM SUCH PROPERTY IS INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THAT INDEBTEDNESS, THE PROPERTY COULD BE FORECLOSED UPON BY THE MORTGAGEE RESULTING IN A LOSS OF INCOME AND A DECLINE IN OUR TOTAL ASSET VALUE. IF ANY OF THE FOREGOING OCCURS, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

DISRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS EXTERNAL FINANCINGS FOR OUR GROWTH AND ONGOING DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. 

WE DEPEND ON EXTERNAL FINANCINGS, PRINCIPALLY DEBT FINANCINGS, TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET ONGOING MATURITIES OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT. OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING DEPENDS ON THE WILLINGNESS OF LENDING INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER DEBT INVESTORS TO GRANT CREDIT TO US AND CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. AN ECONOMIC RECESSION MAY CAUSE EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS. WE RELY UPON THE CREDIT FACILITIES AS SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS. OUR ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF EACH OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US. WHEN MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS COULD BE DISRUPTED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT HAVE THE AVAILABLE CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS TO US. THE FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE PARTICIPANTS TO THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING WE MAY NEED FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND/OR MEETING OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING WE NEED FOR THE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS OR TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. 

ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATING COULD AFFECT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND BORROWING TERMS. 

THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S OUTSTANDING SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, CREDIT FACILITIES, THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AND SIMON S PREFERRED STOCK ARE PERIODICALLY RATED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. THE CREDIT RATINGS ARE BASED ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS, AND OTHER FACTORS 

14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

VIEWED BY THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AS RELEVANT TO OUR INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN GENERAL. OUR CREDIT RATING CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE CAN ACCESS, AS WELL AS THE TERMS OF ANY FINANCING WE OBTAIN. SINCE WE DEPEND PRIMARILY ON DEBT FINANCING TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS, AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATING, INCLUDING ACTUAL CHANGES AND CHANGES IN OUTLOOK, OR EVEN THE INITIATION OF A REVIEW OF OUR CREDIT RATING THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE CHANGE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

THE AGREEMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR INDEBTEDNESS CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS THAT IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON US THAT MIGHT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE FREELY. 

WE HAVE A VARIETY OF UNSECURED DEBT, INCLUDING THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND SECURED PROPERTY LEVEL DEBT. CERTAIN OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR INDEBTEDNESS CONTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR SECURED AND UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS, SELL ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND ENGAGE IN MERGERS AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR INDEBTEDNESS CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COVERAGE RATIOS. THESE COVENANTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES OR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO US. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF OUR FINANCING COVENANTS COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, WHICH, IF NOT CURED OR WAIVED, COULD ACCELERATE THE RELATED INDEBTEDNESS AS WELL AS OTHER OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

OUR HEDGING INTEREST RATE PROTECTION ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY LIMIT OUR INTEREST RATE RISK. 

WE SELECTIVELY MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK BY A COMBINATION OF INTEREST RATE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY FIX OR CAP ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE REFINANCE FIXED RATE DEBT AT TIMES WHEN WE BELIEVE RATES AND OTHER TERMS ARE APPROPRIATE. OUR EFFORTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

OUR USE OF INTEREST RATE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS TO MANAGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY MAY EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING A RISK THAT A COUNTERPARTY TO A HEDGING ARRANGEMENT MAY FAIL TO HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS OR THAT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND OUR CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS IN RELATIVELY LARGE AMOUNTS OR ON SHORT NOTICE. DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE RISK STRATEGY IS COMPLEX AND NO STRATEGY CAN COMPLETELY INSULATE US FROM RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. TERMINATION OF THESE HEDGING AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVES COSTS, SUCH AS TRANSACTION FEES OR BREAKAGE COSTS. 

RISKS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES 

SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS REITS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO ARE STRUCTURED TO BE TAXED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE REIT STRUCTURE. THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SIMON S OR THESE SUBSIDIARIES QUALIFICATIONS AS REITS OR CHANGES IN LOCAL TAX LAWS OR REGULATIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN INCOME-BASED TAXES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, AND OTHER TAXES, INCLUDING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, FRANCHISE TAXES, AND WITHHOLDING TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. WE CURRENTLY FOLLOW LOCAL TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. SHOULD THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS CHANGE, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES WE PAY MAY INCREASE ACCORDINGLY. 

IN THE UNITED STATES, SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS REITS UNDER SECTIONS 856 THROUGH 860 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE BELIEVE SIMON AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED AND OPERATED IN A MANNER WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS REITS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THIS MANNER. HOWEVER, QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS REITS DEPEND UPON THE ABILITY OF SIMON AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO SATISFY SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS (SOME OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL), INCLUDING TESTS RELATED TO OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS, ASSET DIVERSIFICATION, DISTRIBUTION LEVELS AND DIVERSITY OF STOCK OWNERSHIP. THE VARIOUS REIT QUALIFICATION TESTS REQUIRED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SIMON OR ANY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES HAS OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS OR WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A MANNER SO AS TO QUALIFY OR REMAIN QUALIFIED AS A REIT. 

15 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

IF SIMON OR ANY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THOSE PROVISIONS, SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY MAY BE SUBJECT TO MONETARY PENALTIES OR ULTIMATELY TO POSSIBLE DISQUALIFICATION AS REITS. IF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, AND IF AVAILABLE RELIEF PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY: 

SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED A DEDUCTION FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN COMPUTING TAXABLE INCOME; 

SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY WILL BE SUBJECT TO CORPORATE LEVEL INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX, ON TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES; AND 

UNLESS ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS, SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY WILL ALSO BE DISQUALIFIED FROM TREATMENT AS REITS FOR THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR DURING WHICH QUALIFICATION WAS LOST. 

MOREOVER, A FAILURE BY ANY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD ALSO CAUSE SIMON TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AND THE SAME ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES WOULD APPLY TO IT AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS. 

LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE, REGULATORY OR OTHER ACTIONS AFFECTING REITS, INCLUDING POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE IRS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OR OUR INVESTORS. 

THE RULES DEALING WITH U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER REVIEW BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, AND BY THE IRS AND THE TREASURY. CHANGES TO THE TAX LAWS OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF BY THE IRS AND THE TREASURY, WITH OR WITHOUT RETROACTIVE APPLICATION, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US OR OUR INVESTORS. NEW LEGISLATION, TREASURY REGULATIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OR COURT DECISIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS REITS AND/OR THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO US AND OUR INVESTORS OF SUCH QUALIFICATION. 

REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

IN ORDER FOR SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS REITS, AND ASSUMING THAT CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO SATISFIED, SIMON AND EACH SUCH SUBSIDIARY GENERALLY MUST DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90 OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REIT TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID DEDUCTION AND EXCLUDING ANY NET CAPITAL GAINS, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY HOLDERS EACH YEAR. TO THIS POINT, SIMON AND EACH SUCH SUBSIDIARY HAVE HISTORICALLY DISTRIBUTED AT LEAST 100 OF TAXABLE INCOME AND THEREBY AVOIDED INCOME TAX ALTOGETHER. TO THE EXTENT THAT SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY SATISFIES THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT AND QUALIFIES FOR TAXATION AS A REIT, BUT DISTRIBUTES LESS THAN 100 OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX ON ITS UNDISTRIBUTED NET TAXABLE INCOME AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO A 4 NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX IF THE ACTUAL AMOUNT THAT IS DISTRIBUTED TO EQUITY HOLDERS IN A CALENDAR YEAR IS LESS THAN THE REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT SPECIFIED UNDER U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS. WE INTEND TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE EQUITY HOLDERS OF SIMON AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO COMPLY WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. 

FROM TIME TO TIME, SIMON AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MIGHT GENERATE TAXABLE INCOME GREATER THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOW AS A RESULT OF DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF TAXABLE INCOME AND THE ACTUAL RECEIPT OF CASH OR THE EFFECT OF NONDEDUCTIBLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THE CREATION OF RESERVES, OR REQUIRED DEBT OR AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS. IF SIMON AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THESE SITUATIONS, SIMON AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES COULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCESS CAPITAL ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS (THE RECEIPT OF WHICH CANNOT BE ASSURED), SELL ASSETS AT DISADVANTAGEOUS PRICES, DISTRIBUTE AMOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INVESTED IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR REPAYMENT OF DEBT, OR MAKE TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CAPITAL STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THEM TO PAY OUT ENOUGH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REIT TAXABLE INCOME TO SATISFY THE REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT AND AVOID CORPORATE INCOME TAX AND THE 4 EXCISE TAX IN A PARTICULAR YEAR. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE OUR EQUITY. FURTHER, AMOUNTS DISTRIBUTED WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. THUS, COMPLIANCE WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 

COMPLYING WITH REIT REQUIREMENTS MIGHT CAUSE US TO FOREGO OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES OR LIQUIDATE OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS. 

TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS REITS FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MUST ENSURE THAT, AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER, AT LEAST 75 OF THE VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 

16 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ASSETS CONSIST OF CASH, CASH ITEMS, GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND REAL ESTATE ASSETS (AS DEFINED IN THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE), INCLUDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES. THE REMAINDER OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTMENTS (OTHER THAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, QUALIFIED REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND SECURITIES ISSUED BY A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY, OR TRS) GENERALLY CANNOT INCLUDE MORE THAN 10 OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF ANY ONE ISSUER OR MORE THAN 10 OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES OF ANY ONE ISSUER. 

ADDITIONALLY, IN GENERAL, NO MORE THAN 5 OF THE VALUE OF SIMON S AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, QUALIFIED REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND SECURITIES ISSUED BY A TRS) CAN CONSIST OF THE SECURITIES OF ANY ONE ISSUER, AND NO MORE THAN 25 (20 FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017) OF THE VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TOTAL ASSETS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY SECURITIES OF ONE OR MORE TRSS. IF SIMON OR ANY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS AT THE END OF ANY CALENDAR QUARTER, SIMON OR ANY SUCH SUBSIDIARY MUST CORRECT THE FAILURE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CALENDAR QUARTER OR QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN STATUTORY RELIEF PROVISIONS TO AVOID LOSING ITS REIT QUALIFICATION AND SUFFERING ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. AS A RESULT, WE MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO LIQUIDATE OR FOREGO OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS. THESE ACTIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING OUR INCOME AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO EQUITY HOLDERS. 

IN ADDITION TO THE ASSET TESTS SET FORTH ABOVE, TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS REITS, SIMON AND THESE SUBSIDIARIES MUST CONTINUALLY SATISFY TESTS CONCERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SOURCES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INCOME, THE AMOUNTS THEY DISTRIBUTE TO EQUITY HOLDERS AND THE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES. WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO PURSUE INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE ADVANTAGEOUS TO US IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE SOURCE OF INCOME OR ASSET DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFYING AS REITS. THUS, COMPLIANCE WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENTS. 

PARTNERSHIP TAX AUDIT RULES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2015 CHANGES THE RULES APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDITS OF PARTNERSHIPS. UNDER THE RULES (WHICH ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017), AMONG OTHER CHANGES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, ANY AUDIT ADJUSTMENT TO ITEMS OF INCOME, GAIN, LOSS, DEDUCTION, OR CREDIT OF A PARTNERSHIP (AND ANY PARTNER S DISTRIBUTIVE SHARE THEREOF) IS DETERMINED, AND TAXES, INTEREST, OR PENALTIES ATTRIBUTABLE THERETO COULD BE ASSESSED AND COLLECTED, AT THE PARTNERSHIP LEVEL. ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW THESE RULES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD RESULT IN PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH WE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INVEST, BEING REQUIRED TO PAY ADDITIONAL TAXES, INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT ADJUSTMENT, AND WE, AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNER OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS, COULD BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF THOSE TAXES, INTEREST, AND PENALTIES EVEN THOUGH SIMON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AS REITS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PAY ADDITIONAL CORPORATE LEVEL TAXES HAD THEY OWNED THE ASSETS OF THE PARTNERSHIP DIRECTLY. THE PARTNERSHIP TAX AUDIT RULES WILL APPLY TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS PARTNERSHIPS FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE CHANGES CREATED BY THESE RULES ARE SWEEPING AND IN MANY RESPECTS DEPENDENT ON THE PROMULGATION OF FUTURE REGULATIONS OR OTHER GUIDANCE BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, OR THE TREASURY, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE RULES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

RISKS RELATING TO JOINT VENTURES 

WE HAVE LIMITED CONTROL WITH RESPECT TO SOME PROPERTIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED OR MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR REFINANCE THEM. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE OWNED INTERESTS IN 95 INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES WITH OTHER PARTIES. OF THOSE, 17 PROPERTIES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE OTHER 78 PROPERTIES, OR THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS OUR INVESTMENTS IN KL PIERRE (A PUBLICLY TRADED, PARIS-BASED REAL ESTATE COMPANY), A ROPOSTALE, AND HBS GLOBAL PROPERTIES, OR HBS, USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. WE SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER OR PROPERTY MANAGER FOR 57 OF THESE 78 JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES; HOWEVER, CERTAIN MAJOR DECISIONS, SUCH AS APPROVING THE OPERATING BUDGET AND SELLING, REFINANCING AND REDEVELOPING THE PROPERTIES, REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER OWNERS. OF THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER OR PROPERTY MANAGER, 17 ARE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES. THESE INTERNATIONAL PROPERTIES ARE MANAGED LOCALLY BY JOINT VENTURES IN WHICH WE SHARE CONTROL OF THE PROPERTIES WITH OUR PARTNER. THE OTHER OWNERS HAVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS THAT WE CONSIDER SUBSTANTIVE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING CONTROL OVER THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES ASSETS. THE REMAINING JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES, KL PIERRE, AND OUR JOINT VENTURES WITH A ROPOSTALE AND HBS, ARE MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES. 

THESE INVESTMENTS, AND OTHER FUTURE SIMILAR INVESTMENTS COULD INVOLVE RISKS THAT WOULD NOT BE PRESENT WERE A THIRD PARTY NOT INVOLVED, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT PARTNERS OR OTHER OWNERS MIGHT BECOME BANKRUPT, SUFFER A DETERIORATION IN THEIR CREDITWORTHINESS, OR FAIL TO FUND THEIR SHARE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. PARTNERS OR OTHER OWNERS COULD HAVE 

17 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ECONOMIC OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR OWN BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS, AND COULD BE IN A POSITION TO TAKE ACTIONS CONTRARY TO OUR POLICIES OR OBJECTIVES. 

THESE INVESTMENTS, AND OTHER FUTURE SIMILAR INVESTMENTS, ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF CREATING IMPASSES ON DECISIONS, SUCH AS A SALE OR FINANCING, BECAUSE NEITHER WE NOR OUR PARTNER OR OTHER OWNER HAS FULL CONTROL OVER THE PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE. DISPUTES BETWEEN US AND PARTNERS OR OTHER OWNERS MIGHT RESULT IN LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION THAT COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND PREVENT SIMON S OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS FROM FOCUSING THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS ON OUR BUSINESS. CONSEQUENTLY, ACTIONS BY, OR DISPUTES WITH, PARTNERS OR OTHER OWNERS MIGHT RESULT IN SUBJECTING PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE TO ADDITIONAL RISK. IN ADDITION, WE RISK THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR PARTNERS OR OTHER OWNERS. 

THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP GUARANTEES DEBT OR OTHERWISE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES. 

JOINT VENTURE DEBT IS THE LIABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND IS TYPICALLY SECURED BY A MORTGAGE ON THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY, WHICH IS NON RECOURSE TO US. NEVERTHELESS, THE JOINT VENTURE S FAILURE TO SATISFY ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF OUR INVESTMENT THEREIN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP GUARANTEED JOINT VENTURE RELATED MORTGAGE INDEBTEDNESS OF 400.5 MILLION (OF WHICH WE HAVE A RIGHT OF RECOVERY FROM OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS OF 87.3 MILLION). A DEFAULT BY A JOINT VENTURE UNDER ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS WOULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY UNDER A GUARANTY. WE MAY ELECT TO FUND CASH NEEDS OF A JOINT VENTURE THROUGH EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS (GENERALLY ON A BASIS PROPORTIONATE TO OUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS), ADVANCES OR PARTNER LOANS, ALTHOUGH SUCH FUNDINGS ARE NOT TYPICALLY REQUIRED CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE. 

RISKS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

AS OWNERS OF REAL ESTATE, WE CAN FACE LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. 

U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT MAY REQUIRE US, AS A CURRENT OR PREVIOUS OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL PROPERTY, TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT RELEASES AT A PROPERTY OR AT IMPACTED NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES. THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PROPERTY OWNER OR OPERATOR KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE THE ABATEMENT OR REMOVAL OF ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGE, DEMOLITION OR RENOVATION, RECONSTRUCTION OR EXPANSION OF A PROPERTY AND ALSO GOVERN EMISSIONS OF AND EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FIBERS IN THE AIR. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO GOVERN THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS USED TO STORE WASTE OILS OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES CONTAIN, OR AT ONE TIME CONTAINED, ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS OR UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (PRIMARILY RELATED TO AUTO SERVICE CENTER ESTABLISHMENTS OR EMERGENCY ELECTRICAL GENERATION EQUIPMENT). WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTION AND MAY ALSO BE HELD LIABLE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE INCURRED BY THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATION, REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND RELATED LIABILITIES, MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES, OR THE FAILURE TO REMEDIATE THE RELATED CONTAMINATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL, LEASE OR REDEVELOP A PROPERTY OR TO BORROW MONEY USING A PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. 

OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PORTFOLIO IS IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES, THIS BELIEF IS BASED ON LIMITED TESTING. NEARLY ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO PHASE I OR SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS. THESE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS HAVE NOT REVEALED, NOR ARE WE AWARE OF, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY THAT WE BELIEVE IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT: 

PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PORTFOLIO REVEAL ALL POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES; 

ANY PREVIOUS OWNER, OCCUPANT OR TENANT OF A PROPERTY DID NOT CREATE ANY MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION NOT KNOWN TO US; 

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY TENANTS AND OCCUPANTS, BY THE CONDITION OF NEARBY PROPERTIES, OR BY OTHER UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES; OR 

FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF) WILL NOT RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS 

SOME OF OUR POTENTIAL LOSSES MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. 

WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH THIRD PARTY CARRIERS WHO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE COVERAGE FOR SPECIFIC LAYERS OF POTENTIAL LOSSES, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY, FIRE, FLOOD, EXTENDED COVERAGE AND RENTAL LOSS INSURANCE ON ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE INITIAL PORTION OF COVERAGE NOT PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY CARRIERS IS EITHER INSURED THROUGH OUR WHOLLY OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS CONTROLLED BY US. A THIRD PARTY CARRIER HAS, IN TURN, AGREED TO PROVIDE, IF REQUIRED, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE FOR THIS LAYER OF LOSSES UNDER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CARRIER S POLICY. A SIMILAR POLICY WRITTEN THROUGH OUR CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITY ALSO PROVIDES INITIAL COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY INSURANCE AND CERTAIN WINDSTORM RISKS AT THE PROPERTIES LOCATED IN COASTAL WINDSTORM LOCATIONS. 

THERE ARE SOME TYPES OF LOSSES, INCLUDING LEASE AND OTHER CONTRACT CLAIMS, WHICH GENERALLY ARE NOT INSURED OR ARE SUBJECT TO LARGE DEDUCTIBLES. IF AN UNINSURED LOSS OR A LOSS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS OCCURS, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN A PROPERTY, AS WELL AS THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE REVENUE IT COULD GENERATE BUT MAY REMAIN OBLIGATED FOR ANY MORTGAGE DEBT OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATION RELATED TO THE PROPERTY. 

WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE AGAINST ACTS OF TERRORISM ON ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES ON AN ALL RISK BASIS IN THE AMOUNT OF UP TO 1 BILLION. THE CURRENT U.S. FEDERAL LAWS WHICH PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE THROUGH 2020. HOWEVER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD IN THE FUTURE TERMINATE ITS REINSURANCE OF TERRORISM, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF UNINSURED LOSSES FOR TERRORIST ACTS. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE, ANY THREATENED OR ACTUAL TERRORIST ATTACKS WHERE WE OPERATE COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY BREACHES THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS, CYBER INTRUSIONS OR OTHERWISE, AS WELL AS OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) NETWORKS AND RELATED SYSTEMS. 

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY BREACHES, WHETHER THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS OR CYBER INTRUSIONS OVER THE INTERNET, MALWARE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, ATTACHMENTS TO E MAILS, PERSONS INSIDE OUR ORGANIZATION OR PERSONS WITH ACCESS TO SYSTEMS, AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS OF OUR IT NETWORKS AND RELATED SYSTEMS. OUR IT NETWORKS AND RELATED SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, MAY BE CRITICAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF CERTAIN OF OUR TENANTS. ALTHOUGH WE MAKE EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF THESE TYPES OF IT NETWORKS AND RELATED SYSTEMS, AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS MEASURES TO MANAGE THE RISK OF A SECURITY BREACH OR DISRUPTION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR SECURITY EFFORTS AND MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE OR THAT ATTEMPTED SECURITY BREACHES OR DISRUPTIONS WOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR DAMAGING. EVEN THE MOST WELL PROTECTED INFORMATION, NETWORKS, SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED IN SUCH ATTEMPTED SECURITY BREACHES EVOLVE AND GENERALLY ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED AGAINST A TARGET, AND IN SOME CASES ARE DESIGNED NOT TO BE DETECTED AND, IN FACT, MAY NOT BE DETECTED. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE THESE TECHNIQUES OR TO IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE SECURITY BARRIERS OR OTHER PREVENTATIVE MEASURES, AND THUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ENTIRELY MITIGATE THIS RISK. 

A BREACH OR SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENDED DISRUPTION IN THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR PRIMARY WEBSITE, COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS, TENANTS AND REVENUES, GENERATE THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, RESULT IN THE UNINTENDED AND/OR UNAUTHORIZED PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OR THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF PROPRIETARY, PERSONAL IDENTIFYING AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO ADDRESS AND REMEDIATE OR OTHERWISE RESOLVE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER THESE EXPENSES IN WHOLE OR IN ANY PART FROM OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS OR RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, OR THEIR OR OUR INSURERS. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES, AND THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE LEADERSHIP AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE TALENTED EMPLOYEES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. COMPETITION FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IS INTENSE, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OTHER HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS FOR THESE POSITIONS IN THE FUTURE. LOSING ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE PERSONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

PROVISIONS IN SIMON S CHARTER AND BY LAWS AND IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT COULD PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

SIMON S CHARTER CONTAINS A GENERAL RESTRICTION ON THE ACCUMULATION OF SHARES IN EXCESS OF 8 OF ITS CAPITAL STOCK. THE CHARTER PERMITS THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON FAMILY AND RELATED PERSONS TO OWN UP TO 18 OF SIMON S CAPITAL STOCK. 

19 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OWNERSHIP IS DETERMINED BY THE LOWER OF THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING SHARES, VOTING POWER OR VALUE CONTROLLED. SIMON S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY, BY MAJORITY VOTE, PERMIT EXCEPTIONS TO THOSE LEVELS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SIMON S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINES THAT SIMON S ABILITY TO QUALIFY AS A REIT WILL NOT BE JEOPARDIZED. THESE RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING, DEFERRING OR PREVENTING A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SIMON S STOCKHOLDERS OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S UNITHOLDERS OR PREFERRED UNITHOLDERS. OTHER PROVISIONS OF SIMON S CHARTER AND BY LAWS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL EVEN IF SOME OF SIMON S STOCKHOLDERS OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S UNITHOLDERS OR PREFERRED UNITHOLDERS DEEM SUCH A CHANGE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS. THESE INCLUDE PROVISIONS PREVENTING HOLDERS OF SIMON S COMMON STOCK FROM ACTING BY WRITTEN CONSENT AND REQUIRING THAT UP TO FOUR DIRECTORS IN THE AGGREGATE MAY BE ELECTED BY HOLDERS OF CLASS B COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL. THESE INCLUDE A PROVISION REQUIRING THE CONSENT OF A MAJORITY IN INTEREST OF UNITS IN ORDER FOR SIMON, AS GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, TO, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, ENGAGE IN A MERGER TRANSACTION OR SELL ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS. 

WE FACE POSSIBLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. 

WE CANNOT DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER GLOBAL WARMING OR COOLING IS OCCURRING AND, IF SO, AT WHAT RATE. TO THE EXTENT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERNS, OUR PROPERTIES IN CERTAIN MARKETS COULD EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN STORM INTENSITY AND RISING SEA LEVELS. OVER TIME, THESE CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN VOLATILE OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR RETAIL SPACE AT CERTAIN OF OUR PROPERTIES OR, IN EXTREME CASES, OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES AT ALL. CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO HAVE INDIRECT EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS BY INCREASING THE COST OF (OR MAKING UNAVAILABLE) INSURANCE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, AND INCREASING THE COST OF ENERGY AND SNOW REMOVAL AT OUR PROPERTIES. MOREOVER, COMPLIANCE WITH NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH GREEN BUILDING CODES, MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES OR INCREASE TAXES AND FEES ASSESSED ON US OR OUR PROPERTIES. AT THIS TIME, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

THE UNITED KINGDOM S PENDING DEPARTURE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

THE UNITED KINGDOM HELD A REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016 IN WHICH A MAJORITY OF VOTERS VOTED TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR BREXIT, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND AFFECTED MARKETS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN PARTICULAR. NEGOTIATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE TERMS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TERMS OF TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE EFFECTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL DEPEND ON AGREEMENTS THE UNITED KINGDOM MAKES TO RETAIN ACCESS TO EUROPEAN UNION MARKETS EITHER DURING A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OR MORE PERMANENTLY. BREXIT IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AND COULD CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER INSTABILITY IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS BEFORE AND AFTER THE TERMS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM S FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE SETTLED. FURTHER, FINANCIAL AND OTHER MARKETS MAY SUFFER LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OTHER COUNTRIES DETERMINING TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION OR FROM ANY FUTURE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION S STRUCTURE AND/OR REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, BREXIT COULD LEAD TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AS THE UNITED KINGDOM DETERMINES WHICH EUROPEAN UNION LAWS TO REPLACE OR REPLICATE. 

WE CURRENTLY HOLD, AND MAY ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL, EQUITY INTERESTS IN PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN POUNDS STERLING AND EUROS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS ISSUED, AND MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE, SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DENOMINATED IN EUROS. ANY OF THE EFFECTS OF BREXIT DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND OTHERS WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENTS AND OUR POTENTIAL GROWTH IN EUROPE, AND COULD AMPLIFY THE CURRENCY RISKS FACED BY US.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FOREGOING AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE REFLECTED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVIEW ANY FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. IF ONE OR MORE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE UPDATED, NO INFERENCE SHOULD BE DRAWN THAT ADDITIONAL UPDATES WILL BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE OR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 
 
 IPALCO IS A HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA. OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARY IS IPL, A REGULATED ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATING IN THE STATE OF INDIANA. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESS CONSISTS OF THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY CONDUCTED THROUGH IPL. OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE UTILITY AND ALL OTHER. ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED WITHIN THE U.S. AND PRINCIPALLY WITHIN THE STATE OF INDIANA. PLEASE SEE NOTE 12, BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 

IPL 
 
 IPALCO OWNS ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF IPL. IPL WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA IN 1926. IPL IS ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN GENERATING, TRANSMITTING, DISTRIBUTING AND SELLING ELECTRIC ENERGY TO MORE THAN 500,000 RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN THE CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND NEIGHBORING AREAS WITHIN THE STATE OF INDIANA; THE MOST DISTANT POINT BEING ABOUT 40 MILES FROM INDIANAPOLIS. IPL HAS AN EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. IPL S SERVICE AREA COVERS ABOUT 528 SQUARE MILES WITH AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 955,000. IPL S GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, AND CHANGES TO OUR SOURCES OF ELECTRIC GENERATION, ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER PROPERTIES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE SERVICES RENDERED BY IPL DURING 2019. 
 
 IPL IS A TRANSMISSION COMPANY MEMBER OF RF. RF IS ONE OF EIGHT REGIONAL RELIABILITY COUNCILS UNDER THE NERC, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY ORGANIZATION UNDER THE EPACT. RF SEEKS TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE ELECTRIC SERVICE RELIABILITY AND SECURITY FOR THE INTERCONNECTED ELECTRIC SYSTEMS WITHIN THE RF GEOGRAPHIC AREA BY SETTING AND ENFORCING ELECTRIC RELIABILITY STANDARDS. RF MEMBERS COOPERATE UNDER AGREEMENTS TO AUGMENT THE RELIABILITY OF ITS MEMBERS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY SYSTEMS IN THE RF REGION THROUGH COORDINATION OF THE PLANNING AND OPERATION OF THE MEMBERS GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES. SMALLER ELECTRIC UTILITY SYSTEMS, INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS AND POWER MARKETERS CAN PARTICIPATE AS FULL MEMBERS OF RF. 

EMPLOYEES 
 
 AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, IPL HAD 1,206 EMPLOYEES OF WHOM 1,133 WERE FULL TIME. OF THE TOTAL EMPLOYEES, 834 WERE REPRESENTED BY THE IBEW IN TWO BARGAINING UNITS: A PHYSICAL UNIT AND A CLERICAL-TECHNICAL UNIT. IN FEBRUARY 2020, THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE IBEW CLERICAL-TECHNICAL UNIT RATIFIED A THREE-YEAR LABOR AGREEMENT WITH US THAT EXPIRES ON 
 
 7

 THE SERVICE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES INCLUDING OPERATIONS, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, HUMAN RESOURCES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CORPORATE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF COMPANIES THAT ARE PART OF THE U.S. SBU, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER COMPANIES, IPALCO AND IPL. THE SERVICE COMPANY ALLOCATES THE COSTS FOR THESE SERVICES BASED ON COST DRIVERS DESIGNED TO RESULT IN FAIR AND EQUITABLE ALLOCATIONS. THIS INCLUDES ENSURING THAT THE REGULATED UTILITIES SERVED, INCLUDING IPL, ARE NOT SUBSIDIZING COSTS INCURRED FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHER BUSINESSES. PLEASE SEE NOTE 11, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS SERVICE COMPANY TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. 

PROPERTIES 
 
 OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT ONE MONUMENT CIRCLE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. THIS FACILITY AND THE REMAINDER OF OUR MATERIAL PROPERTIES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE OWNED DIRECTLY BY IPL. THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATERIAL PROPERTIES. 
 
 WE OWN TWO DISTRIBUTION SERVICE CENTERS IN INDIANAPOLIS. WE ALSO OWN THE BUILDING IN INDIANAPOLIS THAT HOUSES OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER. 
 
 WE OWN AND OPERATE FOUR GENERATING STATIONS, ALL WITHIN THE STATE OF INDIANA. OUR LARGEST GENERATING STATION, PETERSBURG, IS COAL-FIRED, AND WE PLAN TO RETIRE APPROXIMATELY 630 MW OF COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT PETERSBURG UNITS 1 AND 2 BY 2023 (FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS - IRP FILING ). THE SECOND LARGEST STATION, HARDING STREET, USES NATURAL GAS AND FUEL OIL TO POWER COMBUSTION TURBINES. IN ADDITION, IPL OPERATES A 20 MW BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE UNIT AT THIS LOCATION, WHICH PROVIDES FREQUENCY RESPONSE. THE THIRD STATION, EAGLE VALLEY, IS A CCGT NATURAL GAS PLANT. IPL TOOK OPERATIONAL CONTROL AND COMMENCED COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF THIS CCGT IN APRIL 2018. THE FOURTH STATION, GEORGETOWN, IS A SMALL PEAKING STATION THAT USES NATURAL GAS TO POWER COMBUSTION TURBINES. FOR ELECTRIC GENERATION, THE NET WINTER DESIGN CAPACITY IS 3,705 MW AND NET SUMMER DESIGN CAPACITY IS 3,560 MW. OUR HIGHEST SUMMER PEAK LEVEL OF 3,139 MW WAS RECORDED IN AUGUST 2007 AND THE HIGHEST WINTER PEAK LEVEL OF 2,971 MW WAS RECORDED IN JANUARY 2009.

(1) WE PLAN TO RETIRE APPROXIMATELY 630 MW OF COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT PETERSBURG UNITS 1 AND 2 BY 2023 (FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS - IRP FILING ). 
 
 NET ELECTRICAL GENERATION DURING 2019 AT OUR PETERSBURG, EAGLE VALLEY, HARDING STREET AND GEORGETOWN PLANTS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 58.4 , 34.0 , 7.2 AND 0.4 , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL NET GENERATION. EVEN THOUGH THE CAPACITY OF OUR HARDING STREET PLANT FAR EXCEEDS THAT OF THE EAGLE VALLEY PLANT, WE EXPECT THE GENERATION AT 
 
 8 

EAGLE VALLEY TO CONTINUE TO FAR EXCEED THAT OF HARDING STREET DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOWER COST TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AT EAGLE VALLEY. 
 
 OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS DIRECTLY INTERCONNECTED WITH THE ELECTRIC SYSTEMS OF INDIANA MICHIGAN POWER COMPANY, VECTREN CORPORATION, HOOSIER ENERGY RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC., AND THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM JOINTLY OWNED BY DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INDIANA MUNICIPAL POWER AGENCY AND WABASH VALLEY POWER ASSOCIATION, INC. OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INCLUDES 458 CIRCUIT MILES OF 345,000 VOLT LINES AND 408 CIRCUIT MILES OF 138,000 VOLT LINES. THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 5,018 CIRCUIT MILES OF UNDERGROUND PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CABLES AND 6,116 CIRCUIT MILES OF OVERHEAD PRIMARY AND SECONDARY WIRE. UNDERGROUND STREET LIGHTING FACILITIES INCLUDE 775 CIRCUIT MILES OF UNDERGROUND CABLE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM ARE 138 SUBSTATIONS. DEPENDING ON THE VOLTAGE LEVELS AT THE SUBSTATION, SOME SUBSTATIONS MAY BE CONSIDERED BOTH A BULK POWER SUBSTATION AND A DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATION. THERE ARE 73 BULK POWER SUBSTATIONS AND 118 DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATIONS; 52 SUBSTATIONS ARE CONSIDERED BOTH BULK POWER AND DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATIONS. 
 
 ALL CRITICAL FACILITIES WE OWN ARE WELL MAINTAINED, IN GOOD CONDITION AND MEET OUR PRESENT NEEDS. OUR PLANTS GENERALLY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO MEET THE DAILY NEEDS OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS WHEN ALL OF OUR UNITS ARE AVAILABLE. DURING PERIODS WHEN OUR GENERATING CAPACITY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR RETAIL DEMAND, OR WHEN MISO PROVIDES A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE TO SOME OF OUR AVAILABLE GENERATION, WE PURCHASE POWER ON THE MISO WHOLESALE MARKET. 

SEASONALITY 
 
 THE ELECTRIC UTILITY BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND, THEREFORE, THE OPERATING REVENUES AND ASSOCIATED OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT GENERATED EVENLY BY MONTH DURING THE YEAR. IPL S BUSINESS IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, RETAIL KWH SALES, AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR WEATHER VARIATIONS, ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN SERVICE TERRITORY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE NUMBER OF RETAIL CUSTOMERS WE HAVE, AS WELL AS DSM ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED BY IPL. FOR THE TEN YEARS ENDING IN 2019, IPL S RETAIL KWH SALES HAVE DECREASED AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 0.5 . CONVERSELY, THE NUMBER OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS GREW AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 0.8 DURING THAT SAME PERIOD. GOING FORWARD, WE EXPECT FLAT OR MODEST RETAIL KWH SALES GROWTH ANNUALLY, WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OUR DSM PROGRAMS. PLEASE SEE NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS DSM TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILS. IPL S ELECTRICITY SALES FOR 2015 THROUGH 2019 ARE SET FORTH IN THE TABLE OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION INCLUDED AT THE END OF THIS SECTION. 
 
 WEATHER AND WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE IN OUR SERVICE AREA 
 
 EXTREME HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURES IN OUR SERVICE AREA HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REVENUES AS MANY OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS USE ELECTRICITY TO POWER AIR CONDITIONERS, ELECTRIC FURNACES AND HEAT PUMPS. THE IMPACT IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR DECLINING BLOCK RATE STRUCTURE, WHICH GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS TO BE CHARGED A LOWER PER KWH RATE AT HIGHER CONSUMPTION LEVELS. THEREFORE, AS VOLUMES INCREASE, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE PER KWH DECREASES. THE EFFECT IS GENERALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES THAN WITH LOW TEMPERATURES AS MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS USE GAS HEAT. IN ADDITION, BEFORE THE 2018 BASE RATE ORDER WAS IMPLEMENTED ON DECEMBER 5, 2018, IPL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE 50 OF WHOLESALE MARGINS ABOVE A STATED BENCHMARK, SO EXTREME TEMPERATURES GENERALLY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INCOME BY SELLING POWER ON THE WHOLESALE MARKET (SEE BELOW). HOWEVER, BEGINNING DECEMBER 5, 2018, 100 OF ANNUAL WHOLESALE MARGINS EARNED ABOVE (OR BELOW) THE BENCHMARK OF 16.3 MILLION ARE PASSED BACK (OR CHARGED) TO CUSTOMER RATES THROUGH A RIDER. 
 
 STORM ACTIVITY CAN ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SEVERE STORMS OFTEN DAMAGE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT, THEREBY CAUSING POWER OUTAGES, WHICH REDUCE REVENUES AND INCREASE REPAIR COSTS. IN OUR 2016 AND 2018 BASE RATE ORDERS, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR A STORM DAMAGE RESTORATION RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT ALLOWS US TO DEFER MAJOR STORM COSTS OVER A BENCHMARK THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA CONSIDERED TO BE SEVERE, FOR RECOVERY IN A FUTURE BASIC RATE PROCEEDING. BECAUSE IPL'S BASIC RATES AND CHARGES INCLUDE AN ANNUAL AMOUNT FOR RECOVERY FOR SUCH SEVERE STORM COSTS, IF ACTUAL SEVERE STORM COSTS ARE BELOW THAT LEVEL, IPL WILL RECORD A REGULATORY LIABILITY FOR THE SHORTFALL TO BE PASSED TO CUSTOMERS IN A FUTURE BASIC RATE PROCEEDING. CONVERSELY, IF IPL'S MAJOR STORM COSTS ARE ABOVE THE LEVEL IN BASIC RATES, IPL WILL DEFER THE EXCESS FOR FUTURE RECOVERY. 

MISO OPERATIONS 
 
 IPL IS ONE OF MANY TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OWNER MEMBERS IN MISO. MISO IS A REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION WHICH MAINTAINS FUNCTIONAL CONTROL OVER THE COMBINED TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS OF ITS MEMBERS AND MANAGES ONE OF THE 
 
 9 

LARGEST ENERGY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES MARKETS IN THE U.S. MISO POLICIES ARE DEVELOPED, IN PART, THROUGH A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IN WHICH WE ARE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT. WE FOCUS OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROCESS PRIMARILY ON ITEMS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS, SHARED COST OF TRANSMISSION EXPANSION, RESOURCE ADEQUACY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE MISO AND FERC POLICY BY FILING COMMENTS WITH MISO, THE FERC, OR THE IURC. 
 
 MISO HAS FUNCTIONAL CONTROL OF OUR TRANSMISSION FACILITIES AND OUR TRANSMISSION OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED WITH THOSE OF MISO. OUR PARTICIPATION AND AUTHORITY TO SELL WHOLESALE POWER AT MARKET-BASED RATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FERC JURISDICTION. TRANSMISSION SERVICE OVER OUR FACILITIES IS PROVIDED THROUGH MISO S TARIFF. 
 
 AS A MEMBER OF MISO, WE OFFER OUR AVAILABLE ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION OF EACH OF OUR GENERATION ASSETS INTO THE MISO DAY-AHEAD AND REAL-TIME MARKETS. MISO DISPATCHES GENERATION ASSETS IN ECONOMIC ORDER CONSIDERING TRANSMISSION CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER RELIABILITY ISSUES TO MEET THE TOTAL DEMAND IN THE MISO REGION. MISO SETTLES HOURLY OFFERS AND BIDS BASED ON LOCATIONAL MARGINAL PRICES, WHICH IS PRICING FOR ENERGY AT A GIVEN LOCATION BASED ON A MARKET CLEARING PRICE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS, GENERATION AND DEMAND THROUGHOUT THE MISO REGION. MISO EVALUATES THE MARKET PARTICIPANTS ENERGY OFFERS AND DEMAND BIDS OPTIMIZING FOR ENERGY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES PRODUCTS TO ECONOMICALLY AND RELIABLY DISPATCH THE ENTIRE MISO SYSTEM. THE IURC HAS AUTHORIZED IPL TO RECOVER ITS ONGOING COSTS FROM MISO AND SUCH COSTS ARE BEING RECOVERED PER SPECIFIC RATE ORDERS. THE UNAMORTIZED BALANCE OF TOTAL MISO COSTS DEFERRED AS REGULATORY ASSETS WAS 80.4 MILLION AND 95.5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 , RESPECTIVELY. 
 
 WE HAVE PRESERVED OUR RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM MISO BY TENDERING OUR NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL (SUBJECT TO THE FERC AND THE IURC APPROVAL). WE HAVE MADE NO DECISION TO SEEK WITHDRAWAL FROM MISO AT THIS TIME. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF BEING A MISO MEMBER, AS WELL AS ACTIVELY ADVOCATE FOR OUR POSITIONS THROUGH THE EXISTING MISO STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND IN FILINGS WITH THE FERC OR IURC. 
 
 SEE ALSO NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE FERC AND THE IURC . 

REGULATION 
 
 GENERAL 
 
 IPL IS A REGULATED PUBLIC UTILITY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN PROVIDING ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THE INDIANAPOLIS METROPOLITAN AREA. AN INHERENT BUSINESS RISK FACING ANY REGULATED PUBLIC UTILITY IS THAT OF UNEXPECTED OR ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION. REGULATORY DISCRETION IS REASONABLY BROAD IN INDIANA, AS IT IS ELSEWHERE. WE ATTEMPT TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH REGULATORS AND THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS, WHILE REMAINING VIGILANT IN PROTECTING OR ASSERTING OUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS. WE TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ADDRESSING REGULATORY POLICY ISSUES IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS INCREASED ACTIVITY BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS, WHICH HAS HAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAINTAIN OUR BOOKS AND RECORDS CONSISTENT WITH GAAP REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REGULATION. SEE NOTE 1, OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 
 
 RETAIL RATEMAKING 
 
 IPL S TARIFF RATES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS CONSIST OF BASIC RATES AND CHARGES WHICH ARE SET AND APPROVED BY THE IURC AFTER PUBLIC HEARINGS. IN ADDITION, IPL S RATES INCLUDE VARIOUS ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) A RIDER TO REFLECT CHANGES IN FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS TO MEET IPL S RETAIL LOAD REQUIREMENTS, REFERRED TO AS THE FAC, (II) A RIDER FOR THE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS (INCLUDING A RETURN) INCURRED TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, REFERRED TO AS THE ECCRA, (III) A RIDER TO REFLECT CHANGES IN ONGOING MISO COSTS, REFERRED TO AS THE REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION ADJUSTMENT, (IV) A RIDER TO REFLECT CHANGES IN NET CAPACITY SALES ABOVE AND BELOW AN ESTABLISHED ANNUAL BENCHMARK OF 11.3 MILLION (BEGINNING DECEMBER 5, 2018), REFERRED TO AS THE CAPACITY ADJUSTMENT, (V) A RIDER FOR PASSING THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS WHOLESALE SALES MARGINS ABOVE AND BELOW AN ESTABLISHED ANNUAL BENCHMARK OF 16.3 MILLION (BEGINNING DECEMBER 5, 2018), REFERRED TO AS THE OFF-SYSTEM SALES MARGIN ADJUSTMENT, AND (VI) COST RECOVERY, LOST MARGIN RECOVERIES AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES FROM OUR DSM PROGRAMS. EACH OF THESE TARIFF RATE COMPONENTS MAY BE SET AND APPROVED BY THE IURC IN SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME (CURRENTLY THE FAC PROCEEDINGS OCCUR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND IPL'S OTHER RIDER PROCEEDINGS ALL OCCUR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS). THESE COMPONENTS FUNCTION SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE 
 
 10 

ANOTHER, BUT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF OUR RATES AND CHARGES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AT THE TIME OF ANY REVIEW OF OUR BASIC RATES AND CHARGES. 
 
 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GENERATION, STORAGE, HANDLING, USE, DISPOSAL AND TRANSPORTATION OF REGULATED MATERIALS, INCLUDING ASH; THE USE AND DISCHARGE OF WATER USED IN GENERATION BOILERS AND FOR COOLING PURPOSES; THE EMISSION AND DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS AND OTHER MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE A LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF OBTAINING AND RENEWING PERMITS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. VIOLATION OF THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR PERMITS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES, OTHER SANCTIONS, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF PERMITS AND/OR FACILITY SHUTDOWNS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE AT ALL TIMES IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS, REGULATIONS AND PERMITS. 
 
 FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR CLAIMS OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IPL CANNOT ASSURE THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING AGAINST ANY CLAIM OF NONCOMPLIANCE. HOWEVER, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW NOV FROM THE EPA (SEE NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES - NEW SOURCE REVIEW AND OTHER CAA NOVS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS), WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY CURRENTLY OPEN ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS WILL RESULT IN FINES MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS RELATING TO CONTAMINATION AT OUR PAST OR PRESENT FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY WASTE DISPOSAL SITES. WE COULD ALSO BE HELD LIABLE FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. OUR COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH CURRENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, AND OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM PAST OR FUTURE RELEASES OF, OR EXPOSURE TO, HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. A DISCUSSION OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT US FOLLOWS. 
 
 MATS 
 
 IN APRIL 2012, THE EPA S RULE TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS REGULATED UNDER THE CAA EMITTED FROM COAL AND OIL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITIES, KNOWN AS MATS , BECAME EFFECTIVE. IPL MANAGEMENT DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A PLAN, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE IURC, TO COMPLY WITH THIS RULE AND ALL FOUR PETERSBURG UNITS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MATS RULE SINCE APPLICABLE DEADLINES. 
 
 SEVERAL LAWSUITS CHALLENGING THE EPA S MATS RULE WERE FILED BY OTHER PARTIES AND CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE D.C. CIRCUIT. IN APRIL 2014, THE D.C. CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION UPHOLDING THE MATS RULE. NUMEROUS STATES AND TWO TRADE GROUPS PETITIONED THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW THIS OPINION. IN JUNE 2015, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT REMANDED MATS TO THE D.C. CIRCUIT DUE TO THE EPA S FAILURE TO CONSIDER COSTS BEFORE DECIDING TO REGULATE POWER PLANTS UNDER SECTION 112 OF THE CAA. IN DECEMBER 2015, THE D.C. CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER REMANDING MATS TO THE EPA WITHOUT VACATUR WHILE THE EPA WORKED TO ACCOUNT FOR COSTS OF THE RULE PURSUANT TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT S DECISION. THE EPA PUBLISHED ITS FINAL APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FINDINGS IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER IN APRIL 2016. SEVERAL LAWSUITS WERE FILED APPEALING THAT FINDING IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT. IN APRIL 2017, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT ORDERED THAT THESE CHALLENGES BE HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING FURTHER ORDER FROM THE COURT AS THE EPA RECONSIDERS THE FINDING. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED A PROPOSED RULE FINDING THAT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY TO REGULATE HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS FROM COAL- AND OIL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUS), BUT THAT THE EPA WOULD NOT REMOVE THE SOURCE CATEGORY FROM THE CAA SECTION 112(C) LIST OF SOURCE CATEGORIES AND WOULD NOT CHANGE THE MATS REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER RULEMAKINGS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS ARE POSSIBLE; HOWEVER, IN THE MEANTIME, MATS REMAINS IN EFFECT. WE CURRENTLY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE REGULATORY OR JUDICIAL PROCESS, OR ITS IMPACT, IF ANY, ON OUR MATS COMPLIANCE PLANNING OR ULTIMATE COSTS. 

11 

WASTE MANAGEMENT AND CCR 
 
 IN THE COURSE OF OPERATIONS, OUR FACILITIES GENERATE SOLID AND LIQUID WASTE MATERIALS REQUIRING EVENTUAL DISPOSAL OR PROCESSING. WASTE MATERIALS GENERATED AT OUR ELECTRIC POWER AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES INCLUDE ASBESTOS, CCR, OIL, SCRAP METAL, RUBBISH, SMALL QUANTITIES OF INDUSTRIAL HAZARDOUS WASTES SUCH AS SPENT SOLVENTS, TREE-AND-LAND-CLEARING WASTES AND POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL CONTAMINATED LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS. WE ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR SOLID AND LIQUID WASTES ARE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE NATIONAL, REGIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CCR, WE DO NOT USUALLY PHYSICALLY DISPOSE OF WASTE MATERIALS ON OUR PROPERTY. INSTEAD, THEY ARE USUALLY SHIPPED OFF-SITE FOR FINAL DISPOSAL, TREATMENT OR RECYCLING. SOME OF OUR CCRS ARE BENEFICIALLY USED ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE, INCLUDING AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR PRODUCTION OF WALLBOARD, CONCRETE OR CEMENT AND AS AGRICULTURAL SOIL AMENDMENT, AND SOME ARE DISPOSED OFF-SITE IN PERMITTED DISPOSAL FACILITIES. A SMALL AMOUNT OF CCR, WHICH CONSISTS OF BOTTOM ASH, FLY ASH AND AIR POLLUTION CONTROL WASTES, IS DISPOSED OF AT OUR PETERSBURG COAL-FIRED POWER GENERATION PLANT USING ENGINEERED, PERMITTED LANDFILLS. 
 
 THE EPA'S FINAL CCR RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2015. GENERALLY, THE RULE REGULATES CCR AS NONHAZARDOUS SOLID WASTE AND ESTABLISHES NATIONAL MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR EXISTING AND NEW CCR LANDFILLS AND EXISTING AND NEW CCR ASH PONDS, INCLUDING LOCATION RESTRICTIONS, DESIGN AND OPERATING CRITERIA, GROUNDWATER MONITORING, CORRECTIVE ACTION AND CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND POST-CLOSURE CARE. ON DECEMBER 16, 2016, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE NATION ACT ("WIIN ACT"), WHICH INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CCR RULE THROUGH A STATE PERMITTING PROGRAM, OR IF THE STATE CHOOSES NOT TO PARTICIPATE, A POSSIBLE FEDERAL PERMIT PROGRAM. ON DECEMBER 19, 2019, THE EPA ISSUED A PREPUBLICATION VERSION OF A PROPOSED RULE TO ESTABLISH A FEDERAL CCR PERMIT PROGRAM THAT WOULD OPERATE IN STATES WITHOUT APPROVED CCR PERMIT PROGRAMS. IF THIS RULE IS FINALIZED BEFORE INDIANA ESTABLISHES A STATE-LEVEL CCR PERMIT PROGRAM, IPL COULD EVENTUALLY BE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR A FEDERAL CCR PERMIT FROM THE EPA. 
 
 THE EPA HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL IMPLEMENT A PHASED APPROACH TO AMENDING THE CCR RULE. IN JULY 2018, THE EPA PUBLISHED FINAL CCR RULE AMENDMENTS (PHASE ONE, PART ONE) IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER . IN AUGUST 2018, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ISSUED A DECISION IN CERTAIN CCR LITIGATION MATTERS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVISIONS TO THE CCR RULE. IN OCTOBER 2018, SOME ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW CHALLENGING THE EPA'S FINAL CCR RULE AMENDMENTS (PHASE ONE, PART ONE) WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN REMANDED WITHOUT VACATUR TO THE EPA. ON AUGUST 14, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CCR RULE; THE AMENDMENTS RELATE TO THE CCR RULE'S CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING BENEFICIAL USE AND THE REGULATION OF CCR PILES, AMONG OTHER REVISIONS. ON DECEMBER 2, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED ADDITIONAL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CCR RULE TITLED " A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CLOSURE PART A: DEADLINE TO INITIATE CLOSURE ." 
 
 IPL WAS NOT ABLE TO MEET CERTAIN LOCATION RESTRICTIONS SET IN THE CCR RULE FOR ASH PONDS AT THE HARDING STREET AND EAGLE VALLEY GENERATING STATIONS BY THE DEADLINE OF OCTOBER 17, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE ASH PONDS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR MANAGING NON-CCR WASTEWATERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CLOSE BY OCTOBER 31, 2020 OR SOONER. 
 
 THE EXISTING ASH PONDS AT PETERSBURG DID NOT MEET CERTAIN STRUCTURAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE CCR RULE. AS SUCH, IPL WAS ULTIMATELY REQUIRED TO CEASE USE OF ALL EXISTING ASH PONDS AT PETERSBURG AND DID SO AS OF NOVEMBER 11, 2018. TO COMPLY WITH THE CCR RULE, IPL INSTALLED A DRY BOTTOM ASH HANDLING SYSTEM AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY 46 MILLION, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017. 
 
 THE CCR RULE, CURRENT OR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CCR RULE, THE RESULTS OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING DATA OR THE OUTCOME OF CCR-RELATED LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF ANY RESULTING EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REGARD. SEE NOTE 3, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - ARO TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. 
 
 ON JULY 29, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED ITS PROPOSED RULE THAT WOULD CODIFY THAT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY DEMONSTRATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION ENTITIES UNDER CERCLA. UNDER SECTION 108(B) OF CERCLA, THE EPA MUST IMPOSE REGULATIONS ON CLASSES OF FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ENTITIES ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONSISTENT WITH THE DEGREE AND DURATION OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REQUIRED IS DETERMINED BY THE PRESIDENT, IN HIS DISCRETION. SOME CONSTITUENTS OF THE CCR WASTEWATER LEACHATE DETECTED THROUGH THE CCR RULE COULD, THEORETICALLY BE CLASSIFIED AS HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THE PROPOSED RULE, IF FINALIZED, WOULD MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO IN THE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY THAT SUCH FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY DEMONSTRATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED. IF, HOWEVER ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL 
 
 12 

RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED AS A RESULT OF THIS RULEMAKING OR ASSOCIATED LITIGATION (IF ANY), IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL WASTEWATER REQUIREMENTS 
 
 IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE EPA PUBLISHED ITS FINAL ELG RULE TO REDUCE TOXIC POLLUTANTS DISCHARGED INTO WATERWAYS BY STEAM-ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS. THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES INSTALLED AND OPERATED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OCTOBER 2012 NPDES PERMIT DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE DRY BOTTOM ASH HANDLING SYSTEM INSTALLED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CCR RULE AT PETERSBURG MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL ELG RULE. ON NOVEMBER 22, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE 2015 ELG RULE RELATED TO FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION WASTEWATER AND BOTTOM ASH TRANSPORT WATER. ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT VACATED AND REMANDED PORTIONS OF THE EPA S 2015 ELG RULE RELATED TO LEGACY WASTEWATERS AND COMBUSTION RESIDUAL LEACHATE. IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OUTCOME OF THIS DECISION OR CURRENT OR FUTURE REVISIONS TO THE ELG RULE MIGHT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 IN JUNE 2016, THE EPA PUBLISHED THE FINAL NATIONAL CHRONIC AQUATIC LIFE CRITERION FOR THE POLLUTANT, SELENIUM, IN FRESH WATER. IPL S NPDES PERMITS MAY BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE SELENIUM WATER-QUALITY BASED EFFLUENT LIMITS BASED ON A SITE-SPECIFIC EVALUATION PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES DETERMINING IF THERE IS A REASONABLE POTENTIAL TO EXCEED THE REVISED FINAL SELENIUM WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THE SPECIFIC RECEIVING WATER BODY UTILIZING ACTUAL AND/OR PROJECTED DISCHARGE INFORMATION FOR THE IPL GENERATING FACILITIES. AS A RESULT, IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THIS CRITERIA. HOWEVER, IF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE NECESSARY, THEY COULD BE MATERIAL. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.

 IN JUNE 2015, THE EPA AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ("THE AGENCIES") PUBLISHED A RULE DEFINING FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER WATERS OF THE U.S., KNOWN AS THE "WATERS OF THE U.S." RULE. THIS RULE, WHICH INITIALLY BECAME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2015, COULD EXPAND OR OTHERWISE CHANGE THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF WATERS OR FEATURES SUBJECT TO CWA PERMITTING. HOWEVER, THE AGENCIES ENGAGED IN A TWO-STEP PROCESS TO REPEAL THE 2015 "WATERS OF THE U.S." RULE AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEWLY PROMULGATED RULE CALLED THE NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION RULE. THE AGENCIES COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP ON OCTOBER 22, 2019, BY PUBLISHING THE FINAL RULE REPEALING THE 2015 "WATERS OF THE U.S." RULE. THE AGENCIES NEXT PROPOSED A REVISED DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE U.S. ON DECEMBER 11, 2018 AND RELEASED THE PREPUBLICATION VERSION OF THE FINAL NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION RULE ON JANUARY 23, 2020. IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEWLY PROMULGATED NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION RULE MIGHT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY PROCESS. 
 
 CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION 
 
 ONE BYPRODUCT OF BURNING COAL AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS IS THE EMISSION OF GHGS, INCLUDING CO 2 . WE FACE CERTAIN RISKS RELATED TO EXISTING AND POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL GHG LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER COMPLIANCE COSTS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF ANY EXISTING OR FUTURE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, REGIONAL OR STATE GHG LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS OR PROPOSALS WILL DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: 

THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF LEGISLATION AND/OR REGULATION (E.G., INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, REGIONAL, STATE), WHICH ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION AND/OR REGULATION (E.G., ELECTRICITY GENERATORS, LOAD-SERVING ENTITIES, ELECTRICITY DELIVERERS, ETC.), THE ENACTMENT DATE OF THE LEGISLATION AND/OR REGULATION AND THE COMPLIANCE DEADLINES SET FORTH THEREIN; 
 
 THE LEVEL OF REDUCTIONS OF GHGS BEING SOUGHT BY THE REGULATION AND/OR LEGISLATION (E.G., 10 , 20 , 50 , ETC.) AND THE YEAR SELECTED AS A BASELINE FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE OF MANDATED GHG REDUCTION (E.G., 10 REDUCTION FROM 1990 EMISSION LEVELS, 20 REDUCTION FROM 2000 EMISSION LEVELS, ETC.); 
 
 THE LEGISLATIVE AND/OR REGULATORY STRUCTURE (E.G., A GHG CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM, A CARBON TAX, GHG EMISSION LIMITS, ETC.); 
 
 IN ANY CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM, THE MECHANISM USED TO DETERMINE THE PRICE OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES OR OFFSETS TO BE AUCTIONED BY DESIGNATED GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR REPRESENTATIVES; 
 
 13 

THE PRICE OF OFFSETS AND EMISSION ALLOWANCES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, INCLUDING ANY PRICE FLOORS OR PRICE CAPS ON THE COSTS OF OFFSETS AND EMISSION ALLOWANCES; 
 
 THE OPERATION OF AND EMISSIONS FROM REGULATED UNITS; 
 
 THE PERMISSIBILITY OF USING OFFSETS TO MEET REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH OFFSETS (E.G., TYPE OF OFFSET PROJECTS ALLOWED, THE AMOUNT OF OFFSETS THAT CAN BE USED FOR COMPLIANCE PURPOSES, ANY GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE ORIGIN OR LOCATION OF CREDITABLE OFFSET PROJECTS), AS WELL AS THE METHODS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE OFFSETS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN GHG EMISSIONS AND THAT THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE PERMANENT (I.E., THE VERIFICATION METHOD); 
 
 WHETHER THE USE OF PROCEEDS OF ANY AUCTION CONDUCTED BY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IS REINVESTED IN DEVELOPING NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, IS USED TO OFFSET ANY COST IMPACT ON CERTAIN ENERGY CONSUMERS OR IS USED TO ADDRESS ISSUES UNRELATED TO POWER; 
 
 HOW THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY IS DETERMINED, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PRICE INCLUDES ANY COSTS RESULTING FROM ANY NEW CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION AND THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFER COMPLIANCE COSTS PURSUANT TO LEGISLATION, MARKET OR CONTRACT, TO OTHER PARTIES; 
 
 ANY IMPACT ON FUEL DEMAND AND VOLATILITY THAT MAY AFFECT THE MARKET CLEARING PRICE FOR POWER; 
 
 THE EFFECTS OF ANY LEGISLATION OR REGULATION ON THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT MAY IN TURN AFFECT RELIABILITY; 
 
 THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CARBON CONTROL TECHNOLOGY; 
 
 WHETHER ANY FEDERAL LEGISLATION REGULATING GHG EMISSIONS WILL PRECLUDE THE EPA FROM REGULATING GHG EMISSIONS UNDER THE CAA OR PREEMPT PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS OR OTHER LITIGATION BY THIRD PARTIES; 
 
 ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE THE USE OF FUEL AT THE GENERATION FACILITIES OR OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY; AND 
 
 OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER ANY RESULTING COSTS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF SUCH RECOVERY. 
 
 EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW, AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING, PROPOSED OR POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE OR REGIONAL GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS LEGISLATION OR INITIATIVES DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE IN EARLIER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND ANY FINAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS, IF ADOPTED, COULD VARY DRASTICALLY FROM CURRENT PROPOSALS. ANY INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION ADOPTED IN THE U.S. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED SEVERAL DIFFERENT DRAFT BILLS PERTAINING TO GHG LEGISLATION, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE GHG LEGISLATION THAT WOULD IMPACT MANY INDUSTRIES AND MORE LIMITED LEGISLATION FOCUSING ONLY ON THE UTILITY AND ELECTRIC GENERATION INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH NO LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO GHG EMISSIONS HAS BEEN PASSED TO DATE BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, SIMILAR LEGISLATION MAY BE CONSIDERED OR PASSED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, IN THE PAST MIDWESTERN STATE GOVERNORS (INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA) AND THE PREMIER OF MANITOBA, CANADA COMMITTED TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE MIDWESTERN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ACCORD. THOUGH THE PARTICIPATING STATES AND PROVINCE ARE NO LONGER PURSUING THIS COMMITMENT, SIMILAR APPLICABLE STATE OR REGIONAL INITIATIVES MAY BE PURSUED IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CPP (DISCUSSED BELOW). 
 
 THE EPA REGULATES GHG EMISSIONS FROM CERTAIN STATIONARY SOURCES UNDER THE REGULATIONS FORMERLY-CALLED THE TAILORING RULE. THE REGULATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED PURSUANT TO TWO CAA PROGRAMS: THE TITLE V OPERATING PERMIT PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM REQUIRING A PERMIT IF UNDERGOING CERTAIN NEW CONSTRUCTION OR MAJOR MODIFICATIONS, THE PSD PROGRAM. OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TITLE V PERMITS INCLUDE RECORDKEEPING AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS. SOURCES SUBJECT TO PSD CAN BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT BACT. IN JUNE 2014, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE EPA HAD EXCEEDED ITS STATUTORY AUTHORITY IN ISSUING THE TAILORING RULE BY REGULATING UNDER THE PSD PROGRAM SOURCES BASED SOLELY ON THEIR GHG EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ALSO HELD THAT THE EPA COULD IMPOSE GHG BACT REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCES ALREADY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PSD FOR CERTAIN OTHER POLLUTANTS WHEN GHG INCREASES EXCEED A SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLD. CURRENTLY, THE EPA USES A 75,000 TON PER YEAR GHG THRESHOLD TO DETERMINE IF INCREASES ARE SIGNIFICANT. ON OCTOBER 3, 2016, THE EPA PUBLISHED A PROPOSED RULE THAT WOULD SET A GHG SIGNIFICANT EMISSIONS INCREASE THRESHOLD OF 75,000 TONS PER YEAR, THAT, IF EXCEEDED AS PART OF A MAJOR MODIFICATION THAT OTHERWISE TRIGGERED PSD, WOULD REQUIRE GHG BACT. THEREFORE, IF FUTURE MODIFICATIONS TO IPL S SOURCES REQUIRE PSD REVIEW FOR OTHER POLLUTANTS AND GHG INCREASES EXCEED THE EPA S GHG SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS, SUCH MODIFICATIONS MAY ALSO TRIGGER GHG BACT REQUIREMENTS. THE EPA HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE ON WHAT BACT ENTAILS FOR THE CONTROL OF GHG AND INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE NOW REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHAT CONTROLS ARE REQUIRED FOR FACILITIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 

14 

ON OCTOBER 23, 2015, THE EPA FINALIZED CO 2 EMISSION RULES FOR EXISTING POWER PLANTS UNDER CAA SECTION 111(D) (CALLED THE CPP). THE CPP PROVIDED FOR INTERIM EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE RATES TO BE ACHIEVED BEGINNING IN 2022 AND FINAL EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE RATES TO BE ACHIEVED STARTING IN 2030. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, THE FINAL NSPS FOR CO 2 EMISSIONS FROM NEW, MODIFIED AND RECONSTRUCTED FOSSIL-FUEL-FIRED POWER PLANTS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER ON OCTOBER 23, 2015. SEVERAL STATES AND INDUSTRY GROUPS CHALLENGED THE NSPS FOR CO 2 IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT. PURSUANT TO A COURT ORDER ISSUED IN AUGUST 2017, THE LITIGATION IS BEING HELD IN INDEFINITE ABEYANCE PENDING FURTHER COURT ORDER. ON DECEMBER 20, 2018, THE EPA PUBLISHED PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE FINAL NSPS FOR NEW, MODIFIED AND RECONSTRUCTED COAL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITY STEAM GENERATING UNITS. THE EPA PROPOSED THAT THE BEST SYSTEM OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION (BSER) FOR THESE UNITS IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT GENERATION THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO SUPERCRITICAL STEAM CONDITIONS FOR LARGER UNITS AND SUB-CRITICAL STEAM CONDITIONS FOR SMALLER UNITS, AND NOT PARTIAL CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION (CCS), WHICH HAD BEEN THE BSER FOR THESE UNITS IN THE 2015 FINAL NSPS . THE EPA DID NOT INCLUDE REVISIONS FOR NATURAL-GAS COMBINED CYCLE OR SIMPLE CYCLE UNITS IN THE DECEMBER 20, 2018 PROPOSAL. CHALLENGES TO THE GHG NSPS ARE BEING HELD IN ABEYANCE AT THIS TIME. 
 
 ON FEBRUARY 9, 2016, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED ORDERS STAYING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPP PENDING RESOLUTION OF CHALLENGES TO THE RULE. ON OCTOBER 16, 2017, THE EPA PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER A PROPOSED RULE THAT WOULD RESCIND THE CPP. ON JULY 8, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE TO REPEAL THE CPP. ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2019, THE D.C. CIRCUIT GRANTED MOTIONS TO DISMISS AS MOOT THE CONSOLIDATED CHALLENGES TO THE CPP AND CHALLENGES TO THE EPA'S DENIAL OF RECONSIDERATION OF THE CPP. 
 
 ON AUGUST 31, 2018, THE EPA PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER PROPOSED EMISSION GUIDELINES FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING ELECTRIC UTILITY GENERATING UNITS, KNOWN AS THE ACE RULE. ON JULY 8, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED THE FINAL ACE RULE ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED REVISIONS TO IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. THE FINAL ACE RULE REPLACES THE CPP AND DETERMINES THAT HEAT RATE IMPROVEMENT MEASURES ARE THE BEST SYSTEM OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FOR EXISTING COAL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS. THE FINAL RULE REQUIRES THE STATE OF INDIANA TO DEVELOP A STATE PLAN TO ESTABLISH CO 2 EMISSION LIMITS FOR DESIGNATED FACILITIES, INCLUDING IPL PETERSBURG S COAL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS. STATES HAVE THREE YEARS TO DEVELOP THEIR PLANS UNDER THE RULE. IMPACTS REMAIN LARGELY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE INDIANA'S STATE PLAN HAS NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED. 
 
 DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THESE REGULATIONS, AND EXISTING AND POTENTIAL ASSOCIATED LITIGATION, IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT, BUT ANY RULE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF ANY RESULTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REGARD. 
 
 ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, ON DECEMBER 12, 2015, 195 NATIONS, INCLUDING THE U.S., FINALIZED THE TEXT OF AN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE ACCORD IN PARIS, FRANCE (THE PARIS AGREEMENT ), WHICH AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AND OFFICIALLY ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 22, 2016. THE PARIS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR COUNTRIES TO SET THEIR OWN GHG EMISSIONS TARGETS, MAKE THESE EMISSIONS TARGETS MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME AND BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE GHG EMISSIONS REPORTING AND THE MEASURES EACH COUNTRY WILL USE TO ACHIEVE ITS GHG EMISSIONS TARGETS. A LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT IS TO LIMIT GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE TO WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS FROM TEMPERATURES IN THE PRE-INDUSTRIAL ERA. THE U.S. HAD PROPOSED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPP WOULD FULFILL MUCH OF ITS INTENDED REDUCTIONS UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT, BUT IN AUGUST 2017, THE U.S. INFORMED THE UNITED NATIONS IT WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT, BUT WOULD CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN RELATED MEETINGS DURING THE WITHDRAWAL PROCESS. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2019, THE U.S. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED THE U.N. THAT THE U.S. WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT. AS SUCH, THE U.S. WILL OFFICIALLY BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW ON NOVEMBER 4, 2020. 
 
 BASED ON THE ABOVE, THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT OF GHG RULES ON IPL. THE GHG BACT REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT APPLY AT LEAST UNTIL WE CONSTRUCT A NEW MAJOR SOURCE OR MAKE A MAJOR MODIFICATION OF AN EXISTING MAJOR SOURCE, AND THE NSPS WILL NOT REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH AN EMISSIONS STANDARD UNTIL WE CONSTRUCT A NEW ELECTRIC GENERATING UNIT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PLANNED MAJOR MODIFICATIONS OF AN EXISTING SOURCE OR PLANS TO CONSTRUCT A NEW MAJOR SOURCE WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO THESE REGULATIONS AT THIS TIME. FURTHERMORE, THE EPA, STATES AND OTHER UTILITIES ARE STILL EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE GHG REGULATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN LIGHT OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE EPA S CURRENT AND FUTURE GHG REGULATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT IT COULD BE MATERIAL.

UNIT RETIREMENTS AND REPLACEMENT GENERATION 
 
 FOUR COAL-FIRED UNITS AT IPL S EAGLE VALLEY STATION SITE IN INDIANA WERE RETIRED IN APRIL 2016. IPL REPLACED THIS GENERATION WITH A 671 MW CCGT AT THE EAGLE VALLEY SITE, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN APRIL 2018, AT A COST OF 597 MILLION. IPL ALSO COMPLETED A REFUEL OF ITS HARDING STREET STATION UNITS 5, 6 AND 7 FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS (APPROXIMATELY 610 TOTAL MW NET CAPACITY) AT A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY 105 MILLION. THE HARDING STREET 5 AND 6 REFUELING PROJECTS WERE COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2015 AND THE HARDING STREET 7 REFUEL WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. THE COSTS TO BUILD AND OPERATE THE CCGT AND THE HARDING STREET STATION REFUELING PROJECTS, INCLUDING A RETURN, ARE REFLECTED IN THE BASIC RATES AND CHARGES FROM IPL'S 2018 BASE RATE ORDER EFFECTIVE ON DECEMBER 5, 2018. 
 
 IN DECEMBER 2019, IPL FILED ITS IRP, WHICH DESCRIBES IPL'S PREFERRED RESOURCE PORTFOLIO FOR MEETING GENERATION CAPACITY NEEDS FOR SERVING ITS RETAIL CUSTOMERS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SEE NOTE 2, " REGULATORY MATTERS - IRP FILING " TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. 
 
 NEW SOURCE REVIEW AND OTHER CAA NOVS 
 
 SEE NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES - NEW SOURCE REVIEW AND OTHER CAA NOVS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. 
 
 CSAPR 
 
 CSAPR ADDRESSES THE "GOOD NEIGHBOR" PROVISION OF THE CAA, WHICH PROHIBITS SOURCES WITHIN EACH STATE FROM EMITTING ANY AIR POLLUTANT IN AN AMOUNT WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ANY OTHER STATE S NONATTAINMENT, OR INTERFERENCE WITH MAINTENANCE OF, ANY NAAQS. THE CSAPR IS IMPLEMENTED, IN PART, THROUGH A MARKET-BASED PROGRAM UNDER WHICH COMPLIANCE MAY BE ACHIEVABLE THROUGH THE ACQUISITION AND USE OF EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES CREATED BY THE EPA. FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION AND LEGAL CHALLENGES OF THE EPA S 2005 FEDERAL CAIR, THE FEDERAL CSAPR BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2015 REQUIRING THE FURTHER REDUCTION OF SO 2 AND NO X EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS IN 28 STATES, INCLUDING INDIANA, WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO OZONE AND/OR FINE PARTICLE POLLUTION IN OTHER STATES. IN OCTOBER 2016, THE EPA PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE TO UPDATE THE CSAPR TO ADDRESS THE 2008 OZONE NAAQS CSAPR UPDATE RULE ). THE CSAPR UPDATE RULE FOUND THAT NO X OZONE SEASON EMISSIONS IN 22 STATES (INCLUDING INDIANA) AFFECT THE ABILITY OF DOWNWIND STATES TO ATTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE 2008 OZONE NAAQS, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE EPA ISSUED FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THAT BOTH GENERALLY PROVIDE UPDATED CSAPR NO X OZONE SEASON EMISSION BUDGETS FOR ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS WITHIN THESE STATES AND THAT IMPLEMENT THESE BUDGETS THROUGH MODIFICATIONS TO THE CSAPR NO X OZONE SEASON ALLOWANCE TRADING PROGRAM. IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN IN THE 2017 OZONE SEASON (MAY THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2017). AFFECTED FACILITIES RECEIVE FEWER OZONE SEASON NOX ALLOWANCES IN 2017 AND LATER, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN THE NEED TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES. ADDITIONALLY, ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2019, THE D.C. CIRCUIT REMANDED A PORTION OF OCTOBER 2016 CSAPR UPDATE RULE TO THE EPA. WITH RESPECT TO THESE NEW STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO DATE, HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE IN FUTURE YEARS BUT IT COULD BE MATERIAL. 
 
 NAAQS 
 
 UNDER THE CAA, THE EPA SETS NAAQS FOR SIX CRITERIA POLLUTANTS CONSIDERED HARMFUL TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING PARTICULATE MATTER, NO X , OZONE AND SO 2 , WHICH RESULT FROM FOSSIL-FUEL COMBUSTION. AREAS MEETING THE NAAQS ARE DESIGNATED ATTAINMENT AREAS WHILE THOSE THAT DO NOT MEET THE NAAQS ARE CONSIDERED NONATTAINMENT AREAS. EACH STATE MUST DEVELOP A PLAN TO BRING NONATTAINMENT AREAS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE NAAQS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IMPOSING OPERATING LIMITS ON INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. THE EPA IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW NAAQS AT FIVE-YEAR INTERVALS. 
 
 OZONE. IN OCTOBER 2015, THE EPA PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE LOWERING THE NAAQS FOR OZONE TO 70 PARTS PER BILLION FROM 75 PARTS PER BILLION. THE EPA PUBLISHED ITS FINAL DESIGNATIONS FOR THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED ON NOVEMBER 16, 2017. NONE OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN AREAS DESIGNATED AS NONATTAINMENT. 
 
 IN DECEMBER 2013, EIGHT NORTHEASTERN STATES PETITIONED THE EPA TO ADD NINE UPWIND STATES, INCLUDING INDIANA, TO THE OZONE TRANSPORT REGION, A GROUP OF STATES REQUIRED TO IMPOSE ENHANCED RESTRICTIONS ON NO X EMISSIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2017, THE EPA PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE DENYING THE PETITION. IN DECEMBER 2017, EIGHT NORTHEASTERN STATES FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW CHALLENGING THE FINAL RULE DENYING THE PETITION. ON APRIL 23, 2019, THE D.C. CIRCUIT DENIED THE PETITION. 
 
 16 

IN MARCH 2018, THE STATE OF NEW YORK SUBMITTED A PETITION TO THE EPA PURSUANT TO SECTION 126 OF THE CAA REQUESTING NEW LIMITATIONS ON NO X EMISSIONS FROM DOZENS OF UPWIND GENERATING STATIONS, INCLUDING IPL'S PETERSBURG, HARDING STREET, AND EAGLE VALLEY STATIONS ON THE BASIS THAT THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO NEW YORK S ABILITY TO MEET THE 2008 OZONE NAAQS. ON OCTOBER 18, 2019, THE EPA PUBLISHED FINAL DENIAL OF THE PETITION. STATES SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT CHALLENGING THE EPA S DENIAL. IF THE SECTION 126 PETITION IS ULTIMATELY GRANTED, OUR UNITS COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF ANY RESULTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, ON NOVEMBER 16, 2016, THE STATE OF MARYLAND SUBMITTED A PETITION TO THE EPA PURSUANT TO SECTION 126 OF THE CAA REQUESTING NEW LIMITATIONS ON NO X EMISSIONS FROM 36 UPWIND GENERATING UNITS, INCLUDING IPL'S PETERSBURG GENERATING STATION UNITS 2 AND 3, ON THE BASIS THAT THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO MARYLAND S ABILITY TO MEET THE 2008 OZONE NAAQS. ON OCTOBER 5, 2018, THE EPA PUBLISHED A DENIAL OF MARYLAND S PETITION. THE STATES OF MARYLAND AND DELAWARE, IN ADDITION TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, HAVE A FILED PETITION WITH THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHALLENGING THE EPA S DENIAL. IF THE SECTION 126 PETITION IS ULTIMATELY GRANTED, OUR PETERSBURG GENERATING STATION UNITS 2 AND 3 COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF ANY RESULTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 
 
 FINE PARTICULATE MATTER. IN 2013, THE EPA PUBLISHED THE 2012 ANNUAL PM2.5 STANDARD OF 12 MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER OF AIR AND THE 24-HOUR PM2.5 STANDARD OF 35 MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER OF AIR. IN 2015, THE EPA PUBLISHED ITS FINAL ATTAINMENT DESIGNATIONS FOR THE 2012 PM2.5 STANDARD. IN ADDITION TO THE PM2.5 STANDARD, THERE IS ALSO A 24-HOUR PM10 STANDARD OF 150 MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER OF AIR. NO IPL OPERATIONS ARE CURRENTLY LOCATED IN NONATTAINMENT AREAS. 
 
 NO X AND SO 2 . IN 2010, A ONE-HOUR PRIMARY NAAQS BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR NO X AND A NEW ONE-HOUR SO 2 PRIMARY NAAQS ALSO BECAME EFFECTIVE. IN 2013, THE EPA PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER ITS FINAL DESIGNATION, WHICH INCLUDE PORTIONS OF MARION, MORGAN, AND PIKE COUNTIES AS NONATTAINMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ONE-HOUR SO 2 STANDARD. 
 
 IN 2015, IDEM PUBLISHED ITS FINAL RULE ESTABLISHING REDUCED SO 2 LIMITS FOR IPL FACILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW ONE-HOUR STANDARD, FOR THE AREAS IN WHICH IPL S HARDING STREET, PETERSBURG, AND EAGLE VALLEY GENERATING STATIONS OPERATE, WITH COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY JANUARY 1, 2017. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE EXISTING FGD SYSTEMS AT PETERSBURG STATION WERE REQUIRED TO MEET THE EMISSION LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE RULE. THE RULE HAS NOT IMPACTED IPL S EAGLE VALLEY OR HARDING STREET GENERATING STATIONS AS THESE FACILITIES CEASED COAL COMBUSTION IN ADVANCE OF THE COMPLIANCE DATE. 
 ON AUGUST 15, 2018, THE EPA PROPOSED TO APPROVE INDIANA'S STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (SIP) ADDRESSING ATTAINMENT OF THE 2010 SO 2 STANDARD FOR CERTAIN LOCATIONS INCLUDING THOSE OF IPL'S HARDING STREET AND PETERSBURG GENERATING STATIONS. ON MARCH 22, 2019, THE EPA FINALIZED APPROVAL OF INDIANA S ATTAINMENT PLAN FOR THE AREA THAT INCLUDES HARDING. THE EPA HAS NOT APPROVED THE ATTAINMENT PLAN FOR THE AREA THAT INCLUDES PETERSBURG. INSTEAD IDEM HAS IMPOSED ADDITIONAL SO2 LIMITS ON PETERSBURG THROUGH A COMMISSIONER S ORDER ISSUED JULY 31, 2019. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2019, IDEM REQUESTED EPA APPROVAL OF THOSE LIMITS AS PART OF THE SIP. ONCE THE LIMITS ARE APPROVED AS PART OF THE SIP, IDEM CAN RESUBMIT THE ATTAINMENT PLAN FOR EPA APPROVAL FOR THE AREA THAT INCLUDES PETERSBURG. 
 
 ON APRIL 26, 2017, THE IURC APPROVED IPL S REQUEST FOR NAAQS SO 2 COMPLIANCE AT ITS PETERSBURG GENERATION STATION WITH 80 OF QUALIFYING COSTS RECOVERED THROUGH A RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM AND THE REMAINDER RECORDED AS A REGULATORY ASSET FOR RECOVERY IN A SUBSEQUENT RATE CASE. THE APPROVED CAPITAL COST OF THE NAAQS SO 2 COMPLIANCE PLAN IS APPROXIMATELY 29 MILLION. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2019, IDEM ISSUED A COMMISSIONER S ORDER FURTHER REDUCING SO 2 LIMITS WHICH ARE BEING ACHIEVED THROUGH OPERATION OF EXISTING CONTROLS. 
 
 BASED ON THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS, THE STATE OF INDIANA IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN THE STATE MEET THE NAAQS. WITH RESPECT TO MARION, MORGAN AND PIKE COUNTIES, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER AREAS DETERMINED TO BE IN NONATTAINMENT, THE STATE OF INDIANA WILL BE REQUIRED TO MODIFY ITS STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO DETAIL HOW THE STATE WILL REGAIN ITS ATTAINMENT STATUS. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE IDEM OR THE EPA MAY REQUIRE REDUCTIONS OF EMISSIONS FROM OUR GENERATING STATIONS TO REACH ATTAINMENT STATUS FOR OZONE, FINE PARTICULATE MATTER OR SO 2 . AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE TO IPL WITH RESPECT TO THESE NEW AMBIENT STANDARDS, BUT IT COULD BE MATERIAL. 

17 

COOLING WATER INTAKE REGULATIONS 
 
 WE USE WATER AS A COOLANT AT OUR GENERATING STATIONS. UNDER THE CWA, COOLING WATER INTAKE STRUCTURES ARE REQUIRED TO REFLECT THE BTA FOR MINIMIZING ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. IN 2014, THE EPA'S FINAL STANDARDS BECAME EFFECTIVE TO PROTECT FISH AND OTHER AQUATIC ORGANISMS DRAWN INTO COOLING WATER SYSTEMS AT LARGE POWER PLANTS AND OTHER FACILITIES. THESE STANDARDS, BASED ON SECTION 316(B) OF THE CWA, REQUIRE AFFECTED FACILITIES TO CHOOSE AMONGST SEVEN BTA OPTIONS TO REDUCE FISH IMPINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN FACILITIES MUST CONDUCT STUDIES TO ASSIST PERMITTING AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND WHAT SITE-SPECIFIC CONTROLS, IF ANY, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE ENTRAINMENT OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS. IT IS POSSIBLE THIS PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES PERMITTING AND PUBLIC INPUT, COULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO INSTALL CLOSED-CYCLE COOLING SYSTEMS (CLOSED-CYCLE COOLING TOWERS) OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY, THE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT NEW UNITS ADDED TO AN EXISTING FACILITY MUST REDUCE BOTH IMPINGEMENT AND ENTRAINMENT THAT ACHIEVES ONE OF TWO ALTERNATIVES UNDER NATIONAL BTA STANDARDS. IPL S NPDES PERMITS WILL BE UPDATED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS RULE, INCLUDING ANY SOURCE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS A RESULT, IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE TOTAL IMPACTS OF THIS FINAL RULE, INCLUDING ANY CHALLENGES TO SUCH FINAL RULE AND THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH CHALLENGES. HOWEVER, IF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE NECESSARY, THEY COULD BE MATERIAL. WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 
 
 OTHER 
 
 IN RESPONSE TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS, THE EPA CONTINUES EVALUATING VARIOUS EXISTING REGULATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR REPEAL, REPLACEMENT OR MODIFICATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT AT THIS TIME THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THE EPA S REVIEW OF OTHER EXISTING REGULATIONS OR WHAT IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 SUMMARY 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS PRESENTLY REQUIRE US TO INCUR MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS. SEE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DISCUSSION IN " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY - CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS " FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS. WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEEK RECOVERY OF BOTH CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO SUCH COMPLIANCE, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE COMPLEX, CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CONTINUING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY INCREASE. MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR WHOLESALE VOLUMES AND MARGINS. DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF RECOVERY ALLOWED BY THE IURC, THESE COSTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE MAY SEEK RECOVERY OF ANY OPERATING OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 

ENERGY SUPPLY 
 
 APPROXIMATELY 58 OF THE TOTAL KWH WE GENERATED IN 2019 WAS FROM COAL AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 69 AND 88 IN 2018 AND 2017 , RESPECTIVELY. OUR EXISTING COAL CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ALL OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTED REQUIREMENTS IN 2020 AND APPROXIMATELY 57 IN TOTAL FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 . WE HAVE LONG-TERM COAL CONTRACTS WITH FOUR SUPPLIERS. APPROXIMATELY 33 OF OUR EXISTING COAL UNDER CONTRACT FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMES FROM ONE SUPPLIER. WE HAVE ONE CONTRACT WITH THIS SUPPLIER, WHICH EMPLOYS NON-UNIONIZED LABOR, FOR THE PROVISION OF COAL FROM THREE SEPARATE MINES. 
 
 HISTORICALLY, WE USED COAL AS A FUEL SOURCE AT THE PETERSBURG, HARDING STREET AND EAGLE VALLEY STATIONS. HOWEVER, THE HARDING STREET STATION UNIT 7 CONVERSION FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016 AND THE COAL-FIRED UNITS AT EAGLE VALLEY WERE RETIRED IN APRIL 2016, AND, AS A RESULT, WE NO LONGER BURN COAL AT HARDING STREET OR EAGLE VALLEY. IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO RETIRE APPROXIMATELY 630 MW OF COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT PETERSBURG UNITS 1 AND 2 BY 2023 (FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS - IRP FILING ). 
 
 PRICING PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR LONG-TERM COAL CONTRACTS ALLOW FOR PRICE CHANGES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COAL IS CURRENTLY MINED IN THE STATE OF INDIANA, AND ALL OF OUR COAL SUPPLY IS MINED BY UNAFFILIATED SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTIES. OUR GOAL IS TO CARRY A 25-50 DAY SYSTEM SUPPLY OF COAL TO OFFSET UNFORESEEN OCCURRENCES SUCH AS EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWNS AND TRANSPORTATION OR MINE DELAYS. OUR PRESENT INVENTORY IS WITHIN OUR TARGET RANGE. 
 
 18 

NATURAL GAS AND FUEL OIL PROVIDED THE REMAINING KWH GENERATION IN 2019. NATURAL GAS IS USED IN OUR STEAM BOILER UNITS AT HARDING STREET STATION (UNITS 5 AND 6 BEGINNING IN DECEMBER 2015 AND UNIT 7 BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016), OUR CCGT AT EAGLE VALLEY AND COMBUSTION TURBINES. IPL SOURCES NATURAL GAS FROM THE WHOLESALE MARKET DELIVERED TO OUR PLANTS BY INTERSTATE PIPELINE AND LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES. IPL HOLDS FIRM PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION COMMITMENTS ON TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION INTERSTATE PIPELINE AND HAS FIRM REDELIVERY CONTRACTS WITH THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES THAT SERVE IPL PLANTS. IPL HAS ESTABLISHED PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS HEDGES FOR APPROXIMATELY 50 OF THE EXPECTED CONSUMPTION AT EAGLE VALLEY DURING THE 2020 WINTER PERIOD. WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A NATURAL GAS INVENTORY; HOWEVER, OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT NATURAL GAS IS READILY AVAILABLE AT LIQUID SUPPLY POINTS ON INTERSTATE PIPELINES, AND WE EXPECT THIS AVAILABILITY TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. FUEL OIL IS USED FOR START-UP AND FLAME STABILIZATION IN COAL-FIRED GENERATING UNITS, AS PRIMARY FUEL IN TWO OLDER COMBUSTION TURBINES, AND AS AN ALTERNATE FUEL IN TWO OTHER COMBUSTION TURBINES. 
 
 AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE CCGT AT THE EAGLE VALLEY STATION IN APRIL 2018, THE HARDING STREET STATION REFUELING PROJECTS AND THE RETIREMENT OF COAL-FIRED UNITS AT EAGLE VALLEY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF GENERATION FROM NATURAL GAS. THE GENERATION FUEL MIX FROM COAL AND NATURAL GAS WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE AS THE RELATIVE PRICES OF THE COMMODITIES CHANGE. CURRENTLY, APPROXIMATELY 58 OF THE TOTAL KWH WE GENERATE IS FROM COAL AND APPROXIMATELY 42 IS FROM NATURAL GAS. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, WE MEET THE ELECTRICITY DEMANDS OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS WITH ENERGY PURCHASED UNDER POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND BY PURCHASES IN MISO. WE ARE COMMITTED UNDER LONG-TERM POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE ALL ENERGY FROM TWO WIND PROJECTS THAT HAVE A COMBINED MAXIMUM OUTPUT CAPACITY OF 300 MW. WE HAVE 96.4 MW OF SOLAR-GENERATED ELECTRICITY IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, OF WHICH 95.9 MW WAS IN OPERATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 . WE ALSO PURCHASE UP TO 8 MW OF ENERGY FROM A COMBINED HEAT AND POWER FACILITY LOCATED IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. 
 
 TOTAL ELECTRICITY SOLD TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN 2019 CAME FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: 49.6 FROM IPL-OWNED COAL-FIRED STEAM GENERATION, 40.2 FROM IPL-OWNED NATURAL GAS-FIRED UNITS, AND 10.2 FROM POWER PURCHASED UNDER POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (PRIMARILY WIND AND SOLAR) AND FROM THE WHOLESALE POWER MARKET.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION TO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. NEW RISKS MAY EMERGE AT ANY TIME, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THOSE RISKS OR ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING IPALCO AND IPL SET FORTH IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HEREIN. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. 
 
 OUR ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD RESULT IN UNSCHEDULED PLANT OUTAGES, UNANTICIPATED OPERATION AND/OR MAINTENANCE EXPENSES, INCREASED FUEL OR PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. 
 
 WE OPERATE COAL, OIL AND NATURAL GAS GENERATING FACILITIES, WHICH INVOLVE CERTAIN RISKS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ENERGY COSTS, OUTPUT AND EFFICIENCY LEVELS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE: 

UNIT OR FACILITY SHUTDOWNS DUE TO A BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES; 
 
 INCREASED PRICES FOR FUEL AND FUEL TRANSPORTATION AS EXISTING CONTRACTS EXPIRE OR AS SUCH CONTRACTS ARE ADJUSTED THROUGH PRICE RE-OPENER PROVISIONS OR AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENTS; 
 
 DISRUPTIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OR DELIVERY OF FUEL AND LACK OF ADEQUATE INVENTORIES; 
 
 SHORTAGES OF OR DELAYS IN OBTAINING EQUIPMENT; 
 
 LOSS OF COST-EFFECTIVE DISPOSAL OPTIONS FOR SOLID WASTE GENERATED BY THE FACILITIES; 
 
 ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES; 
 
 RELIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS; 
 
 INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY OR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS; 
 
 OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS RESULTING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL OR PERMIT LIMITATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTIONS; 
 
 CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS; 
 
 DISRUPTIONS IN THE DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY; 
 
 LABOR DISPUTES OR WORK STOPPAGES BY EMPLOYEES; 
 
 THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; 
 
 EVENTS OCCURRING ON THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS THAT INTERCONNECT TO AND AFFECT OUR SYSTEM; 
 
 OPERATOR ERROR; AND 
 
 CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. 
 
 THE ABOVE RISKS COULD RESULT IN UNSCHEDULED PLANT OUTAGES, UNANTICIPATED OPERATION AND/OR MAINTENANCE EXPENSES, INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND/OR INCREASED FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. THESE RISKS ARE PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY IPL'S ABILITY TO GENERALLY PASS FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE FAC. IF UNEXPECTED PLANT OUTAGES OCCUR FREQUENTLY AND/OR FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME, HOWEVER, THIS COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE RISKS AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BECOME EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. POWER GENERATION INVOLVES HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ACQUIRING, TRANSPORTING AND UNLOADING FUEL, OPERATING LARGE PIECES OF ROTATING EQUIPMENT AND DELIVERING ELECTRICITY TO TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. THE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS DEPEND UPON ADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL AND ON THE EXISTENCE OF OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PLANS AND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEMS WHICH REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE POSSIBILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE AND IMPACT OF THESE RISKS. 
 
 THE HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE CAN ALSO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE, SEVERE DAMAGE TO AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, CONTAMINATION OF, OR DAMAGE TO, THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY ONE OF THESE EVENTS MAY RESULT IN OUR BEING NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES, ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS, PERSONAL INJURY AND FINES AND/OR PENALTIES. WE MAINTAIN AN AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROTECTION THAT WE BELIEVE IS ADEQUATE, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INSURANCE WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND AGAINST ALL HAZARDS OR LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE MAY BE SUBJECT. A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT FULLY INSURED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, EXCEPT FOR IPL S LARGE SUBSTATIONS, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION ASSETS ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF 
 
 21 

PROPERTY INSURANCE. FURTHER, DUE TO RISING INSURANCE COSTS AND CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US OR AT ALL. ANY SUCH LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR COSTS TO DELIVER ELECTRICITY TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE COSTS WE CAN RECOVER AND THE RETURN ON CAPITAL WE ARE PERMITTED TO EARN FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE REGULATED AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF INDIANA AND THE RULES, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE IURC. 
 
 WE ARE CURRENTLY OBLIGATED TO SUPPLY ELECTRIC ENERGY TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. EVEN THOUGH RATE REGULATION IS PREMISED ON FULL RECOVERY OF PRUDENTLY INCURRED COSTS AND A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE IURC WILL AGREE THAT ALL OF OUR COSTS HAVE BEEN PRUDENTLY INCURRED OR ARE RECOVERABLE. THERE ALSO IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN WHICH RATES ARE DETERMINED WILL ALWAYS RESULT IN RATES THAT WILL PRODUCE A FULL OR TIMELY RECOVERY OF OUR COSTS AND AUTHORIZED RETURN. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY REQUIRED TO MEET OUR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD EXCEED OUR AVAILABLE ELECTRIC GENERATING CAPACITY. WHEN OUR RETAIL CUSTOMER DEMAND EXCEEDS OUR GENERATING CAPACITY FOR UNITS OPERATING UNDER MISO ECONOMIC DISPATCH, RECOVERY OF OUR COST TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC ENERGY IN THE MISO MARKET TO MEET THAT DEMAND IS SUBJECT TO A STIPULATION AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT INCLUDES A BENCHMARK WHICH COMPARES HOURLY PURCHASED POWER COSTS TO DAILY NATURAL GAS PRICES. PURCHASED POWER COSTS ABOVE THE BENCHMARK MUST MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA IN ORDER FOR US TO FULLY RECOVER THEM FROM OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS CONSIDERATION OF THE CAPACITY OF UNITS AVAILABLE BUT NOT SELECTED BY THE MISO ECONOMIC DISPATCH. WE MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PASS ALL OF THE PURCHASED POWER COSTS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO DO SO, THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY BETWEEN THE TIME THE COSTS ARE INCURRED AND THE TIME THE COSTS ARE RECOVERED. SINCE THESE SITUATIONS MOST OFTEN OCCUR DURING PERIODS OF PEAK DEMAND, THE MARKET PRICE FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY AT THE TIME WE PURCHASE IT COULD BE VERY HIGH, AND WE MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO RECOVER ALL OF SUCH COSTS THROUGH OUR FAC. EVEN IF A SUPPLY SHORTAGE WERE BRIEF, WE COULD SUFFER SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 CHANGES IN, OR REINTERPRETATIONS OF, THE LAWS, RULES, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT SET ELECTRIC RATES, PERMITTED RATES OF RETURN, CHANGES IN IPL S RATE STRUCTURE, REGULATIONS REGARDING OWNERSHIP OF GENERATION ASSETS AND ELECTRIC SERVICE, RELIABILITY INITIATIVES, FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER (WHICH ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OPERATING COSTS), CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS AND THE RECOVERY OF THESE AND OTHER COSTS ON A FULL OR TIMELY BASIS THROUGH RATES, POWER MARKET PRICES AND CHANGES TO THE FREQUENCY AND TIMING OF RATE INCREASES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A LACK OF GROWTH OR A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS OR IN CUSTOMER USAGE. 
 
 CUSTOMER GROWTH AND CUSTOMER USAGE ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DSM MEASURES, POPULATION CHANGES, JOB AND INCOME GROWTH, HOUSING STARTS, NEW BUSINESS FORMATION AND THE OVERALL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. A LACK OF GROWTH, OR A DECLINE, IN THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS AND MAY CAUSE US TO FAIL TO FULLY REALIZE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM INVESTMENTS AND EXPENDITURES. 
 
 THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUEL AND OTHER COMMODITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED AND COULD CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HEDGE THE ENTIRE EXPOSURE OF OUR OPERATIONS FROM AVAILABILITY AND PRICE VOLATILITY. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY COAL AND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR COAL SUPPLY COMES FROM ONE SUPPLIER. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF COAL, NATURAL GAS, PURCHASED POWER AND EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF STEEL, COPPER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR COSTS. WE ALSO ARE DEPENDENT ON PURCHASED POWER, IN PART, TO MEET OUR SEASONAL PLANNING RESERVE MARGINS. ANY CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES COULD AFFECT THE PRICES WE CHARGE, OUR OPERATING COSTS AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WITH RESPECT TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 
 
 OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF FUEL IS LIMITED BECAUSE, PURSUANT TO INDIANA LAW, WE MAY APPLY TO THE IURC FOR A CHANGE IN OUR FAC EVERY THREE MONTHS TO RECOVER OUR ESTIMATED FUEL COSTS, WHICH MAY BE ABOVE OR BELOW THE LEVELS INCLUDED IN OUR BASIC RATES AND CHARGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERALLY RECOVER THE ENERGY PORTION OF OUR PURCHASED POWER COSTS IN THESE QUARTERLY FAC PROCEEDINGS SUBJECT TO A BENCHMARK (PLEASE SEE NOTE 
 
 22 

2, REGULATORY MATTERS FAC AND AUTHORIZED ANNUAL JURISDICTIONAL NET OPERATING INCOME TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THE BENCHMARK AND THE PROCESS TO RECOVER FUEL COSTS). AS PART OF THIS COST-RECOVERY PROCESS, WE MUST PRESENT EVIDENCE IN EACH PROCEEDING THAT WE HAVE MADE EVERY REASONABLE EFFORT TO ACQUIRE FUEL AND GENERATE OR PURCHASE POWER OR BOTH SO AS TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS AT THE LOWEST FUEL COST REASONABLY POSSIBLE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY OR FULLY RECOVER OUR FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 APPROXIMATELY 58 OF THE ENERGY WE PRODUCED IN 2019 WAS GENERATED BY COAL AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 69 AND 88 IN 2018 AND 2017 , RESPECTIVELY. WHILE WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 57 IN TOTAL OF OUR CURRENT COAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BALANCE IS YET TO BE PURCHASED AND WILL BE PURCHASED UNDER A COMBINATION OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS AND ON THE SPOT MARKET. PRICES CAN BE HIGHLY VOLATILE IN BOTH THE SHORT-TERM MARKET AND ON THE SPOT MARKET. THE COAL MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE ARE NOW IN A GLOBAL MARKET FOR COAL IN WHICH OUR DOMESTIC PRICE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS AND DEMAND BALANCE. COAL EXPORTS FROM THE U.S. HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AT TIMES IN RECENT YEARS. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED DIRECT COSTS AND PERMITTING ISSUES THAT AFFECT MINING COSTS AND SUPPLY AVAILABILITY, AND THE VARIABLE DEMAND OF RETAIL CUSTOMER LOAD AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR GENERATION FLEET HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUEL PROCUREMENT OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, PRICING PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR COAL CONTRACTS WITH TERMS OF ONE YEAR OR MORE ALLOW FOR PRICE CHANGES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
 BECAUSE OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON COAL TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNEXPECTED PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE COAL MARKET, PRICE INCREASES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN OF OUR LONG-TERM COAL CONTRACTS, AND THE CONTINUED REGULATORY AND POLITICAL SCRUTINY OF COAL. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS AND ARE TAKING ACTIONS WHICH, IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL PHYSICAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. OUR DEPENDENCE ON COAL ALSO MEANS THAT THE OUTPUT OF OUR COAL-FIRED GENERATION UNITS CAN BE GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE COSTS OF OTHER FUELS COMBUSTED BY GENERATION FACILITIES THAT COMPETE WITH OUR COAL-FIRED GENERATION UNITS. NATURAL GAS PRICES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW AND SOME GAS-FIRED GENERATORS THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE PRIMARILY USED DURING PERIODS OF PEAK AND INTERMEDIATE ELECTRIC DEMAND HAVE RUN EVEN DURING PERIODS OF RELATIVELY LOW DEMAND. THIS HAS CAUSED MANY COAL-FIRED GENERATORS, INCLUDING OURS, TO RUN FEWER HOURS DURING THESE PERIODS OF BASE-LOAD DEMAND. 
 
 IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COAL SUPPLY IS CURRENTLY MINED IN THE STATE OF INDIANA, AND ALL OF OUR COAL SUPPLY IS CURRENTLY MINED BY UNAFFILIATED SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTIES. OUR CURRENT GOAL IS TO CARRY A 25-50 DAY SYSTEM SUPPLY OF COAL TO OFFSET UNFORESEEN OCCURRENCES SUCH AS EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWNS AND TRANSPORTATION OR MINE DELAYS. IPL HAS LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH FOUR SUPPLIERS, WITH ABOUT 33 OF OUR EXISTING COAL UNDER CONTRACT FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMING FROM ONE SUPPLIER. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COAL INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING AS A RESULT OF DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. FURTHER RESTRUCTURING MAY RESULT IN A FAILURE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR FEWER SUPPLIERS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, INCREASED DEPENDENCY ON ANY ONE SUPPLIER. ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE ABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, PARTICULARLY OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS, TO MINE OR DELIVER COAL OR OTHER FUEL, OR ANY FAILURE ON THE PART OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS OR FAILURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE POWER OR FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER OF FUEL ON SIMILARLY FAVORABLE TERMS, WHICH COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER FUEL COSTS THROUGH THE FAC PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FACILITIES, SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS. 
 
 CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, CYBER-ATTACKS, TERRORIST ACTS, ACTS OF WAR, PANDEMIC EVENTS, OR NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES, TORNADOES, SEVERE WINDS, ICE OR SNOW STORMS, DROUGHTS OR OTHER SIMILAR OCCURRENCES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GENERATION FACILITIES, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. OUR PETERSBURG PLANT, WHICH IS OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GENERATING CAPACITY, IS LOCATED IN THE WABASH VALLEY SEISMIC ZONE, ADJACENT TO THE NEW MADRID SEISMIC ZONE, WHICH ARE BOTH AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE CENTRAL U.S. 

23 

CONCERNS ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE LED TO INCREASED REGULATION AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 ONE BYPRODUCT OF BURNING COAL AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS IS THE EMISSION OF GHGS, INCLUDING CO 2 . AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND REGIONAL LEVELS, POLICIES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS. IN 2019, IPL EMITTED APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION TONS OF CO 2 FROM OUR POWER PLANTS. IPL USES CO 2 EMISSION ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES SUPPORTED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOL REPORTING STANDARD ON GHG EMISSIONS. OUR CO 2 EMISSIONS ARE DETERMINED FROM EMISSIONS MONITORING DATA AND CALCULATIONS USING ACTUAL FUEL HEAT INPUTS AND FUEL TYPE CO 2 EMISSION FACTORS. 
 
 THERE CURRENTLY IS NO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION IMPOSING MANDATORY GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS (INCLUDING FOR CO2) THAT AFFECTS OUR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. HOWEVER, IN 2015, THE EPA PROMULGATED A RULE ESTABLISHING NSPS FOR CO 2 EMISSIONS FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND MODIFIED/RECONSTRUCTED FOSSIL-FUELED EUSGUS LARGER THAN 25 MW. ALSO IN 2015, THE EPA PROMULGATED THE CPP, WHICH REQUIRES INTERIM REDUCTIONS BY PREEXISTING EUSGUS BEGINNING IN 2022, WITH FULL COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED BY 2030. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY AMEND OR RESCIND THE RULES. IN 2016, THE EPA ADOPTED REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO GHG EMISSIONS THAT REQUIRE NEW AND EXISTING SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS TO POTENTIALLY OBTAIN NEW SOURCE REVIEW PERMITS FROM THE EPA PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION OR MODIFICATION, BUT ONLY IF SUCH SOURCES ALSO MUST OBTAIN A NEW SOURCE REVIEW PERMIT FOR INCREASES IN OTHER REGULATED POLLUTANTS. 
 
 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE REGULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS IN THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S ISSUED ORDER STAYING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPP, AND THE EPA'S PROPOSAL TO RESCIND THE CPP, SEE "ITEM 1. BUSINESS -ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION ." 
 
 IN DECEMBER 2015, THE PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE CONVENED FOR THE 21ST CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES AND THE RESULTING PARIS AGREEMENT ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM GOAL OF KEEPING THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE WELL BELOW 2 C ABOVE PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PARIS AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE THE TREND TOWARD EFFORTS TO DE-CARBONIZE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. WHILE FUTURE PARTICIPATION BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT REMAINS UNCERTAIN, SUCH PARTICIPATION COULD FURTHER LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS. 
 
 ANY EXISTING OR FUTURE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE ACTUAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS, THE DEGREE AND TIMING OF GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS REQUIRED UNDER ANY SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF OFFSETS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET-BASED COMPLIANCE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE GHG EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE THEM IN AN AUCTION OR ON THE OPEN MARKET AND THE IMPACT OF SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION ON OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER COSTS INCURRED THROUGH RATE INCREASES OR OTHERWISE. OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. ALTHOUGH WE WOULD SEEK RECOVERY OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW CLIMATE CHANGE OR GHG REGULATIONS, OUR INABILITY TO FULLY OR TIMELY RECOVER SUCH COSTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. ADDITIONALLY, CONCERNS OVER GHG EMISSIONS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE LED, AND COULD LEAD FURTHER, TO REDUCED DEMAND FOR COAL-FIRED POWER, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE, PHYSICAL RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE COULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, INCREASED RUNOFF AND EARLIER SPRING PEAK DISCHARGE IN MANY GLACIER AND SNOW-FED RIVERS, WARMING OF LAKES AND RIVERS, AN INCREASE IN SEA LEVEL, CHANGES AND VARIABILITY IN PRECIPITATION AND IN THE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. PHYSICAL IMPACTS MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED DOWNTIME AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AT OUR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES AND OUR SUPPORT FACILITIES. VARIATIONS IN WEATHER CONDITIONS, PRIMARILY TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY, WOULD ALSO BE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE ENERGY NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. A DECREASE IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES. IN ADDITION, WHILE REVENUES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF CUSTOMERS INCREASED, SUCH INCREASE COULD PROMPT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN GENERATION CAPACITY. CHANGES IN THE TEMPERATURE OF LAKES AND RIVERS AND CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION THAT RESULT IN DROUGHT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF OUR FOSSIL-FUEL FIRED ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. IF ANY OF THE FOREGOING RISKS MATERIALIZE, COSTS MAY INCREASE OR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AND THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 IF ANY OF THE FOREGOING RISKS MATERIALIZE, COSTS MAY INCREASE OR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AND THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH

FLOWS AND REPUTATION. PLEASE SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IMPACTING US, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO REGULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCREASE OUR COST OF OPERATIONS, MAY EXPOSE US TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES OR MAKE CONTINUED OPERATION OF CERTAIN GENERATING UNITS UNPROFITABLE. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GENERATION, STORAGE, HANDLING, USE, DISPOSAL AND TRANSPORTATION OF REGULATED MATERIALS, INCLUDING CCR; THE USE AND DISCHARGE OF WATER USED IN GENERATION BOILERS AND FOR COOLING PURPOSES; THE EMISSION AND DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS AND OTHER MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES. SUCH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS CAN BECOME STRICTER OVER TIME, AND WE COULD ALSO BECOME SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS ALSO GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH INSPECTIONS AND OBTAIN AND COMPLY WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSES, PERMITS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE A LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF OBTAINING AND RENEWING LICENSES, PERMITS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TIMELY COMPLY WITH INSPECTIONS AND OBTAIN, MAINTAIN OR COMPLY WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND ALL LICENSES, PERMITS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATIONS REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, THEN OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE PREVENTED, DELAYED OR SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COSTS. A VIOLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, PERMITS OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES, PENALTIES, OTHER SANCTIONS, PERMIT REVOCATION, FACILITY SHUTDOWNS, THE IMPOSITION OF STRICTER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND CONTROLS OR OTHER INJUNCTIVE MEASURES AFFECTING OPERATING ASSETS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS REQUIRES US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AND RESOURCES AND COULD AT SOME POINT BECOME PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE OR RESULT IN OUR SHUTTING DOWN (TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY) OR ALTERING THE OPERATION OF OUR FACILITIES. UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, WE COULD ALSO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS RELATING TO CONTAMINATION AT OUR PAST OR PRESENT FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY WASTE DISPOSAL SITES. WE COULD ALSO BE HELD STRICTLY, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION ACTIONS FOR CLAIMS OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING AGAINST ANY CLAIM OF NONCOMPLIANCE. ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEFEND AGAINST ANY SUCH ALLEGED VIOLATIONS AND EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED COSTS. OUR COSTS AND LIABILITIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE OUTCOME OF THE EPA S NOVS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES - NEW SOURCE REVIEW AND OTHER CAA NOVS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE NOVS COULD ALSO RESULT IN FINES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. IPL RETIRED FOUR COAL-FIRED UNITS AT EAGLE VALLEY IN APRIL 2016, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - UNIT RETIREMENTS AND REPLACEMENT GENERATION. THE PRIMARILY COAL-FIRED UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN RETIRED AND/OR CONVERTED WERE NOT EQUIPPED WITH THE ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING AND EXPECTED REGULATIONS. 
 
 IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION EXPENSES, ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES, PRIVATE PARTY LAWSUITS AND REPUTATIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CCR, WHICH CONSISTS OF BOTTOM ASH, FLY ASH, AND AIR POLLUTION CONTROL WASTES GENERATED AT OUR CURRENT AND FORMER COAL-FIRED GENERATION PLANT SITES . WE EXPECT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO COMPLY WITH CCR RULES AND REQUIREMENTS AND ANY CHANGES TO THE CCR RULES OR REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER NEW RULES OR REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSING CCR MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS. ALSO, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO CCR-RELATED LAWSUITS OR INVOLVED IN OTHER CCR-RELATED LITIGATION THAT MAY REQUIRES US TO INCUR OTHER COSTS OR EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, CCR AND ITS PRODUCTION AT OUR FACILITIES HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTEREST FROM ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE MEDIA. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 PLEASE SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IMPACTING US.

THE USE OF NON-DERIVATIVE AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS COULD RESULT IN LOSSES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE SOMETIMES USE NON-DERIVATIVE AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS SWAPS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND FORWARDS, TO MANAGE COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL RISKS. WE MAY AT TIMES ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE RISK OF VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM WHOLESALE MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE TRADES ARE AFFECTED BY A RANGE OF FACTORS, INCLUDING VARIATIONS IN POWER DEMAND, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET PRICES, MARKET PRICES FOR ALTERNATIVE COMMODITIES AND OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES. WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MANAGE OUR COMMODITIES PRICE RISK EXPOSURE BY ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING RISK LIMITS AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, HOWEVER, THESE RISK LIMITS AND MANAGEMENT POLICIES MAY NOT WORK AS PLANNED AND FLUCTUATING PRICES AND OTHER EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVELY QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND PRICING INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES, THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS CAN INVOLVE MANAGEMENT S JUDGMENT OR THE USE OF ESTIMATES. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR USE OF ALTERNATIVE VALUATION METHODS COULD AFFECT THE REPORTED FAIR VALUE OF SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS. WE COULD ALSO RECOGNIZE FINANCIAL LOSSES AS A RESULT OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET VALUES OF THESE CONTRACTS, A COUNTERPARTY FAILING TO PERFORM, OR THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS WHICH THE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE FAILING TO MATERIALIZE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE DODD-FRANK ACT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COULD REDUCE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. 
 
 IN JULY 2010, THE DODD-FRANK ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE DODD-FRANK ACT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, A REQUIREMENT THAT CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES THAT WOULD NECESSITATE THE POSTING OF CASH COLLATERAL FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE CONSIDERED AN END-USER UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND THEREFORE ARE EXEMPT FROM MOST OF THE COLLATERAL AND MARGINING REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY BILATERAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, UNLESS OUR COUNTERPARTY IS A MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANT OR HAS ELECTED TO REPORT ON OUR BEHALF. EVEN THOUGH WE QUALIFY FOR AN EXCEPTION FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE EXCEPTION MAY PASS ALONG ANY INCREASED COSTS INCURRED BY THEM THROUGH HIGHER PRICES AND REDUCTIONS IN UNSECURED CREDIT LIMITS OR BE UNABLE TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH US. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO WEATHER AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS. 
 
 WEATHER CONDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRIC POWER, AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY VARIATIONS IN GENERAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AND UNUSUALLY SEVERE WEATHER. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR OPERATING REVENUES AND ASSOCIATED OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT GENERATED EVENLY BY MONTH DURING THE YEAR. WE FORECAST ELECTRIC SALES ON THE BASIS OF NORMAL WEATHER, WHICH REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM HISTORICAL AVERAGE. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS FROM NORMAL WEATHER (SUCH AS WARMER WINTERS AND COOLER SUMMERS) COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, SEVERE OR UNUSUAL WEATHER, SUCH AS FLOODS, TORNADOES AND ICE OR SNOW STORMS, MAY CAUSE OUTAGES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT MAY NOT BE INSURED OR RECOVERABLE FROM CUSTOMERS. WHILE WE ARE PERMITTED TO SEEK RECOVERY OF CERTAIN SEVERE STORM DAMAGE COSTS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY RECOVER SUCH COSTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR MEMBERSHIP IN A REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION PRESENTS RISKS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ARE A MEMBER OF MISO, A FERC-REGULATED REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION. MISO SERVES THE ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION NEEDS OF A 15-STATE AREA INCLUDING MUCH OF THE MID-U.S. AND CANADA AND MAINTAINS FUNCTIONAL OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES, AS WELL AS THAT OF THE OTHER UTILITY MEMBERS OF MISO. WE RETAIN CONTROL OVER OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. AS A RESULT OF MEMBERSHIP IN MISO AND ITS OPERATIONAL CONTROL, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO IMPORT POWER, WHEN NECESSARY, AND EXPORT POWER TO THE WHOLESALE MARKET HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, IMPACTED. WE OFFER OUR GENERATION AND BID OUR LOAD INTO THIS MARKET ON A DAY-AHEAD BASIS AND SETTLE DIFFERENCES IN REAL TIME. GIVEN THE NATURE OF MISO S POLICIES REGARDING USE OF TRANSMISSION FACILITIES, AND ITS ADMINISTRATION OF THE ENERGY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES MARKETS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT NEAR-TERM OPERATIONAL IMPACTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE MISO S RELIABLE OPERATION OF THE REGIONAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, OR THE IMPACT OF ITS OPERATION OF THE ENERGY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES MARKETS. 

26 

THE RULES GOVERNING THE VARIOUS REGIONAL POWER MARKETS MAY ALSO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR COSTS AND REVENUES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE MAY EXPAND OR OTHERWISE CHANGE OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM ACCORDING TO DECISIONS MADE BY MISO IN ADDITION TO OUR INTERNAL PLANNING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PROPOSALS AND PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FERC RELATING TO MISO OR OTHERWISE MAY CAUSE TRANSMISSION RATES TO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. WE ALSO INCUR FEES AND COSTS TO PARTICIPATE IN MISO. 
 
 TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RELY, AT LEAST IN PART, ON THE PERFORMANCE OF MISO TO MAINTAIN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, IT PUTS US AT SOME RISK FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF MISO. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY MISO TO SECURE THE RELIABLE OPERATION OF THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATED BY MISO COULD RESULT IN VOLTAGE REDUCTIONS, ROLLING BLACKOUTS, OR SUSTAINED SYSTEM-WIDE BLACKOUTS ON IPL S TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. SEE ALSO ITEM 1. BUSINESS - MISO OPERATIONS AND ITEM 1. BUSINESS - REGULATION RETAIL RATEMAKING. 
 
 IF WE WERE FOUND NOT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY PENALTIES, WHICH LIKELY WOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH REGULATED RATES. 
 
 AS AN OWNER AND OPERATOR OF A BULK POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, IPL IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS PROMULGATED BY THE NERC AND ENFORCED BY THE FERC. THE STANDARDS ARE BASED ON THE FUNCTIONS THAT NEED TO BE PERFORMED TO ENSURE THE BULK POWER SYSTEM OPERATES RELIABLY AND IS GUIDED BY RELIABILITY AND MARKET INTERFACE PRINCIPLES. COMPLIANCE WITH RELIABILITY STANDARDS MAY SUBJECT US TO HIGHER OPERATING COSTS OR INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO RECOVER COSTS AND EXPENDITURES FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH REGULATED RATES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE IURC WILL APPROVE FULL RECOVERY IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE WERE FOUND NOT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY PENALTIES, WHICH LIKELY WOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH REGULATED RATES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE RELY ON ACCESS TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, AND CAUSE INCREASES IN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. 
 
 FROM TIME TO TIME WE RELY ON ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY OPERATING CASH FLOWS. THESE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE ABILITY OF CORPORATIONS TO RAISE CAPITAL CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO RAISE CAPITAL. OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS OR DECLINES IN OUR CREDITWORTHINESS, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADEQUATE FUNDING TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE OR FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE EXTENT OF ANY IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS, THE OVERALL SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, OUR CREDIT RATINGS, CREDIT CAPACITY, THE COST OF FINANCING, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS OF OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR WITH SIMILAR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IT MAY ALSO DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CREDIT COUNTERPARTIES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. ACCESS TO FUNDS UNDER OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO MEET THEIR FINANCING COMMITMENTS AND OUR SATISFYING CONDITIONS TO BORROWING. OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, WITH CREDITWORTHY COUNTERPARTIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY. 
 
 SEE NOTE 7, DEBT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING INDEBTEDNESS. SEE ALSO ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO MARKET RISKS. 
 
 OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL, RELIABILITY AND CAPACITY RISKS. 
 
 THE ONGOING RELIABLE PERFORMANCE OF OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO RISKS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WEATHER DAMAGE, INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DAMAGE, EQUIPMENT OR PROCESS FAILURE, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, SUCH AS FIRES AND/OR EXPLOSIONS, FACILITY OUTAGES, LABOR DISPUTES, ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES, OPERATOR ERROR, OR INOPERABILITY OF KEY INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL TO US AND EVENTS OCCURRING ON THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS THAT 
 
 27 

INTERCONNECT TO AND AFFECT OUR SYSTEM. THE FAILURE OF OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO FULLY OPERATE AND DELIVER THE ENERGY DEMANDED BY CUSTOMERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS, AND IF SUCH FAILURES OCCUR FREQUENTLY AND/OR FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME, COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION. IN ADDITION, THE ADVENT AND QUICK ADAPTATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT REQUIRE INCREASED LEVELS OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY CANNOT BE PREDICTED AND COULD RESULT IN INSUFFICIENT TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CAPACITY. AS WITH ALL UTILITIES, POTENTIAL CONCERN WITH THE ADEQUACY OF TRANSMISSION CAPACITY ON IPL S SYSTEM OR THE REGIONAL SYSTEMS OPERATED BY MISO COULD RESULT IN MISO, THE NERC, THE FERC OR THE IURC REQUIRING US TO UPGRADE OR EXPAND OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THROUGH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR SHARE IN THE COSTS OF REGIONAL EXPANSION. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE RISKS AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BECOME EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. EXCEPT FOR IPL S LARGE SUBSTATIONS, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION ASSETS ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF PROPERTY INSURANCE. OTHERWISE, WE MAINTAIN AN AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROTECTION THAT WE BELIEVE IS ADEQUATE, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INSURANCE WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND AGAINST ALL HAZARDS OR LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE MAY BE SUBJECT. FURTHER, ANY INCREASED COSTS OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS MAY CAUSE DELAYS OR INABILITY IN MAINTAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE ON TERMS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US OR AT ALL. A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT FULLY INSURED COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 CURRENT AND FUTURE CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH, CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, FLUCTUATING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, AND OTHER CHALLENGES AFFECTING THE GENERAL ECONOMY, HAVE CAUSED AND MAY CONTINUE TO CAUSE SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO EXPERIENCE DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING CUSTOMERS MAY REDUCE THEIR ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US IN THE NORMAL, TIMELY FASHION. IN ADDITION, SOME EXISTING COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DISCONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS. SUSTAINED DOWNTURNS, RECESSIONS OR A SLUGGISH ECONOMY GENERALLY AFFECT THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE OUR ENERGY OPERATIONS. A CONTRACTING, SLOW OR SLUGGISH ECONOMY COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY IN AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE DOING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS MAY SEE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS, WHICH IN TURN MAY LEAD TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY REQUIRE. FURTHERMORE, PROJECTS WHICH MAY RESULT IN POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVE. SOME OF OUR SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES, AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE TRANSACT BUSINESS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US OR RESULT IN THEIR DECLARING BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR INSOLVENCY-LIKE PROCEEDINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR COUNTERPARTIES ON FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY MAY BECOME UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO REPLACEMENT AGREEMENTS ON TERMS AS FAVORABLE AS OUR EXISTING AGREEMENTS. REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR ELECTRIC SERVICES, FAILURE BY OUR CUSTOMERS TO TIMELY REMIT FULL PAYMENT OWED TO US AND SUPPLY DELAYS OR UNAVAILABILITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROJECTED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TOTAL EMPLOYMENT IN INDIANAPOLIS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE REALIZATION OF OUR FORECASTS FOR ANNUAL ENERGY SALES. 
 
 THE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND THE SECURITY PROVIDED FOR THIS INDEBTEDNESS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. 
 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 , WE HAD ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS 2,651.6 MILLION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND TOTAL COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF 546.5 MILLION . IPL HAD 1,713.8 MILLION OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 , WHICH ARE SECURED BY THE PLEDGE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF IPL UNDER THE TERMS OF IPL S MORTGAGE AND DEED OF TRUST. THIS LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS AND RELATED SECURITY COULD HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

INCREASING OUR VULNERABILITY TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS; 
 
 REQUIRING US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, THEREBY REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH FLOW TO FUND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES; 
 
 LIMITING OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE; AND 
 
 28 

LIMITING, ALONG WITH THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN OUR INDEBTEDNESS, OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS, AS NEEDED. 
 
 WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE FUTURE, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR ANY IPL DEBT. TO THE EXTENT WE BECOME MORE LEVERAGED, THE RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD INCREASE. FURTHER, ACTUAL CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE GREATER THAN EXPECTED. ACCORDINGLY, OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY AT MATURITY ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE AND, IN THAT EVENT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY, SELL ASSETS OR OTHERWISE RAISE FUNDS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT, SEE ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND NOTE 7, DEBT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K. 
 
 WE HAVE VARIABLE RATE DEBT THAT BEARS INTEREST BASED ON A PREVAILING RATE THAT IS RESET BASED ON A MARKET INDEX THAT CAN BE AFFECTED BY MARKET DEMAND, SUPPLY, MARKET INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN BOTH CASH ON DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENTS IN CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS. AS SUCH, ANY EVENT WHICH IMPACTS MARKET INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, RATINGS AGENCIES ISSUE CREDIT RATINGS ON US AND OUR DEBT THAT AFFECT OUR BORROWING COSTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND AFFECT OUR POTENTIAL POOL OF INVESTORS AND FUNDING SOURCES. OUR CREDIT RATINGS ALSO GOVERN THE COLLATERAL PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS. IF THE RATING AGENCIES WERE TO DOWNGRADE OUR CREDIT RATINGS, OUR BORROWING COSTS WOULD LIKELY FURTHER INCREASE, OUR POTENTIAL POOL OF INVESTORS AND FUNDING RESOURCES COULD BE REDUCED, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL CASH COLLATERAL UNDER SELECTED CONTRACTS. THESE EVENTS WOULD LIKELY REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY AND PROFITABILITY AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE ASSET PERFORMANCE AND INTEREST RATES OF THE PENSION PLANS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 PENSION COSTS ARE BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, LEVEL OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS, THE EXPECTED LIFE SPAN OF PENSION PLAN BENEFICIARIES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PENSION OBLIGATIONS. ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE TO BE WRONG, RESULTING IN A SHORTFALL OF OUR PENSION PLANS ASSETS COMPARED TO PENSION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PENSION PLANS. FURTHER, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AFFECTS THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE HELD IN TRUST TO SATISFY FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PENSION PLANS. THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND WILL YIELD UNCERTAIN RETURNS, WHICH MAY FALL BELOW OUR PROJECTED RETURN RATES. A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PENSION PLANS ASSETS WILL INCREASE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PENSION PLANS IF THE ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS DO NOT RECOVER THESE DECLINES IN VALUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FUTURE PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND THE TIMING OF FUNDING PAYMENTS, MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LEGISLATION. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING ANY SHORTFALL OF OUR PENSION PLANS ASSETS COMPARED TO OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PENSION PLANS, AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR PENSION LIABILITIES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006, WHICH REQUIRES UNDERFUNDED PENSION PLANS TO IMPROVE THEIR FUNDING RATIOS WITHIN PRESCRIBED INTERVALS BASED ON THE LEVEL OF THEIR UNDERFUNDING. AS A RESULT, OUR REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS, AT TIMES, HAVE INCREASED AND MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, OUR PENSION AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. AS INTEREST RATES DECREASE, THE DISCOUNTED LIABILITIES INCREASE BENEFIT EXPENSE AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING INCREASED NUMBERS OF RETIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY ASSUMPTIONS, MAY ALSO INCREASE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS. DECLINES IN MARKET VALUES AND INCREASED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. PLEASE SEE NOTE 9, BENEFIT PLANS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. 
 
 COUNTERPARTIES PROVIDING MATERIALS OR SERVICES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AND RELY ON MANY COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING FOR THE PURCHASE AND DELIVERY OF INVENTORY, INCLUDING FUEL AND EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS, FOR OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONS AND TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS ACTUARIAL CALCULATIONS, PAYROLL PROCESSING AND VARIOUS CONSULTING SERVICES. IF ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAILS TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS TO US OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, OUR BUSINESS PLANS MAY BE MATERIALLY DISRUPTED, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DISCONTINUE OR DELAY CERTAIN OPERATIONS IF A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE OR WE MAY BE FORCED TO ENTER INTO ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AT THEN- 
 
 29 

CURRENT MARKET PRICES THAT MAY EXCEED OUR CONTRACTUAL PRICES AND CAUSE DELAYS. ALTHOUGH OUR AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A POTENTIAL DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY, OUR ACTUAL EXPOSURE MAY BE GREATER THAN THE RELIEF PROVIDED BY THESE MITIGATION PROVISIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY ACTIONS, COST OVERRUNS, DELAYS OR OTHER LOSSES, ANY OF WHICH (OR A COMBINATION OF WHICH) COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 FURTHER, OUR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM CALLS FOR EXTENSIVE EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONS, INCLUDING THE INSTALLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADES, IMPROVEMENTS TO GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE ENGAGED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE, NUMEROUS CONTRACTORS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE THE NECESSARY MATERIALS AND/OR OBTAIN THE REQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RELATED SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SOME CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR US TO ASSUME THE RISK OF PRICE ESCALATION AND AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN METALS AND KEY COMPONENTS. THIS COULD FORCE US TO ENTER INTO ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AT THEN-CURRENT MARKET PRICES THAT MAY EXCEED OUR CONTRACTUAL PRICES AND CAUSE CONSTRUCTION DELAYS. IT COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO ENFORCEMENT ACTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH A CONTRACTOR FAILURE RESULTED IN A FAILURE BY IPL TO COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE COST OF THE PROJECT. AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, WE MIGHT INCUR LOSSES OR DELAYS IN COMPLETING CONSTRUCTION. 
 
 ACCIDENTAL IMPROPRIETIES AND UNDETECTED ERRORS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND INFORMATION REPORTING COULD RESULT IN THE DISALLOWANCE OF COST RECOVERY, NONCOMPLIANT DISCLOSURE OR INCORRECT PAYMENT PROCESSING. 
 
 OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND INTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE US TO CAPTURE AND PROCESS TRANSACTIONS AND INFORMATION IN A TIMELY AND ACCURATE MANNER IN COMPLIANCE WITH GAAP, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DISCLOSE AND REPORT FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECOVERY OF OUR COSTS AND WITH OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL SECURITIES, TAX AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND TO PROPERLY PROCESS PAYMENTS. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INTERNAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND POLICIES HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE CONTROLS, POLICIES, PRACTICES AND SYSTEMS ARE ADEQUATE TO VERIFY DATA INTEGRITY, UNANTICIPATED AND UNAUTHORIZED ACTIONS OF EMPLOYEES, TEMPORARY LAPSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS DUE TO SHORTFALLS IN OVERSIGHT OR RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS COULD LEAD TO IMPROPRIETIES AND UNDETECTED ERRORS THAT COULD RESULT IN THE DISALLOWANCE OF COST RECOVERY, NONCOMPLIANT DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING OR INCORRECT PAYMENT PROCESSING. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE SEC, FASB OR OTHER AUTHORITATIVE BODIES OR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MAY ISSUE NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS OR NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THESE CHANGES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO APPLY A NEW OR REVISED STANDARD RETROACTIVELY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE LAWS AND LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION, AS WELL AS LITIGATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND COSTS. 
 
 AS AN ELECTRIC UTILITY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WE ARE REGULATED BY THE FERC AND THE NERC AND, AT THE STATE LEVEL, WE ARE REGULATED BY THE IURC. THE REGULATORY POWER OF THE IURC OVER IPL IS BOTH COMPREHENSIVE AND TYPICAL OF THE TRADITIONAL FORM OF REGULATION GENERALLY IMPOSED BY STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS. WE FACE THE RISK OF UNEXPECTED OR ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION. REGULATORY DISCRETION IS REASONABLY BROAD IN INDIANA. WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE IURC AS TO OUR SERVICES AND FACILITIES, THE VALUATION OF PROPERTY, THE CONSTRUCTION, PURCHASE, OR LEASE OF ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITIES, THE CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS, RATES OF DEPRECIATION, THE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN RETAIL RATES AND CHARGES, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT, THE ACQUISITION AND SALE OF SOME PUBLIC UTILITY PROPERTIES OR SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS. 

30 

IPL S TARIFF RATES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS CONSIST OF BASIC RATES AND CHARGES WHICH ARE SET AND APPROVED BY THE IURC AFTER PUBLIC HEARINGS. IN ADDITION, IPL S RATES TYPICALLY INCLUDE VARIOUS ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS AND WE MUST SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE IURC THROUGH SUCH PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS OF OUR RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM FACTORS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CERTAIN COSTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE GRANTED APPROVAL OF RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM FACTORS THAT WE REQUEST FROM THE IURC. THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN IURC APPROVAL OF REQUESTED RELIEF, OR ANY OTHER ADVERSE RATE DETERMINATION BY THE IURC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 AS A RESULT OF THE EPACT AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY, WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING MANDATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS, CYBER SECURITY, TRANSMISSION EXPANSION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE LONG-TERM IMPACT, IF ANY, TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS. COMPLYING WITH THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT REQUIRES US TO EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDS AND RESOURCES. THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL COSTS AND PENALTIES AND CHANGES, EITHER FORCED OR VOLUNTARY, IN THE WAY WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 INDEPENDENT OF THE IURC S ABILITY TO REVIEW BASIC RATES AND CHARGES, INDIANA LAW REQUIRES ELECTRIC UTILITIES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE IURC TO MEET OPERATING EXPENSE AND INCOME TEST REQUIREMENTS AS A CONDITION FOR APPROVAL OF REQUESTED CHANGES IN THE FAC. ADDITIONALLY, THE FUEL CHARGE APPLIED FOR CAN BE REDUCED IF A UTILITY S ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH OPERATING INCOME, DETERMINED AT QUARTERLY MEASUREMENT DATES, EXCEEDS A UTILITY S AUTHORIZED ANNUAL JURISDICTIONAL NET OPERATING INCOME AND THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE NET OPERATING INCOME DEFICIENCIES AGAINST WHICH THE EXCESS ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH JURISDICTIONAL NET OPERATING INCOME CAN BE OFFSET. 
 
 FUTURE EVENTS, INCLUDING THE ADVENT OF RETAIL COMPETITION WITHIN IPL S SERVICE TERRITORY, COULD RESULT IN THE DEREGULATION OF PART OF IPL S EXISTING REGULATED BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD RESULT FROM ANY DEREGULATION, SUCH AS A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED COSTS TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT CUSTOMERS UPON DEREGULATION, ADJUSTMENTS TO IPL S ACCOUNTING RECORDS MAY BE REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE HISTORICAL IMPACT OF REGULATORY ACCOUNTING. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS, AS REQUIRED BY FASB ASC 980 REGULATED OPERATIONS, COULD ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF ANY ACTIONS OF REGULATORS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS COULD INCLUDE THE EXPENSING OF ANY UNAMORTIZED NET REGULATORY ASSETS, THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES, AND A WRITE DOWN OF ANY IMPAIRED UTILITY PLANT BALANCES. WE EXPECT IPL TO MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THE APPLICATION OF ASC 980 FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, AUDITS, SETTLEMENTS, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO ADDRESS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. ASBESTOS AND OTHER REGULATED SUBSTANCES ARE, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, PRESENT AT OUR FACILITIES, AND WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ASBESTOS LITIGATION. THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF ASBESTOS AND OTHER REGULATED SUBSTANCES AT THESE FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION BEING BROUGHT AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. PLEASE SEE NOTE 2, REGULATORY MATTERS AND NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY MATTERS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING US. 
 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A QUALIFIED AND PROPERLY MOTIVATED WORKFORCE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS TO RETAIN A SKILLED, EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE WHILE RECRUITING NEW TALENT TO REPLACE LOSSES IN KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS DUE TO RESIGNATIONS, TERMINATIONS OR RETIREMENTS. THIS UNDERTAKING COULD REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AND INCUR INCREASED COSTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN AN APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED WORKFORCE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT REWARD THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES. WE SEEK TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMPENSATION PLANS ENCOURAGE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS FOR RISK AND HIGH PERFORMANCE THROUGH PAY MIX, PERFORMANCE METRICS AND TIMING. WE ALSO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MITIGATE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING BY EMPLOYEES SINCE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING BY OUR EMPLOYEES TO ACHIEVE PERFORMANCE TARGETS COULD RESULT IN EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 

31 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A UNION. APPROXIMATELY 69 OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY A UNION IN TWO BARGAINING UNITS: A PHYSICAL UNIT AND A CLERICAL-TECHNICAL UNIT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EMPLOYEES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LABOR DISRUPTIONS AFFECTING SOME OR ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS COULD OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS OR AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BEFORE NEW AGREEMENTS ARE NEGOTIATED. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRAIN NEW PERSONNEL AS CURRENT WORKERS WITH SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE RETIRE. WORK STOPPAGES BY, OR POOR RELATIONS OR INEFFECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH, OUR EMPLOYEES OR OTHER WORKFORCE ISSUES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACHES (INCLUDING CYBER-SECURITY BREACHES) AND TERRORISM RISKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY THAT REQUIRES THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR GENERATION STATIONS, FUEL STORAGE FACILITIES AND TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. WE ALSO USE VARIOUS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER SYSTEMS IN OUR BUSINESSES. THESE SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES ARE VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DUE TO HACKING, VIRUSES, OTHER CYBER-SECURITY ATTACKS AND OTHER CAUSES. IN PARTICULAR, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY AND THE ELECTRIC GRID, THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES COULD BE TARGETS OF TERRORISM OR ACTS OF WAR. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MEASURES TO HELP PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING NETWORK AND SYSTEM MONITORING, IDENTIFICATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF SECURE TECHNOLOGIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER MEASURES TO COMPLY WITH MANDATORY REGULATORY RELIABILITY STANDARDS. PURSUANT TO NERC REQUIREMENTS, WE HAVE A ROBUST CYBER-SECURITY PLAN IN PLACE AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR AUDITS BY AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR APPROVED BY NERC. WE ROUTINELY TEST OUR SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES AGAINST THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO MEASURE COMPLIANCE, ASSESS POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS, AND IDENTIFY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CYBER-SECURITY TRAINING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND PERFORM EXERCISES DESIGNED TO RAISE EMPLOYEE AWARENESS OF CYBER RISKS ON A REGULAR BASIS. TO DATE, CYBER-ATTACKS ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, IF OUR SYSTEMS OR FACILITIES WERE TO BE BREACHED OR DISABLED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RECOVER THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER TO FULFILL CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN REVENUES AND INCREASES IN COSTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IN THE COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ALSO STORE AND USE CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE, AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IF OUR OR OUR THIRD-PARTY VENDORS SYSTEMS WERE TO BE BREACHED OR DISABLED, SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA COULD BE COMPROMISED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, REMEDIATION COSTS AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION, DAMAGES, CONSENT ORDERS, INJUNCTIONS, FINES AND OTHER RELIEF. 
 
 TO HELP MITIGATE THESE RISKS, WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE AGAINST SOME, BUT NOT ALL, POTENTIAL LOSSES, INCLUDING COVERAGE FOR ILLEGAL ACTS AGAINST US. HOWEVER, INSURANCE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PROTECT US AGAINST ALL COSTS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS. 
 
 IPALCO IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND PARENT OF IPL AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IPALCO S CASH FLOW IS DEPENDENT ON OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF IPL AND ITS ABILITY TO PAY CASH TO IPALCO. 
 
 IPALCO IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH NO MATERIAL ASSETS OTHER THAN THE COMMON STOCK OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ACCORDINGLY ALL CASH IS GENERATED BY THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, PRINCIPALLY IPL. AS SUCH, IPALCO S CASH FLOW IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF IPL AND ITS ABILITY TO PAY CASH TO IPALCO. IPL S MORTGAGE AND DEED OF TRUST, ITS AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND UNSECURED NOTES CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON IPL S ABILITY TO ISSUE CERTAIN SECURITIES OR PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO IPALCO. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS THAT REQUIRE MAINTENANCE OF A LEVERAGE RATIO WHICH COULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF IPL TO PAY DIVIDENDS. SEE ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE RESTRICTIONS. SEE NOTE 7, DEBT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, IPL IS REGULATED BY THE IURC, WHICH POSSESSES BROAD OVERSIGHT POWERS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF UTILITY CUSTOMERS ARE BEING MET. THE IURC COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF IPL TO DISTRIBUTE, LOAN OR ADVANCE CASH TO IPALCO PURSUANT TO THESE BROAD POWERS. WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY OF THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT IPL S ABILITY TO PAY FUNDS TO IPALCO IN THE FUTURE, A 
 
 32 

SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION ON IPL S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR LOAN OR ADVANCE FUNDS TO IPALCO WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON IPALCO S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 TAX LEGISLATION INITIATIVES OR CHALLENGES TO OUR TAX POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, LEGISLATIVE MEASURES MAY BE ENACTED THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OVERALL TAX POSITIONS REGARDING INCOME OR OTHER TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OR TAX PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES. 
 
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED TAX REFORM IN 2017 THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCES U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES, IMPOSES LIMITS ON TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND CHANGES THE RULES RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COST RECOVERY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES AND AMBIGUITIES AS TO THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEWLY ENACTED TAX REFORM MEASURE. GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THESE POSSIBLE CHANGES AND THEIR POTENTIAL INTERDEPENDENCY, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE OVERALL EFFECT SUCH TAX CHANGES WILL HAVE ON OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS THE IMPACTS OF THE NEW LAW ARE DETERMINED, AND AS YET-TO-BE RELEASED REGULATIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE INTERPRETING THE NEW LAW ARE ISSUED AND FINALIZED, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 
 
 IN ADDITION, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS WILL BE SUSTAINED IF CHALLENGED BY RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES AND IF NOT SUSTAINED, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OUR OWNERSHIP BY AES SUBJECTS US TO POTENTIAL RISKS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 
 
 ALL OF IPL S COMMON STOCK IS OWNED BY IPALCO, ALL OF WHOSE COMMON STOCK IS OWNED BY AES U.S. INVESTMENTS (82.35 AND CDPQ (17.65 ). DUE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AES, ANY ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS CONCERNING AES MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND TO OTHERWISE CONDUCT BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, DOWNGRADES IN AES S CREDIT RATINGS COULD RESULT IN IPL S OR IPALCO S CREDIT RATINGS BEING DOWNGRADED.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

WE HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT
WHETHER, OR TO WHAT EXTENT, ANY OF SUCH RISKS MAY BE REALIZED
NOR CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE RISKS
THAT MIGHT ARISE.

8

WE ARE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL FINANCING.

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO COMPLETE
OUR OPERATIONAL PLAN TO PROMOTE AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR NEWLY
ACQUIRED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ACTIVITIES. WE WILL ALSO
REQUIRE FUNDS TO SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IF WE ARE NOT
SUCCESSFUL IN EARNING REVENUES FROM OUR PRODUCT SALES AND SUB-
LICENSING. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING
OF 8,000,000 TO PURSUE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IF WE ARE UNABLE
TO OBTAIN EQUITY FINANCING UPON TERMS THAT OUR MANAGEMENT DEEMS
SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE, OR AT ALL, IT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE IMPACT UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR CURRENT
OPERATIONAL PLAN. ANY SALE OF SHARE CAPITAL WILL RESULT IN
DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS.

TO DATE, WE HAVE GENERATED SOME REVENUES FROM SALES BUT NOT
ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR
BUSINESS DEPENDS ON US RECEIVING INVENTORY AND ADVERTISING
MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS. THE EXACT
AMOUNT OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL
DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN OUR
CONTROL, INCLUDING THE PROGRESS OF OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, THE
COSTS OF TESTING, SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS, DEMAND OF OUR
PRODUCTS AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. OUR ABILITY
TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FINANCING DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS BEYOND
OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE STATE OF CAPITAL MARKETS, THE MARKET
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE DEVELOPMENT OR PROSPECTS FOR
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY BY OTHERS. THE NECESSARY
ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US OR MAY BE
AVAILABLE ONLY ON TERMS THAT WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DILUTION
TO THE CURRENT OWNERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN WE NEED THEM, WE MAY HAVE TO
CURTAIL OR DISCONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD
LOSE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY.

WE ARE IN OUR EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND FACE A RISK OF
BUSINESS FAILURE.

9

WE ARE IN OUR EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE NO WAY TO
EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE OUR
BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY. THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS MUST BE
CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES,
COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TECHNOLOGY AND SALES INDUSTRIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE ARE
UNABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR SALES, WE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO EARN PROFITS OR CONTINUE OPERATIONS. THERE IS
ONLY A LIMITED HISTORY UPON WHICH TO BASE ANY ASSUMPTION AS TO
THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE CAN
PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL GENERATE ANY
ADDITIONAL OPERATING REVENUES OR EVER ACHIEVE PROFITABLE
OPERATIONS FROM OUR CURRENT BUSINESS INITIATIVES. IF WE ARE
UNSUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING THESE RISKS, OUR BUSINESS WILL MOST
LIKELY FAIL.

WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST LARGER AND BETTER-FINANCED COMPANIES.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH FINANCIAL
REWARDS PENDING ON MARKET PERFORMANCE. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS
ARE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ENTERPRISES WITH MORE RESOURCES FOR
MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND DEVELOPMENT. WE MAY BE IN A
DISADVANTAGE IF ANY OF OUR COMPETITORS FOCUSED ON SIMILAR
PRODUCTS WE SELL. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND
PERSONNEL IN PLACE TO ADEQUATELY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS
AND OPERATIONS, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL.

OUR BUSINESS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE HARMED IF
WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR BRAND IMAGE.
OUR SUCCESS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF
OUR WATAIRE BRANDED LINES OF ATMOSPHERIC WATER GENERATORS. IF
WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO CHANGING
CONSUMER DEMAND, THE BRAND WATAIRE DISTRIBUTES MAY BE IMPAIRED.
EVEN IF WE REACT APPROPRIATELY TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER
PREFERENCES, CONSUMERS MAY CONSIDER THOSE BRAND IMAGES TO BE
OUTDATED. LACK OF ACCEPTANCE OF OUR BRANDS WILL HAVE A
MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY.

DEPENDENCE ON OUR SUPPLIERS

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED SUPPORT AND
SERVICES OF SUPPLIERS. WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR
SUPPORT TO PROVIDE ENOUGH INVENTORY TO MEET OUR PURCHASE
ORDERS. IF OUR SUPPLIERS ARE NOT ABLE TO MANUFACTURE ENOUGH
PRODUCTS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS, OUR
BUSINESS WILL MOST LIKELY FAIL.
DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY FAIL TO MATERIALIZE

10

OUR GROWTH AND SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR SUCCESS IN
INTRODUCING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. THE MARKET FOR THE
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PLAN TO OFFER IS RELATIVELY NEW AND
THERE IS LITTLE HARD DATA TO VALIDATE MARKET DEMAND OR PREDICT
HOW THIS DEMAND WILL BE SEGMENTED. THERE COULD BE MUCH LOWER
DEMAND THAN BELIEVED, OR INTEREST IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
COULD DECLINE OR DIE OUT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS.

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A
GOING CONCERN

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2009
SHOW SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN WHICH
CONTEMPLATES THE COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY HAS
SOUGHT OUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE
AS A GOING CONCERN WITHOUT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE
NECESSARY IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING
CONCERN.

OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, GRUBER & COMPANY LLC, HAVE EXPRESSED
SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING
CONCERN GIVEN OUR RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET
STOCKHOLDER'S DEFICIT. THIS OPINION COULD MATERIALLY LIMIT OUR
ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING NEW DEBT OR EQUITY
SECURITIES OR OTHERWISE.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF
ROBERT ROSNER, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. IF HE WERE TO
LEAVE US THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE ENTERING INTO EMPLOYMENT
CONTRACT WITH MR. ROSNER BUT CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE
WILL COME TO TERMS FOR SUCH EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.

OUR BUSINESS ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STAFF IN ALL AREAS TO
SUCCESSFULLY BRING OUR PRODUCTS TO MARKET. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS
ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL WITH EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN THE TECHNOLOGY
FIELD. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED
TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, WE WILL SUFFER DIMINISHED
CHANCES OF FUTURE SUCCESS.

11

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAIM IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT WORK AS PROMISED FROM OUR
INVENTOR(S) AND PREDECESSOR

THE ATMOSPHERIC WATER GENERATORS ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE
POTABLE SAFE DRINKING WATER. IF THE TECHNOLOGY FAILS TO WORK AS
MANUFACTURED BY OUR INVENTOR(S) AND PREDECESSOR, CUSTOMERS MAY
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US. DESPITE LIMITATIONS ON SUCH CLAIMS,
SUCH CLAIMS CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING WHICH COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS, EVEN IF WE ARE FOUND
NOT TO HAVE BEEN AT FAULT. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE LIABILITY
INSURANCE AND ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SEEK SOME COVERAGE IN THE
FUTURE IF SUCH COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE COST.

SIGNIFICANT REPAIR AND/OR REPLACEMENT WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT
WARRANTY CLAIMS OR PRODUCT RECALLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE PROVIDE A LIMITED WARRANTY FOR OUR PRODUCTS FOR A PERIOD OF
ONE YEAR. SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

REGULATION BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,
CANADA AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY BE A FACTOR IN THE
DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND IN
OUR RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE PROCESS OF
OBTAINING THESE APPROVALS AND THE SUBSEQUENT COMPLIANCE MAY
REQUIRE TIME AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES.

LIMITED EXPERIENCE TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS

EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS AND OBTAIN THE
NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE OR
CAPABILITIES IN MARKETING OR COMMERCIALIZING OUR PRODUCTS. WE
CURRENTLY HAVE SOME SALES AND JUST ENGAGED A MARKETING AGENCY.
 WE DO NOT HAVE A DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE.
ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND
COLLABORATIVE MARKETING PARTNERS OR CONTRACT SALES COMPANIES
FOR COMMERCIAL SALE OF ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. EVEN IF WE FIND A
POTENTIAL MARKETING PARTNER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN
ADVERTISING AND/OR LICENSING CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS TO
JUSTIFY OUR INVESTMENT OR ACHIEVE ADEQUATE REVENUES.

12

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFSHORE
MANUFACTURING.

WE IMPORT SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS INTO THE UNITED STATES AND
CANADA FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR RESALE. ALL OF OUR IMPORT
OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO TARIFFS AND QUOTAS SET BY THE U.S.
AND OTHER COUNTRIES' GOVERNMENTS THROUGH MUTUAL AGREEMENTS OR
BILATERAL ACTIONS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THESE IMPORT COSTS AND
RESTRICTIONS, OR OUR SUPPLIERS' FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMS
REGULATIONS OR SIMILAR LAWS, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.
OUR OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL
TRADE AGREEMENTS AND REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE NORTH AMERICAN
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT, THE CARIBBEAN BASIN INITIATIVE AND THE
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT, AND THE ACTIVITIES AND
REGULATIONS OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. TRADE AGREEMENTS
CAN ALSO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS, SUCH AS SETTING QUOTAS ON PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE
IMPORTED FROM A PARTICULAR COUNTRY INTO OUR KEY MARKET, THE
UNITED STATES. IN FACT, SOME TRADE AGREEMENTS CAN PROVIDE OUR
COMPETITORS WITH AN ADVANTAGE OVER US, OR INCREASE OUR COSTS,
EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION, THE RECENT ELIMINATION OF QUOTAS ON WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION MEMBER COUNTRIES BY 2005 COULD RESULT IN INCREASED
COMPETITION FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE
LOWER LABOR COSTS, INCLUDING CHINA. THIS INCREASED COMPETITION,
INCLUDING FROM COMPETITORS WHO CAN QUICKLY CREATE COST AND
SOURCING ADVANTAGES FROM THESE CHANGES IN TRADE ARRANGEMENTS,
COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION.

OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE
MANNER MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY PROBLEMS AT PORTS OR ISSUES THAT
OTHERWISE AFFECT TRANSPORTATION AND WAREHOUSING PROVIDERS, SUCH
AS LABOR DISPUTES OR INCREASED U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY
REQUIREMENTS. THESE ISSUES COULD DELAY IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS
OR REQUIRE US TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE PORTS OR WAREHOUSING
PROVIDERS TO AVOID DISRUPTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE
ALTERNATIVES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON SHORT NOTICE OR COULD
RESULT IN HIGHER TRANSIT COSTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE
IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

13

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC
AND CURRENCY RISKS.
ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS CAME FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED
STATES. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING
BUSINESS ABROAD, INCLUDING:

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS;

CHANGES IN TARIFFS AND TAXES;

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY; AND

DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS.

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT THE RELATIVE
PRICES AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND MAY
AFFECT THE COST OF CERTAIN ITEMS REQUIRED IN OUR OPERATION,
THUS POSSIBLY ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR PROFITABILITY.

THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS
INTERNATIONALLY. LANGUAGE BARRIERS, FOREIGN LAWS AND CUSTOMS
AND DUTIES ISSUES ALL HAVE A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR
ABILITY TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY BE
SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND/OR PRIVATE
LITIGANTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE TRANSACT BUSINESS, AND
WE MAY BE FORCED TO EXPEND FUNDS TO CONTEST LEGAL MATTERS IN
THOSE COUNTRIES IN DISPUTES WITH THOSE GOVERNMENTS OR WITH
CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS.
WE MAY SUFFER FROM INFRINGEMENTS OR PIRACY OF OUR TRADEMARKS,
DESIGNS, BRANDS OR PRODUCTS.
WE MAY SUFFER FROM INFRINGEMENTS OR PIRACY OF OUR TRADEMARKS,
DESIGNS, BRANDS OR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. OR GLOBALLY. SOME
JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT HONOR OUR CLAIMS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT LEGAL
RESOURCES TO POLICE OR ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS IN SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES.

UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES OR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZATION MAY IMPACT
OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE PROFITABLY.
IN AN EFFORT TO PENETRATE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY
COMPETES, SOME COMPETITORS MAY SELL PRODUCTS AT VERY LOW
MARGINS, OR BELOW COST, FOR SUSTAINED PERIODS OF TIME IN ORDER
TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND SALES. ADDITIONALLY, SOME COMPETITORS
MAY ENJOY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO
COMPETE AT SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICES. THESE EVENTS COULD
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCT AT
PROFITABLE PRICES.

14

IF WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE
WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO EXPORT
REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS, AND MARKETING
OF THE PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTORSHIPS, AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO
THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE MARKETS, ALL OF
WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COST OF SELLING PRODUCTS AND
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN
FOREIGN MARKETS.

AS A PART OF OUR MARKETING STRATEGY, WE PLAN TO MARKET AND SELL
OUR PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY. IN ADDITION TO REGULATION BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT, THOSE PRODUCTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH
WE MARKET AND SELL. REGULATIONS WILL VARY FROM COUNTRY TO
COUNTRY AND WILL VARY FROM THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE
DIFFERENCE IN REGULATIONS UNDER U.S. LAW AND THE LAWS OF
FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND, IN ORDER TO COMPLY
WITH THE LAWS OF THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE MAY HAVE TO
IMPLEMENT MANUFACTURING CHANGES OR ALTER PRODUCT DESIGN OR
MARKETING EFFORTS. ANY CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR
PRODUCTS WILL REQUIRE RESPONSE TO THE LAWS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES
AND WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATIONS OR
APPROVALS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO MARKET AND SELL THE
PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO
OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO EXPORT THE
PRODUCTS. IF WE ARE DELAYED IN RECEIVING, OR ARE UNABLE TO
OBTAIN IMPORT OR EXPORT CLEARANCES, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
COMPLY WITH FOREIGN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE UNABLE
TO EXECUTE OUR COMPLETE MARKETING STRATEGY.

CAUTIONARY
 STATEMENTS RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

WE HAVE MADE, IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON
 FORM 10-K, 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS RELATING TO DEVELOPMENTS, RESULTS,
 CONDITIONS OR OTHER EVENTS WE EXPECT OR ANTICIPATE WILL OCCUR.
 THESE STATEMENTS MAY RELATE TO REVENUES, EARNINGS, STORE
 OPENINGS, BUSINESS STRATEGY, MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE
 COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. THE WORDS BELIEVE, 
 MAY, WILL, ESTIMATE, 
 INTEND, EXPECT, ANTICIPATE, 
 PLAN AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS AS THEY RELATE TO THE
 COMPANY, OR FUTURE OR CONDITIONAL VERBS, SUCH AS
 WILL, SHOULD, WOULD, 
 MAY AND COULD, ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED
 ON MANAGEMENT S THEN-CURRENT VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WE
 UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THEM. FORWARD-LOOKING
 STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND ACTUAL
 RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED.

AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES CARRIES CERTAIN RISKS. INVESTORS
 SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND OTHER
 RISKS WHICH MAY BE DISCLOSED IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC BEFORE
 INVESTING IN OUR SECURITIES.

WE CONDUCT OUR
 OPERATIONS IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT WHICH
 COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WE COMPETE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENT STORES AND MANY OTHER
 RETAILERS, INCLUDING STORE-BASED, MAIL-ORDER AND INTERNET
 RETAILERS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL
 AND MARKETING RESOURCES. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN
 OUR BUSINESS ARE PRICE, QUALITY AND SELECTION OF MERCHANDISE,
 REPUTATION, STORE LOCATION, ADVERTISING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE
 CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY
 AGAINST EXISTING OR FUTURE COMPETITORS. OUR EXPANSION INTO

8

NEW MARKETS SERVED BY OUR COMPETITORS AND THE ENTRY OF NEW
 COMPETITORS INTO, OR EXPANSION OF EXISTING COMPETITORS IN, OUR
 MARKETS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY NOT BE
 ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT CUSTOMER-BASED TRENDS AND EFFECTIVELY
 MANAGE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS. 

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT MERCHANDISE CONSUMERS WILL WANT.
 A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY
 TO MAKE CORRECT TREND DECISIONS. FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT
 CONSTANTLY CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, SPENDING PATTERNS AND OTHER
 LIFESTYLE DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LONG LEAD TIMES FOR
 ORDERING MUCH OF OUR MERCHANDISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR MANAGERS FOCUS
 ON INVENTORY LEVELS AND BALANCE THESE LEVELS WITH INVENTORY
 PLANS AND REVIEWS OF TRENDS; HOWEVER, IF OUR INVENTORIES BECOME
 TOO LARGE, WE MAY HAVE TO MARK DOWN OR DECREASE OUR
 SALES PRICES, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL A SIGNIFICANT
 AMOUNT OF UNSOLD INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED PRICES OR EVEN BELOW
 COST.

GENERAL ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, INCLUDING SPENDING FOR THE MERCHANDISE
 THAT WE SELL, ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVAILING
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, SALARIES AND WAGE
 RATES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT TERMS, HOUSING
 COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, INCOME TAX RATES AND POLICIES, INFLATION,
 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER PURCHASING PATTERNS MAY BE
 INFLUENCED BY CONSUMERS DISPOSABLE INCOME, CREDIT
 AVAILABILITY AND DEBT LEVELS. A CONTINUED OR INCREMENTAL
 SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY OR AN UNCERTAIN
 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING
 HABITS, RESULTING IN LOWER NET SALES AND PROFITS, INCLUDING THE
 POTENTIAL WRITE-DOWN OF THE CURRENT VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE
 ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

WEATHER
 CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS. 

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS APPAREL SALES
 AND SUBJECT TO WEATHER CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS, OUR OPERATING
 RESULTS MAY BE UNEXPECTEDLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCLEMENT
 WEATHER. FREQUENT OR UNUSUALLY HEAVY SNOW, ICE OR RAIN STORMS
 MIGHT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO TRAVEL TO OUR
 STORES AND THEREBY REDUCE OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. EXTENDED
 PERIODS OF UNSEASONABLE TEMPERATURES IN OUR MARKETS, POTENTIALLY
 DURING OUR PEAK SEASONS, COULD RENDER A PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY
 INCOMPATIBLE WITH THOSE UNSEASONABLE CONDITIONS, REDUCE SALES
 AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

FAILURE TO
 SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN AND UPDATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
 AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 BUSINESS. 

TO KEEP PACE WITH CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY
 PROVIDE FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW INFORMATION
 TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS ENHANCEMENTS OF OUR EXISTING
 SYSTEMS. ANY FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MAINTAIN AND UPDATE THE
 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS SUPPORTING OUR SALES OPERATIONS
 OR INVENTORY CONTROL COULD PREVENT US FROM PROCESSING AND
 DELIVERING MERCHANDISE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

9

OUR STOCK PRICE
 HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE
 TO BE VOLATILE AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY:

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS;

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS;

DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO CONDITIONS AND TRENDS IN OUR
 INDUSTRY;

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION;

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS; AND

OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

FAILURE TO
 MAINTAIN KEY VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS. 

OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UPON CLOSE
 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR VENDORS AND OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE BRAND
 NAME MERCHANDISE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES AND TERMS. THE LOSS OF
 KEY VENDOR SUPPORT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
 ACQUIRE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES OR ON
 COMPETITIVE TERMS IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN
 MERCHANDISE THAT IS HIGH PROFILE AND IN HIGH DEMAND MAY BE
 ALLOCATED BY VENDORS BASED UPON THE VENDORS INTERNAL
 CRITERIA, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

OUR BUSINESS IS
 SEASONAL. 

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES, WITH A MAJOR
 PORTION OF SALES AND INCOME HISTORICALLY REALIZED DURING THE
 SECOND HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES THE
 BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SEASONS. THIS SEASONALITY CAUSES OUR
 OPERATING RESULTS TO VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER
 AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR
 COMMON STOCK. WE MUST CARRY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVENTORY,
 ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE PEAK SELLING PERIODS. IF WE ARE NOT
 SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING OUR INVENTORY, ESPECIALLY DURING OUR PEAK
 SELLING PERIODS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO RELY ON MARKDOWNS, VENDOR
 SUPPORT OR PROMOTIONAL SALES TO DISPOSE OF THE INVENTORY OR WE
 MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE INVENTORY AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR SUBSTANTIAL
 DEBT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2008, WE HAD TOTAL DEBT OF APPROXIMATELY
 1.2 BILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AND
 FINANCIAL COVENANTS. THIS COULD HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES TO
 OUR INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD:

INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND
 INDUSTRY CONDITIONS;

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY OR SELL EQUITY TO FUND FUTURE
 WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE
 REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE REQUIREMENTS;

REQUIRE US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW
 FROM OPERATIONS TO PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT, THEREBY REDUCING OUR
 ABILITY TO USE OUR CASH FLOW FOR OTHER PURPOSES, INCLUDING
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES;

LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES
 IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE RETAIL INDUSTRY;

10

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE
 OBLIGATIONS IN THE EVENT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN
 INTEREST RATES BECAUSE THE DEBT UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT
 FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT FLUCTUATING RATES;

RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF INVESTMENTS, PAY
 DIVIDENDS, OR SELL ALL OF OUR ASSETS OR MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE
 WITH ANOTHER COMPANY; AND

PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR
 COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS DEBT.

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT DEPENDS UPON, AMONG OTHER
 THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO REPLENISH INVENTORY AT COMPETITIVE PRICES
 AND TERMS, GENERATE SALES AND MAINTAIN OUR STORES. IF WE DO NOT
 GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FROM OUR OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT
 OBLIGATIONS, WE WILL NEED TO TAKE ONE OR MORE ACTIONS, INCLUDING
 REFINANCING OUR DEBT, OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, SELLING
 ASSETS, OBTAINING ADDITIONAL EQUITY CAPITAL, OR REDUCING OR
 DELAYING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR
 EARNINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL AND
 INTEREST ON OUR DEBT AND MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. DEBT UNDER
 OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT A FLOATING
 RATE, A PORTION OF WHICH IS OFFSET BY FIXED-RATE SWAP
 DERIVATIVES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES
 MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. A
 HIGHER INTEREST RATE ON OUR DEBT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 OPERATING RESULTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE
 OBLIGATIONS OR IF WE DEFAULT IN SOME OTHER MANNER UNDER OUR
 CREDIT FACILITIES, OUR LENDERS COULD ELECT TO DECLARE ALL
 BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING, TOGETHER WITH ACCUMULATED AND UNPAID
 INTEREST AND OTHER FEES, IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE, WHICH
 WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DISCRETION IN
 SOME MATTERS IS LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR
 SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND MORTGAGE LOAN FACILITY
 AGREEMENTS AND IN THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS OUR SENIOR
 UNSECURED NOTES, AND ANY DEFAULT ON OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT
 FACILITY, MORTGAGE LOAN FACILITY OR THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS
 THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS,
 PROFITABILITY AND GROWTH PROSPECTS. 

THE AGREEMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY
 AND MORTGAGE LOAN FACILITY, AND THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS OUR
 SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, CONTAIN A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT LIMIT
 THE DISCRETION OF OUR MANAGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN
 BUSINESS MATTERS AND MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO
 CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE SENIOR SECURED
 CREDIT FACILITY, THE MORTGAGE LOAN FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE,
 AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO:

INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT OR ISSUE GUARANTEES OF DEBT;

SELL PREFERRED STOCK;

CREATE LIENS;

MAKE RESTRICTED PAYMENTS (INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS OR
 THE REPURCHASE OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK);

MAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF INVESTMENTS;

SELL STOCK IN OUR RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES;

PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE PAYMENTS FROM SUBSIDIARIES;

ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND

SELL ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS OR MERGE OR
 CONSOLIDATE WITH ANOTHER COMPANY.

OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS
 THAT REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH A MINIMUM EXCESS AVAILABILITY
 REQUIREMENT. OUR ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS FOR ANY PURPOSE DEPENDS
 ON OUR SATISFYING THIS REQUIREMENT.

11

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS OR THE
 OTHER RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT
 FACILITY OR ANY FUTURE FINANCING AGREEMENTS, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT
 COULD OCCUR. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT COULD RESULT IN THE
 ACCELERATION OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR DEBT. IF THE DEBT IS
 ACCELERATED, WE WOULD NOT HAVE, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN,
 SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO REPAY OUR DEBT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
 ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS.

THE LOSS OF THE
 OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT OPERATES OUR PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD
 PROGRAMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 OPERATIONS. 

OUR PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED, UNDER
 AGREEMENTS, BY HSBC. HSBC ISSUES OUR PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARDS TO
 OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE RECEIVE A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET CREDIT
 SALES THEREUNDER. IF HSBC IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE OUR PROPRIETARY
 CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS, OR OUR AGREEMENTS WITH HSBC ARE
 TERMINATED, IN EITHER CASE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE ARE
 UNABLE TO QUICKLY AND ADEQUATELY CONTRACT WITH A COMPARABLE
 REPLACEMENT VENDOR, OUR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE ACCOUNTS UNDER OUR
 PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS WILL BE UNABLE TO USE THEIR
 CARDS, WHICH WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN SALES TO SUCH
 CUSTOMERS, A LOSS OF THE REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PAYMENTS
 FROM HSBC, AND AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CUSTOMER GOODWILL, ANY OR
 ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS
 COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED IF WE CANNOT RETAIN OR REPLACE
 MEMBERS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM. 

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UPON THE CONTINUED
 CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL,
 BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A GROUP. OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WILL BE
 SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN OR REPLACE OUR
 KEY PERSONNEL AND THE INABILITY TO RETAIN OR REPLACE OUR KEY
 PERSONNEL COULD PREVENT US FROM EXECUTING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

CURRENT STORE
 LOCATIONS MAY BECOME LESS DESIRABLE, AND DESIRABLE NEW LOCATIONS
 MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, IF AT
 ALL. 

THE SUCCESS OF ANY STORE DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY UPON ITS
 LOCATION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT LOCATIONS WILL
 CONTINUE TO BE DESIRABLE AS DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS CHANGE.
 NEIGHBORHOOD OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHERE STORES ARE LOCATED
 COULD DECLINE IN THE FUTURE, THUS RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY
 REDUCED SALES IN THOSE LOCATIONS. IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN DESIRABLE
 LOCATIONS AT REASONABLE PRICES OUR COST STRUCTURE WILL INCREASE
 AND OUR REVENUES WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AN INABILITY TO
 FIND QUALIFIED DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL VENDORS AND
 FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE WITH COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR
 INTERNATIONAL VENDORS ARE LOCATED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 BUSINESS. 

THE PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC
 AND INTERNATIONAL VENDORS. OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED VENDORS
 AND SOURCE PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER,
 INCLUDING OBTAINING VENDOR ALLOWANCES IN SUPPORT OF OUR
 ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS, REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT
 CHALLENGE. THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND THE ULTIMATE COSTS
 OF BUYING AND SELLING THESE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND
 PROMOTIONAL COSTS, ARE NOT COMPLETELY WITHIN OUR CONTROL AND
 COULD INCREASE OUR MERCHANDISE AND OPERATING COSTS.
 ADDITIONALLY, COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS SPECIFIC TO IMPORTED
 MERCHANDISE, SUCH AS TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY
 EXCHANGE RATES AND TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COSTS, ARE BEYOND OUR
 CONTROL AND COULD RESTRICT THE AVAILABILITY OF

12

IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COSTS OF OUR
 MERCHANDISE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONDITIONS IN,
 AND THE UNITED STATES RELATIONSHIP WITH, THE FOREIGN
 COUNTRIES WHERE WE SOURCE OUR MERCHANDISE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
 OUR BUSINESS. 

A MAJORITY OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE
 UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN INDIA AND THE FAR EAST. POLITICAL
 INSTABILITY OR OTHER EVENTS RESULTING IN THE DISRUPTION OF TRADE
 FROM THE COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MERCHANDISE IS MANUFACTURED OR THE
 IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO, OR DUTIES
 UPON, THE MERCHANDISE WE IMPORT COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS
 OR INTERRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY OF OUR MERCHANDISE OR INCREASE
 OUR COSTS. IF WE ARE FORCED TO SOURCE MERCHANDISE FROM OTHER
 COUNTRIES, THOSE GOODS MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE OR OF A DIFFERENT
 OR INFERIOR QUALITY FROM THE MERCHANDISE WE NOW SELL. IF WE ARE
 UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY REPLACE THE MERCHANDISE WE CURRENTLY SOURCE
 WITH MERCHANDISE PRODUCED ELSEWHERE, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

A PRIVACY BREACH
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL
 CONDITION. 

THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE, AND COMPANY DATA IS
 CRITICAL TO US. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING
 INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY DEMANDING, WITH
 THE FREQUENT IMPOSITION OF NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING
 REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS HAVE A HIGH EXPECTATION
 THAT WE WILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. A
 SIGNIFICANT BREACH OF CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE, OR COMPANY DATA COULD
 DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, FINES, OR
 LAWSUITS.

WE MAY PURSUE
 STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES WHICH MAY NOT BE COMPLETED
 OR, IF COMPLETED, MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR
 EXISTING BUSINESS. 

WE MAY PURSUE INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION THROUGH STRATEGIC
 ACQUISITIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE
 ACQUISITIONS OR TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES,
 OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS OR TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS
 EFFECTIVELY COULD BE REDUCED, AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER. WE ALSO CANNOT
 PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE
 OPERATIONS OF ANY FUTURE COMPLETED STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
 WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING DIFFICULTY REGARDING DIFFERENT BUSINESS
 STRATEGIES WITH RESPECT TO MARKETING, INTEGRATION OF PERSONNEL
 WITH DISPARATE BUSINESS BACKGROUNDS AND CORPORATE CULTURES,
 INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS AND OTHER
 TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER BUSINESS
 PARTNERS.

THE CONSUMMATION AND INTEGRATION OF ANY FUTURE ACQUISITION
 INVOLVE MANY RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF:

DIVERTING MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OUR ONGOING BUSINESS
 CONCERNS;

BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US;

ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO DIRECT PRIOR EXPERIENCE;

IMPROPERLY EVALUATING NEW SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND MARKETS;

BEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN UNIFORM STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES
 AND POLICIES;

BEING UNABLE TO INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR PERSONNEL;

INCURRING THE EXPENSES OF ANY UNDISCLOSED OR POTENTIAL
 LIABILITIES; AND

THE DEPARTURE OF KEY MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.

13

OUR PENSION COSTS
 COULD INCREASE AT A HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED RATE. 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, DECREASES IN THE FAIR
 VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT LOSSES ON PLAN ASSETS COULD
 AFFECT THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS AND COULD INCREASE FUTURE
 FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENSION PLANS. A SIGNIFICANT
 INCREASE IN FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE
 IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS.

TIM GRUMBACHER
 HAS VOTING CONTROL OVER MATTERS SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF THE
 SHAREHOLDERS, AND HE MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH THE
 INTERESTS OF OUR OTHER SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF OUR DEBT
 SECURITIES. 

COLLECTIVELY, AS OF MARCH 28, 2008, TIM GRUMBACHER, TRUSTS
 FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. GRUMBACHER S GRANDCHILDREN AND
 THE GRUMBACHER FAMILY FOUNDATION BENEFICIALLY OWN SHARES OF OUR
 OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK (WHICH IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE PER
 SHARE) AND SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK (WHICH IS
 ENTITLED TO TEN VOTES PER SHARE) REPRESENTING, IN THE AGGREGATE,
 APPROXIMATELY 61 OF THE VOTES ELIGIBLE TO BE CAST BY
 SHAREHOLDERS IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND GENERALLY.
 ACCORDINGLY, MR. GRUMBACHER HAS THE POWER TO CONTROL ALL
 MATTERS REQUIRING THE APPROVAL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING
 THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND THE APPROVAL OF MERGERS AND OTHER
 SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. THE INTERESTS OF
 MR. GRUMBACHER AND CERTAIN OTHER STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONFLICT
 WITH THE INTERESTS OF OUR OTHER SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF OUR
 DEBT SECURITIES.

IN ADDITION TO
 MR. GRUMBACHER S VOTING CONTROL, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF
 OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND PENNSYLVANIA LAW COULD DISCOURAGE
 POTENTIAL ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND COULD DETER, DELAY OR
 PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY THAT OUR OTHER
 SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDER FAVORABLE AND COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET
 VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS,
 AS WELL AS PROVISIONS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA BUSINESS CORPORATION
 LAW, COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DETERRING TAKEOVERS OR DELAYING OR
 PREVENTING CHANGES IN CONTROL OR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY THAT
 OUR SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDER FAVORABLE AND COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET
 VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

SUBCHAPTER F OF CHAPTER 25 OF THE PENNSYLVANIA BUSINESS
 CORPORATION LAW OF 1988, WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO US, MAY HAVE AN
 ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECT AND MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A TENDER
 OFFER OR TAKEOVER ATTEMPT THAT A SHAREHOLDER MIGHT CONSIDER IN
 HIS OR HER BEST INTEREST. IN GENERAL, SUBCHAPTER F COULD DELAY
 FOR FIVE YEARS AND IMPOSE CONDITIONS UPON BUSINESS
 COMBINATIONS BETWEEN AN INTERESTED SHAREHOLDER 
 AND US, UNLESS PRIOR APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS
 GIVEN. THE TERM BUSINESS COMBINATION IS DEFINED
 BROADLY TO INCLUDE VARIOUS MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, DIVISION,
 EXCHANGE OR SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR
 ASSETS FOR PURCHASE PRICE AMORTIZATION OR REFINANCING PURPOSES.
 AN INTERESTED SHAREHOLDER, IN GENERAL, WOULD BE A
 BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES ENTITLING THAT PERSON TO CAST AT
 LEAST 20 OF THE VOTES THAT ALL SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE ENTITLED
 TO CAST IN AN ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.

DECEMBER 31, 2012, EXCLUDING THE BENEFITS OF THE TRANSITIONAL PHASE-IN PERIODS PROVIDED BY BASEL III. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT S UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASEL III PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES IN JUNE
2012 AND ON AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. IT ALSO REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATES OF PNC S RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS UNDER BASEL II (WITH THE MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED IN JUNE 2012) AND APPLICATION OF THE BASEL II.5 MARKET RISK
RULES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013. BOTH OUR BASEL II AND BASEL III ESTIMATES ARE POINT IN TIME ESTIMATES AND ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATORY GUIDANCE AND CLARITY, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT, REFINEMENT, VALIDATION AND REGULATORY

POLICY FOR SUBSIDIARY BANKS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS STATED THAT, AS A MATTER OF PRUDENT BANKING, A BANK HOLDING COMPANY GENERALLY SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN A RATE OF CASH DIVIDENDS UNLESS ITS NET
INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FULLY FUND THE DIVIDENDS AND THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION APPEARS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CORPORATION S CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION.
FURTHER, IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THE LARGE BHCS PARTICIPATING IN THE 2013 CCAR, DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE STATED THAT IT EXPECTS CAPITAL PLANS SUBMITTED IN 2013 WILL REFLECT CONSERVATIVE DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS AND NET SHARE REPURCHASE
PROGRAMS, AND THAT REQUESTS THAT IMPLY COMMON DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS ABOVE 30 OF PROJECTED AFTER-TAX NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE PARTICULARLY CLOSE SCRUTINY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO HAS STATED THAT IT EXPECTS BHCS THAT
MEET THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL III DURING THE TRANSITION PERIODS PROVIDED BY BASEL III, BUT THAT DO NOT MEET THE FULLY-PHASED IN BASEL III MINIMUM PLUS CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER RATIO OF 7 PERCENT TIER 1 COMMON (PLUS ANY
APPLICABLE CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS), TO MAINTAIN PRUDENT EARNINGS RETENTION POLICIES WITH A VIEW TO MEETING THIS STANDARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PHASE-IN SCHEDULE INCLUDED IN THE AGENCIES PROPOSED BASEL III
RULES. ADDITIONAL POWERS UNDER THE GLB ACT . THE GRAMM LEACH BLILEY ACT (GLB ACT) PERMITS A QUALIFYING BANK HOLDING
COMPANY TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND THEREBY ENGAGE IN, OR AFFILIATE WITH FINANCIAL COMPANIES ENGAGING IN, A BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE PERMITTED FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY. PERMITTED AFFILIATES
INCLUDE SECURITIES UNDERWRITERS AND DEALERS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE OR INCIDENTAL
THERETO OR ARE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNILATERALLY TO BE COMPLEMENTARY TO FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. WE BECAME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000. IN ORDER TO BE AND REMAIN A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, A
BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED. IN ADDITION, A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY GENERALLY MAY NOT ENGAGE IN A NEW FINANCIAL ACTIVITY IF ANY OF ITS INSURED
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RECEIVED A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY RATING AT ITS MOST RECENT EVALUATION UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA). 
 THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS THE UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WITH ITS OPERATING ENTITIES, SUCH AS ITS SUBSIDIARY
BROKER-DEALERS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, ALSO BEING SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE
 FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS WITH NORMAL REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPANIES IN THEIR LINES OF BUSINESS.

AS SUBSIDIARIES OF A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE GLB ACT, OUR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY
ALLOWED TO CONDUCT NEW FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES, AND PNC IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE LESS THAN 10 BILLION IN ASSETS, WITH AFTER-THE-FACT NOTICE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES
(AND ANY FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES OF SUBSIDIARY BANKS) ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT WERE NOT PERMITTED FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS PRIOR TO ENACTMENT OF THE GLB ACT, AND TO ENGAGE ON LESS RESTRICTIVE TERMS IN CERTAIN
ACTIVITIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PERMITTED. AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES, WE CURRENTLY RELY ON OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY TO CONDUCT MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES AND SECURITIES UNDERWRITING AND DEALING ACTIVITIES. 
 IN ADDITION, THE GLB ACT PERMITS NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS PNC BANK, N.A., TO ENGAGE IN EXPANDED ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A FINANCIAL
SUBSIDIARY. PNC BANK, N.A. HAS FILED A FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARY CERTIFICATION WITH THE OCC AND CURRENTLY ENGAGES IN INSURANCE AGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGH FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES. PNC BANK, N.A. MAY ALSO GENERALLY ENGAGE THROUGH A FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARY
IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE OR INCIDENTAL TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE. CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, ARE IMPERMISSIBLE FOR A FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARY
OF A NATIONAL BANK, INCLUDING CERTAIN INSURANCE UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES, INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT OR DEVELOPMENT, AND MERCHANT BANKING. OTHER FEDERAL RESERVE AND OCC REGULATION AND SUPERVISION . THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES POSSESS BROAD POWERS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR AN INSURED DEPOSITORY
INSTITUTION AND ITS HOLDING COMPANY. IN SOME CASES, THE EXTENT OF THESE POWERS DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE INSTITUTION IN QUESTION IS CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, 
 SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED OR CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. GENERALLY, THE SMALLER AN INSTITUTION S CAPITAL BASE IN RELATION TO ITS RISK-WEIGHTED OR TOTAL ASSETS, THE GREATER THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF THE
AGENCIES POWERS, ULTIMATELY PERMITTING THE AGENCIES TO APPOINT A RECEIVER FOR THE INSTITUTION. BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY AN INSTITUTION S CAPITAL CLASSIFICATION. FOR INSTANCE, ONLY A WELL CAPITALIZED 
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL AND AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS ONLY WITH PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, PNC
BANK, N.A. EXCEEDED THE REQUIRED RATIOS FOR CLASSIFICATION AS WELL CAPITALIZED. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, WE REFER YOU TO THE FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES PORTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW
SECTION OF ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT AND TO NOTE 22 REGULATORY MATTERS IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT. LAWS AND REGULATIONS LIMIT THE SCOPE OF OUR PERMITTED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. NATIONAL BANKS (SUCH AS PNC BANK,

N.A.) AND THEIR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY MAY ENGAGE ONLY IN ANY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE OCC TO BE PART OF OR INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS OF BANKING, ALTHOUGH A FINANCIAL
SUBSIDIARY MAY ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. MOREOVER, EXAMINATION RATINGS OF 3 OR LOWER, LOWER
CAPITAL RATIOS THAN PEER GROUP INSTITUTIONS, REGULATORY CONCERNS REGARDING MANAGEMENT, CONTROLS, ASSETS, OPERATIONS OR OTHER FACTORS, CAN ALL POTENTIALLY RESULT IN PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ENGAGE IN
NEW ACTIVITIES, GROW, ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES, REPURCHASE ITS STOCK OR PAY DIVIDENDS, OR TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT EXISTING ACTIVITIES. THE
FEDERAL RESERVE S PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED WHENEVER WE PROPOSE TO ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR THRIFT, TO ACQUIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF MORE THAN 5 OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SHARES OF ANY
BANK OR THRIFT, OR TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY OR THRIFT HOLDING COMPANY. THE BHC ACT ENUMERATES THE FACTORS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST CONSIDER WHEN REVIEWING THE MERGER OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES OR THE ACQUISITION OF
BANKS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSAL IN THE RELEVANT GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS; THE FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL RESOURCES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES AND BANKS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION; THE EFFECT OF THE
TRANSACTION ON FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES; THE ORGANIZATIONS COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND REGULATIONS; THE CONVENIENCE AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED; AND THE RECORDS OF PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CRA OF
THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION. IN CASES INVOLVING INTERSTATE BANK ACQUISITIONS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO MUST CONSIDER THE CONCENTRATION OF DEPOSITS NATIONWIDE AND IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL STATES. OCC PRIOR APPROVAL IS
REQUIRED FOR PNC BANK, N.A. TO ACQUIRE ANOTHER INSURED BANK OR THRIFT BY MERGER. IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE SUCH A TRANSACTION, THE OCC IS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER FACTORS SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. OUR ABILITY
TO GROW THROUGH ACQUISITIONS COULD BE LIMITED BY THESE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, PNC BANK, N.A. WAS RATED
 OUTSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO CRA. BECAUSE OF PNC S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BLACKROCK, BLACKROCK IS SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION
AND REGULATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FDIC INSURANCE . PNC BANK, N.A. IS INSURED BY THE FDIC AND SUBJECT TO PREMIUM
ASSESSMENTS. REGULATORY MATTERS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO AN INSURED BANK AS FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE RISK BASED. THEREFORE, HIGHER FEE PERCENTAGES WOULD BE CHARGED TO BANKS THAT HAVE LOWER
CAPITAL RATIOS OR HIGHER RISK PROFILES. THESE RISK PROFILES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WEAKNESSES THAT ARE FOUND BY THE PRIMARY BANKING REGULATOR THROUGH ITS EXAMINATION AND SUPERVISION OF THE BANK. A NEGATIVE

EVALUATION BY THE FDIC OR A BANK S PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR COULD INCREASE THE COSTS TO A BANK AND RESULT IN AN AGGREGATE COST OF DEPOSIT FUNDS HIGHER THAN THAT OF COMPETING BANKS
IN A LOWER RISK CATEGORY. UNDER DODD-FRANK, IN APRIL 2011, THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE BASE CALCULATION SHIFTED FROM DEPOSITS TO AVERAGE ASSETS LESS TIER 1 CAPITAL. THIS METHODOLOGY CHANGE DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE PREMIUMS DUE TO THE FDIC FOR PNC.
 CFPB REGULATION AND SUPERVISION . DODD-FRANK GIVES THE CFPB AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE PNC AND PNC BANK, N.A. FOR COMPLIANCE WITH A
BROAD RANGE OF FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT RELATE TO CREDIT CARD, DEPOSIT, MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK GIVES THE CFPB
BROAD AUTHORITY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AGAINST PNC BANK, N.A. AND PNC AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. THE CFPB ALSO HAS POWERS THAT IT WAS ASSIGNED IN DODD-FRANK TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TO PREVENT AND REMEDY ACTS AND PRACTICES
RELATING TO CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT IT DEEMS TO BE UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE. THE AGENCY ALSO HAS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR SERVICE. THESE AUTHORITIES ARE IN
ADDITION TO THE AUTHORITY THE CFPB ASSUMED ON JULY 21, 2011 UNDER EXISTING CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAW GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. S ECURITIES AND D ERIVATIVES R EGULATION OUR REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE SEC. SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND MAY PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES TO CLIENTS, OTHER PNC AFFILIATES OR RELATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING REGISTERED
INVESTMENT COMPANIES. CERTAIN OF THESE ADVISERS ARE REGISTERED AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS TO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS UNDER RULES ADOPTED UNDER DODD-FRANK. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, AND THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY
(FINRA) IS THE PRIMARY SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATION (SRO) FOR OUR REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES. INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED, AND THE REGULATIONS
THEREUNDER. AN INVESTMENT ADVISER TO A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED, AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. OUR BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES ALSO
ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY STATES OR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE SEC AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES
HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON THE MUTUAL FUND AND BROKER-DEALER INDUSTRIES. CONGRESS AND THE SEC HAVE ADOPTED

REGULATORY REFORMS AND ARE CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL REFORMS THAT HAVE INCREASED, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE, THE EXTENT OF REGULATION OF THE MUTUAL FUND AND BROKER-DEALER INDUSTRIES AND
IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND COSTS ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES INVOLVED WITH THOSE INDUSTRIES. UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND THEIR
SERVICE PROVIDERS, A DETERMINATION BY A COURT OR REGULATORY AGENCY THAT CERTAIN VIOLATIONS HAVE OCCURRED AT A COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES CAN RESULT IN FINES, RESTITUTION, A LIMITATION ON PERMITTED ACTIVITIES, DISQUALIFICATION TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND AN INABILITY TO RELY ON CERTAIN FAVORABLE EXEMPTIONS. CERTAIN TYPES OF INFRACTIONS AND VIOLATIONS CAN ALSO AFFECT A PUBLIC COMPANY IN ITS TIMING AND ABILITY TO EXPEDITIOUSLY ISSUE NEW SECURITIES INTO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. IN
ADDITION, CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF A BROKER-DEALER REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM FINRA, AND FINRA TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A VARIETY OF CONSIDERATIONS IN ACTING UPON APPLICATIONS FOR SUCH APPROVAL, INCLUDING INTERNAL CONTROLS, CAPITAL LEVELS,
MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND QUALITY, PRIOR ENFORCEMENT AND DISCIPLINARY HISTORY AND SUPERVISORY CONCERNS. TITLE VII OF DODD-FRANK IMPOSES NEW
COMPREHENSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT REGULATIONS ON THE ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE U.S. OVER-THE-COUNTER OTC DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS. TITLE VII WAS ENACTED TO (I) ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RISK
ISSUES, (II) BRING GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE DERIVATIVES MARKETS, (III) PROVIDE ENHANCED DISCLOSURES AND PROTECTION TO CUSTOMERS, AND (IV) PROMOTE MARKET INTEGRITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, TITLE VII: (I) REQUIRES THE REGISTRATION
OF BOTH SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION CFTC (IN THE CASE OF NON SECURITY-BASED SWAPS) AND THE SEC (IN THE CASE OF SECURITY-BASED SWAPS);
(II) REQUIRES THAT MOST STANDARDIZED SWAPS BE CENTRALLY CLEARED THROUGH A REGULATED CLEARING HOUSE AND TRADED ON A CENTRALIZED EXCHANGE OR SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY; (III) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS TO CAPITAL AND
MARGIN REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF HISTORICAL PRACTICE; (IV) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS TO COMPREHENSIVE NEW RECORDKEEPING AND REAL-TIME PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; (V) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP
PARTICIPANTS TO NEW BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING THE PROVIDING OF DAILY MARKS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND DISCLOSING TO COUNTERPARTIES (PRE-EXECUTION) THE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SWAP AND OF MATERIAL INCENTIVES AND ANY CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SWAP); AND (VI) IMPOSES SPECIAL DUTIES ON SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WHEN TRANSACTING A SWAP WITH A SPECIAL ENTITY (E.G., GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY (FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL) OR POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION THEREOF, PENSION PLAN OR ENDOWMENT). BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF A SWAP DEALER UNDER TITLE VII, PNC BANK, N.A.
REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS A SWAP DEALER ON JANUARY 31, 2013. AS A RESULT THEREOF, PNC BANK, N.A. IS SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED REGULATIONS AND

REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, AND THE CFTC WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL SUPERVISORY ROLE WITH RESPECT TO PNC BANK, N.A. S DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESSES. BECAUSE OF
THE LIMITED VOLUME OF OUR SECURITY-BASED SWAP ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE NOT REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS A SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALER. THE ABOVE DESCRIBED REQUIREMENTS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPOSE IMPLEMENTATION AND ONGOING COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON PNC BANK, N.A.
AND WILL INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL LEGAL RISKS (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF NEWLY APPLICABLE ANTIFRAUD AND ANTI-MANIPULATION PROVISIONS AND PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION). IN ADDITION, AN INVESTMENT ADVISER TO PRIVATE FUNDS OR TO REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR. REGISTRATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT NEW
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BURDENS. PRESENTLY, WE EXPECT OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT SERVE AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS TO SUCH ENTITIES TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR. 
 BLACKROCK HAS SUBSIDIARIES IN SECURITIES AND RELATED BUSINESSES SUBJECT TO SEC, OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, STATE, LOCAL AND FINRA REGULATION, AS

ITEM 1A R ISK F ACTORS 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS POTENTIALLY IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. AS A
FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF RISK ARE INHERENT IN OUR TRANSACTIONS AND ARE PRESENT IN THE BUSINESS DECISIONS WE MAKE. THUS, WE ENCOUNTER RISK AS PART OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE DESIGN RISK MANAGEMENT
PROCESSES TO HELP MANAGE THESE RISKS. THERE ARE RISKS THAT ARE KNOWN TO EXIST AT THE OUTSET OF A TRANSACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY LOAN
TRANSACTION PRESENTS CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT THE BORROWER MAY NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS) AND MARKET RISK (A POTENTIAL LOSS IN EARNINGS OR ECONOMIC VALUE DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENT IN MARKET INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS),
WITH THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THESE RISKS PRINCIPALLY DEPENDING ON THE FINANCIAL PROFILE OF THE BORROWER AND OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE FOCUS ON LENDING THAT IS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR RISK FRAMEWORK, AND MANAGE THESE RISKS BY ADJUSTING
THE TERMS AND STRUCTURE OF THE LOANS WE MAKE AND THROUGH OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE BORROWER RELATIONSHIP, AS WELL AS THROUGH MANAGEMENT OF OUR DEPOSITS AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. RISK MANAGEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SO
THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATELY BALANCE REVENUE GENERATION AND PROFITABILITY. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, MODEL RISK, TECHNOLOGY, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL RISK, AND STRATEGIC AND
REPUTATION RISK. WE DISCUSS OUR PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND, IN APPROPRIATE PLACES, RELATED HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT. 
 THE FOLLOWING ARE THE KEY RISK FACTORS THAT AFFECT US. ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, IN ADDITION TO PRESENTING OTHER POSSIBLE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE RISK FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED FURTHER IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT.
 THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MODERATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY RETURNING TO RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS OR OF TURMOIL OR VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL
MARKETS WOULD LIKELY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES
ECONOMY HAS SHOWN MODEST IMPROVEMENT RECENTLY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO POSE A RISK TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING PNC. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY, ALTHOUGH CONTINUING, DID SO ONLY AT A PACE IN 2012 BELOW TREND FOR OTHER RECENT RECOVERIES
FROM RECESSIONS. JOB GROWTH HAS NOT YET BEEN SUFFICIENT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS IMPROVING BUT REMAINS IN THE CAUTIOUS ZONE.

THERE CONTINUES TO BE CONCERN REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF A RETURN TO RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASED TURMOIL OR VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS.
 THE RECENT GLOBAL RECESSION AND DISRUPTION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS LED TO CONCERNS OVER THE SOLVENCY OF CERTAIN EUROZONE STATES,
INCLUDING GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN, AFFECTING THESE COUNTRIES CAPITAL MARKETS ACCESS, AS WELL AS MARKET PERCEPTION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT DIRECT OR INDIRECT EXPOSURE TO THESE COUNTRIES 
CREDITWORTHINESS. CERTAIN OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES HAVE DOWNGRADED THE SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS OF GREECE, PORTUGAL AND IRELAND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. THE SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS OF FRANCE, ITALY AND SPAIN HAVE ALSO BEEN DOWNGRADED. THESE
RATINGS DOWNGRADES, UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORM PROGRAMS, THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC CONTRACTION, AND THE EUROZONE S FINANCIAL INTER-LINKAGES INCREASE THE RISK OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS SPREADING TO OTHER EUROZONE STATES. IF
MEASURES TO ADDRESS SOVEREIGN DEBT AND FINANCIAL SECTOR PROBLEMS IN EUROPE ARE INADEQUATE, THEY MAY RESULT IN A DELAYED ECONOMIC RECOVERY, THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE MEMBER STATES FROM THE EUROZONE, OR MORE SEVERE RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS. IF REALIZED,
THESE RISK SCENARIOS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO SEVERE FINANCIAL MARKET STRESS OR A GLOBAL RECESSION, LIKELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMY AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL. ALTHOUGH THE SO-CALLED FISCAL CLIFF WAS AVERTED IN EARLY 2013, CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT STILL NEED TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT S DEBT CEILING AND OTHER
BUDGETARY AND SPENDING MATTERS. UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THESE ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED OR HOW EFFECTIVE A RESOLUTION MIGHT BE INCREASES THE RISK OF SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE NATURE AND ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES, OR A FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A
TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION, MAY FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. ECONOMY THROUGH POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING DOWNGRADES IN THE RATINGS FOR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, OR SUBSTANTIAL SPENDING CUTS RESULTING FROM
SEQUESTRATION. CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY NOT IMPROVE IN THE
NEAR FUTURE. WE EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ONGOING NEGATIVE IMPACT ON US AND A WORSENING OF CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY AGGRAVATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THESE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ON US AND ON OTHERS IN THE
FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN PARTICULAR, WE MAY FACE THE FOLLOWING RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT:

INVESTORS MAY HAVE LESS CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS IN GENERAL AND IN FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY STOCKS IN PARTICULAR, WHICH COULD PLACE DOWNWARD
PRESSURE ON PNC S STOCK PRICE AND RESULTING MARKET VALUATION. 

ECONOMIC AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE OR ELSEWHERE, MAY FURTHER AFFECT

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE LEVELS AND MAY CAUSE DECLINES IN CREDIT USAGE AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN PAYMENT PATTERNS, CAUSING INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES.

THE CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT VERY LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT LEAST THROUGH MID-YEAR 2015 BASED ON STATEMENTS BY
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, COULD AFFECT CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR IN WAYS THAT ARE ADVERSE TO US AND COULD ALSO HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. 

OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE MODELS AND APPROACHES WE USE TO SELECT, MANAGE, AND UNDERWRITE OUR
CUSTOMERS BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE BEHAVIORS. 

THE PROCESS WE USE TO ESTIMATE LOSSES IN OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES REQUIRES DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS AND HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR BORROWERS TO REPAY THEIR LOANS. AT ANY POINT IN TIME OR FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME, SUCH LOSSES MAY NO LONGER BE CAPABLE OF ACCURATE ESTIMATION, WHICH MAY, IN TURN, ADVERSELY IMPACT
THE RELIABILITY OF THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING LOSSES AND, THEREFORE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADEQUATE RESERVES FOR THOSE LOSSES. 

WE COULD SUFFER DECREASES IN CUSTOMER DESIRE TO DO BUSINESS WITH US, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF A DECREASED DEMAND FOR LOANS OR OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES OR DECREASED DEPOSITS OR OTHER INVESTMENTS IN ACCOUNTS WITH PNC. 

COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASING CONSOLIDATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH CURRENT
MARKET CONDITIONS, OR OTHERWISE. 

A CONTINUATION OR DETERIORATION OF CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS MAY LEAD TO DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN GOODWILL
IMPAIRMENTS. 

A LESSENING OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHOSE SECURITIES WE HOLD COULD IMPACT THE VALUE OF THOSE
HOLDINGS. 

INCREASED REGULATION OF COMPENSATION AT FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AS PART OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REFORM THE INDUSTRY MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO
ATTRACT, RETAIN AND INCENTIVIZE WELL-QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN KEY POSITIONS. 

INVESTORS IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND OTHER ASSETS THAT WE SELL OR SOLD ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INDEMNIFICATION FROM US AGAINST LOSSES OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO
HAVE US SHARE IN SUCH LOSSES OR TO REQUEST US TO REPURCHASE LOANS THAT THEY BELIEVE DO NOT COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL FEES AND TAXES AS THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO RECOVER SOME OF THE COSTS OF ITS RECOVERY EFFORTS, REDUCE THE NATIONAL DEBT
OR PAY FOR ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, IN PARTICULAR FROM THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THE REGULATORY
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM INITIATIVES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING DODD-FRANK AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED TO IMPLEMENT IT. 
 THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS HAVE UNDERTAKEN MAJOR REFORM OF THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING
ENGAGING IN NEW EFFORTS TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SYSTEMIC RISKS AND PROTECT CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS. WE EXPECT TO FACE FURTHER INCREASED REGULATION OF OUR INDUSTRY AS A RESULT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INITIATIVES INTENDED TO PROVIDE
ECONOMIC STIMULUS, FINANCIAL MARKET STABILITY AND ENHANCED REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND TO ENHANCE THE LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS. WE ALSO EXPECT IN MANY CASES MORE INTENSE SCRUTINY FROM OUR BANK
SUPERVISORS IN THE EXAMINATION PROCESS AND MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND OTHER SUPERVISORY INITIATIVES WILL LIKELY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUE,
AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN DESIRABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
(DODD-FRANK) MANDATES THE MOST WIDE-RANGING OVERHAUL OF FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATION IN DECADES. DODD-FRANK WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON JULY 21, 2010. MANY PARTS OF THE LAW ARE NOW IN EFFECT AND OTHERS ARE NOW IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE, WHICH IS
LIKELY TO CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE LAW REQUIRES THAT REGULATORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NEW REGULATORY BODIES CREATED BY DODD-FRANK, DRAFT, REVIEW AND APPROVE MORE THAN 300 IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND CONDUCT NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO
LEAD TO MORE REGULATIONS, A PROCESS THAT, WHILE WELL UNDERWAY, IS PROCEEDING SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED, THUS EXTENDING THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF DODD-FRANK ON US. 
 A NUMBER OF REFORM PROVISIONS ARE LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE WAYS IN WHICH BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING PNC, DO BUSINESS.

NEWLY CREATED REGULATORY BODIES INCLUDE THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB) AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC). THE CFPB
HAS BEEN GIVEN AUTHORITY TO REGULATE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD BY BANKS AND NON-BANK COMPANIES AND TO SUPERVISE BANKS WITH ASSETS OF MORE THAN 10 BILLION AND THEIR AFFILIATES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS.
THE FSOC HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

IDENTIFYING SYSTEMIC RISKS, PROMOTING STRONGER FINANCIAL REGULATION AND IDENTIFYING THOSE NON-BANK COMPANIES THAT ARE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND THUS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION
BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN ADDITION, IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES AND TOGETHER WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FSOC COULD BREAK UP FINANCIAL FIRMS THAT ARE DEEMED TO PRESENT A GRAVE THREAT TO THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

DODD-FRANK (THROUGH PROVISIONS COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS BANKS AND THEIR AFFILIATES FROM ENGAGING IN SOME TYPES OF
PROPRIETARY TRADING AND RESTRICTS THE ABILITY OF BANKS AND THEIR AFFILIATES TO SPONSOR, INVEST IN OR HAVE OTHER FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIVATE EQUITY OR HEDGE FUNDS. IN OCTOBER 2011, FOUR OF THE FIVE AGENCIES WITH AUTHORITY FOR RULEMAKING
ISSUED PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE. IN JANUARY 2012, THE FIFTH AGENCY ISSUED SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PROPOSED RULES. THE RULES SET FORTH A COMPLEX AND DETAILED COMPLIANCE, REPORTING AND MONITORING PROGRAM FOR LARGE BANKS, AND SEEK
COMMENTS ON NUMEROUS QUESTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE COMMENT DEADLINE EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2012 ON THE FOUR AGENCY PROPOSALS (AND LATER IN 2012 ON THE SINGLE AGENCY PROPOSAL), THE AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET ISSUED FINAL RULES. THE TIMING AND CONTENT OF THE FINAL
RULES REMAIN UNCERTAIN. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE PROPOSED RULES ARE ADDRESSED BY THE AGENCIES WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE IMPACT OF THE FINAL RULES ON PNC. 
 ALTHOUGH PNC NO LONGER HAS A DESIGNATED PROPRIETARY TRADING OPERATION, THE PROPOSED RULES BROADLY DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES POTENTIALLY
PROHIBITED PROPRIETARY TRADING, THEREBY MAKING THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY EXEMPTIONS FOR TRADING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE EXEMPTIONS FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND CUSTOMER TRADING, ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT. UNTIL MORE IS KNOWN
ABOUT HOW THE FINAL RULES WILL DEFINE PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE SCOPE OF PERMISSIBLE TRADING ACTIVITIES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT TO PNC OF THE PROPRIETARY TRADING PROHIBITION. HOWEVER, ANY MEANINGFUL LIMITATION ON
PNC S ABILITY TO HEDGE ITS RISKS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OR TO TRADE ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS WOULD LIKELY BE ADVERSE TO PNC S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED RULES CONTAIN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE AND RECORDKEEPING
REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PERMISSIBLE TRADING ACTIVITIES. SUCH REQUIREMENTS, IF INCLUDED IN A FINAL RULE, COULD INCREASE THE COSTS OF HEDGING OR OTHER TYPES OF PERMISSIBLE TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIALLY RESULT IN PNC NOT ENGAGING IN CERTAIN
TRANSACTIONS, OR TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS, IN WHICH WE WOULD OTHERWISE ENGAGE. WITH RESPECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON PRIVATE
EQUITY AND HEDGE FUND ACTIVITIES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, PNC HELD INTERESTS IN SUCH FUNDS LIKELY TO BE COVERED TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 859 MILLION INCLUDING THREE

SPONSORED FUNDS WITH TOTAL INVESTED CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY 389 MILLION. PNC EXPECTS THAT OVER TIME IT WILL NEED TO ELIMINATE THESE INVESTMENTS AND CEASE SPONSORING THESE FUNDS, ALTHOUGH IT IS
LIKELY THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THESE AMOUNTS WILL REDUCE OVER TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE BEFORE COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED, AND THE VOLCKER RULE ALSO PERMITS EXTENSIONS OF THE COMPLIANCE DATE UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. A FORCED SALE OF SOME OF THESE
INVESTMENTS DUE TO THE VOLCKER RULE COULD RESULT IN PNC RECEIVING LESS VALUE THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE RECEIVED. DEPENDING ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE FINAL RULE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER STRUCTURES THROUGH WHICH PNC CONDUCTS BUSINESS, SUCH AS
OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES OR SECURITIZATION VEHICLES, BUT THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS PRIVATE EQUITY OR HEDGE FUNDS, COULD BE RESTRICTED, WITH AN IMPACT THAT CANNOT NOW BE EVALUATED. 

PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, IN DECEMBER 2011 THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUESTED COMMENT ON PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD ESTABLISH ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS
GOVERNING U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH 50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS COVERED COMPANIES ). THE PROPOSED ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WOULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HEIGHTENED LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
STANDARDS; NEW STANDARDS GOVERNING OVERSIGHT BY A COVERED COMPANY S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND BOARD-LEVEL RISK COMMITTEE; AND NEW LIMITS ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE A COVERED COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY.
THESE PROPOSED RULES ALSO WOULD ESTABLISH AN EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME FOR COVERED COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE INCREASINGLY STRINGENT ACTIONS AGAINST A COVERED COMPANY AS ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR
RISK MANAGEMENT DETERIORATED AS REFLECTED BY THE COMPANY S CURRENT OR PROJECTED POST-STRESS CAPITAL LEVELS, COMPLIANCE WITH SUPERVISORY LIQUIDITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, MARKET-BASED INDICATORS, SUCH AS CREDIT
DEFAULT SWAP SPREADS. THE COMMENT PERIOD ON THE PROPOSED RULES CLOSED IN MARCH 2012. FINAL RULES, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED, AND AS SUCH THE IMPACT OF THESE RULES CANNOT NOW BE EVALUATED. 

IN ADDITION, THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE DODD-FRANK PROVISIONS REQUIRING RETENTION OF RISK BY CERTAIN
SECURITIZATION PARTICIPANTS THROUGH HOLDING INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES, BUT THE RULES ARE NOT YET FINALIZED OR EFFECTIVE. AS A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE DODD-FRANK PROVISIONS ON PNC REMAINS UNPREDICTABLE. THAT IMPACT ON PNC
COULD BE DIRECT, BY REQUIRING PNC TO HOLD INTERESTS IN A SECURITIZATION VEHICLE OR OTHER ASSETS THAT REPRESENT A PORTION OF THE CREDIT RISK OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE, OR INDIRECT, BY IMPACTING MARKETS IN WHICH

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

PNC PARTICIPATES AND INCREASING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MORTGAGE ASSETS THAT WE ORIGINATE. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, THERE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS
PRIVATE (THAT IS, NON-GOVERNMENT BACKED) SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE CASE. IT IS UNCLEAR AT PRESENT WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE PRIVATE SECURITIZATION MARKETS WILL REBOUND. IN RECENT YEARS, PNC HAS ONLY ENGAGED TO A
LIMITED EXTENT IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE MIGHT EXPECT TO BE REQUIRED TO RETAIN ADDITIONAL RISK ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE DODD-FRANK PROVISIONS. IF THE MARKET FOR PRIVATE
SECURITIZATIONS REBOUNDS AND PNC DECIDES TO INCREASE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THAT MARKET, WE WOULD LIKELY BE REQUIRED UNDER THE REGULATIONS TO RETAIN MORE RISK THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE, AND AS A RESULT COULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE
CERTAIN SECURITIZATION VEHICLES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WITH CURRENTLY AN UNCERTAIN FINANCIAL IMPACT. 

ON THE INDIRECT IMPACT SIDE, PNC ORIGINATES LOANS OF A VARIETY OF TYPES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD, AUTO, AND
STUDENT, THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE COMMONLY BEEN SECURITIZED, AND PNC IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT SERVICER OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES HELD BY OTHERS, INCLUDING SECURITIZATION VEHICLES. PNC ANTICIPATES THAT THE RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS WILL
IMPACT THE MARKET FOR LOANS OF TYPES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED, POTENTIALLY AFFECTING THE VOLUMES OF LOANS SECURITIZED, THE TYPES OF LOAN PRODUCTS MADE AVAILABLE, THE TERMS ON WHICH LOANS ARE OFFERED, CONSUMER AND BUSINESS DEMAND FOR
LOANS, AND THE NEED FOR THIRD-PARTY LOAN SERVICERS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE RISK RETENTION RULES THEMSELVES COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING THE REBOUND IN THE SECURITIZATION MARKETS. ONE EFFECT OF HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES TO
SECURITIZE LOANS WOULD LIKELY BE A REDUCTION IN THE WILLINGNESS OF BANKS, INCLUDING PNC, TO MAKE LOANS DUE TO BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. ANY OF THESE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE DODD-FRANK RISK RETENTION RULES COULD AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH
PNC CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND COULD ALSO AFFECT PNC S REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY, ALTHOUGH, AS NOTED ABOVE, NOT IN WAYS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PREDICTABLE. 

TITLE VII OF DODD-FRANK IMPOSES NEW COMPREHENSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE U.S.
OVER-THE-COUNTER OTC DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS. TITLE VII (I) REQUIRES THE REGISTRATION OF BOTH SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION CFTC (IN THE CASE OF NON SECURITY-BASED SWAPS) AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION SEC (IN THE CASE OF SECURITY-BASED SWAPS); (II) REQUIRES THAT MOST

STANDARDIZED SWAPS BE CENTRALLY CLEARED THROUGH A REGULATED CLEARING HOUSE AND TRADED ON A CENTRALIZED EXCHANGE OR SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY; (III) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP
PARTICIPANTS TO CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF CURRENT PRACTICE; (IV) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS TO COMPREHENSIVE NEW RECORDKEEPING AND REAL-TIME PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; (V) SUBJECTS SWAP DEALERS
AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS TO NEW BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE DAILY MARKS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND TO DISCLOSE TO COUNTERPARTIES (PRE-EXECUTION) THE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A SWAP AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES
AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWAP); AND (VI) IMPOSES SPECIAL DUTIES ON SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WHEN TRANSACTING A SWAP WITH A SPECIAL ENTITY (E.G., GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY (FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL) OR
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, PENSION PLAN OR ENDOWMENT). BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF A SWAP DEALER UNDER TITLE VII, PNC BANK, N.A. REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS A SWAP DEALER EFFECTIVE JANUARY 31, 2013. AS A RESULT, PNC BANK, N.A.
WILL BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED RESTRICTIONS AND THE CFTC WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL SUPERVISORY ROLE WITH RESPECT TO PNC BANK, N.A. S DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESSES. 
 THE ABOVE DESCRIBED REQUIREMENTS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPOSE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION AND ONGOING COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON PNC
AND WILL INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL LEGAL RISK (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF NEWLY APPLICABLE ANTIFRAUD AND ANTI-MANIPULATION PROVISIONS AND PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION). 

NEW PROVISIONS UNDER DODD-FRANK CONCERNING THE APPLICABILITY OF STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS TO NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS PNC BANK, N.A., BECAME
EFFECTIVE IN 2011. QUESTIONS MAY ARISE AS TO WHETHER CERTAIN STATE CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS THAT MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW ARE NO LONGER PREEMPTED AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE NEW PROVISIONS. DEPENDING ON HOW SUCH
QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED, WE MAY EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN STATE-LEVEL REGULATION OF OUR RETAIL BANKING BUSINESS AND ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS, REVENUE IMPACTS AND COSTS. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS UNDER DODD-FRANK THAT ALSO TOOK EFFECT IN 2011
PERMIT STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO BRING CIVIL ACTIONS AGAINST NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS PNC BANK, N.A., FOR VIOLATIONS OF LAW, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE CFPB. 

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE 50 BILLION OR MORE IN ASSETS, SUCH AS PNC, TO PERIODICALLY SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE
FDIC AND THE FSOC A RESOLUTION PLAN THAT INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE COMPANY COULD BE RESOLVED IN A RAPID AND ORDERLY FASHION IF THE COMPANY WERE TO FAIL OR EXPERIENCE MATERIAL FINANCIAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

DISTRESS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC MAY JOINTLY IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON PNC, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR LIMITATIONS ON GROWTH, IF THE AGENCIES JOINTLY DETERMINE THAT THE
COMPANY S PLAN IS NOT CREDIBLE OR WOULD NOT FACILITATE A RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF PNC UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, AND ADDITIONALLY COULD REQUIRE PNC TO DIVEST ASSETS OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS IF WE DID NOT SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION
PLAN WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER ANY SUCH RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED. THE FDIC ALSO HAS ADOPTED A RULE THAT REQUIRES LARGE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING PNC BANK, N.A., TO PERIODICALLY SUBMIT A RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FDIC THAT INCLUDES, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE INSTITUTION COULD BE RESOLVED UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDI ACT) IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS DEPOSITORS AND LIMITS LOSSES OR COSTS TO CREDITORS OF THE BANK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FDI ACT. PNC AND PNC
BANK, N.A. MUST FILE THEIR FIRST PLANS UNDER THESE RULES BY DECEMBER 31, 2013. DEPENDING ON HOW THE AGENCIES CONDUCT THEIR REVIEW OF THE RESOLUTION PLANS SUBMITTED BY PNC AND PNC BANK, N.A., IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD AFFECT
THE WAYS IN WHICH PNC STRUCTURES AND CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AND RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND OPERATING COSTS. 

OTHER PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK WILL AFFECT REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, HOLDING COMPANY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS.
 WHILE MUCH OF HOW THE DODD-FRANK AND OTHER FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REFORMS WILL CHANGE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS DEPENDS
ON THE SPECIFIC REGULATORY PROMULGATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE YET TO BE RELEASED OR FINALIZED, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REFORMS, BOTH UNDER DODD-FRANK AND OTHERWISE, WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR ENTIRE INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH
DODD-FRANK AND OTHER REFORMS WILL AFFECT A NUMBER OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESSES IN
RESPONSE TO THE REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE AND EXTENT OF THESE EFFECTS AT THIS STAGE, WE BELIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH DODD-FRANK AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND OTHER INITIATIVES WILL CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY
IMPACT REVENUE, AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT, AND INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS, BOTH IN TERMS OF TRANSITION EXPENSES AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, AND MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN DESIRABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. 
 NEW CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS WILL RESULT IN BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES NEEDING TO MAINTAIN MORE AND HIGHER QUALITY CAPITAL AND GREATER
LIQUIDITY THAN HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN THE CASE. NEW AND EVOLVING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BANKS
AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING PNC. THESE EVOLVING STANDARDS INCLUDE THE

PROPOSALS ISSUED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES IN JUNE 2012 TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL III CAPITAL FRAMEWORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND REVISE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE RISK-WEIGHTING OF ASSETS UNDER BASEL
I. THE BASEL III PROPOSED RULES WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NARROW THE DEFINITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL, REQUIRE THE PHASE-OUT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES FROM TIER 1 REGULATORY CAPITAL, ESTABLISH A NEW TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENT FOR BANKING
ORGANIZATIONS AND REVISE THE CAPITAL LEVELS AT WHICH A BANK WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, PNC HAD 331 MILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL WHICH, UNDER THESE RULES AND
DODD-FRANK, WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY AS TIER 1 CAPITAL OVER TIME TO THE EXTENT THEY REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO WOULD REQUIRE THAT UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL ENTITIES (POTENTIALLY INCLUDING PNC S INVESTMENT IN
BLACKROCK), AS WELL AS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, ABOVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS BE DEDUCTED FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH MINORITY INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING MINORITY
INTERESTS IN THE FORM OF REIT PREFERRED SECURITIES) MAY BE INCLUDED IN REGULATORY CAPITAL. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, PNC HAD APPROXIMATELY 1.4 BILLION OF REIT PREFERRED SECURITIES OUTSTANDING. PNC HAS SUBMITTED THE NECESSARY REDEMPTION NOTICE
TO REDEEM 375 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT ON MARCH 15, 2013, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY ACTIONS PORTION OF THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SECTION IN ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD REMOVE THE FILTER
THAT CURRENTLY EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (OTHER THAN THOSE RESULTING FROM OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES FROM AFFECTING REGULATORY CAPITAL, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF REGULATORY CAPITAL
OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING PNC. WHEN FULLY PHASED-IN ON JANUARY 1, 2019, THE BASEL III RULES WOULD REQUIRE THAT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO OF 4.5 , A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 6.0 , A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO
OF 8.0 AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4 . MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED RULES, WHEN FULLY PHASED-IN, WOULD REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING PNC, TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO OF 7.0 , A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5 , AND A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO
OF 10.5 TO AVOID LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (INCLUDING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES) AND CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS. FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUBJECT TO THE BASEL II ADVANCED APPROACHES (SUCH AS
PNC), THESE LEVELS COULD BE SUPPLEMENTED BY AN ADDITIONAL COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 2.5 DURING PERIODS OF EXCESSIVE CREDIT GROWTH, ALTHOUGH THIS BUFFER IS PROPOSED TO INITIALLY BE SET AT ZERO IN THE UNITED STATES. SUCH
ORGANIZATIONS WOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A NEW SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO THAT WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS. THE
PROPOSED RULES ISSUED IN JUNE 2012 THAT WOULD REVISE THE BASEL I RISK-WEIGHTING FRAMEWORK (REFERRED TO AS THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH) AND THE BASEL II RISK-WEIGHTING FRAMEWORK (REFERRED TO AS THE ADVANCED APPROACHES) WOULD REPLACE THE USE OF CREDIT
RATINGS WITH ALTERNATIVE

TO 100 TO BETWEEN 35 AND 200 AND INCREASE THE RISK WEIGHT APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN TYPES OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS UNDER BASEL I. THE ADVANCED APPROACHES RULE WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK WEIGHTS, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT FOR COUNTERPARTY RISK IN OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, UNDER BASEL II. THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK ADOPTED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ALSO INCLUDES NEW SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY STANDARDS (THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO) AND LONG-TERM FUNDING STANDARDS (THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO). THE
LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN TO TAKE EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2015 AND BE FULLY PHASED IN BY JANUARY 1, 2019, IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF CASH, OR OTHER HIGH QUALITY
AND UNENCUMBERED LIQUID ASSETS THAT CAN READILY BE CONVERTED TO CASH, TO MEET ESTIMATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN A STRESS SCENARIO LASTING 30 DAYS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS DEFINED THE TYPES OF ASSETS THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS HIGH QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS, AND
ALSO HAS ESTABLISHED VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CASH OUTFLOWS AND INFLOWS DURING THE 30-DAY STRESS PERIOD, FOR PURPOSES OF THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO. THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE A STABLE MATURITY STRUCTURE OF ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT BY JANUARY 1, 2018 BUT CONTINUES TO UNDERGO REVIEW BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. 
 IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ALSO ADOPTED A FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD REQUIRE GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS G-SIBS TO MAINTAIN
ADDITIONAL TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL RANGING BETWEEN 1.0 TO 2.5 OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, WITH THE ACTUAL REQUIRED AMOUNT VARYING BASED ON THE FIRM S GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE AS DETERMINED USING FIVE CRITERIA (SIZE, INTERCONNECTEDNESS, LACK OF
SUBSTITUTABILITY, CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY, AND COMPLEXITY). THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT EXPECTS TO PROPOSE A CAPITAL SURCHARGE IN THE UNITED STATES BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEE S G-SIB FRAMEWORK. WHILE THESE RULES HAVE NOT
YET BEEN PROPOSED, AND THE IDENTITY OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A SURCHARGE AS A G-SIB DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED, PNC BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE DEEMED A G-SIB BASED ON THE CRITERIA INCLUDED IN THE BASEL
COMMITTEE S FRAMEWORK. DODD-FRANK DIRECTS THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH HEIGHTENED RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, LIKE PNC, THAT HAVE 50 BILLION OR MORE IN ASSETS. THE
BASEL COMMITTEE ALSO HAS ADOPTED AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS TO USE IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPLY A CAPITAL SURCHARGE TO

FIRMS THAT MAY BE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT ON A DOMESTIC BASIS D-SIBS ), BUT THAT ARE NOT G-SIBS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS STATED THAT IT IS STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER TO IMPOSE AN
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL SURCHARGE ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE 50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS, BUT THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A G-SIB SURCHARGE. BECAUSE PROPOSALS BY THE U.S. AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS AND REVISE THE BASEL I RISK-WEIGHTING FRAMEWORK HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED, AND ANY ADDITIONAL HEIGHTENED CAPITAL OR
LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER BASEL III OR DODD-FRANK (SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A D-SIB SURCHARGE) REMAIN SUBJECT TO RULEMAKING IN THE U.S., THE FULL EFFECT OF THESE STANDARDS ON PNC S REGULATORY CAPITAL
AND LIQUIDITY, BOTH DURING AND AFTER ANY APPLICABLE PHASE-IN PERIODS, IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. THE NEED TO MAINTAIN MORE AND HIGHER QUALITY
CAPITAL, AS WELL AS GREATER LIQUIDITY, GOING FORWARD THAN HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN REQUIRED COULD LIMIT PNC S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING LENDING, AND ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND, EITHER ORGANICALLY OR THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. IT COULD ALSO RESULT IN
PNC TAKING STEPS TO INCREASE ITS CAPITAL THAT MAY BE DILUTIVE TO SHAREHOLDERS OR BEING LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, OR SELLING OR REFRAINING FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE ASSETS UNDERLYING RISKS. IN ADDITION, THE NEW LIQUIDITY STANDARDS COULD REQUIRE PNC TO INCREASE ITS HOLDINGS OF HIGHLY LIQUID SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, THEREBY REDUCING PNC S ABILITY TO INVEST IN LONGER-TERM
OR LESS LIQUID ASSETS EVEN IF MORE DESIRABLE FROM A BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING PHASED IN OVER TIME, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE BEEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE
ABILITY OF BANKS TO MEET THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING UNDER STRESSED CONDITIONS, IN APPROVING ACTIONS THAT REPRESENT USES OF CAPITAL, SUCH AS DIVIDEND INCREASES, SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. 
 OUR LENDING AND SERVICING BUSINESSES AND THE VALUE OF THE LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES WE HOLD MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,
INCLUDING A REVERSAL OR SLOWING OF THE CURRENT MODERATE RECOVERY. DOWNWARD VALUATION OF DEBT SECURITIES COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CAPITAL POSITION. GIVEN THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OUR ASSETS REPRESENTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY LOANS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LENDING TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS, WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON
OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THIS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LOAN UTILIZATION RATES AS WELL AS DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND CUSTOMER ABILITY TO MEET OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOANS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE
AFTERMATH OF RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS CONTINUES AND THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY APPEAR TO BE SLOW TO MATERIALIZE AND UNEVENLY SPREAD AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS.

THE PNC
FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FORM 10-K 17 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

FURTHER, WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVE
OUR CUSTOMERS, AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF BORROWERS WHO BECOME DELINQUENT OR DEFAULT OR OTHERWISE DEMONSTRATE A DECREASED ABILITY TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEIR LOANS. THIS
WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER LEVELS OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, NET CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ON LOANS HELD FOR SALE. THE VALUE TO US OF OTHER ASSETS SUCH AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, MOST OF WHICH ARE DEBT SECURITIES OR
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUPPORTED BY LOANS, SIMILARLY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WIDESPREAD DECREASES IN CREDIT QUALITY RESULTING FROM A WEAKENING OF THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT CONSIDERED GOVERNMENT INSURED OR GUARANTEED LOANS TO BE HIGHER RISK LOANS AS DEFAULTS ARE MATERIALLY MITIGATED BY PAYMENTS OF INSURANCE OR GUARANTEED AMOUNTS FOR APPROVED CLAIMS
BY THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. WHILE THE LEVEL OF CLAIM DENIALS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN LOW, IF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS PROMPT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO DENY OR CURTAIL
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS, WE COULD FACE ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN OUR LENDING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT THAT SUBMITTED CLAIMS ARE DENIED OR CURTAILED AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE AS A SERVICER OF THE LOAN TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE
AGENCY SERVICING GUIDELINES, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO REMIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLAIMS PROCEEDS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND THE CLAIM AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECEIVED TO THE HOLDER OF THE LOAN. 
 A FAILURE TO SUSTAIN REDUCED AMOUNTS OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH HAS BENEFITTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN RECENT PERIODS, COULD RESULT IN
DECREASES IN NET INCOME. AS WAS TYPICAL IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT STARTED IN 2007 RESULTED IN PNC EXPERIENCING
HIGH LEVELS OF PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. IN 2009, PNC REPORTED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALING 3.9 BILLION. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN PART DUE TO IMPROVEMENT IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY PNC TO MANAGE ITS PORTFOLIO, PNC S
PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES HAS DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY, TO 2.5 BILLION IN 2010, 1.2 BILLION IN 2011 AND 1.0 BILLION IN 2012. THIS DECLINE IN PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES HAS BEEN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO PNC S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW ITS
NET INCOME DURING THIS PERIOD. AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES STABILIZES, THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH OPPORTUNITY AS THERE HAS BEEN FOR DECLINING PROVISION TO HELP PNC MAINTAIN AND GROW NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, IF PNC S PROVISION FOR CREDIT
LOSSES WERE TO RISE BACK TOWARDS LEVELS EXPERIENCED DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, IT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PNC S NET INCOME AND COULD RESULT IN LOWER LEVELS OF NET INCOME THAN PNC HAS REPORTED IN RECENT PERIODS.

OUR REGIONAL CONCENTRATIONS MAKE US PARTICULARLY AT RISK TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR PRIMARY
RETAIL BANKING FOOTPRINT. ALTHOUGH MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE NATIONAL IN SCOPE, OUR RETAIL BANKING BUSINESS IS CONCENTRATED WITHIN OUR
RETAIL BRANCH NETWORK FOOTPRINT, LOCATED PRINCIPALLY IN OUR PRIMARY GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. THUS, WE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC, MIDWEST, AND SOUTHEAST REGIONS. 
 OUR BUSINESS AND PERFORMANCE ARE VULNERABLE TO THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS. 
 AS MOST OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE, WE TEND TO BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. TURMOIL
AND VOLATILITY IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, SUCH AS THAT EXPERIENCED DURING THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, CAN BE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR TO OVERALL WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEADING TO SOME OF THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE, INCLUDING THE
IMPAIRED ABILITY OF BORROWERS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO US. FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY ALSO CAN HAVE SOME OF THE FOLLOWING ADVERSE EFFECTS ON PNC AND OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 

IT CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OR LIQUIDITY OF OUR ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. 

IT CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OF SERVICING RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE WE CARRY AT FAIR VALUE. 

IT CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO RAISE FUNDS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAIN OUR OVERALL LIQUIDITY POSITION.
INABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AS NEEDED, OR AT COST EFFECTIVE RATES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

IT CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT WE MANAGE OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTER FOR OTHERS OR THE ASSETS FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE PROCESSING AND INFORMATION
SERVICES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS, DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS WOULD AFFECT RELATED FEE INCOME AND COULD RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. 

IT CAN AFFECT THE REQUIRED FUNDING OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS SUPPORTING THOSE OBLIGATIONS DROPS BELOW
MINIMUM LEVELS. 

IN GENERAL, IT CAN IMPACT THE NATURE, PROFITABILITY OR RISK PROFILE OF THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ENGAGE. 
 VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS FOR REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS COMMONLY SECURING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS HAS BEEN AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT
CONTRIBUTOR TO OVERALL VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS.

OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MARKET INTEREST RATES AND MOVEMENTS
IN THOSE RATES. THE MONETARY, TAX AND OTHER POLICIES OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INTEREST RATES AND OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKET PERFORMANCE OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL AND WHICH WE MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO PREDICT ADEQUATELY. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE IN THE FORM OF INTEREST-BEARING OR
INTEREST-RELATED INSTRUMENTS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, IN THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE OR IN SPREADS BETWEEN DIFFERENT MARKET INTEREST RATES CAN HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE: 

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR INTEREST RATE SPREADS CAN AFFECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTEREST THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS AND THE INTEREST THAT WE PAY
ON LIABILITIES, WHICH IMPACTS OUR OVERALL NET INTEREST INCOME AND PROFITABILITY. 

SUCH CHANGES CAN AFFECT THE ABILITY OF BORROWERS TO MEET OBLIGATIONS UNDER VARIABLE OR ADJUSTABLE RATE LOANS AND OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS, AND CAN, IN
TURN, AFFECT OUR LOSS RATES ON THOSE ASSETS. 

SUCH CHANGES MAY DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR INTEREST RATE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LOANS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. 

SUCH CHANGES CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE VARIOUS FORMS OF MARKET AND INTEREST RATE RISK AND MAY DECREASE THE PROFITABILITY OR INCREASE THE
RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH HEDGES. 

MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES ALSO AFFECT MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF MORTGAGE SERVICING ASSETS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE
PROFITABILITY OF SUCH ASSETS. THE MONETARY, TAX AND OTHER POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE
FEDERAL RESERVE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INTEREST RATES AND OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKET PERFORMANCE. THESE GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES CAN THUS AFFECT THE ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF BANKING COMPANIES SUCH AS PNC. AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS TO REGULATE THE NATIONAL SUPPLY OF BANK CREDIT AND CERTAIN INTEREST RATES. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE INFLUENCE THE RATES OF INTEREST THAT WE CHARGE ON LOANS AND THAT WE PAY ON BORROWINGS AND INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS
AND CAN ALSO AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. BOTH DUE TO THE IMPACT ON RATES AND BY CONTROLLING ACCESS TO DIRECT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE S POLICIES ALSO
INFLUENCE, TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT, OUR COST OF FUNDING. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE NATURE OR TIMING OF FUTURE CHANGES IN MONETARY, TAX AND OTHER POLICIES OR THE EFFECTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PNC FACES LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK ARISING OUT OF ITS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESSES. 
 NUMEROUS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING PRACTICES IN THE BUSINESS OF MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY
LOAN LENDING AND SERVICING AND IN THE MORTGAGE-RELATED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES. PNC HAS RECEIVED INQUIRIES FROM GOVERNMENTAL, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ON THESE TOPICS AND IS RESPONDING TO THESE INQUIRIES. THESE INQUIRIES
AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD LEAD TO ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN REMEDIES INCLUDING FINES, PENALTIES, RESTITUTION, ALTERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND COLLATERAL COSTS. 
 IN ADDITION TO GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, PNC, LIKE OTHER COMPANIES WITH RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOAN
ORIGINATION AND SERVICING OPERATIONS, FACES THE RISK OF CLASS ACTIONS, OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS FROM: THE OWNERS OF, INVESTORS IN, OR PURCHASERS OF SUCH LOANS ORIGINATED OR SERVICED BY PNC (OR SECURITIES BACKED BY SUCH LOANS), HOMEOWNERS INVOLVED
IN FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS OR VARIOUS MORTGAGE-RELATED INSURANCE PROGRAMS, DOWNSTREAM PURCHASERS OF HOMES SOLD AFTER FORECLOSURE, TITLE INSURERS, AND OTHER POTENTIAL CLAIMANTS. INCLUDED AMONG THESE CLAIMS ARE CLAIMS FROM PURCHASERS OF MORTGAGE AND
HOME EQUITY LOANS SEEKING THE REPURCHASE OF LOANS WHERE THE LOANS ALLEGEDLY BREACHED ORIGINATION COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO THE PURCHASERS IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS. 
 AT THIS TIME PNC CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OVERALL COST TO OR EFFECT UPON PNC FROM GOVERNMENTAL, LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS AND PRIVATE
LITIGATION OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOAN LENDING, SERVICING OR REINSURANCE PRACTICES, ALTHOUGH SUCH ACTIONS, LITIGATION AND CLAIMS COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE. SEE NOTE
23 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND NOTE 24 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND
INVESTIGATIONS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS. MOREOVER,
THE CFPB RECENTLY ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE NEW REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATION PRACTICES AND SERVICING PRACTICES. THESE REGULATIONS ARE NOT YET IN EFFECT, BUT WE ARE IN THE PROCESSES OF IMPLEMENTING THEM. WE
CANNOT PREDICT AT THIS TIME THE OVERALL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THESE REQUIREMENTS, BUT IMPLEMENTATION IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE.

THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, IN PROPERTY
SUBJECT TO FORECLOSURE. IN ADDITION, POSSIBLE DELAYS IN THE SCHEDULE FOR PROCESSING FORECLOSURES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN NONPERFORMING LOANS, ADDITIONAL SERVICING COSTS AND POSSIBLE DEMANDS FOR CONTRACTUAL FEES OR PENALTIES UNDER SERVICING
AGREEMENTS. THERE IS ALSO A CONTINUING RISK OF INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO FURTHER REMEDIAL AND RELATED EFFORTS REQUIRED BY THE CONSENT ORDERS
AND RELATED TO REPURCHASE REQUESTS ARISING OUT OF EITHER THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS OR ORIGINATION ISSUES. REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THIS INDUSTRY-WIDE INQUIRY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR EXISTING MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOAN
BUSINESS AND COULD REDUCE FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PNC S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. WE GROW OUR BUSINESS IN PART BY ACQUIRING OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES FROM TIME TO
TIME, AND THESE ACQUISITIONS PRESENT A NUMBER OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED BOTH TO THE ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THEMSELVES AND TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO PNC AFTER CLOSING. 
 ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSETS AND RELATED DEPOSITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
TO PNC IN ADDITION TO THOSE PRESENTED BY THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. IN GENERAL, ACQUISITIONS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO
COMPLETE THAN ANTICIPATED (INCLUDING UNANTICIPATED COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY). ANTICIPATED BENEFITS (INCLUDING ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS AND STRATEGIC GAINS) MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER OR TAKE LONGER
TO ACHIEVE THAN EXPECTED OR MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED IN THEIR ENTIRETY AS A RESULT OF UNEXPECTED FACTORS OR EVENTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE
ANTICIPATED RESULTS FROM ACQUISITIONS IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ALSO ON THE EXTENT OF CREDIT LOSSES IN THE ACQUIRED LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND THE EXTENT OF DEPOSIT ATTRITION, WHICH ARE, IN PART, RELATED TO THE STATE OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKETS. ALSO,
LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAY BE FILED OR COMMENCED, AS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION OR OTHERWISE, COULD IMPACT THE TIMING OR REALIZATION OF ANTICIPATED BENEFITS TO PNC.

INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS INTO PNC, INCLUDING CONVERSION OF THE
ACQUIRED COMPANY S DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES, MAY TAKE LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED OR BE MORE COSTLY THAN ANTICIPATED OR HAVE UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE RESULTS RELATING TO THE ACQUIRED COMPANY S OR PNC S EXISTING BUSINESSES. IN SOME
CASES, ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE OUR ENTRY INTO NEW BUSINESSES OR NEW GEOGRAPHIC OR OTHER MARKETS, AND THESE SITUATIONS ALSO PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN INSTANCES WHERE WE MAY BE INEXPERIENCED IN THESE NEW AREAS. 
 OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY PROSPECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO PREPARE IN ADVANCE OF CLOSING FOR INTEGRATION, DEPENDS,
IN PART, ON THE INFORMATION WE CAN GATHER WITH RESPECT TO THE TARGET, WHICH IS MORE LIMITED THAN THE INFORMATION WE HAVE REGARDING COMPANIES WE ALREADY OWN. AS A REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE OR COMPLETE ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY REGULATORY DELAYS OR OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES. IN ADDITION,
LEGAL AND REGULATORY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, INVESTIGATIONS OR INQUIRIES RELATING TO PRE-ACQUISITION BUSINESS AND ACTIVITIES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES MAY RESULT IN FUTURE MONETARY JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS OR OTHER REMEDIES, INCLUDING
DAMAGES, FINES, PENALTIES, RESTITUTION OR ALTERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, AND IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND COLLATERAL COSTS, AND MAY CAUSE REPUTATIONAL HARM TO PNC. THE PROCESSES OF INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS THE
DECONSOLIDATION OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, ALSO POSE MANY ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY OR OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO PNC. NOTE 23 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN
ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT DESCRIBES SEVERAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO PRE-ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES OF COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED, INCLUDING NATIONAL CITY. OTHER SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY BE COMMENCED IN THE FUTURE. 
 THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND WE ROUTINELY
EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT
RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF OUR COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE
LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE US.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND THE
GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, AS WELL AS IN OUR LABOR MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE FOR TALENTED EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION, GROWTH AND RETENTION, AS WELL AS OUR CREDIT SPREADS AND PRODUCT
PRICING, CAUSING US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE AND DEPOSITS AND REVENUES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS FROM NON-BANK ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN MANY SIMILAR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO BANK REGULATORY SUPERVISION AND RESTRICTIONS. THIS COMPETITION IS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT UNDER COMPETITION. 
 IN ALL, THE PRINCIPAL BASES FOR COMPETITION ARE PRICING (INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATES CHARGED ON LOANS OR PAID ON INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS),
PRODUCT STRUCTURE, THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, AND THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE (INCLUDING CONVENIENCE AND RESPONSIVENESS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND CONCERNS). THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE TECHNOLOGY IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT
COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, AND IT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AS IT AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE RIGHT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 
 ANOTHER INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS THE COMPETITION TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES ACROSS MANY OF OUR
BUSINESS AND SUPPORT AREAS. THIS COMPETITION LEADS TO INCREASED EXPENSES IN MANY BUSINESS AREAS AND CAN ALSO CAUSE US TO NOT PURSUE CERTAIN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE COULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, MEETING THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES
COULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OR TO ACCEPT RISK BEYOND WHAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE VIEW AS DESIRABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, IN OUR INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE BUSINESSES, PRESSURES TO INCREASE RATES ON DEPOSITS OR
DECREASE RATES ON LOANS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN WITH A RESULTING NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. THE PERFORMANCE
OF OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY OVERALL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH THE OFFERINGS BY COMPETITORS. 
 ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND THUS IS IMPACTED BY GENERAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATIONS,
CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. IN ADDITION, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING THE LEVEL OF ASSETS. POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE COULD IMPAIR REVENUE AND GROWTH AS EXISTING CLIENTS MIGHT WITHDRAW FUNDS IN FAVOR OF BETTER
PERFORMING PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT FUNDS FROM EXISTING AND NEW CLIENTS MIGHT DIMINISH. OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT

THE AMOUNT THAT CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE OR WILLING TO INVEST AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS THEY DO INVEST. THE FAILURE OR NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCTS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN SIMILAR PRODUCTS OFFERED BY US WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH
A NEGATIVE CONTAGION COULD LEAD TO WITHDRAWALS, REDEMPTIONS AND LIQUIDITY ISSUES IN SUCH PRODUCTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUES AND EARNINGS. 
 AS A REGULATED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND TO COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION AND SUPERVISION BY
REGULATORS, WHICH AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. PNC IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY
AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS INVOLVING BOTH ITS BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION. OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY
MULTIPLE BANK REGULATORY BODIES AS WELL AS MULTIPLE SECURITIES INDUSTRY REGULATORS. APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES THAT OPERATE IN THE BANKING AND SECURITIES
BUSINESSES AND IMPOSE CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. PNC S ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS OBLIGATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RECEIPT OF DIVIDENDS AND ADVANCES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES. APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO RESTRICT PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES AND
INVESTMENTS AND REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH PROTECTIONS FOR LOAN, DEPOSIT, BROKERAGE, FIDUCIARY, MUTUAL FUND AND OTHER CUSTOMERS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO
COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING, TERRORIST FINANCING, AND TRANSACTIONS WITH PERSONS, COMPANIES OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY U.S. AUTHORITIES. THE CONSEQUENCES OF NONCOMPLIANCE CAN INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY AND NONMONETARY SANCTIONS AS WELL AS
DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION AND SUPERVISION BY BANKING AND OTHER
REGULATORY BODIES. EXAMINATION REPORTS AND RATINGS (WHICH OFTEN ARE NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE) AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE CONDUCT, GROWTH, AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES. 
 DUE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND ISSUES FACING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE NEW LEGISLATIVE AND
REGULATORY INITIATIVES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, INCLUDING MANY FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES IN WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED. THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE ACTIONS ALREADY TAKEN BY CONGRESS AND THE
REGULATORS, THROUGH ENACTMENT OF THE CREDIT CARD ACT, THE SAFE ACT, AND DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE REAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES ACT, THE FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT,

AND THE ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER ACT. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES HAVE HAD AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS. THIS IMPACT COULD INCLUDE RULES
AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE NATURE AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, HOW WE USE OUR CAPITAL, HOW WE COMPENSATE AND INCENT OUR EMPLOYEES, THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES, AND OTHER MATTERS POTENTIALLY
HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS RESULTS AND PROSPECTS. UNDER THE REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, A BANK HOLDING COMPANY
IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL STRENGTH FOR ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS. AS A RESULT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD REQUIRE PNC TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO PNC BANK, N.A. WHEN DOING SO IS NOT OTHERWISE IN THE INTERESTS OF PNC OR ITS
SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES,
PRINCIPALLY PNC BANK, N.A. BANKS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION THAT LIMITS AND GOVERNS THE PAYOUT OF DIVIDENDS TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES. WE
DISCUSS THESE AND OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES APPLICABLE TO PNC, INCLUDING SOME PARTICULAR AREAS OF CURRENT REGULATORY FOCUS OR CONCERN, IN THE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION SECTION INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT AND IN NOTE 22 REGULATORY MATTERS
IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT. A FAILURE TO COMPLY, OR TO HAVE ADEQUATE POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO COMPLY, WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD EXPOSE US TO DAMAGES, FINES AND REGULATORY PENALTIES AND OTHER REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, AND COULD ALSO INJURE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM
WE DO BUSINESS. WE MUST COMPLY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD,
ACCOUNTING, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER RULES SET FORTH BY THE SEC, INCOME TAX AND OTHER REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. TREASURY AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXING AUTHORITIES, AND REVENUE RULINGS AND OTHER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE,
WHICH AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, OR INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE STANDARDS, CAN
IMPACT OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND EXPENSE POLICIES AND AFFECT OUR ESTIMATION METHODS USED TO PREPARE THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CHANGES IN INCOME TAX REGULATIONS, REVENUE RULINGS, REVENUE PROCEDURES, AND OTHER GUIDANCE CAN IMPACT OUR
TAX LIABILITY AND ALTER THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH TAX DEDUCTIONS AND PAYMENTS. NEW GUIDANCE OFTEN DICTATES HOW CHANGES TO STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS ARE TO BE PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS EITHER AN ADJUSTMENT
TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE PERIOD OR AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CURRENT

PERIOD EARNINGS. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES MAY BE APPLIED TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED DISCLOSURES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS ALLOWANCES AND IMPAIRMENTS TAKEN ON OUR ASSETS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE, AND INACCURATE ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL
POSITION. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS ALLOWANCES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS VARIES BY ASSET TYPE AND IS BASED UPON OUR PERIODIC
EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF KNOWN AND INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESPECTIVE ASSET CLASS. SUCH EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE REVISED AS CONDITIONS CHANGE AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MANAGEMENT UPDATES ITS EVALUATIONS REGULARLY
AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ALLOWANCES AND IMPAIRMENTS IN OPERATIONS AS SUCH EVALUATIONS ARE REVISED. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO DETERMINE LOSS ALLOWANCE AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THIS
AREA, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ACCURATELY ASSESSED THE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENTS TAKEN AND ALLOWANCES REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FURTHERMORE, ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENTS MAY NEED TO BE TAKEN OR ALLOWANCES PROVIDED FOR IN
THE FUTURE. HISTORICAL TRENDS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OR ALLOWANCES. OUR ASSET VALUATION MAY INCLUDE METHODOLOGIES,
ESTIMATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS AND THIS, ALONG WITH MARKET FACTORS SUCH AS VOLATILITY IN ONE OR MORE MARKETS, COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO ASSET VALUATIONS THAT MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE MUST USE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND JUDGMENTS WHEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AND REPORTED
AT FAIR VALUE. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE INHERENTLY RESULT IN A HIGHER DEGREE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT VOLATILITY. FAIR VALUES AND THE INFORMATION USED TO RECORD VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON
QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND/OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN SUCH THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE PRIMARILY BY USING CASH FLOW AND OTHER FINANCIAL MODELING
TECHNIQUES UTILIZING ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER RELEVANT INPUTS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING FACTORS OR ASSUMPTIONS IN ANY OF THE AREAS UNDERLYING OUR ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DURING PERIODS OF MARKET DISRUPTION, INCLUDING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANTLY RISING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES,
RAPIDLY WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS OR ILLIQUIDITY, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS IF TRADING BECOMES LESS FREQUENT AND/OR MARKET DATA BECOMES LESS OBSERVABLE. THERE MAY BE CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES THAT WERE HISTORICALLY IN ACTIVE
MARKETS WITH SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE DATA THAT RAPIDLY BECOME ILLIQUID DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, A LOSS IN MARKET CONFIDENCE OR OTHER FACTORS. IN SUCH CASES, VALUATIONS IN CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES MAY REQUIRE

22 THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FORM 10-K 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

MORE SUBJECTIVITY AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT; VALUATIONS MAY INCLUDE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE LESS OBSERVABLE OR REQUIRE GREATER ESTIMATION. FURTHER, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND UNPRECEDENTED MARKET
CONDITIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET (E.G. CREDIT, EQUITY, FIXED INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE) COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE VALUATION OF ASSETS AS REPORTED WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN VALUE COULD VARY
SIGNIFICANTLY. THERE ARE RISKS RESULTING FROM THE EXTENSIVE USE OF MODELS IN OUR BUSINESS. 
 PNC RELIES ON QUANTITATIVE MODELS TO MEASURE RISKS AND TO ESTIMATE CERTAIN FINANCIAL VALUES. MODELS MAY BE USED IN SUCH PROCESSES AS DETERMINING THE
PRICING OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS, GRADING LOANS AND EXTENDING CREDIT, MEASURING INTEREST RATE AND OTHER MARKET RISKS, PREDICTING LOSSES, ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND CALCULATING REGULATORY CAPITAL LEVELS, AS WELL AS TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS AND BALANCE SHEETS ITEMS. POORLY DESIGNED OR IMPLEMENTED MODELS PRESENT THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS DECISIONS BASED ON INFORMATION INCORPORATING MODELS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DUE TO THE INADEQUACY OF THAT INFORMATION. ALSO,
INFORMATION WE PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC OR TO OUR REGULATORS BASED ON POORLY DESIGNED OR IMPLEMENTED MODELS COULD BE INACCURATE OR MISLEADING. SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT OUR REGULATORS MAKE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR
SHAREHOLDERS, COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY DUE TO THEIR PERCEPTION THAT THE QUALITY OF THE MODELS USED TO GENERATE THE RELEVANT INFORMATION IS INSUFFICIENT. SEE THE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PORTION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION INCLUDED IN ITEM 7
OF THIS REPORT. WE ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL RISK. LIKE ALL BUSINESSES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL RISK, WHICH REPRESENTS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS, HUMAN ERROR AND EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL
RISK ALSO ENCOMPASSES TECHNOLOGY, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL RISK, WHICH IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM VIOLATIONS OF, OR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH, LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, PRESCRIBED PRACTICES OR ETHICAL STANDARDS, AS WELL AS THE RISK OF OUR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH OUR OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS, AND THE EFFECT THAT CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OR CAPABILITIES OF OUR OUTSOURCING VENDORS CAN HAVE ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM
OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE SEEK TO MITIGATE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS WHICH WE REVIEW AND UPDATE, NO SYSTEM OF CONTROLS, HOWEVER WELL DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED, IS INFALLIBLE. CONTROL
WEAKNESSES OR FAILURES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL RISKS COULD RESULT IN CHARGES, INCREASED OPERATIONAL COSTS, HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR FOREGONE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE CONTINUALLY ENCOUNTER TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND WE COULD FALTER IN OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE
IN THIS ARENA. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS CONTINUALLY UNDERGOING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WITH FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW
TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY INCREASES EFFICIENCY AND ENABLES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO BETTER SERVE CUSTOMERS AND TO REDUCE COSTS. OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE
NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS BY USING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT SATISFY CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND CREATE EFFICIENCIES IN OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW
US TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE OR BE SUCCESSFUL IN MARKETING THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MAY
EXPERIENCE INTERRUPTIONS OR BREACHES IN SECURITY. WE RELY HEAVILY ON COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. ANY
FAILURE, INTERRUPTION OR BREACH IN SECURITY OF THESE SYSTEMS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS TO OUR ACCOUNTING, DEPOSIT, LOAN AND OTHER SYSTEMS, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO
PREVENT OR LIMIT THE EFFECT OF THESE POSSIBLE EVENTS, THERE REMAINS THE RISK THAT SUCH A FAILURE, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY BREACH MIGHT OCCUR AND, IF IT DOES OCCUR, THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY REMEDIATED. 
 RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL WELL-PUBLICIZED SERIES OF APPARENTLY RELATED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS ON LARGE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING
PNC. IN A DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK, HACKERS FLOOD COMMERCIAL WEBSITES WITH EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH VOLUMES OF TRAFFIC, WITH THE GOAL OF DISRUPTING THE ABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS AND POSSIBLY MAKING THEIR WEBSITES
UNAVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. THE RECENT ATTACKS AGAINST PNC RESULTED IN TEMPORARY DISRUPTIONS IN CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CORPORATE WEBSITE AND TO PERFORM ON-LINE BANKING TRANSACTIONS, ALTHOUGH NO CUSTOMER DATA
WAS LOST OR COMPROMISED. FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF NOT DIRECTED AT PNC SPECIFICALLY, ATTACKS ON OTHER ENTITIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS OR ON WHOM WE OTHERWISE RELY OR ATTACKS ON FINANCIAL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS IMPORTANT TO THE OVERALL FUNCTIONING OF THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ASPECTS OF PNC S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASING
EFFORTS ON THE PART OF THIRD PARTIES TO BREACH DATA SECURITY AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING SCHEMES SUCH AS PHISHING. THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO
BANK REMOTELY, INCLUDING ONLINE AND THROUGH MOBILE DEVICES, REQUIRES SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND INCREASES THE RISK OF DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED TO ATTACK FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
CHANGE FREQUENTLY (AND GENERALLY INCREASING IN SOPHISTICATION), OFTEN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED AGAINST A TARGET, MAY BE SUPPORTED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR OTHER WELL-FINANCED ENTITIES, AND MAY ORIGINATE FROM LESS REGULATED AND REMOTE AREAS
AROUND THE WORLD, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADDRESS THESE TECHNIQUES IN ADVANCE OF ATTACKS, INCLUDING BY IMPLEMENTING ADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. 
 DESPITE TEMPORARY DISRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO DATE THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON
PNC. NONETHELESS, THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY BREACH OF OUR SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY IF WIDESPREAD OR RESULTING IN FINANCIAL LOSSES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, COULD DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF PNC, RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMER
BUSINESS, SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY SCRUTINY, OR EXPOSE US TO CIVIL LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER EFFORTS TO BREACH OR DISRUPT OUR SYSTEMS HAS LED, AND WE EXPECT WILL
CONTINUE TO LEAD, TO INCREASED COSTS TO PNC WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF THESE RISKS, AS WELL AS COSTS REIMBURSING CUSTOMERS FOR LOSSES SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS. SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS OR SYSTEMS FAILURES AT OTHER LARGE
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHETHER OR NOT PNC IS INCLUDED, COULD LEAD TO A GENERAL LOSS OF CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PNC S BUSINESS, ADDITIONAL DEMANDS ON THE PART OF OUR REGULATORS, AND
INCREASED COSTS TO DEAL WITH RISKS IDENTIFIED AS A RESULT OF THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING OTHERS. OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE
IMPACTED MATERIALLY BY ADVERSE RESULTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LEGAL LIABILITY. WE
HAVE BEEN NAMED OR THREATENED TO BE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS LAWSUITS ARISING FROM OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (AND IN SOME CASES FROM THE ACTIVITIES OF COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED). IN ADDITION, WE ARE REGULARLY THE SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER FORMS OF REGULATORY INQUIRY. WE ALSO ARE AT RISK WHEN WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY OTHERS FOR LOSSES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUIRIES, THEY FACE, SUCH AS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF A BUSINESS OR ASSETS BY US. THE RESULTS OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR PENALTIES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE WAY IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, OR REPUTATIONAL HARM. 
 ALTHOUGH WE ESTABLISH ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN INFORMATION RELATED TO THE LOSS CONTINGENCIES REPRESENTED BY THOSE MATTERS INDICATES BOTH THAT
A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, WE DO NOT HAVE ACCRUALS FOR ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WHERE WE FACE A RISK OF LOSS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE INHERENT SUBJECTIVITY OF THE ASSESSMENTS AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE
OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AMOUNTS ACCRUED MAY NOT REPRESENT THE ULTIMATE LOSS TO US FROM THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN QUESTION. THUS, OUR ULTIMATE

LOSSES MAY BE HIGHER, AND POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANTLY SO, THAN THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR LEGAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES. WE DISCUSS FURTHER THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND DESCRIBE SOME OF OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN NOTE 23 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN
ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT. OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY DISASTERS,
NATURAL OR OTHERWISE, BY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR BY INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES. NEITHER THE OCCURRENCE NOR THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF
DISASTERS (SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES, TORNADOES, FLOODS, FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, AND OTHER SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENTS), TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES CAN BE PREDICTED. HOWEVER, THESE OCCURRENCES COULD
IMPACT US DIRECTLY (FOR EXAMPLE, BY CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR FACILITIES OR PREVENTING US FROM CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE), OR INDIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BORROWERS, DEPOSITORS, OTHER CUSTOMERS,
SUPPLIERS OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. WE COULD ALSO SUFFER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE EXTENT THAT DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES AFFECT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR IN ANY PARTICULAR REGION. THESE
TYPES OF IMPACTS COULD LEAD, FOR EXAMPLE, TO AN INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES, BANKRUPTCIES OR DEFAULTS THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR EXPERIENCING HIGHER LEVELS OF NONPERFORMING ASSETS, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES. 
 OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH OCCURRENCES IS IN PART DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF OUR RESILIENCY PLANNING, AND OUR ABILITY, IF
ANY, TO ANTICIPATE THE NATURE OF ANY SUCH EVENT THAT OCCURS. THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF DISASTERS OR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES ALSO COULD BE INCREASED TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A LACK OF PREPAREDNESS ON THE PART OF NATIONAL OR
REGIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS OR ON THE PART OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT WE DEAL WITH, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WE DEPEND UPON BUT HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS. 

AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY S SECURITIES INVOLVES CERTAIN RISKS AS DISCUSSED BELOW. HOWEVER, THE
RISKS SET FORTH BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THE COMPANY FACES, AND IT FACES OTHER RISKS WHICH HAVE
NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED OR WHICH ARE NOT YET OTHERWISE PREDICTABLE. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS
OCCUR OR ARE OTHERWISE REALIZED, THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS
DESCRIBED BELOW AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES AND SCHEDULES THERETO, PRIOR TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION WITH
REGARD TO THE COMPANY S SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION BEING PRICE,
QUALITY OF SERVICE, QUALITY OF PRODUCTS, PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, CREDIT TERMS AND THE PROVISION OF
VALUE-ADDED SERVICES, SUCH AS MERCHANDISING DESIGN, IN-STORE SERVICE AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. THE
COMPANY ENCOUNTERS COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF REGIONAL AND NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, SOME OF
WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY AND MAY OFFER A GREATER VARIETY OF
PRODUCTS. IF THESE COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECTING ITS SALES. 

HILLMAN HAS, IN THE PAST, EXPERIENCED SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS FROM
QUARTER TO QUARTER. TYPICALLY, THE FIRST CALENDAR QUARTER IS THE WEAKEST DUE TO THE EFFECT OF
WEATHER ON HOME PROJECTS AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

7

LARGE
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION AND THE INABILITY TO
PENETRATE NEW CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS. 

THE COMPANY S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 38.8 OF SALES FOR 2005. THE LOSS
OF ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE CUSTOMERS
COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BUSINESS. THE COMPANY S INABILITY TO PENETRATE NEW CHANNELS OF
DISTRIBUTION MAY ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS FUTURE SALES AND BUSINESS.

SUCCESSFUL
SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS DEPEND ON THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO
RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. 

THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY S EFFORTS TO GROW ITS
BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ABILITIES OF KEY EXECUTIVES, ITS SALES FORCE AND OTHER
PERSONNEL, INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF ITS SALES FORCE TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE CUSTOMER COVERAGE.
THE COMPANY MUST THEREFORE CONTINUE TO RECRUIT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE MANAGEMENT, SALES AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT BUSINESS AND SUPPORT ITS PROJECTED GROWTH. A SHORTAGE OF THESE KEY EMPLOYEES MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS GROWTH STRATEGY.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. 

THE COMPANY IMPORTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS PRODUCT FROM THE FAR EAST INCLUDING CHINA, TAIWAN
AND INDIA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES OF THESE
COUNTRIES VERSUS THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR.

THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF RAW
MATERIALS, FREIGHT AND ENERGY. 

THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED OF METALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STEEL, ALUMINUM,
ZINC, AND COPPER. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES OTHER COMMODITY BASED MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURE
OF LNS THAT ARE RESIN BASED AND SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF OIL. AS DESCRIBED IN MORE
DETAIL IN ITEM 7 HERETO, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY AND FREIGHT
INFLATION IN RECENT YEARS, AND IT EXPECTS ENERGY AND CERTAIN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY
NON-FERROUS METALS, MAY INCREASE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MITIGATE THESE INFLATION INCREASES
THROUGH VARIOUS CUSTOMER PRICING ACTIONS AND COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, ITS PROFITABILITY MAY BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SOURCING PRODUCT FROM OVERSEAS. 

THE COMPANY IMPORTS LARGE QUANTITIES OF ITS FASTENER PRODUCTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS IMPORT
OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS REQUIREMENTS AND TO TARIFFS AND QUOTAS SET BY GOVERNMENTS THROUGH
MUTUAL AGREEMENTS OR BILATERAL ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COUNTRIES
FROM WHICH THE COMPANY S PRODUCTS
AND MATERIALS ARE MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED MAY FROM TIME TO TIME IMPOSE ADDITIONAL QUOTAS,
DUTIES, TARIFFS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON ITS IMPORTS OR ADVERSELY MODIFY EXISTING RESTRICTIONS.
IMPORTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY VARIATION WHICH MAY INCREASE THE
COMPANY S COST OF GOODS SOLD. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THESE IMPORT COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, OR THE
COMPANY S SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMS REGULATIONS OR SIMILAR LAWS, COULD HARM THE
COMPANY S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED
BY CONDITIONS AT PORTS OR ISSUES THAT OTHERWISE AFFECT TRANSPORTATION AND WAREHOUSING PROVIDERS,
SUCH AS PORT AND SHIPPING CAPACITY, LABOR DISPUTES, SEVERE WEATHER OR INCREASED HOMELAND SECURITY
REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE ISSUES COULD DELAY IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS OR
REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE PORTS OR WAREHOUSING PROVIDERS TO AVOID DISRUPTION TO
CUSTOMERS. THESE ALTERNATIVES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON SHORT NOTICE OR COULD RESULT IN HIGHER
TRANSIT COSTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION.

IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ALL OR PART OF ITS GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED
TRADENAMES, ITS NET INCOME COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER TRANSACTION THE COMPANY HAS 241.5 MILLION OF GOODWILL AND 44.7 MILLION
OF INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADENAMES RECORDED ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE
COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PERIODICALLY DETERMINE IF ITS GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADENAMES HAVE
BECOME IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD WRITE DOWN THE IMPAIRED PORTION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. IF
THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ALL OR PART OF ITS GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADENAMES,
ITS NET INCOME COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

8

THE COMPANY S SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. 

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PROPRIETARY COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS
BUSINESS AND GROWTH STRATEGIES. HILLMAN DEPENDS ON ITS INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO PROCESS ORDERS, TO
MANAGE INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS, TO PURCHASE, SELL AND SHIP PRODUCTS
EFFICIENTLY AND ON A TIMELY BASIS, TO MAINTAIN COST-EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS AND TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR
SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH THE COMPANY HAS
TAKEN AGAINST CERTAIN EVENTS THAT COULD DISRUPT THE OPERATIONS OF ITS INFORMATION SYSTEMS WILL
PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH A DISRUPTION. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE ACQUISITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY S
BUSINESS. 

ONE ELEMENT OF HILLMAN S FUTURE GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO PURSUE SELECTED ACQUISITIONS THAT EITHER
EXPAND OR COMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESSES IN NEW OR EXISTING MARKETS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE
THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR ACQUIRE ACCEPTABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES ON TERMS
FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO FULFILL
HILLMAN S GROWTH STRATEGY.

THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS MAY RESULT IN
UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTIES AND MAY REQUIRE A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT S
ATTENTION, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT HILLMAN WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE
ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE STEELWORKS ACQUISITION IN JANUARY 2006.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY S OUTSTANDING DEBT HAS VARIABLE RATE INTEREST. INCREASES IN
BORROWING RATES WILL INCREASE THE COMPANY S COST OF BORROWING,
WHICH MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF TYPES OF RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE UNDERTAKE A
VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL THOSE RISKS, MANY OF THE RISKS ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.
AMONG THE RISKS WE FACE ARE THE FOLLOWING:

CREDIT RISK: THE RISK THAT LOAN CUSTOMERS OR OTHER PARTIES WILL BE UNABLE TO
PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; 

MARKET RISK: THE RISK THAT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES WILL ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION; 

LIQUIDITY RISK: THE RISK THAT HORIZON OR THE BANK WILL HAVE INSUFFICIENT CASH OR
ACCESS TO CASH TO MEET ITS OPERATING NEEDS; AND 

OPERATIONAL RISK: THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL
PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS, OR EXTERNAL EVENTS. 

INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THESE RISKS AND THE OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED
BELOW. ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. THE RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT, HOWEVER, THE ONLY ONES THAT WE MAY FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE NOT MATERIAL, COULD
ALSO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR
COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS, OBTAIN LOW-COST FUNDS AND COMPETE WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF
FINANCIAL SERVICES. 

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR HISTORY OF RECORD EARNINGS YEAR AFTER YEAR WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE PART,
ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND OBTAIN LOW-COST
FUNDS. DURING 2005 AND 2006, WE FOCUSED ON INCREASING CONSUMER LOANS, AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO
EMPHASIZE AND GROW CONSUMER, AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL TYPES OF LOANS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THIS
REPRESENTED A SHIFT IN OUR EMPHASIS FROM 2002 AND 2003 WHEN WE FOCUSED ON MORTGAGE BANKING
SERVICES, WHICH GENERATED A LARGE PORTION OF OUR INCOME DURING THOSE YEARS.

12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE HAVE ALSO FUNDED OUR GROWTH WITH LOW-COST CONSUMER DEPOSITS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR
GROWTH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IN ATTRACTING SUCH DEPOSITS OR FINDING OTHER
SOURCES OF LOW-COST FUNDS.

ANOTHER FACTOR IN MAINTAINING OUR HISTORY OF RECORD EARNINGS WILL BE OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR
SCOPE OF AVAILABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.
IN ADDITION TO OTHER BANKS, OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE CREDIT UNIONS, SECURITIES DEALERS, BROKERS,
MORTGAGE BANKERS, INVESTMENT ADVISORS, AND FINANCE AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION IS INTENSE
IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE COMPETE ON PRICE AND SERVICE WITH OUR COMPETITORS. COMPETITION COULD
INTENSIFY IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM NONBANKS, GREATER TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY, AND
BANKING REFORM.

OUR COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOANS EXPOSE US TO INCREASED CREDIT RISKS. 

WE HAVE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOANS. COMMERCIAL LOANS GENERALLY HAVE
GREATER CREDIT RISK THAN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BECAUSE REPAYMENT OF THESE LOANS OFTEN DEPENDS
ON THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE BORROWERS. THESE LOANS ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE MUCH
LARGER LOAN BALANCES THAN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. CONSUMER LOANS GENERALLY INVOLVE GREATER
RISK THAN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNSECURED OR SECURED BY ASSETS THAT
DEPRECIATE IN VALUE. ALTHOUGH WE UNDERTAKE A VARIETY OF UNDERWRITING, MONITORING AND RESERVING
PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THESE TYPES OF LOANS, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL NOT SUFFER
UNEXPECTED LOSSES.

CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET
INTEREST RATES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTEREST INCOME THAT WE EARN ON OUR INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS AND THE
INTEREST EXPENSE THAT WE PAY ON OUR INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES. OUR PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON OUR
ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING PERIODS OF CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES. IF
RATES INCREASE RAPIDLY AS A RESULT OF AN IMPROVING ECONOMY, WE MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THE RATES PAID
ON OUR DEPOSITS AND BORROWED FUNDS MORE QUICKLY THAN LOANS AND INVESTMENTS REPRICE, RESULTING IN A
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST SPREADS AND NET INTEREST INCOME. THE IMPACT OF RISING RATES COULD BE
COMPOUNDED IF DEPOSIT CUSTOMERS MOVE FUNDS FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO HIGHER RATE CERTIFICATE OF
DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. CONVERSELY, SHOULD MARKET INTEREST RATES FALL BELOW CURRENT LEVELS, OUR NET
INTEREST MARGIN COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, AS COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD KEEP US FROM
FURTHER REDUCING RATES ON OUR DEPOSITS, AND PREPAYMENTS AND CURTAILMENTS ON ASSETS MAY CONTINUE.
SUCH MOVEMENTS MAY CAUSE A DECREASE IN OUR INTEREST RATE SPREAD AND NET INTEREST MARGIN, AND
THEREFORE, DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REINVESTMENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN
INTEREST RATES MAY AFFECT THE AVERAGE LIFE OF LOANS AND MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES. INCREASES IN
INTEREST RATES MAY DECREASE LOAN DEMAND AND/OR MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BORROWERS TO REPAY
ADJUSTABLE RATE LOANS. DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES OFTEN RESULT IN INCREASED PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS
AND MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES, AS BORROWERS REFINANCE THEIR LOANS TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS.
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REINVESTMENT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO
REINVEST THE CASH RECEIVED FROM SUCH PREPAYMENTS IN LOANS OR OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE INTEREST
RATES THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THE INTEREST RATES ON EXISTING LOANS AND SECURITIES.

AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN NORTHWESTERN INDIANA AND SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR PRIMARY MARKET AREA FOR DEPOSITS AND LOANS CONSISTS OF LAPORTE AND PORTER COUNTIES IN
NORTHWESTERN INDIANA AND BERRIEN COUNTY IN SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN. AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THESE
AREAS COULD HURT OUR BUSINESS. POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A DOWNTURN COULD INCLUDE THE
FOLLOWING:

INCREASES IN LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND FORECLOSURES; 

DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE AND OTHER COLLATERAL FOR LOANS; AND 

A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 

13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. 

AS A CONDITION TO THE APPROVAL OF OUR ACQUISITION OF ALLIANCE FINANCIAL CORPORATION IN 2005, THE
OCC, OUR PRIMARY REGULATOR, REQUIRED US TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AT 100 BASIS POINTS
ABOVE THE WELL CAPITALIZED MINIMUMS. THIS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS NOT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THESE HIGHER CAPITAL LEVELS BY LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO GROW
ASSETS. THE OCC HAS NOT TOLD US WHEN THESE INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL BE LIFTED, BUT AS
OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE EXCEEDED THESE HEIGHTENED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LOANS FOR CAPITAL
PURPOSES, THIS COULD RESTRICT THE CAPITAL WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER GROWTH. 

WE PURCHASE HOME MORTGAGES FROM MORTGAGE COMPANIES UNDER WAREHOUSE AGREEMENTS WHEREBY THE MORTGAGE
COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY CLASSIFIED THESE LOANS AS HOME
MORTGAGE LOANS FOR CALL REPORT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES AS OPPOSED TO TREATING THEM AS
 OTHER LOANS. DURING THE COURSE OF A ROUTINE, PERIODIC EXAMINATION BY BANK REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE EXAMINATION PERSONNEL RAISED THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OUR MORTGAGE
WAREHOUSE LOANS SHOULD BE TREATED AS OTHER LOANS FOR CALL REPORT PURPOSES. WE SUBMITTED A
POSITION STATEMENT TO THE REGULATORS IN 2003 SUBSTANTIATING OUR CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LOANS AND
HAD VARIOUS FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEREAFTER. THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE NEVER
REQUIRED US TO CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LOANS, AND WE BELIEVE THE MATTER IS RESOLVED;
ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE NEVER TOLD US THIS MATTER IS SETTLED AND RECENTLY INFORMED
US THAT THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERING THE ISSUE. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE OUR TREATMENT OF THESE
LOANS, IT WILL CHANGE OUR CALCULATIONS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND REDUCE OUR RISK-BASED CAPITAL
RATIOS WHICH MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR ASSETS.

BECAUSE OUR STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SELL YOUR SHARES OR BUY
ADDITIONAL SHARES WHEN YOU DESIRE TO DO SO AND THE PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. 

ALTHOUGH OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN LISTED ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET SINCE DECEMBER 2001 AND
SINCE FEBRUARY 1, 2007, HAS BEEN LISTED ON NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET, OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED.
AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME DURING 2006 WAS ONLY 3,476 SHARES. THE PRICES OF THINLY TRADED
STOCKS, SUCH AS OURS, ARE TYPICALLY MORE VOLATILE THAN STOCKS TRADED IN A LARGE, ACTIVE PUBLIC
MARKET AND CAN BE MORE EASILY IMPACTED BY SALES OR PURCHASES OF LARGE BLOCKS OF STOCK. THINLY
TRADED STOCKS ARE ALSO LESS LIQUID, AND BECAUSE OF THE LOW VOLUME OF TRADES, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO
SELL YOUR SHARES WHEN YOU DESIRE TO DO SO.

THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES THAT MAY VARY FROM ACTUAL
RESULTS. 

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT
ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ONE OF OUR MOST CRITICAL ESTIMATES IS THE LEVEL OF
THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. DUE TO THE INHERENT NATURE OF THESE ESTIMATES, WE CANNOT PROVIDE
ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND/OR SUSTAIN
LOAN LOSSES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PROVIDED ALLOWANCE.

OUR MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE AND INDIRECT LENDING OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER FRAUD RISK THAN OUR
OTHER LENDING OPERATIONS. 

WE BUY LOANS ORIGINATED BY MORTGAGE BANKERS AND AUTOMOBILE DEALERS. BECAUSE WE MUST RELY ON THE
MORTGAGE BANKERS AND AUTOMOBILE DEALERS IN MAKING AND DOCUMENTING THESE LOANS, THERE IS AN
INCREASED RISK OF FRAUD TO US ON THE PART OF THE THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS AND THE UNDERLYING
BORROWERS. IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINST THIS INCREASED RISK, WE PERFORM INVESTIGATIONS ON THE LOAN
ORIGINATORS WE DO BUSINESS WITH, AND WE REVIEW THE LOAN FILES AND LOAN DOCUMENTS WE PURCHASE TO
ATTEMPT TO DETECT ANY IRREGULARITIES OR LEGAL NONCOMPLIANCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT
OUR PROCEDURES WILL DETECT ALL CASES OF FRAUD OR LEGAL NONCOMPLIANCE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION AND CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR REGULATOR
POLICIES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY MAJOR CHANGES IN THE FUTURE
AND THEIR EFFECTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE.

OUR INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ACCURATELY PROCESS LARGE VOLUMES OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY
IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE PROCESS LARGE VOLUMES OF TRANSACTIONS. IF SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL
CONTROL SHOULD FAIL TO WORK AS EXPECTED, IF SYSTEMS ARE USED IN AN UNAUTHORIZED MANNER, OR IF
EMPLOYEES SUBVERT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES COULD RESULT.

WE PROCESS LARGE VOLUMES OF TRANSACTIONS ON A DAILY BASIS AND ARE EXPOSED TO NUMEROUS TYPES OF
OPERATIONAL RISK. OPERATIONAL RISK RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE
AND SYSTEMS INCLUDES THE RISK OF FRAUD BY PERSONS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE COMPANY, THE EXECUTION OF
UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, ERRORS RELATING TO TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND SYSTEMS, AND
BREACHES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. THIS RISK OF LOSS ALSO
INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTIONS THAT COULD ARISE AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATIONAL DEFICIENCY OR
AS A RESULT OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY STANDARDS.

WE ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL OPERATIONAL CONTROLS THAT PROVIDE US WITH TIMELY AND
ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK. WHILE NOT FOOLPROOF, THESE SYSTEMS HAVE
BEEN DESIGNED TO MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE, COST-EFFECTIVE LEVELS. PROCEDURES EXIST
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT POLICIES RELATING TO CONDUCT, ETHICS, AND BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE
FOLLOWED. FROM TIME TO TIME, LOSSES FROM OPERATIONAL RISK MAY OCCUR, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF
OPERATIONAL ERRORS.

WHILE WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR AND IMPROVE THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS,
AND CORPORATE-WIDE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE LOSSES WILL NOT
OCCUR.

ITEM 1 
 BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 
 
 SEARS OIL AND GAS CORPORATION SRSG ), A NEVADA CORPORATION, WAS INCORPORATED ON OCTOBER 18, 2005. AT THE TIME SRSG WAS ORGANIZED ITS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE WAS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MANY AND VARIED OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED WITHIN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. SRSG INTENDED TO EXPLOIT MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS THROUGHOUT THE NATURAL RESOURCES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING OIL, GAS AND MINING AREAS. HOWEVER, AFTER VARIOUS FAILED EFFORTS, THE PRINCIPALS SOLD CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY NOW SEEKS ANOTHER COMPANY WITH WHICH TO MERGE OR ACQUIRE FOR STOCK. SRSG HAS NEVER DECLARED BANKRUPTCY, IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN RECEIVERSHIP, AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS. SINCE INCORPORATION, SRSG HAS NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS, NOR HAS IT BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS OR CONSOLIDATIONS. SRSG HAS NO SUBSIDIARIES. OUR FISCAL YEAR END IS DECEMBER 31ST. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
 THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO SEEK, INVESTIGATE AND, IF WARRANTED, ACQUIRE AN INTEREST IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY FIRM CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS WITH WHICH THE COMPANY DESIRES TO BECOME INVOLVED AND WILL CONSIDER PARTICIPATING IN A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES OR AREAS WITH NO LIMITATION AS TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE ENTERPRISE. THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE UNRESTRICTED DISCRETION IN REVIEWING, ANALYZING, AND ULTIMATELY SELECTING A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE FOR ACQUISITION OR PARTICIPATION BY THE COMPANY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ANY ENTERPRISE ULTIMATELY SELECTED WILL BE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON ITS ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ENTERPRISE, AS WELL AS ITS BUSINESS PLAN, POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH, AND OTHER FACTORS, NONE OF WHICH CAN BE ANTICIPATED TO BE CONTROLLING. IF THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO LOCATE A SUITABLE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, THE DECISION TO ACQUIRE OR PARTICIPATE IN THE ENTERPRISE MAY BE MADE BY THE COMPANY S BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. APPROVAL MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED PURSUANT TO THE CONSENT OF A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS AND, SINCE THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY OWN APPROXIMATELY 96 OF THE COMPANY S OUTSTANDING SHARES, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO APPROVE ANY TRANSACTION WITH THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES. FURTHER, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE ACQUISITION OF OR PARTICIPATION IN AN ENTERPRISE MAY INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE BY THE COMPANY OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE COMPANY, WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE RESPECTIVE EQUITY INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS AND MAY ALSO RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF THE COMPANY S NET TANGIBLE ASSET VALUE PER SHARE. 
 
 THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RISKS WHICH ARISE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY HAS NO SPECIFIC BUSINESS AND MAY ACQUIRE OR PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BASED ON THE DECISION OF MANAGEMENT WHICH WILL, IN ALL PROBABILITY, ACT WITHOUT THE CONSENT, VOTE, OR APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY S STOCKHOLDERS. THE RISKS FACED BY THE COMPANY ARE FURTHER INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ITS LIMITED RESOURCES AND ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE A PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY WITH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. (SEE ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS. 
 
 ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OR PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS SUITABLE FOR ACQUISITION OR PARTICIPATION BY THE COMPANY OR THAT IF AN ENTERPRISE IS LOCATED, IT CAN BE ACQUIRED ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. SIMILARLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

 4 

THAT IF ANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IS ACQUIRED, IT WILL PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT S EXPECTATIONS OR RESULT IN ANY PROFIT TO THE COMPANY OR APPRECIATION IN THE MARKET PRICE FOR THE COMPANY S SHARES. 
 
 IF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE, THE SELECTION OF AN OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH TO PARTICIPATE WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY AND MAY BE MADE ON MANAGEMENT S ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITY OF THE OTHER COMPANY S MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL, THE ANTICIPATED ACCEPTABILITY OF NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETING CONCEPTS, THE MERIT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ANALYZE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ANY OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND ACQUIRE ANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS. 
 
 IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE INTRODUCED TO THE COMPANY FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING ITS SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, AND HIS BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CONTACTS, PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS SUCH AS ATTORNEYS AND ACCOUNTANTS, SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, VENTURE CAPITALISTS, MEMBERS OF THE FRANCHISE COMMUNITY, AND OTHERS WHO MAY PRESENT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS. 
 
 THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT ITS SEARCH TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO A BUSINESS OR OPPORTUNITY INVOLVING A START-UP OR NEW COMPANY OR AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE STATUS OF ANY BUSINESS IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAY BECOME ENGAGED. 
 
 THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY CANNOT BE PREDICTED AND WILL DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE COMPANY S CONTROL, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANY TO COMPLETE ITS INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE TIME REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS PROVIDING FOR THE COMPANY S PARTICIPATION, AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE REVIEWED AND, ON THE BASIS OF THAT REVIEW, THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OR METHOD DEEMED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE MOST SUITABLE WILL BE SELECTED. THE STRUCTURE MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, MERGERS, REORGANIZATIONS, LEASES, PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS, LICENSES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY MAY ACT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTEREST IN A PARTNERSHIP, CORPORATION, OR OTHER FORM OF ORGANIZATION. IMPLEMENTING THE STRUCTURE MAY REQUIRE THE MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR REORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY WITH OTHER CORPORATIONS OR FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE THE SURVIVING ENTITY. IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING SHARES OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWING A REORGANIZATION TRANSACTION. AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION, ALL OR A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY S DIRECTORS MAY RESIGN AND NEW DIRECTORS MAY BE APPOINTED WITHOUT ANY VOTE BY THE STOCKHOLDERS. 
 
 THE COMPANY WILL MOST LIKELY ACQUIRE A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BY ISSUING SHARES OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK TO THE OWNERS OF THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. ALTHOUGH THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION CANNOT BE PREDICTED, IN MANY INSTANCES THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ENTITY WILL REQUIRE THAT THE TRANSACTION BY WHICH THE COMPANY ACQUIRES ITS PARTICIPATION BE TAX-FREE UNDER SECTIONS 351 OR 368 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 (THE CODE ). IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ACQUISITION WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL DILUTION TO THE EQUITY OF THOSE WHO WERE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. 
 
 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY IS TECHNICALLY THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WILL ORDINARILY REQUIRE THAT THE TRANSACTION BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THE COMPANY HAD BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE OTHER ENTITY OWNING THE BUSINESS VENTURE OR OPPORTUNITY AND, THEREFORE, WILL NOT PERMIT A WRITE UP IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OF THE OTHER COMPANY. 
 
 IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SECURITIES ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE ISSUED IN RELIANCE ON EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER, AS A NEGOTIATED ELEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY MAY AGREE TO REGISTER SUCH SECURITIES EITHER AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS CONSUMMATED OR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OR AT SPECIFIED TIMES THEREAFTER. THE ISSUANCE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES AND THEIR POTENTIAL SALE INTO ANY TRADING MARKET WHICH MAY DEVELOP IN THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE FOR THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK. 
 
 THE COMPANY WILL PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ONLY AFTER THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF A WRITTEN AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT CANNOT BE PREDICTED, GENERALLY THE AGREEMENT WOULD REQUIRE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY ALL OF THE PARTIES THERETO, SPECIFY CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT, DETAIL THE TERMS OF CLOSING AND THE CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE SATISFIED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES THERETO PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, SET FORTH REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, AND INCLUDE MISCELLANEOUS OTHER TERMS. 
 
 IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS BROAD DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE MANNER BY WHICH THE COMPANY WILL PARTICIPATE IN A PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AND MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS HAVING A POTENTIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS IN THAT THEIR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY MAY BE REDUCED WITHOUT ANY INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THEIR INVESTMENT OR THAT THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AN INTEREST MAY ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE UNPROFITABLE. THE TRANSACTION MAY BE CONSUMMATED WITHOUT BEING SUBMITTED TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, HOWEVER, THE PROPOSED PARTICIPATION IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY MAY BE SUBMITTED TO THE STOCKHOLDERS FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION, EITHER VOLUNTARILY BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SEEK THE STOCKHOLDERS ADVICE OR CONSENT OR BECAUSE OF A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO BY STATE LAW. 

5 

THE INVESTIGATION OF SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND THE NEGOTIATION, DRAFTING, AND EXECUTION OF RELEVANT AGREEMENTS, DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND ATTENTION AND SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ACCOUNTANTS, ATTORNEYS, AND OTHERS. IF A DECISION IS MADE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, THE COSTS PREVIOUSLY INCURRED IN THE RELATED INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED FOR THE PARTICIPATION IN A SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, THE FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THAT TRANSACTION MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS TO THE COMPANY OF THE RELATED COSTS INCURRED. 
 
 THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION OF AN INTEREST IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND INTEREST ACQUIRED. THE SPECIFIC RISKS OF A GIVEN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THE PRESENT TIME. 
 
 THE COMPANY IS NOT REGISTERED AND DOES NOT PROPOSE TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (THE INVESTMENT ACT ). THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES SO AS TO AVOID BEING CLASSIFIED AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT ACT AND, THEREFORE TO AVOID APPLICATION OF THE REGISTRATION AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND THE RELATED REGULATIONS. 
 
 REGULATION 
 
 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT GOVERNMENT REGULATION THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNTIL IT HAS ACQUIRED AN INTEREST IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. THE USE OF ASSETS AND/OR CONDUCT OF BUSINESSES WHICH THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE COULD SUBJECT IT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY, LAND USE, TRADE, OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND STATE OR LOCAL TAXATION. IN SELECTING A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE, MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO ASCERTAIN, TO THE EXTENT OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY, THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION ON THE PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF AN INTEREST IN A NEW OR START-UP BUSINESS ACTIVITY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. THE PRIMARY COMPETITION FOR DESIRABLE INVESTMENTS COMES FROM INVESTMENT BANKERS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES, VENTURE CAPITAL PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATIONS, VENTURE CAPITAL AFFILIATES OF LARGE INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL COMPANIES, SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES, OTHER SHELL COMPANIES, AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. MOST OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EXPERIENCE, RESOURCES, AND MANAGERIAL CAPABILITIES THAN THE COMPANY AND ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. 
 
 FACILITIES 
 
 THE COMPANY S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AT THE HOME OF MARK A. SCHARMANN, OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. BEGINNING AUGUST 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ORAL AGREEMENT TO PAY MR. SCHARMANN 500 PER MONTH AS PAYMENT FOR USE OF HIS PERSONAL RESIDENCE AS THE COMPANY S OFFICE AND MAILING ADDRESS. 
 
 EMPLOYEES 
 
 THE COMPANY HAS NO EMPLOYEES AND ITS BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS ARE HANDLED BY ITS PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE COMPANY ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS, WITHOUT COMPENSATION. MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY MAY ENGAGE CONSULTANTS, ATTORNEYS, AND ACCOUNTANTS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A NEED TO ENGAGE ANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES SO LONG AS IT IS SEEKING AND EVALUATING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

 RISK FACTORS 

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS 
 
 THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONCERNING OUR FUTURE PROGRAMS, EXPENSES, REVENUE, LIQUIDITY AND CASH NEEDS AS WELL AS OUR PLANS AND STRATEGIES. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THIS INFORMATION, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NUMEROUS FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. 
 
 BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY WE WILL CONTINUE ACTIVITIES IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. 
 
 OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION. THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE AS AN ONGOING BUSINESS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. AS SUCH WE MAY HAVE TO CEASE ACTIVITIES AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A MERGER

CANDIDATE FOR OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTAINING OUR STATUS AS A REPORTING COMPANY. 
 
 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 534 CASH AVAILABLE. 
 
 WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE LOSSES WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE ACTIVITIES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF ANY INVESTMENT MADE INTO THE COMPANY. 
 
 WE WERE INCORPORATED ON OCTOBER 18, 2005 AND WE HAVE NOT STARTED ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR REALIZED ANY REVENUES. WE HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH AN EVALUATION OF OUR FUTURE SUCCESS OR FAILURE CAN BE MADE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 OUR NET LOSS SINCE INCEPTION WAS 579,608. BASED UPON CURRENT PLANS, WE EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS. 
 
 AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT GENERATE REVENUES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 IF WE ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE FINANCING THROUGH THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE, THEN SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION. 
 
 THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF FUTURE FINANCING PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US IS THROUGH THE SALE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY SALE OF COMMON STOCK WILL RESULT IN DILUTION OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. THIS MEANS THAT IF WE SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MORE SHARES WILL BE OUTSTANDING AND EACH EXISTING SHAREHOLDER WILL OWN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE SHARES THEN OUTSTANDING. TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WE MAY HAVE TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, WHICH MAY SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY HAVE TO BORROW LARGE SUMS, AND ASSUME DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST AND CAPITAL PAYMENTS. 
 
 BECAUSE THERE IS CURRENTLY LIMITED PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR STOCK . 
 
 OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTC PINK MARKETPLACE, UNDER THE SYMBOL SRSG. WE HAVE LIMITED TRADING. 
 
 BECAUSE OUR SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO PENNY STOCK RULES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RESELLING YOUR SHARES . 
 
 OUR SHARES ARE PENNY STOCKS ARE COVERED BY SECTION 15(G) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WHICH IMPOSES ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER/DEALERS WHO SELL THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES INCLUDING THE DELIVERY OF A STANDARDIZED DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT; DISCLOSURE AND CONFIRMATION OF QUOTATION PRICES; DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION THE BROKER/DEALER RECEIVES; AND, FURNISHING MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS. FOR SALES OF OUR SECURITIES, THE BROKER/DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL SUITABILITY DETERMINATION AND RECEIVE FROM ITS CUSTOMER A WRITTEN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO MAKING A SALE. THE IMPOSITION OF THE FOREGOING ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT A SHAREHOLDER'S ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF HIS STOCK AND AS A RESULT THE INVESTOR MAY LOSE HIS ENTIRE INVESTMENT MADE INTO THE COMPANY.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

 THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND PRESENTED ELSEWHERE BY OUR MANAGEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS, AND YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THEM. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. YOU SHOULD
NOT CONSIDER THIS LIST TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES AND WE MAY UPDATE THEM IN OUR FUTURE PERIODIC REPORTS. 

 RISKS RELATING TO DEBT AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 

WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL DEBT BURDEN THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR CONSOLIDATED MORTGAGES AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, EXCLUDING THE RELATED PREMIUM AND DISCOUNT, TOTALED
 18.0 BILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 1.5 BILLION MATURES DURING 2009, INCLUDING RECURRING PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON MORTGAGES MATURING DURING 2009. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS NORMALLY
ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT FINANCING, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE. OUR DEBT SERVICE COSTS GENERALLY WILL NOT BE REDUCED IF
DEVELOPMENTS AT THE PROPERTY, SUCH AS THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS OR THE LOSS OF MAJOR TENANTS, CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE INCOME FROM THE PROPERTY. SHOULD SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF A PROPERTY IS MORTGAGED TO SECURE PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS AND INCOME FROM THIS IS INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THAT INDEBTEDNESS, THE PROPERTY COULD BE FORECLOSED UPON BY THE MORTGAGEE
RESULTING IN A LOSS OF INCOME AND A DECLINE IN OUR TOTAL ASSET VALUE. 

THE ONGOING DISRUPTION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS EXTERNAL FINANCINGS FOR OUR GROWTH AND ONGOING DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. 

WE DEPEND PRIMARILY ON EXTERNAL FINANCINGS, PRINCIPALLY DEBT FINANCINGS, TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN
MEET ONGOING MATURITIES OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT. OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING DEPENDS ON OUR CREDIT RATING, THE WILLINGNESS OF BANKS TO LEND TO US AND CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE DISRUPTION IN
THE CAPITAL MARKETS THAT BEGAN IN 2008 HAS CONTINUED INTO 2009, RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS FOR MANY COMPANIES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING WE NEED FOR
FUTURE GROWTH OR TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE AS OBLIGATIONS MATURE, OR THAT THE FINANCING AVAILABLE TO US WILL BE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. 

ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATING COULD AFFECT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND BORROWING TERMS. 

OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND PREFERRED STOCK ARE PERIODICALLY RATED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. THE
CREDIT RATINGS ARE BASED ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OTHER FACTORS VIEWED BY THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AS RELEVANT TO OUR INDUSTRY AND
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN GENERAL. OUR CREDIT RATING CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE CAN ACCESS, AS WELL AS THE TERMS OF ANY FINANCING WE OBTAIN. SINCE WE DEPEND PRIMARILY ON DEBT FINANCING TO FUND
OUR GROWTH, ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATING COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE GROWTH. 

OUR HEDGING INTEREST RATE PROTECTION ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY LIMIT OUR INTEREST RATE RISK. 

WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK BY A COMBINATION OF INTEREST RATE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY FIX OR CAP A
PORTION OF OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT, OR IN THE CASE OF A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT TO VARIABLE RATE DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE REFINANCE FIXED RATE DEBT AT TIMES WHEN WE BELIEVE
RATES AND TERMS ARE APPROPRIATE. OUR EFFORTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

OUR
USE OF INTEREST RATE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS TO MANAGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY MAY EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING A RISK THAT A COUNTERPARTY TO A
HEDGING ARRANGEMENT MAY FAIL TO HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS. DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE RISK STRATEGY IS COMPLEX AND NO STRATEGY CAN COMPLETELY INSULATE US FROM RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST
RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. TERMINATION OF THESE HEDGING
AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVES COSTS, SUCH AS TRANSACTION FEES OR BREAKAGE COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 FACTORS AFFECTING REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND OPERATIONS 

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF PROPERTIES. 

WE REGULARLY ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP NEW PROPERTIES AND EXPAND AND REDEVELOP EXISTING PROPERTIES, AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO
VARIOUS RISKS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN PURSUING ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, NEWLY ACQUIRED, DEVELOPED OR REDEVELOPED/EXPANDED PROPERTIES MAY NOT
PERFORM AS WELL AS EXPECTED. WE ARE SUBJECT TO OTHER RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

CONSTRUCTION COSTS OF A PROJECT MAY BE HIGHER THAN PROJECTED, POTENTIALLY MAKING THE PROJECT UNFEASIBLE OR UNPROFITABLE; 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO REFINANCE CONSTRUCTION LOANS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL; WE MAY BE
UNABLE TO OBTAIN ZONING, OCCUPANCY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; OCCUPANCY RATES AND RENTS MAY NOT MEET OUR PROJECTIONS AND THE PROJECT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE; AND
 WE MAY NEED THE CONSENT OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS ANCHOR TENANTS, MORTGAGE LENDERS AND JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, AND THOSE
CONSENTS MAY BE WITHHELD. 

IF
A DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT/EXPANSION PROJECT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, EITHER BECAUSE IT IS NOT MEETING OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN OPERATIONAL OR WAS NOT COMPLETED ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT
PLANNING, WE COULD LOSE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. FURTHER, IF WE GUARANTEE THE PROPERTY'S FINANCING, OUR LOSS COULD EXCEED OUR INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. 

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID. 

OUR PROPERTIES REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID. AS A
RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES OR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE IN RESPONSE TO ANY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS IS LIMITED. IF WE WANT TO SELL A PROPERTY, WE CANNOT
ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF IT IN THE DESIRED TIME PERIOD OR THAT THE SALES PRICE OF A PROPERTY WILL EXCEED THE COST OF OUR INVESTMENT. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS 

AS OWNERS OF REAL ESTATE, WE CAN FACE LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. 

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT MAY REQUIRE US, AS A CURRENT OR PREVIOUS
OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL PROPERTY, TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT RELEASES AT A PROPERTY OR AT IMPACTED NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES. THESE LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE
LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PROPERTY OWNER OR OPERATOR KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE THE ABATEMENT OR
REMOVAL OF ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGE, DEMOLITION OR RENOVATION, RECONSTRUCTION OR EXPANSION OF A PROPERTY AND ALSO GOVERN EMISSIONS OF AND EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FIBERS IN THE
AIR. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO GOVERN THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS USED TO STORE WASTE OILS OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES CONTAIN,
OR AT ONE TIME CONTAINED, ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS OR UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (PRIMARILY RELATED TO AUTO SERVICE CENTER ESTABLISHMENTS OR EMERGENCY ELECTRICAL GENERATION EQUIPMENT). THE COSTS
OF INVESTIGATION, REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION BUT IS NOT ESTIMABLE. THE
PRESENCE OF CONTAMINATION, OR THE FAILURE TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL, LEASE OR REDEVELOP A PROPERTY OR TO BORROW USING A PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. 

OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PORTFOLIO IS IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, ORDINANCES AND
REGULATIONS REGARDING HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES, THIS BELIEF IS BASED ON LIMITED TESTING. NEARLY ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO PHASE I OR SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS. THESE
ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS HAVE NOT REVEALED, NOR ARE WE AWARE OF, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT: 

EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PORTFOLIO REVEAL ALL POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES; ANY PREVIOUS OWNER,
OCCUPANT OR TENANT OF A PROPERTY DID NOT CREATE ANY MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION NOT KNOWN TO US; 
 
 9 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY TENANTS AND OCCUPANTS, BY THE CONDITION OF
NEARBY PROPERTIES, OR BY OTHER UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES; OR FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE
INTERPRETATION THEREOF) WILL NOT RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. 

RETAIL OPERATIONS RISKS 

DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE GENERAL RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. 

OUR CONCENTRATION IN THE RETAIL REAL ESTATE MARKET MEANS THAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS THAT AFFECT THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY,
INCLUDING THE LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING, SEASONALITY, THE WILLINGNESS OF RETAILERS TO LEASE SPACE IN OUR SHOPPING CENTERS, TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. A RECESSION IS CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE ECONOMY AND CONSUMER SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY DECLINED. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS RISING AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HAS
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM RETAIL TENANTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC STRESS. A PROLONGED RECESSION IS
LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TENANTS AND AS A RESULT THIS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS COULD REQUIRE
US TO CURTAIL PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEASE NEWLY DEVELOPED PROPERTIES AND RENEW LEASES AND RELET SPACE AT EXISTING PROPERTIES. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEASE NEW PROPERTIES TO AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF TENANTS OR FOR RENTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PROJECTIONS.
ALSO, WHEN LEASES FOR OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES EXPIRE, THE PREMISES MAY NOT BE RELET OR THE TERMS OF RELETTING, INCLUDING THE COST OF ALLOWANCES AND CONCESSIONS TO TENANTS, MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN
THE CURRENT LEASE TERMS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR LEASING PLANS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, OUR CASH GENERATED BEFORE DEBT REPAYMENTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

SOME OF OUR PROPERTIES DEPEND ON ANCHOR STORES OR MAJOR TENANTS TO ATTRACT SHOPPERS AND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF OR A STORE CLOSURE BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE
TENANTS. 

REGIONAL MALLS ARE TYPICALLY ANCHORED BY DEPARTMENT STORES AND OTHER LARGE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED TENANTS. THE VALUE OF SOME OF OUR
PROPERTIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THESE TENANTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEEK CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, OR CEASE THEIR OPERATIONS. DEPARTMENT STORE
AND LARGER STORE, ALSO REFERRED TO AS "BIG BOX", CONSOLIDATIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF EXISTING STORES OR DUPLICATE OR GEOGRAPHICALLY OVERLAPPING STORE LOCATIONS. WE DO NOT CONTROL THE
DISPOSITION OF THOSE DEPARTMENT STORES OR LARGER STORES THAT WE DO NOT OWN. WE ALSO MAY NOT CONTROL THE VACANT SPACE THAT IS NOT RE-LEASED IN THOSE STORES WE DO OWN. OTHER TENANTS MAY BE
ENTITLED TO MODIFY THE TERMS OF THEIR EXISTING LEASES IN THE EVENT OF SUCH CLOSURES. THE MODIFICATION COULD BE UNFAVORABLE TO US AS THE LESSOR AND COULD DECREASE RENTS OR EXPENSE RECOVERY CHARGES.
ADDITIONALLY, MAJOR TENANT CLOSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WHICH COULD LEAD TO DECREASED SALES AT OTHER STORES. IF THE SALES OF STORES OPERATING IN OUR PROPERTIES WERE TO DECLINE
SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO CLOSING OF ANCHORS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OR OTHER REASONS, TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR MINIMUM RENTS OR EXPENSE RECOVERY CHARGES. IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY A TENANT OR
ANCHOR STORE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS AND COSTS IN ENFORCING OUR RIGHTS AS LANDLORD TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE TO US UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THOSE PARTIES. 

WE FACE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM THE INCREASING NUMBER OF TENANT BANKRUPTCIES. 

ALTHOUGH BANKRUPTCY FILINGS BY RETAILERS OCCUR REGULARLY IN THE COURSE OF OUR OPERATIONS, THE NUMBER OF TENANT BANKRUPTCIES HAS
INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO RE-LEASE VACANT SPACES RESULTING FROM TENANT TERMINATIONS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF A TENANT, PARTICULARLY AN ANCHOR
TENANT, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE THE REMAINDER OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES. FUTURE TENANT BANKRUPTCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROPERTIES OR IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR
RE-LEASING STRATEGY. 

 RISKS RELATING TO JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES 

WE HAVE LIMITED CONTROL WITH RESPECT TO SOME PROPERTIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED OR MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR REFINANCE
THEM. 

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE OWNED INTERESTS IN 183 INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES WITH OTHER PARTIES. OF THOSE, 18 PROPERTIES ARE
INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE OTHER 165 PROPERTIES UNDER THE 

 10 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 EQUITY
METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH WE REFER TO AS JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES. WE SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER OR PROPERTY MANAGER FOR 93 OF THESE 165 PROPERTIES; HOWEVER, CERTAIN MAJOR DECISIONS, SUCH AS
SELLING OR REFINANCING THESE PROPERTIES, REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER OWNERS. OF THE PROPERTIES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER OR PROPERTY MANAGER, 62 ARE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL JOINT
VENTURES. THE OTHER OWNERS ALSO HAVE OTHER PARTICIPATING RIGHTS THAT WE CONSIDER SUBSTANTIVE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING CONTROL OVER THE PROPERTIES' ASSETS. THE REMAINING JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES ARE
MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL, REFINANCE, OR OTHERWISE OPERATE THESE PROPERTIES. 

THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP GUARANTEES DEBT OR OTHERWISE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES. 

JOINT VENTURE DEBT IS THE LIABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND IS TYPICALLY SECURED BY A MORTGAGE ON THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY. AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS LOAN GUARANTEES AND OTHER GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPORT 71.9 MILLION AND 6.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL
 6.6 BILLION SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE MORTGAGE AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. A DEFAULT BY A JOINT VENTURE UNDER ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY UNDER A GUARANTY OR LETTER OF CREDIT. 

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS 

OUR COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE (CAM) CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW US TO RECOVER THE MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES FROM TENANTS. 

CAM COSTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE ALLOCABLE ENERGY COSTS, REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO COMMON AREAS, JANITORIAL SERVICES,
ADMINISTRATIVE, PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE COSTS, AND SECURITY COSTS. WE HISTORICALLY HAVE USED LEASES WITH VARIABLE CAM PROVISIONS THAT ADJUST TO REFLECT INFLATIONARY INCREASES. RECENTLY, WE
HAVE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO CONVERT OUR LEASES TO A FIXED PAYMENT METHODOLOGY WHICH FIXES OUR TENANTS' CAM CONTRIBUTIONS AND SHOULD IN TURN REDUCE THE VOLATILITY OF AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
RECOVERIES WE COLLECT FROM OUR TENANTS FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF OUR PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH VARIABLE AND FIXED PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES, THE AMOUNT OF CAM CHARGES WE
BILL TO OUR TENANTS MAY NOT ALLOW US TO RECOVER ALL OF THESE OPERATING COSTS. 

WE FACE A WIDE RANGE OF COMPETITION THAT COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. 

OUR PROPERTIES COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL PROPERTIES FOR TENANTS ON THE BASIS OF THE RENT CHARGED AND LOCATION. THE PRINCIPAL
COMPETITION MAY COME FROM EXISTING OR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SAME MARKET AREAS AND FROM DISCOUNT SHOPPING CENTERS, OUTLET MALLS, CATALOGUES, DISCOUNT SHOPPING CLUBS AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE. THE
PRESENCE OF COMPETITIVE PROPERTIES ALSO AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE AND THE LEVEL OF RENTS WE CAN OBTAIN. RENOVATIONS AND EXPANSIONS AT COMPETING MALLS COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR
PROPERTIES. 

 WE
ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS TO ACQUIRE PRIME DEVELOPMENT SITES. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL PROPERTY COMPANIES FOR TENANTS AND QUALIFIED
MANAGEMENT. 

OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY SUBJECT US TO DIFFERENT OR GREATER RISK FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. 

WE HOLD INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES THAT ARE UNDER OPERATION IN ITALY, FRANCE, POLAND, JAPAN, KOREA, MEXICO, AND CHINA AND WE
HAVE RECENTLY MADE AN INVESTMENT IN A U.K. RETAIL REAL ESTATE COMPANY. WE MAY PURSUE ADDITIONAL EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OWNERSHIP ACTIVITIES
CARRY RISKS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WE FACE WITH OUR DOMESTIC PROPERTIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE: 

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES; CHANGES IN FOREIGN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS,
REGIONALLY, NATIONALLY, AND LOCALLY; CHALLENGES OF COMPLYING WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS INCLUDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, OPERATIONS, TAXES, AND
LITIGATION; DIFFERING LENDING PRACTICES; DIFFERENCES IN CULTURES; CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT AFFECT FOREIGN OPERATIONS;
 DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND OBSTACLES TO THE REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS AND CASH.

11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ALTHOUGH
OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY ARE A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS (INTERNATIONAL PROPERTIES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 6.3 OF THE GLA OF ALL OF OUR
PROPERTIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008), TO THE EXTENT THAT WE EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, THESE RISKS COULD INCREASE IN SIGNIFICANCE WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

SOME OF OUR POTENTIAL LOSSES MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. 

WE MAINTAIN COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY, FIRE, FLOOD, EXTENDED COVERAGE AND RENTAL LOSS INSURANCE ON ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE
UNITED STATES THROUGH WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITIES AND OTHER SELF-INSURANCE MECHANISMS. ROSEWOOD INDEMNITY, LTD. AND BRIDGEWOOD INSURANCE COMPANY, LTD. ARE OUR
WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, AND HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY OUR GENERAL LIABILITY CARRIER FOR A SPECIFIC LAYER OF LOSSES FOR THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS. THE
CARRIER HAS, IN TURN, AGREED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE FOR THIS LAYER OF LOSSES UNDER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CARRIER'S POLICY. A SIMILAR POLICY WRITTEN THROUGH THESE CAPTIVE INSURANCE
ENTITIES ALSO PROVIDES INITIAL COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY INSURANCE AND CERTAIN WINDSTORM RISKS AT THE PROPERTIES LOCATED IN COASTAL WINDSTORM LOCATIONS. 

THERE
ARE SOME TYPES OF LOSSES, INCLUDING LEASE AND OTHER CONTRACT CLAIMS THAT GENERALLY ARE NOT INSURED. IF AN UNINSURED LOSS OR A LOSS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS OCCURS, WE COULD
LOSE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN A PROPERTY, AS WELL AS THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE REVENUE FROM THE PROPERTY. IF THIS HAPPENS, WE MAY STILL REMAIN OBLIGATED FOR ANY MORTGAGE DEBT
OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE PROPERTY. 

 WE
CURRENTLY MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE AGAINST ACTS OF TERRORISM ON ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES ON AN "ALL RISK" BASIS IN THE AMOUNT OF UP TO 1 BILLION PER
OCCURRENCE FOR CERTIFIED FOREIGN ACTS OF TERRORISM AND 500 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE FOR NON-CERTIFIED DOMESTIC ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE CURRENT FEDERAL LAWS WHICH PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE
ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE THROUGH 2014. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE, ANY THREATENED OR ACTUAL TERRORIST ATTACKS IN HIGH PROFILE MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROPERTY VALUES,
REVENUES, CONSUMER TRAFFIC AND TENANT SALES. 

 RISKS RELATING TO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 

WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT 

WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER SECTIONS 856 THROUGH 860 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED, OR THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED AND OPERATED IN A MANNER WHICH ALLOWS US TO QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN
THIS MANNER. HOWEVER, OUR QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO MEET, THROUGH ACTUAL ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS, ASSET DIVERSIFICATION, DISTRIBUTION LEVELS AND DIVERSITY OF
STOCK OWNERSHIP, THE VARIOUS QUALIFICATION TESTS IMPOSED UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. REIT QUALIFICATION IS GOVERNED BY HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX PROVISIONS FOR WHICH THERE ARE ONLY LIMITED
JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
INTERPRETATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE OPERATED OR WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A MANNER SO AS TO QUALIFY OR REMAIN QUALIFIED AS A REIT. 

IF
WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THOSE PROVISIONS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO MONETARY PENALTIES OR ULTIMATELY TO POSSIBLE DISQUALIFICATION AS A REIT. IF SUCH EVENTS OCCURS, AND IF AVAILABLE RELIEF
PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY: 

WE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED A DEDUCTION FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN COMPUTING OUR TAXABLE INCOME; 
 WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO CORPORATE LEVEL INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX, ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME
AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES; AND 
 UNLESS ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS, WE WILL ALSO BE DISQUALIFIED FROM TREATMENT AS A REIT FOR
THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR DURING WHICH QUALIFICATION WAS LOST.

1A. RISK FACTORS. 

HOLDERS
 AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE
 FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS IN ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS FORM 10-K.
 WE
 ARE IDENTIFYING THESE RISK FACTORS AS IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR
 ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY WRITTEN OR
 ORAL
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF US. WE ARE RELYING UPON
 THE
 SAFE-HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ANY SUCH STATEMENTS MADE BY
 OR ON
 BEHALF OF US ARE QUALIFIED BY REFERENCE TO THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS,
 AS WELL AS THOSE SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. 

IF
 WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OUR RAW MATERIALS AT FAVORABLE PRICES, IT COULD
 ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

PRICING
 FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING
 CAPACITY IN THE INDUSTRY AND BY RAW MATERIAL COSTS. THE PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS
 IS IMPORTANT TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN 2006, MATERIALS EXPENSE REPRESENTED
 APPROXIMATELY 81 OF OUR COST OF SALES. OUR PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIAL, POLYETHYLENE
 RESINS, IS OCCASIONALLY IN SHORT SUPPLY AND SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PRICE
 FLUCTUATION IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEMAND AND THE PRICE OF FEED STOCKS, INCLUDING
 NATURAL GAS. GENERALLY, WE DO NOT ENTER INTO PURCHASE CONTRACTS FOR THE FUTURE
 DELIVERY OF RAW MATERIALS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR SUPPLIERS MAY CHANGE THEIR
 PRICES AND OTHER PURCHASE TERMS AT ANY TIME. IF RAW MATERIALS PRICES INCREASE,
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS ON SUCH INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER OUR
 CONTRACTS. ALSO, AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS "RISK FACTORS" SECTION, WE
 COMPETE WITH COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USING RAW MATERIALS DIFFERENT
 FROM OURS AND IF WE EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR RAW MATERIALS
 OR
 AN INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF OUR RAW MATERIALS, OUR COMPETITORS WOULD NOT
 NECESSARILY SUFFER THE SAME PRICE INCREASES OR SUPPLY INTERRUPTION. A
 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE INDUSTRY'S WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY,
 MATERIAL INTERRUPTION IN RAW MATERIAL SUPPLY OR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, OR RAW
 MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR FINANCIAL
 POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

WE
 MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL DECLINE IN VOLUMES AND GROSS MARGINS FROM THE LARGEST
 CUSTOMER, WASTE MANAGEMENT. 

IN
 2006,
 WASTE MANAGEMENT WAS OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 13 
 OF
 SALES AND OPERATING REVENUE. AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS-CUSTOMERS, THE
 SUPPLY CONTRACT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND WE ENTERED INTO THE MASTER
 AGREEMENTS WITH WMNSI, WHICH WILL REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS
 THE
 PROFITABILITY OF WASTE MANAGEMENT COMMITMENTS IN 2007. WE BELIEVE THAT THE
 SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN FROM WASTE MANAGEMENT WILL
 HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND/OR CASH FLOWS IF NOT OFFSET BY OTHER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR ORGANIC
 GROWTH. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE IN BUSINESS WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT,
 WE ARE PURSUING OTHER BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR NEWLY ACQUIRED REPLICATED GRASS
 TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS AND STORM WATER RETENTION BUSINESS, AS WELL AS REDUCING
 THE
 CURRENT COST STRUCTURE. 

WE
 GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, AND OUR CUSTOMERS
 GENERALLY MAY TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AT ANY
 TIME. 

EXCEPT
 FOR THE MASTER AGREEMENTS WITH WMNSI, OUR CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO ON A
 PROJECT-BY-PROJECT BASIS, AND OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE ONGOING CONTRACTUAL
 OBLIGATIONS TO PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM US. IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR
 CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THEIR CONTRACTS OR TO NOT ENTER INTO NEW CONTRACTS
 WITH US, IT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
 POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, FOR SIMILAR
 REASONS, OUR CONTRACT BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE SALES,
 AND
 THE ESTIMATED SIZE OF ANY CONTRACT IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE
 PROFITABILITY OF THAT CONTRACT. 

14 

OUR
 PROFITABILITY IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS BECAUSE OF THE FIXED NATURE OF ALMOST
 ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS. 

SUBSTANTIALLY
 ALL OF OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, PARTICULARLY OUR INSTALLATION CONTRACTS, ARE
 FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS WITH COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE DATES SPREAD THROUGHOUT
 THE YEAR. UNDER A FIXED-PRICE CONTRACT, THE CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY A SPECIFIED
 PRICE FOR OUR PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE CONTRACT. FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS CARRY
 INHERENT RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS OF LOSSES FROM UNDERESTIMATING COSTS,
 OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR OVER THE CONTRACT
 PERIOD. ALSO, INCLEMENT OR HAZARDOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN
 SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS IN INSTALLATION AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. DUE TO THESE
 FACTORS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM OUR OBLIGATIONS
 UNDER FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL EXPENSES THAT WE ARE
 UNABLE TO PASS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IF WE WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY
 UNDERESTIMATE THE COST OF ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING AS A
 RESULT OF SUBSEQUENT INCREASES IN RESIN PRICES) OR EXPERIENCE GREATER EXPENSES
 THAN ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME OF CONTRACTING, THE RESULTING LOSSES COULD HAVE
 A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR
 CASH FLOWS. 

WE
 OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. 

WE
 SELL
 OUR PRODUCTS IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. THE PRINCIPAL RESIN TYPES THAT
 WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND LINEAR LOW DENSITY
 POLYETHYLENE. WE COMPETE BOTH WITH COMPANIES THAT USE THE SAME RAW MATERIALS
 THAT WE DO AND WITH COMPANIES THAT USE DIFFERENT RAW MATERIALS. ADDITIONALLY,
 COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY COMPETING
 WITH US MAY DECIDE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRODUCT
 PERFORMANCE, INSTALLATION CAPABILITY, QUALITY AND PRICING. PRICING REMAINS
 VERY
 COMPETITIVE WITH EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE INDUSTRY IMPACTING MARGINS. MOREOVER,
 OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS MAY HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL
 RESOURCES, NAME RECOGNITION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND HUMAN
 RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING
 NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE BETTER THAN OUR PRODUCTS. THESE COMPANIES
 MAY
 ALSO PROVE TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WE ARE IN MARKETING AND SELLING THESE
 PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY
 WITH
 ANY OF THESE COMPANIES. INCREASED COMPETITION AS TO ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD
 RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTION, REDUCED MARGINS AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, WHICH
 COULD
 NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

WE
 ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT COULD
 HARM OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. 

WE
 HAVE
 SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN EUROPE, CANADA, THAILAND, CHILE AND EGYPT. CERTAIN
 RISKS ARE INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING: 

-> DIFFICULTY
 OF ENFORCING AGREEMENTS AND COLLECTING RECEIVABLES THROUGH CERTAIN FOREIGN
 LEGAL
 SYSTEMS; 

-> FOREIGN
 CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES THAN CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED
 STATES; 

-> TAX
 RATES
 IN CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY EXCEED THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN
 EARNINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS OR THE IMPOSITION OF
 TARIFFS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS; 

-> GENERAL
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL UNREST AND TERRORIST S ATTACKS IN COUNTRIES WHERE
 WE OPERATE MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS IN THOSE
 COUNTRIES; 

-> EXPOSURE
 TO POSSIBLE EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS; 

-> DIFFICULTIES
 ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING A LARGE ORGANIZATION SPREAD THROUGHOUT VARIOUS
 COUNTRIES; 

-> IMPORT
 AND EXPORT LICENSE REQUIREMENTS; 

-> CHANGES
 IN TARIFFS AND TAXES; 

-> RESTRICTIONS
 ON REPATRIATING FOREIGN PROFITS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES; 

-> INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY PROTECTION DIFFICULTIES; AND 

-> COMPLICATIONS
 IN COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MANY OF WHICH
 CONFLICT WITH U.S. LAWS. 

15 

IN
 ADDITION, FOREIGN OPERATIONS INVOLVE UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM LOCAL BUSINESS
 PRACTICES, CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND TRADE
 TENSIONS. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS GLOBALLY, OUR SUCCESS WILL
 BE
 DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE
 AND OTHER RISKS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY
 THESE RISKS OR THAT THESE AND OTHER FACTORS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
 EFFECT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OR OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION,
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

CURRENCY
 EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND
 FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

WE
 GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, AND INCUR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION
 OF OUR EXPENSES, IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. TO THE EXTENT THAT
 WE
 ARE UNABLE TO MATCH REVENUES RECEIVED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WITH COSTS PAID
 IN
 THE SAME CURRENCY, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANY SUCH CURRENCY COULD HAVE
 AN
 ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. DURING TIMES OF
 A
 STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, OUR REPORTED SALES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO
 FEWER U.S. DOLLARS. 

THE
 COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF ACQUIRING AND INTEGRATING COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES
 AND
 TECHNOLOGIES COULD IMPEDE OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 COMPETITIVENESS. 

AS
 PART
 OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE INTEND TO CONSIDER ACQUIRING COMPLEMENTARY
 BUSINESSES. OUR PROGREEN ASSET ACQUISITION IN OCTOBER 2006 WAS CONSISTENT WITH
 THIS GROWTH STRATEGY. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER COMMITMENTS OR
 AGREEMENTS RELATING TO ANY MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD
 RESULT IN THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD HAVE
 A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF
 OPERATIONS. RISKS WE COULD FACE WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS
 INCLUDE: 

-> GREATER
 THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND MANAGEMENT TIME AND EFFORT INVOLVED IN IDENTIFYING,
 COMPLETING AND INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS; 

-> RISKS
 ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED EVENTS OR LIABILITIES; 

-> POTENTIAL
 DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND DIFFICULTY IN MAINTAINING OUR STANDARDS,
 CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES; 

-> ENTERING
 INTO MARKETS AND ACQUIRING TECHNOLOGIES IN AREAS IN WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE
 EXPERIENCE; 

-> THE
 INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND PERSONNEL OF
 ANY
 ACQUISITION INTO OUR OPERATIONS; 

-> A
 NEED TO
 INCUR DEBT, WHICH MAY REDUCE OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS AND OTHER USES;
 AND 

-> REALIZING
 LITTLE, IF ANY, RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT. 

IF
 WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EXECUTIVES AND OTHER PERSONNEL, OUR GROWTH MAY
 BE
 HINDERED. 

OUR
 SUCCESS WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON MAINTAINING OUR STAFF OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS.
 THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS IS COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT CONTINUE
 TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THESE PROFESSIONALS.
 IN
 PARTICULAR, OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE CONSIDERABLE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND
 WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS THEREFORE COULD BE HARMED
 IF ANY OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL CEASED WORKING FOR US.
 OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE HARMED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT, HIRE,
 TRAIN AND RETAIN QUALIFIED MANAGERIAL, SALES, INSTALLATION AND MARKETING
 PERSONNEL. 

OUR
 PRODUCT DELIVERIES AND INSTALLATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO SEASONALITY AND OTHER
 FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH
 FLOWS. 

THE
 GREATEST VOLUME OF GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCT DELIVERIES AND INSTALLATIONS TYPICALLY
 OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL, WHICH RESULTS IN SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS OF
 REVENUE. OFTEN, SCHEDULED DELIVERIES ARE SUBJECT TO DELAYS AT THE CUSTOMERS'
 REQUESTS TO CORRESPOND WITH CUSTOMERS' ANNUAL BUDGETARY AND PERMITTING CYCLES.
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AT OUR VARIOUS LOCATIONS
 TO
 MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL FLUCTUATION ON OUR MANUFACTURING, DELIVERY
 AND
 INSTALLATION SCHEDULES. SUBSTANTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS COULD
 SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR CASH FLOW AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT,
 INCLUDING THE SENIOR NOTES. 

16 

PRODUCT
 LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
 OUR
 OPERATING RESULTS. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE MAY BE LIMITED, AND OUR
 COVERAGE LIMITS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL CLAIMS. 

OUR
 PRODUCTS ARE USED IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE PREVENTION
 OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION. OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO USED IN SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC
 WORKS PROJECTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE AN INHERENT BUSINESS RISK OF EXPOSURE
 TO
 PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS (INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE)
 AND CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT IN THE EVENT THAT THE FAILURE OF OUR PRODUCTS
 OR OUR INSTALLATION SERVICES RESULTS, OR IS ALLEGED TO RESULT, IN PROPERTY
 DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND/OR PERSONAL INJURY. WE AGREE IN MOST
 CASES
 TO INDEMNIFY THE SITE OWNER, GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND OTHERS FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES
 RESULTING FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE AND THAT OF OUR EMPLOYEES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU
 THAT WE WILL NOT INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO DEFEND PRODUCT LIABILITY AND BREACH
 OF CONTRACT CLAIMS OR THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE ANY MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY
 LOSSES OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH COSTS, LOSSES AND
 OBLIGATIONS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION,
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

ALTHOUGH
 WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE WITHIN RANGES OF COVERAGE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY
 PRACTICE, THIS INSURANCE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE PREMIUMS
 AND MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL SUCH LOSSES. OUR INSURANCE POLICIES
 ARE
 SUBJECT TO LARGE DEDUCTIBLES. THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL ACTIONS AND CLAIMS AGAINST
 US
 OR THAT ARE OTHERWISE INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
 IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH
 FLOWS. 

WE
 MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY CLAIMS. 

WE
 PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES WITH
 LIMITED MATERIAL WARRANTIES ON OUR PRODUCTS AND LIMITED INSTALLATION WARRANTIES
 FOR OUR WORKMANSHIP. OUR
 LIMITED INSTALLATION WARRANTIES ARE TYPICALLY 1 TO 5 YEARS BUT OCCASIONALLY
 EXTEND UP TO 20 YEARS. OUR PRODUCT WARRANTIES ARE TYPICALLY 5 YEARS
 BUT OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 20 YEARS. THESE LIMITED WARRANTIES ARE
 GENERALLY LIMITED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR WORKMANSHIP,
 OFTEN ON A PRORATED BASIS, UP TO THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT.
 IN
 SOME FOREIGN CONTRACTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH
 SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL LIMITED WARRANTIES AS TO MATERIAL QUALITY. OUR PRODUCT
 WARRANTY LIABILITY IN MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IS DICTATED BY LOCAL LAWS IN
 ADDITION TO THE WARRANTY SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACTS. SEVERAL OF OUR FOREIGN
 SUBSIDIARIES SELL PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION SERVICES UNDER COMPETITIVELY BID
 CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. 
 SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

A
 DOWNTURN IN EITHER THE ECONOMY GENERALLY OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANDFILLS IN
 PARTICULAR WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 

OUR
 PRIMARY BUSINESS DEPENDS ON A GROWING ECONOMY TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR THE TYPES
 OF PROJECTS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE INSTALLED. IN PARTICULAR, A SUBSTANTIAL
 PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF LANDFILLS.
 LANDFILL DEVELOPMENT COULD SLOW DUE TO A GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, A CHANGE
 IN
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANDFILLS OR FROM OTHER
 FACTORS. A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY OR ANY OTHER DEVELOPMENT THAT ADVERSELY
 IMPACTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANDFILLS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL
 POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. 

REGULATORY
 AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

CHANGES
 IN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY OR INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS OR COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES
 MAY RENDER CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OBSOLETE. OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CHANGES
 IN REGULATORY AND TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW AND
 ENHANCED PRODUCTS IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHANGES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR
 ABILITY TO GROW AND TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN EXISTING LAWS
 AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES REQUIRE DEVELOPERS
 OF
 LANDFILLS AND OTHER HANDLERS OF CERTAIN WASTE TO PREVENT GROUNDWATER
 CONTAMINATION IN A MANNER THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE.
 CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
 OUR
 FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS IF NEW REQUIREMENTS
 WERE NOT SATISFIED BY OUR PRODUCTS. ALSO, A REDUCTION IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF
 SUCH
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
 POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR CASH FLOWS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE
 RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS,
 INCLUDING LACK OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND FAILURE
 OF PRODUCTS TO OPERATE PROPERLY. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE
 TO
 ACHIEVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO REMAIN
 COMPETITIVE OR THAT CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL NOT BECOME
 OBSOLETE. 

17 

WE
 MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY REGULATIONS TO WHICH
 WE
 ARE SUBJECT. 

WE
 ARE
 REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS GOVERNING THE
 PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE EXPOSURE OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY TO HAZARDOUS
 SUBSTANCES AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. THESE LAWS REGULATE, AMONG OTHER
 THINGS, THE GENERATION, STORAGE, HANDLING, USE AND TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS
 MATERIALS; THE DISPOSAL OF WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES INTO SOIL, AIR OR WATER;
 AND OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR WORKERS AND THE
 PUBLIC. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS
 FOR
 CERTAIN OPERATIONS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLETE
 COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND PERMITS. IF WE VIOLATE OR FAIL TO
 COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE FINED OR OTHERWISE SANCTIONED.
 IN
 SOME INSTANCES, SUCH A FINE OR SANCTION COULD BE MATERIAL AND COULD INCLUDE
 MONETARY PENALTIES OR THE SHUT-DOWN OF A FACILITY. CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL
 REQUIREMENTS, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS BY REGULATORS AND
 COURTS, MIGHT ALSO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME. WE THEREFORE CANNOT ASSURE
 YOU THAT WE WILL NOT INCUR MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OR LIABILITIES IN THE
 FUTURE. WE HAVE MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CAPITAL AND OTHER EXPENDITURES
 TO
 COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS,
 CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON OUR
 BUSINESS. 

WE
 ARE
 ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS GOVERNING THE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED PROPERTY. UNDER
 THESE
 LAWS, WE COULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR COSTS AND DAMAGES RELATING TO CONTAMINATION
 OF
 OUR PAST OR PRESENT FACILITIES AND AT THIRD PARTY SITES TO WHICH OUR FACILITIES
 SENT WASTES OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE
 MATERIAL. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE LIABILITY FOR SUCH
 CONTAMINATION, NOR CAN WE ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN ACCIDENT
 OR
 BECOME LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER CONTAMINATION THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST
 (INCLUDING SUCH LIABILITY TO BUYERS OF PROPERTIES OR BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE
 SOLD). 

OUR
 SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
 FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

WE
 HAVE A
 SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD OUTSTANDING
 APPROXIMATELY 179.9 MILLION OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY
 29.6 MILLION OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS. THE HIGH LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD
 HAVE
 IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES TO YOU, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

-> IT
 MAY BE
 MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SENIOR
 NOTES; 

-> OUR
 ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL
 EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES MAY BE
 IMPAIRED; 

-> WE
 MUST
 USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO PAY INTEREST
 AND
 PRINCIPAL ON THE SENIOR NOTES AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH WILL REDUCE THE
 FUNDS AVAILABLE TO US FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS CAPITAL
 EXPENDITURES; 

-> WE
 MAY BE
 LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS; 

-> WE
 MAY BE
 LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN BONDS NEEDED TO BID ON OR PERFORM CERTAIN
 INSTALLATION CONTRACTS; 

-> WE
 MAY
 HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS THAN SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS, WHICH MAY
 PUT
 US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AND REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR,
 OR
 RESPONDING TO, CHANGING CONDITIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INCREASED
 COMPETITION; AND 

-> WE
 MAY BE
 MORE VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR
 BUSINESS. 

WE
 EXPECT
 TO UTILIZE CASH FLOW FROM OUR OPERATIONS TO PAY OUR EXPENSES AND TO PAY THE
 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR DEBT. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR EXPENSES THUS
 DEPENDS ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, WHICH WILL BE AFFECTED BY FINANCIAL,
 BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL MANY OF
 THESE FACTORS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE
 AND
 PRESSURE FROM COMPETITORS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR CASH FLOW WILL BE
 SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO PAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS,
 INCLUDING THE SENIOR NOTES, AND MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. IF WE DO NOT HAVE
 ENOUGH LIQUIDITY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REFINANCE ALL OR PART OF OUR EXISTING
 DEBT, INCLUDING THE SENIOR NOTES, SELL ASSETS OR BORROW MORE MONEY. WE CANNOT
 GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.
 IN
 ADDITION, THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE DEBT AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING OUR
 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES, MAY
 RESTRICT US FROM PURSUING ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. 

18 

THE
 INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES AND THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER
 INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING
 AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON
 THE
 SENIOR NOTES OR PREVENT US FROM CAPITALIZING ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND
 TAKING CERTAIN CORPORATE ACTIONS. 

THE
 INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES AND THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER
 INDEBTEDNESS IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS ON US.
 THESE RESTRICTIONS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS INCLUDING OUR
 ABILITY TO: 

-> INCUR
 ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS; 

-> CREATE
 LIENS OR OTHER ENCUMBRANCES; 

-> PAY
 DIVIDENDS OR MAKE CERTAIN OTHER PAYMENTS, INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND GUARANTEES;
 AND 

-> SELL
 OR
 OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ASSETS AND MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANOTHER
 ENTITY. 

IN
 ADDITION, OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES US TO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL
 RATIOS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION TESTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE ITEM 7. -
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS . EVENTS BEYOND OUR
 CONTROL CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND FINANCIAL
 CONDITION TESTS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE OBLIGATIONS COULD CAUSE AN
 EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT
 OCCURS, OUR LENDERS COULD ELECT TO DECLARE ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, INCLUDING
 ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY TO BE IMMEDIATELY
 DUE, AND THE LENDERS COULD FORECLOSE UPON THE ASSETS SECURING OUR SENIOR CREDIT
 FACILITY. IN THAT EVENT, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT
 ASSETS TO REPAY ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE SENIOR NOTES.

WE
 MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE HOLDERS OF THE SENIOR NOTES
 UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

UPON
 THE
 OCCURRENCE OF A "CHANGE OF CONTROL" (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING
 THE
 SENIOR NOTES) EACH HOLDER OF THE SENIOR NOTES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE
 US
 TO REPURCHASE THE OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 101 OF THE
 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, TOGETHER WITH ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND LIQUIDATED
 DAMAGES, IF ANY, TO THE DATE OF REPURCHASE. OUR FAILURE TO PURCHASE, OR GIVE
 NOTICE OF PURCHASE OF, THE SENIOR NOTES WOULD BE A DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE
 GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES, WHICH WOULD IN TURN BE A DEFAULT UNDER OUR SENIOR
 CREDIT FACILITY. 

IF
 A
 CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS
 AT THE TIME OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL TO MAKE THE REQUIRED REPURCHASE OF SENIOR
 NOTES OR TO SATISFY ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND THE
 INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES. IN ORDER TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS,
 WE
 COULD SEEK TO REFINANCE THE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND
 THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES OR OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM THE LENDERS
 OR
 HOLDERS OF THE SENIOR NOTES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO
 OBTAIN A WAIVER OR REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF
 AT
 ALL. 

THE
 PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER OF GEO HOLDINGS CONTROLS US AND COULD DELAY, DETER OR
 PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHERWISE CAUSE
 US
 TO TAKE ACTIONS WITH WHICH YOU AS A HOLDER OF SENIOR NOTES MAY DISAGREE OR
 WHICH
 MIGHT NOT BE IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS. 

WE
 ARE A
 WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GEO HOLDINGS. CHS IV OWNS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE
 ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF GEO HOLDINGS, AND MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR
 MANAGEMENT HOLD OPTIONS EXERCISABLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 OF THE COMMON STOCK
 OF
 GEO HOLDINGS, DETERMINED ON A FULLY-DILUTED BASIS. PURSUANT TO THE STOCKHOLDERS
 AGREEMENT THAT GEO HOLDINGS ENTERED INTO WITH CHS IV, CERTAIN CO-INVESTORS
 AND
 CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, CHS IV HAS THE RIGHT TO APPOINT UP
 TO
 THREE OF GEO HOLDINGS' FOUR DIRECTORS. GEO HOLDINGS HAS THE ABILITY TO ELECT
 ALL
 OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, APPOINT NEW MANAGEMENT AND APPROVE
 ANY
 ACTION REQUIRING THE APPROVAL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THE DIRECTORS HAVE THE
 AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS AFFECTING OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, INCLUDING THE
 ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS. IN
 ADDITION, TRANSACTIONS MAY BE PURSUED THAT COULD ENHANCE THE INVESTMENT OF
 THE
 HOLDERS OF GEO HOLDINGS EQUITY WHILE INVOLVING RISKS TO YOUR INTERESTS. IT
 IS
 POSSIBLE THAT THE HOLDERS OF GEO HOLDINGS EQUITY WILL EXERCISE CONTROL OVER
 US
 IN A MANNER THAT IS ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE HOLDERS OF THE SENIOR NOTES.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 
 OUR BUSINESS FACES MANY RISKS. ANY OF THE RISKS DISCUSSED BELOW, OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K OR OUR OTHER SEC FILINGS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL DEVICES INDUSTRY. 
 THE MEDICAL DEVICE MARKET IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR CUSTOMERS CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN CHOOSING SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING PRODUCT RELIABILITY, CLINICAL OUTCOMES, PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, INVENTORY CONSIGNMENT, PRICE AND PRODUCT SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER, AND MARKET SHARE CAN SHIFT AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND OTHER BUSINESS FACTORS. MAJOR SHIFTS IN INDUSTRY MARKET SHARE HAVE OCCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT PROBLEMS, PHYSICIAN ADVISORIES AND SAFETY ALERTS, REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCT QUALITY IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY, AND ANY QUALITY PROBLEMS WITH OUR PROCESSES, GOODS AND SERVICES COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION FOR PRODUCING HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AND ERODE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, SALES AND MARKET SHARE. OUR COMPETITORS RANGE FROM SMALL START-UP COMPANIES TO LARGER COMPANIES WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES AND BROADER PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAN US, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE COMING YEARS, OTHER LARGE COMPANIES WILL ENTER CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HOLD A STRONG POSITION. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THAT COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY WITH THE INCREASED USE OF STRATEGIES SUCH AS CONSIGNED INVENTORY, AND WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING PRICE COMPETITION AS A RESULT OF MANAGED CARE, CONSOLIDATION AMONG HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, INCREASED COMPETITION AND DECLINING REIMBURSEMENT RATES. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS WHICH HAVE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, BETTER FEATURES OR LOWER PRICING MAY MAKE OUR PRODUCTS OR PROPOSED PRODUCTS OBSOLETE OR LESS COMPETITIVE. AS A RESULT, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE CONTINUED EFFORTS AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO BRING OUR PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO MARKET, ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS FOR THE MEDICAL MARKETPLACE. IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS OR COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION AND ANY ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. 
 OUR PRODUCTS, DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND RIGOROUS REGULATION BY NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FDA AND COMPARABLE FOREIGN AGENCIES. TO VARYING DEGREES, EACH OF THESE AGENCIES MONITORS AND ENFORCES OUR COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MEDICAL DEVICES. THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING MARKETING APPROVAL OR CLEARANCE FROM THE FDA AND COMPARABLE FOREIGN BODIES FOR NEW PRODUCTS, OR FOR ENHANCEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, COULD: 
 
 - 
 TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME, 
 
 - 
 REQUIRE THE EXPENDITURE OF SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES, 
 
 - 
 INVOLVE RIGOROUS PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTING, AS WELL AS INCREASED POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE, 
 
 - 
 INVOLVE MODIFICATIONS, REPAIRS OR REPLACEMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND 
 
 - 
 RESULT IN LIMITATIONS ON THE INDICATED USES OF OUR PRODUCTS. 

WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL RECEIVE REQUIRED APPROVAL OR CLEARANCE FROM THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. THE FAILURE TO RECEIVE APPROVAL OR CLEARANCE FOR SIGNIFICANT NEW PRODUCTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER A PRODUCT IS COMMERCIALLY RELEASED, WE HAVE ONGOING RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER FDA REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE FDA'S QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATION (QSR), WHICH MANDATES THAT MANUFACTURERS OF MEDICAL DEVICES ADHERE TO CERTAIN QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, VALIDATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, CONTROLS FOR PURCHASING PRODUCT COMPONENTS, AND DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL MEDICAL DEVICE REPORTING REGULATION REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE FDA WHENEVER THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT REASONABLY SUGGESTS THAT A DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY OR, THAT A MALFUNCTION OCCURRED WHICH WOULD BE LIKELY TO CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY UPON RECURRENCE. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IS SUBJECT TO CONTINUAL REVIEW AND IS MONITORED RIGOROUSLY THROUGH PERIODIC INSPECTIONS BY THE FDA, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OBSERVATIONS ON FORM 483, AND IN SOME CASES WARNING LETTERS, THAT REQUIRE CORRECTIVE ACTION. IF THE FDA WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR THAT ANY OF OUR MEDICAL DEVICES ARE INEFFECTIVE OR POSE AN UNREASONABLE HEALTH RISK, THE FDA COULD BAN SUCH MEDICAL DEVICES, DETAIN OR SEIZE SUCH MEDICAL DEVICES, ORDER A RECALL, REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR REFUND OF SUCH DEVICES, OR REQUIRE US TO NOTIFY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS THAT THE DEVICES PRESENT UNREASONABLE RISKS OF SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. THE FDA HAS BEEN INCREASING ITS SCRUTINY OF THE 
 18 

MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE THE INDUSTRY CLOSELY WITH INSPECTIONS, AND POSSIBLY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, BY THE FDA OR OTHER AGENCIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FDA MAY RESTRICT MANUFACTURING AND IMPOSE OTHER OPERATING RESTRICTIONS, ENJOIN AND RESTRAIN CERTAIN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW PERTAINING TO MEDICAL DEVICES, AND ASSESS CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AGAINST OUR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR US. THE FDA MAY ALSO RECOMMEND PROSECUTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ANY ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON ITS MAGNITUDE, MAY RESTRICT US FROM EFFECTIVELY MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ADVERSE REGULATORY ACTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 IN ADDITION, THE FDCA PERMITS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS TO PROMOTE PRODUCTS SOLELY FOR THE USES AND INDICATIONS SET FORTH IN THE APPROVED PRODUCT LABELING. A NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST MANUFACTURERS THAT PROMOTE PRODUCTS FOR OFF-LABEL USES, INCLUDING ACTIONS ALLEGING THAT FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT OF PRODUCTS PROMOTED FOR "OFF-LABEL" USES ARE FALSE AND FRAUDULENT CLAIMS TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OFF-LABEL PROMOTION RESTRICTIONS CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PENALTIES AND A REQUIRED CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE OBLIGATIONS AND COSTS, AND POTENTIAL EVALUATION FROM FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. 
 
 FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY STRINGENT AND MORE COMMON, AND WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EVEN MORE RIGOROUS REGULATION BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE FUTURE. PENALTIES FOR A COMPANY'S NONCOMPLIANCE WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION COULD BE SEVERE, INCLUDING REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF A COMPANY'S BUSINESS LICENSE AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. ANY DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL MEDICAL DEVICE LAW OR REGULATION IMPOSED IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. 
 OUR PRODUCTS ARE CONTINUALLY THE SUBJECT OF CLINICAL TRIALS CONDUCTED BY US, OUR COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH MAY BE UNFAVORABLE, OR PERCEIVED AS UNFAVORABLE BY THE MARKET, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 AS A PART OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS OF OBTAINING MARKETING CLEARANCE FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INDICATIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, WE CONDUCT AND PARTICIPATE IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS WITH A VARIETY OF STUDY DESIGNS, PATIENT POPULATIONS AND TRIAL ENDPOINTS. UNFAVORABLE OR INCONSISTENT CLINICAL DATA FROM EXISTING OR FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS CONDUCTED BY US, BY OUR COMPETITORS OR BY THIRD PARTIES, OR THE MARKET'S OR FDA'S PERCEPTION OF THIS CLINICAL DATA, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN PRODUCT APPROVALS, THE SIZE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE, OUR POSITION IN, AND SHARE OF, THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EFFECTIVELY, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES. WE ALSO RELY UPON TRADE SECRETS, KNOW-HOW, CONTINUING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE SEEK TO PROTECT THESE, IN PART, THROUGH CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND OTHER PARTIES. WE PURSUE A POLICY OF GENERALLY OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND IN KEY FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR PATENTABLE SUBJECT MATTER IN OUR PROPRIETARY DEVICES AND ALSO ATTEMPT TO REVIEW THIRD-PARTY PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS TO THE EXTENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE PATENT STRATEGY, AVOID INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, IDENTIFY LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES AND MONITOR THE PATENT CLAIMS OF OTHERS. WE CURRENTLY OWN NUMEROUS UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS AND HAVE NUMEROUS PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING. WE ARE ALSO A PARTY TO VARIOUS LICENSE AGREEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH PATENT RIGHTS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED OR GRANTED IN CONSIDERATION FOR CASH, CROSS-LICENSING RIGHTS OR ROYALTY PAYMENTS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY PENDING OR FUTURE PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN ISSUED PATENTS, THAT ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED OR THAT THE RIGHTS GRANTED THEREUNDER WILL PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO US OR PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM ENTERING MARKETS WHICH WE CURRENTLY SERVE. ANY REQUIRED LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. IN ADDITION, SOME LICENSES MAY BE NON-EXCLUSIVE, AND THEREFORE OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TECHNOLOGIES AS US. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN THE FUTURE TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS OR KNOW-HOW OR TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST CLAIMED INFRINGEMENT OF THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. ANY LEGAL ACTION OF THAT TYPE COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING TO US AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME. THE INVALIDATION OF KEY PATENTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WHICH WE OWN OR AN UNSUCCESSFUL OUTCOME IN LAWSUITS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 PENDING AND FUTURE PATENT LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE TO US AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE OPERATE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT PATENT LITIGATION AND, IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS BEEN COMMON FOR COMPANIES IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE FIELD TO AGGRESSIVELY CHALLENGE THE RIGHTS OF OTHER COMPANIES TO PREVENT THE MARKETING OF NEW 
 19 

DEVICES. COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN PATENTS FOR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR OR USEFUL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BRING LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST US CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME, WE GENERALLY ARE INVOLVED AS BOTH A PLAINTIFF AND A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED ACTIONS. DEFENDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX AND OUTCOMES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. ANY PENDING OR FUTURE PATENT LITIGATION MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ROYALTY OR OTHER PAYMENTS OR INJUNCTIONS THAT CAN PREVENT THE SALE OF PRODUCTS AND MAY CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DIVERSION OF THE EFFORTS OF OUR TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. WHILE WE INTEND TO DEFEND ANY SUCH LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THE EVENT THAT OUR RIGHT TO MARKET ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS IS SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED OR IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN A REQUIRED LICENSE OR ARE UNABLE TO DESIGN AROUND A PATENT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 PENDING AND FUTURE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND OTHER LITIGATION, INCLUDING PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION, SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS AND CONTRACT LITIGATION, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF THE MEDICAL DEVICES WE PRODUCE ENTAIL AN INHERENT RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN USED IN INTENSIVE CARE SETTINGS WITH SERIOUSLY ILL PATIENTS, AND MANY OF THE MEDICAL DEVICES WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL ARE DESIGNED TO BE IMPLANTED IN THE HUMAN BODY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR INDEFINITELY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN UNSAFE CONDITION OR INJURY TO, OR DEATH OF, A PATIENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE OR OTHER PRODUCTS WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR SELL, INCLUDING COMPONENT FAILURES, MANUFACTURING FLAWS, DESIGN DEFECTS OR INADEQUATE DISCLOSURE OF PRODUCT-RELATED RISKS OR PRODUCT-RELATED INFORMATION. PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS MAY BE BROUGHT BY INDIVIDUALS OR BY GROUPS SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS. 
 WE ARE CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 5 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL REPORT INCLUDED IN OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND FILED AS EXHIBIT 13 TO THIS FORM 10-K. THE OUTCOME OF PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR QUANTIFY. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE TYPES OF LAWSUITS OFTEN SEEK RECOVERY OF VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE MONETARY AMOUNTS, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS RELATING TO SUCH LAWSUITS MAY REMAIN UNKNOWN FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME. THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE TYPES OF LITIGATION MATTERS MAY TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH ANY POTENTIAL SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS WOULD BE PAID OUT OR THE AMOUNTS OF ANY SUCH SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COST TO DEFEND ANY FUTURE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION AND OTHER CURRENT OR FUTURE LITIGATION, INCLUDING ANY COSTS (THE MATERIAL COMPONENTS OF WHICH ARE SETTLEMENTS, JUDGMENTS, LEGAL FEES AND OTHER RELATED DEFENSE COSTS) NOT COVERED UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY-ISSUED PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES AND EXISTING LITIGATION RESERVES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 OUR SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAM MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER FUTURE LOSSES. 
 CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDOMINANT PRACTICE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN OR INTEND TO MAINTAIN ANY INSURANCE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE TO EVALUATE THE VALUE TO US OF OBTAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH IS BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSS TRENDS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER FUTURE LOSSES, ALTHOUGH WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT THIS WILL REMAIN TRUE AS HISTORICAL TRENDS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSSES. THESE LOSSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. 
 THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS OR AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF INVENTORY SUPPLIED TO US COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE PURCHASE CERTAIN SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FROM SINGLE SOURCES DUE TO QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS, COSTS OR CONSTRAINTS RESULTING FROM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON SHORT NOTICE AND WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED PERIODICALLY BY SOME SUPPLIERS THAT IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THEIR POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY EXPOSURE, THEY MAY TERMINATE SALES OF PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THAT MANUFACTURE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES. WHILE SOME OF THESE SUPPLIERS HAVE MODIFIED THEIR POSITIONS AND HAVE INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A PRODUCT TEMPORARILY UNTIL AN ALTERNATIVE VENDOR OR PRODUCT CAN BE QUALIFIED (OR EVEN TO RECONSIDER THE SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP), WHERE A PARTICULAR SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT SUPPLIERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS OR MATERIALS QUICKLY. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FDA APPROVAL SYSTEM, WHICH MANDATES VALIDATION OF MATERIALS PRIOR TO USE IN OUR PRODUCTS, AND THE COMPLEX NATURE OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES EMPLOYED BY MANY SUPPLIERS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY LOSE A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH A SUPPLIER BY A COMPETITOR (WHICH MAY CAUSE THE SUPPLIER TO STOP SELLING ITS PRODUCTS TO US) OR THE BANKRUPTCY OF SUCH A SUPPLIER, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE SUPPLIER TO CEASE OPERATIONS. A REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION BY A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER OF THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR KEY 
 20 

COMPONENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS OR AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF THOSE MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 COST CONTAINMENT PRESSURES AND DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LEGISLATIVE OR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS RESULTING IN RESTRICTIVE REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS OR PREFERENCES FOR ALTERNATE THERAPIES COULD DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, THE PRICES WHICH THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THOSE PRODUCTS AND THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES USING OUR DEVICES. 
 OUR PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED PRINCIPALLY BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT TYPICALLY BILL VARIOUS THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, SUCH AS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS (E.G., MEDICARE AND MEDICAID), PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS AND MANAGED CARE PLANS, FOR THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROVIDED TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE ABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEIR SERVICES AND THE PRODUCTS THEY PROVIDE FROM GOVERNMENT AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. THE AVAILABILITY OF REIMBURSEMENT AFFECTS WHICH PRODUCTS CUSTOMERS PURCHASE AND THE PRICES THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY. REIMBURSEMENT VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. AFTER WE DEVELOP A PROMISING NEW PRODUCT, WE MAY FIND LIMITED DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT UNLESS REIMBURSEMENT APPROVAL IS OBTAINED FROM PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENTAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. 
 MAJOR THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD CONTINUE TO WORK TO CONTAIN HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE INTRODUCTION OF COST CONTAINMENT INCENTIVES, COMBINED WITH CLOSER SCRUTINY OF HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES BY BOTH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS AND EMPLOYERS, HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED DISCOUNTS AND CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CHARGES FOR SERVICES PERFORMED AND IN THE SHIFTING OF SERVICES BETWEEN INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS. INITIATIVES TO LIMIT THE GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE COSTS, INCLUDING PRICE REGULATION, ARE ALSO UNDERWAY IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTHCARE REFORMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SIGNIFICANT OVERSEAS MARKETS SUCH AS GERMANY, JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES MAY LIMIT THE PRICE OR THE LEVEL AT WHICH REIMBURSEMENT IS PROVIDED FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT BOTH OUR PRICING FLEXIBILITY AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS MAY RESPOND TO SUCH COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURES BY SUBSTITUTING LOWER COST PRODUCTS OR OTHER THERAPIES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 
 IN MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT WERE ENACTED INTO LAW IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDED A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND DECREASING THE COSTS OF HEALTHCARE. THE HEALTHCARE REFORM STATUTES HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REIMBURSEMENT CUTS IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT CONSEQUENCES THESE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE ON PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND WHAT IMPACTS THESE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE ON MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. LEGISLATIVE OR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS TO THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEMS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR MEDICAL DEVICES OR DENY COVERAGE FOR SUCH PROCEDURES, OR ADVERSE DECISIONS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS BY ADMINISTRATORS OF SUCH SYSTEMS IN COVERAGE OR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CLINICAL PRODUCTS, PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE PRICES OUR CUSTOMERS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THEM. THIS IN TURN WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO REIMBURSEMENT AND REGULATION OF HEALTHCARE GOODS AND SERVICES MAY SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR DEVICES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION REGARDING QUALITY AND COST BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, INCLUDING THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS), AS WELL AS COMPARABLE STATE AND FOREIGN AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND REGULATION OF HEALTHCARE GOODS AND SERVICES. FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ALSO IMPOSE REGULATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE GOODS AND SERVICES. U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE LAWS APPLY WHEN WE SUBMIT A CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A U.S. FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM BENEFICIARY, OR WHEN A CUSTOMER SUBMITS A CLAIM FOR AN ITEM OR SERVICE THAT IS REIMBURSED UNDER A U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROGRAM, SUCH AS MEDICARE OR MEDICAID. THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL LAWS IMPLICATED INCLUDE THOSE THAT PROHIBIT THE FILING OF FALSE OR IMPROPER CLAIMS FOR FEDERAL PAYMENT, THOSE THAT PROHIBIT UNLAWFUL INDUCEMENTS FOR THE REFERRAL OF BUSINESS REIMBURSABLE UNDER FEDERALLY-FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, KNOWN AS THE ANTI-KICKBACK LAWS, AND THOSE THAT PROHIBIT HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROVIDERS SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES TO A PATIENT WHO WAS REFERRED BY A PHYSICIAN THAT HAS CERTAIN TYPES OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDER, KNOWN AS THE STARK LAW. 
 THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO US ARE SUBJECT TO EVOLVING INTERPRETATIONS. IF A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE AND OUR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES COULD BE SUBJECT TO SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION AS A SUPPLIER OF PRODUCT TO BENEFICIARIES COVERED BY CMS. IF WE ARE EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION BASED ON SUCH AN INTERPRETATION, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 21 

CONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY COULD LEAD TO DEMANDS FOR PRICE CONCESSIONS OR LIMIT OR ELIMINATE OUR ABILITY TO SELL TO CERTAIN OF OUR SIGNIFICANT MARKET SEGMENTS. 
 THE COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE AND NUMEROUS INITIATIVES AND REFORMS INITIATED BY LEGISLATORS, REGULATORS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS TO CURB THESE COSTS HAVE RESULTED IN A CONSOLIDATION TREND IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THIS IN TURN HAS RESULTED IN GREATER PRICING PRESSURES AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO SELL TO IMPORTANT MARKET SEGMENTS, AS GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS, INDEPENDENT DELIVERY NETWORKS AND LARGE SINGLE ACCOUNTS, SUCH AS THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE TO CONSOLIDATE PURCHASING DECISIONS FOR SOME OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS. WE EXPECT THAT MARKET DEMAND, GOVERNMENT REGULATION, THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES AND SOCIETAL PRESSURES WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WORLDWIDE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, RESULTING IN FURTHER BUSINESS CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES WHICH MAY EXERT FURTHER DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 FAILURE TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO OUR OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO DEVELOP AND IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS IN RECENT YEARS AND MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE. OUR INTEGRATION OF THE OPERATIONS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE COORDINATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, OPERATIONS, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCE. THESE EFFORTS RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MANAGEMENT'S TIME THAT CANNOT THEN BE DEDICATED TO OTHER PROJECTS. OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE SUCCESSFULLY AND COORDINATE THE GROWTH OF THE COMBINED COMPANY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT THE BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE WILL BECOME PROFITABLE OR REMAIN SO. IF OUR ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, WE MAY RECORD UNEXPECTED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT THE SUCCESS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS INCLUDE: 
 
 - 
 
 THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND/OR SIGNIFICANT FRAUD IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES; 
 
 - 
 
 ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS ARISING OUT OF INVESTIGATIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OF THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES; 
 
 - 
 
 ANY DECREASE IN CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND PRODUCT ORDERS CAUSED BY DISSATISFACTION WITH THE COMBINED COMPANIES' PRODUCT LINES AND SALES AND MARKETING PRACTICES, INCLUDING PRICE INCREASES; 
 
 - 
 
 OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES; AND 
 
 - 
 
 THE ABILITY OF THE COMBINED COMPANY TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES AMONG ITS CONSTITUENT COMPANIES, SUCH AS INCREASING SALES OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, ACHIEVING COST SAVINGS AND EFFECTIVELY COMBINING TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS. 

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM OUR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS, AND THEY MAY RESULT IN UNINTENDED ADVERSE IMPACTS TO OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 IN MAY 2011, WE ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT INCLUDED PHASING OUT CRM MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN SWEDEN, REDUCING OUR WORKFORCE AND RATIONALIZING PRODUCT LINES. ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2012, WE ANNOUNCED A BUSINESS REALIGNMENT PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR PRODUCT DIVISIONS INTO TWO NEW OPERATING DIVISIONS AS WELL AS RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN SUPPORT FUNCTIONS BY CENTRALIZING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN MARKETING FUNCTIONS. THE ACTIONS INITIATED UNDER THESE RESTRUCTURING PLANS INCLUDED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES, THE DISPOSAL OF INVENTORY AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 WHILE THESE CHANGES ARE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ACCELERATE OUR GROWTH, REDUCE COSTS AND LEVERAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. IN ADDITION, THESE ACTIONS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS COULD YIELD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS DISRUPTION, REDUCED EMPLOYEE MORALE AND PRODUCTIVITY AND UNEXPECTED ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE ATTRITION , INCLUDING THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. THESE CONSEQUENCES COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE RECENT RESTRUCTURING MEASURES, OR OTHER RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXPENSE REDUCTION MEASURES WE TAKE IN THE FUTURE, WILL RESULT IN THE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS AND ADDITIONAL OPERATING EFFICIENCY WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE. 
 THE SUCCESS OF MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS UPON STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. 
 IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE DEVELOPED AND MARKETED IN LINE WITH THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE PROFESSIONALS WHO USE AND SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS. THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SALES OF MANY OF OUR NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR 
 22 

MAINTAINING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS AS WELL AS OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING HOSPITAL PURCHASING AGENTS, WHO ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING PURCHASING DECISIONS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE RELY ON THESE PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE US WITH CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE REGARDING OUR PRODUCTS AND THE MARKETING AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. PHYSICIANS ALSO ASSIST US AS RESEARCHERS, MARKETING CONSULTANTS, PRODUCT CONSULTANTS, INVENTORS AND AS PUBLIC SPEAKERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE PROFESSIONALS AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR ADVICE AND INPUT, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD SUFFER, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS THAT USE OUR PRODUCTS ARE REGULATED UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE AND SIMILAR STATE AND FOREIGN LAWS. WE OPERATE CONSISTENT WITH THE ADVAMED CODE OF ETHICS ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON MARKETING AND OTHER PRACTICES IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND/OR PRODUCT PURCHASERS. WE ALSO ADHERE TO MANY SIMILAR CODES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE IN PLACE AND ARE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND POLICIES. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK LAW OR SIMILAR STATE OR FOREIGN LAW COULD RESULT IN CRIMINAL OR CIVIL PENALTIES. 
 INSTABILITY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OR FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 OUR PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY MARKETED IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH OUR LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BEING EUROPE, JAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC. AS A RESULT, WE FACE CURRENCY AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, BRAZILIAN REALS, BRITISH POUNDS AND SWEDISH KRONOR, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLARS WE RECEIVE FOR SALES DENOMINATED IN ANY OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND/OR INCREASE THE U.S. DOLLARS WE REPORT AS EXPENSES IN THESE CURRENCIES, THEREBY AFFECTING OUR REPORTED CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, PROFIT MARGINS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS HAVE CAUSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CURRENCIES INVOLVED, THE VARIABILITY OF CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND THE VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. 
 IN ADDITION TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO: 
 
 - 
 
 THE IMPOSITION OF OR INCREASE IN IMPORT OR EXPORT DUTIES, SURTAXES, TARIFFS OR CUSTOMS DUTIES; 
 
 - 
 
 THE IMPOSITION OF IMPORT OR EXPORT QUOTAS OR OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS; 
 
 - 
 
 FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND POTENTIAL INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERLAPPING TAX STRUCTURES; 
 
 - 
 
 COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE UK ANTI-BRIBERY ACT AND IMPORT/EXPORT LAWS; 
 
 - 
 
 LONGER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CYCLES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WHETHER DUE TO CULTURAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS; 
 
 - 
 
 CHANGES IN MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; AND 
 
 - 
 
 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CONCERNS OVER EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF SOVEREIGN DEBT AND BUDGET DEFICITS IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN INABILITY TO PAY OR TIMELY PAY OUTSTANDING PAYABLES. 

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 DURING 2008 AND 2009, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY EXPERIENCED A SEVERE DOWNTURN DUE TO THE SEQUENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE SUBPRIME LENDING CRISIS, THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, COLLATERAL EFFECTS ON THE FINANCE AND BANKING INDUSTRIES, SLOWER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, DECREASED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS. MORE RECENTLY, CREDIT AND SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUES HAVE DESTABILIZED CERTAIN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES AND THEREBY INCREASED GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. ON AUGUST 5, 2011, STANDARD POOR'S DOWNGRADED THE U.S. CREDIT RATING TO AA+ FROM ITS TOP RANK OF AAA. THE CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT CONCERNS HAVE INCREASED THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER CREDIT RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO POSE A RISK AS THESE AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE AND COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. 
 UPHEAVAL IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR BUSINESS THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON GENERAL LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT AND CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR. THE RECOVERY FROM THE RECENT RECESSION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN BELOW HISTORIC AVERAGES AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH FOR SOME TIME. INFLATION HAS FALLEN OVER THE LAST 
 23 

SEVERAL YEARS, BUT IS NOW RISING, AND CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEGUN TIGHTENING MONETARY CONDITIONS TO ATTEMPT TO CONTROL INFLATION. PROPOSED CUTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE NEXT DECADE COULD RESULT IN CUTS TO, AND RESTRUCTURING OF, ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND AID TO STATES FOR MEDICAID PROGRAMS. OUR HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS RELY HEAVILY ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO FUND THEIR OPERATIONS. ANY CUTS TO THESE PROGRAMS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF RECENT OR FUTURE POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR BE UNABLE TO BORROW MONEY TO FUND THEIR OPERATIONS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY OR DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS OR TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS THEY DO PURCHASE OR HAVE PURCHASED ON A TIMELY BASIS, IF AT ALL. WHILE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS BEGUN TO SHOW SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, THE STRENGTH AND TIMING OF ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY REMAINS UNCERTAIN, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT TO WHAT EXTENT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR NET SALES, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, PROFIT MARGINS, PROCEDURAL VOLUMES AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES FROM THIRD PARTY PAYORS. IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIERS, LEADING THEM TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR TO BE UNABLE TO BORROW MONEY TO FUND THEIR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS. 
 ON FEBRUARY 21, 2012, AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE GREEK GOVERNMENT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND WHEREBY CREDITORS WOULD SWAP EXISTING GREEK GOVERNMENT BONDS FOR NEW BONDS WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FACE VALUE, A LONGER TERM AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. THIS AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER MACROECONOMIC AND FACTORS SPECIFIC TO THE DISTRIBUTOR, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE SOLVENCY AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR GREEK DISTRIBUTOR, RESULTING IN A 57 MILLION ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE CHARGE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN OFF DURING 2012. ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE CHARGES WERE MADE IN 2012, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE LONGER COLLECTION CYCLES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES, PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. WE STILL EXPECT TO FULLY COLLECT THESE RECEIVABLES, HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS AND SLOWDOWNS IN EUROPE MAY RESULT IN US NOT FULLY COLLECTING THESE RECEIVABLES, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONAL PROLONGATION OF THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN EUROPE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND PROCEDURAL VOLUMES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS ARE OFTEN THE SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO MARKETING AND OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES. INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST US COULD RESULT IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBSTANTIAL FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE OF OUR MARKETS. 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY THE FDA AND NUMEROUS OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. THESE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INCREASING THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR INDUSTRY. WE HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND OTHER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (OIG). THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RELATED PRIMARILY TO FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND PRODUCT PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES. 
 IN MARCH 2010, WE RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND (CID) FROM THE DOJ. THE CID REQUESTS DOCUMENTS AND SETS FORTH INTERROGATORIES RELATED TO COMMUNICATIONS BY AND WITHIN OUR COMPANY ON VARIOUS INDICATIONS FOR TACHYCARDIA IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR SYSTEMS (ICDS) AND A NATIONAL COVERAGE DECISION ISSUED BY CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. SIMILAR REQUESTS WERE MADE OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, ON AUGUST 31, 2012 WE RECEIVED A CID FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE DOJ REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO OUR RIATA AND RIATA ST SILICONE-INSULATED PRODUCTS. THE CID APPEARS TO RELATE TO A REVIEW OF WHETHER CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING OUR RIATA AND RIATA ST DEFIBRILLATOR LEAD PRODUCTS CAUSED THE SUBMISSION OF FALSE CLAIMS TO FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS. ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2012, THE OIG ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUIRING US TO PRODUCE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS RELATED TO PAYMENTS MADE BY OUR COMPANY TO HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, AND ARIZONA, AS WELL AS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO PAYMENTS MADE BY OUR COMPANY TO NON-EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. 
 WE ARE FULLY COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ARE RESPONDING TO THESE REQUESTS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE RESOLVED, THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR THEIR IMPACT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS COULD INCLUDE THE COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBSTANTIAL FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, INCLUDING EXCLUSION FROM GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE MATTERS COULD INVOLVE THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL AND COSTLY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY, IF THESE INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, THEY COULD DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS AND IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON US. THESE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES, AS WELL AS ANY ADVERSE OUTCOME FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INITIATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AT ANY TIME, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 FURTHER, GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OUR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS THE DOJ INVESTIGATION OF HOSPITALS RELATED TO ICD UTILIZATION, MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE SIZE OF THE CRM MARKET. OUR U.S. ICD SALES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 18 OF 
 24 

OUR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2012, AND ANY CHANGES IN THIS MARKET COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE CONCERN OVER BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE) MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS CONTAINING BOVINE MATERIAL. 
 OUR ANGIO-SEAL VASCULAR CLOSURE DEVICE, AS WELL AS OUR VASCULAR GRAFT PRODUCTS, CONTAIN BOVINE COLLAGEN. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE TISSUE HEART VALVES WE MARKET, SUCH AS OUR BIOCOR , EPIC AND TRIFECTA TISSUE HEART VALVES, INCORPORATE BOVINE PERICARDIAL MATERIAL. CERTAIN MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES THAT INCORPORATE ANY BOVINE MATERIAL BECAUSE OF CONCERNS OVER BSE, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS MAD COW DISEASE, A DISEASE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO HUMANS THROUGH THE CONSUMPTION OF BEEF. WHILE WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY REPORTED CASES OF TRANSMISSION OF BSE THROUGH MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND ARE COOPERATING WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES CONSIDERING THESE ISSUES, THE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF AUTHORITY TO MANUFACTURE, MARKET OR DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS CONTAINING BOVINE MATERIAL, OR THE IMPOSITION OF A REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT WE PROCURE MATERIAL FOR THESE PRODUCTS FROM ALTERNATE SOURCES, COULD RESULT IN LOST MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, HARM THE CONTINUED COMMERCIALIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH PRODUCTS AND IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US. ANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES COULD IN TURN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE ARE NOT INSURED AGAINST ALL POTENTIAL LOSSES. NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CYCLONES, TYPHOONS, TROPICAL STORMS, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS, SEVERE CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, SUCH AS ACTS OF WAR, CIVIL UNREST OR TERRORIST ATTACKS, IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR IN WHICH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CRM FACILITIES LOCATED IN SYLMAR AND SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA, PUERTO RICO AND COSTA RICA. EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE IS CURRENTLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN, EXTREMELY COSTLY AND RESTRICTIVE WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE OF COVERAGE. OUR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR OUR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES PROVIDES 10 MILLION OF INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE AGGREGATE, WITH A DEDUCTIBLE EQUAL TO 5 OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE FACILITY AND CONTENTS INVOLVED IN THE CLAIM. CONSEQUENTLY, DESPITE THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE, WE COULD INCUR UNINSURED LOSSES AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM AN EARTHQUAKE NEAR ONE OR BOTH OF OUR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY AND LOCATION OF THE EARTHQUAKE, THE EXTENT OF ANY DAMAGE TO OUR FACILITIES, THE IMPACT OF AN EARTHQUAKE ON OUR CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE AND ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE TO OUR INVENTORY AND WORK IN PROCESS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM AN EARTHQUAKE COULD BE PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE SOME OF OUR CRM PRODUCTS AT OUR OTHER MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, THE LOSSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS FOR AN INDETERMINATE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THIS MANUFACTURING TRANSITION IS COMPLETE AND OPERATES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. FURTHERMORE, OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN PUERTO RICO MAY SUFFER DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF HURRICANES WHICH ARE FREQUENT IN THE CARIBBEAN AND WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOST PRODUCTION AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES TO US TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGE IS NOT FULLY COVERED BY OUR HURRICANE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE. EVEN WITH INSURANCE COVERAGE, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING ACTS OF WAR, COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN OUR OPERATIONAL CAPACITY AND COULD ALSO LEAD TO A LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY AND TO A POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS RESULTING FROM OUR INABILITY TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR THEM, FOR WHICH WE WOULD NOT BE COMPENSATED BY EXISTING INSURANCE. THIS IN TURN COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 FURTHER, WHEN NATURAL DISASTERS, RESULT IN WIDE-SPREAD DESTRUCTION, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE OPERATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN THOSE AFFECTED LOCATIONS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THAT REGION OR ON THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS. 
 OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR MATERIAL COSTS. 
 OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GENERATION, HANDLING, TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR WASTES, PARTICULARLY ETHYLENE OXIDE, THE CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE RELEASES, AND EMISSIONS OR DISCHARGES INTO THE AIR OR WATER. WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO INCUR EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, STRICTER ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, OR THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CONTAMINATION COULD REQUIRE US TO INCUR COSTS OR BECOME THE BASIS FOR NEW OR INCREASED LIABILITIES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL. 
 WE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND, IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA OR IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT OPERATE AS INTENDED, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. 
 WE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING AND INTEGRATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING THE CONVERSION TO A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM. OUR INFORMATION AND MANUFACTURING 
 25 

SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, MOBILE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY STANDARDS AND THE INCREASING NEED TO PROTECT PATIENT AND CUSTOMER INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THIRD PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO HACK INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SYSTEMS AND MAY OBTAIN DATA RELATING TO PATIENTS WITH OUR PRODUCTS OR THE COMPANY'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OR PROTECT OUR INFORMATION AND MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY MANUFACTURING PRODUCT, HAVE DIFFICULTY PREVENTING, DETECTING, AND CONTROLLING FRAUD, BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SANCTIONS OR PENALTIES, EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES, INCUR EXPENSES OR LOSE REVENUES AS A RESULT OF A DATA PRIVACY BREACH OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. ANY SIGNIFICANT BREAKDOWN, INTRUSION, INTERRUPTION, CORRUPTION OR DESTRUCTION OF THESE SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS ANY DATA BREACHES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. 
 OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RECENT HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. 
 THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT WERE ENACTED INTO LAW IN MARCH 2010. AS A U.S. HEADQUARTERED COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW WILL MATERIALLY IMPACT US AS WELL AS THE U.S. ECONOMY. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE LAW WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR WHICH THE DETAILS HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED OR CONSEQUENCES NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE FULL IMPACTS WILL BE FROM THE LAW. THE LAW DOES LEVY A 2.3 EXCISE TAX ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR U.S. MEDICAL DEVICE SALES BEGINNING IN 2013. OUR U.S. NET SALES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 47 OF OUR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2012 AND WE STILL EXPECT THE NEW TAX WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE LAW ALSO FOCUSES ON A NUMBER OF MEDICARE PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING QUALITY AND DECREASING COSTS. IT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT WHAT NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THESE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE ON PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE MEDICARE PROVISIONS INCLUDE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAMS, INCREASED FUNDING OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH, REDUCED HOSPITAL PAYMENTS FOR AVOIDABLE READMISSIONS AND HOSPITAL ACQUIRED CONDITIONS, AND PILOT PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES THAT PROMOTE CARE COORDINATION (SUCH AS BUNDLED PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PAYMENTS). ADDITIONALLY, THE LAW INCLUDES A REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL RATE OF INFLATION FOR MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS THAT BEGAN IN 2011 AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD TO RECOMMEND WAYS OF REDUCING THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE SPENDING BEGINNING IN 2014. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENTED AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL, OR THE EFFECT OF ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION. HOWEVER, ANY CHANGES THAT LOWER REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR REDUCE MEDICAL PROCEDURE VOLUMES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS NON-INCOME BASED TAXES, IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. TAX AUTHORITIES MAY DISAGREE WITH CERTAIN POSITIONS WE HAVE TAKEN AND ASSESS ADDITIONAL TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELY OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF OUR TAX PROVISION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACCURATELY PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS, AND THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR TAX RULINGS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. FOR EXAMPLE, PROPOSALS FOR FUNDAMENTAL U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM, SUCH AS PAST PROPOSALS BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, IF ENACTED, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, RECENT HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION LEVIES A 2.3 EXCISE TAX ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR U.S. MEDICAL DEVICE SALES BEGINNING IN 2013.

1A RISK FACTORS 

 THE
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR OPERATING
 RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION TO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, ARE
 DESCRIBED BELOW : 

A
 DECLINE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE, WOULD ADVERSELY
 AFFECT US. 

A
 PRIMARY
 SOURCE OF OUR REVENUE IS ADVERTISING. FOR 2006 AND 2005, ADVERTISING REVENUES,
 WHICH INCLUDE RETAIL, NATIONAL AND CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING REVENUES, CONSTITUTED
 APPROXIMATELY 81.9 AND 81.3 , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES.
 A
 REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING COULD RESULT FROM: 

A
 GENERAL DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; 

A
 DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN PARTICULAR MARKETS WHERE WE CONDUCT
 BUSINESS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA MARKET WHERE
 WE
 DERIVED APPROXIMATELY 31.8 OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDING
 DECEMBER
 31, 2006; 

A
 DECLINE IN THE CIRCULATION OF OUR
 NEWSPAPERS; 

A
 DECLINE IN THE POPULARITY OF OUR EDITORIAL
 CONTENT; 

A
 CHANGE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC MAKEUP OF THE POPULATION WHERE OUR NEWSPAPERS
 ARE SOLD; 

A
 DECREASE IN THE PRICE OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL
 ADVERTISING; 

THE
 ACTIVITIES OF OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION
 FROM OTHER
 FORMS OF ADVERTISING-BASED MEDIUMS, INCLUDING LOCAL, REGIONAL AND
 NATIONAL
 NEWSPAPERS, SHOPPERS, RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTERS, CABLE
 TELEVISION
 (NATIONAL AND LOCAL), DIRECT MAIL AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA (INCLUDING
 THE
 INTERNET); AND 

A
 DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT SPENT ON ADVERTISING IN
 GENERAL. 

OUR
 REVENUES ARE CYCLICAL AND MAY DECREASE DUE TO AN ECONOMIC
 DOWNTURN. 

NEWSPAPER
 COMPANIES TEND TO FOLLOW A DISTINCT AND RECURRING SEASONAL PATTERN. THE
 FIRST
 QUARTER OF THE YEAR TENDS TO BE THE WEAKEST QUARTER BECAUSE ADVERTISING
 VOLUME
 IS THEN AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL. THE FOURTH QUARTER TENDS TO BE THE STRONGEST
 QUARTER AS IT INCLUDES HOLIDAY SEASON ADVERTISING. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSOLIDATED
 RESULTS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. 

OUR
 ADVERTISING REVENUES, AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IN GENERAL,
 MAY
 BE CYCLICAL AND DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE CANNOT ASSURE
 YOU
 THAT THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES WILL CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS. HISTORICALLY,
 ADVERTISING REVENUES HAVE INCREASED WITH THE BEGINNING OF AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY,
 PRINCIPALLY WITH INCREASES IN CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING FOR EMPLOYMENT, REAL
 ESTATE
 AND AUTOMOBILES. DECREASES IN ADVERTISING REVENUES HAVE HISTORICALLY
 CORRESPONDED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND REGIONAL AND LOCAL RECESSIONARY
 CONDITIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS
 MITIGATES, TO SOME DEGREE, THE EFFECTS OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS,
 A DECLINE IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY GENERALLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING
 RESULTS. 

A
 DECLINE IN CIRCULATION REVENUE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. 

WE
 ALSO
 RELY ON CIRCULATION REVENUE, WHICH IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
 COMPETITION AND CONSUMER TRENDS, INCLUDING DECLINING CONSUMER SPENDING ON
 NEWSPAPERS. CIRCULATION IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF OUR REVENUE. CIRCULATION
 REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PRICE INCREASES FOR OUR PRINT PRODUCTS
 ARE
 AFFECTED BY: 

COMPETITION
 FROM OTHER PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER FORMS OF MEDIA AVAILABLE IN OUR
 VARIOUS
 MARKETS, I NCLUDING
 NETWORK, CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION, THE INTERNET AND
 RADIO; 

DECLINING
 CONSUMER SPENDING ON DISCRETIONARY ITEMS LIKE
 NEWSPAPERS; 

COMPETING
 USES OF FREE TIME; AND 

DECLINING
 NUMBER OF REGULAR NEWSPAPER BUYERS.

FLUCTUATIONS
 IN NEWSPRINT COSTS, OR INCREASES IN LABOR OR HEALTH CARE COSTS COULD ADVERSELY
 AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

NEWSPRINT,
 INK AND SUPPLEMENTS ARE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR COST OF RAW MATERIALS.
 NEWSPRINT, INK AND SUPPLEMENTS WERE 12.6 , 12.0 , AND 11.8 OF OUR TOTAL
 OPERATING REVENUES IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY
 NEWSPRINT
 PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED SUBSTANTIALLY. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE
 TO
 CHANGES IN NEWSPRINT PRICES. WE HAVE NO LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND
 WE HAVE
 NOT ATTEMPTED TO HEDGE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE NORMAL PURCHASES OF NEWSPRINT
 OR
 ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEWSPRINT.
 IF
 THE PRICE OF NEWSPRINT INCREASES MATERIALLY, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD
 BE
 ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN LABOR OR HEALTH
 CARE
 COSTS COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 

COMPETITION
 COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. 

REVENUE
 GENERATION IN THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY UPON THE SALE
 OF
 ADVERTISING AND PAID CIRCULATION. COMPETITION AND PRICING ARE LARGELY BASED
 ON
 READERSHIP, MARKET PENETRATION, QUALITY AND SERVICING THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS
 OF
 ADVERTISERS AND READERS. CURRENTLY, OUR DAILY NEWSPAPERS GENERALLY DO NOT
 DIRECTLY COMPETE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES WITH OTHER DAILY NEWSPAPERS
 COVERING LOCAL NEWS. COMPETITION FOR ADVERTISING AND CIRCULATION, HOWEVER,
 ALSO
 COMES FROM REGIONAL AND NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS, RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST,
 CABLE TELEVISION (NATIONAL AND LOCAL), NON-DAILY NEWSPAPERS, DIRECT MAIL,
 ELECTRONIC MEDIA (INCLUDING THE INTERNET) AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND
 ADVERTISING MEDIA THAT OPERATE IN OUR MARKETS. CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITORS
 ARE
 LARGER AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. THE EXTENT AND
 NATURE
 OF SUCH COMPETITION IS, IN LARGE PART, DETERMINED BY THE LOCATION AND
 DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE MARKET AND THE NUMBER OF MEDIA ALTERNATIVES IN THOSE
 MARKETS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR COMPETITION AND FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT
 OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, SEE BUSINESS COMPETITION. 

WE
 MUST CONSTANTLY EXPAND AND DEVELOP NEW PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES TO COMPETE
 FOR
 ADVERTISING DOLLARS AGAINST COMPETITORS WHO MAY TARGET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS
 OF
 ADVERTISERS. 

IN
 RECENT
 YEARS, NEWSPAPERS HAVE FACED COMPETITION FOR ADVERTISING DOLLARS FROM PUBLISHERS
 OF SPECIALIZED PUBLICATIONS TARGETED TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF READERS. TO MEET
 THIS
 COMPETITION, OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE
 OFFERING NEW PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES THAT SUCCESSFULLY GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE
 BY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF SPECIFIC AUDIENCE GROUPS WITHIN OUR TARGET MARKETS.
 THE PROCESS OF INTERNALLY RESEARCHING, DEVELOPING, LAUNCHING, GAINING ACCEPTANCE
 AND ESTABLISHING PROFITABILITY FOR A NEW PUBLICATION OR SERVICE, IS INHERENTLY
 RISKY AND COSTLY. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE
 NEW
 PUBLICATIONS OR SERVICES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. 

WE
 ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO US, COULD
 ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

WE
 ARE
 SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.
 WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WILL HAVE
 A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT UPON OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THE DAMAGES THAT MAY
 BE
 CLAIMED IN THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL, INCLUDING CLAIMS
 FOR
 PUNITIVE OR EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, IF THE OUTCOMES OF
 THESE
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
 FUTURE
 FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION
 OR LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IN THE FUTURE OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE
 PROVES TO BE INADEQUATE OR UNAVAILABLE OR THERE IS AN INCREASE IN LIABILITIES
 FOR WHICH WE ARE SELF-INSURED. 

THE
 INTERESTS OF OUR PARENT, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS, AND ITS ULTIMATE OWNERS,
 THE
 MORRIS FAMILY, MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN HOLDERS OF OUR SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES,
 AND THEY MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE VIEWED AS ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS
 OR THE NOTES. 

MORRIS
 COMMUNICATIONS, ITS ULTIMATE PARENT COMPANY, SHIVERS TRADING OPERATING
 COMPANY, AND THE MORRIS FAMILY HAVE INTERESTS IN OTHER BUSINESSES THAT MAY
 HAVE
 CONFLICTING BUSINESS INTERESTS. OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS
 OPERATE BUSINESSES THAT ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING, INCLUDING
 BROADCAST RADIO STATIONS, OUTDOOR ADVERTISING, MAGAZINES, BOOK PUBLISHING
 AND
 SPECIALIZED PUBLICATIONS. THESE OTHER SUBSIDIARIES MAY COMPETE WITH US FOR
 ADVERTISING REVENUES. BECAUSE THE MORRIS FAMILY S INTERESTS AS AN EQUITY HOLDER
 MAY CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF HOLDERS OF THE NOTES, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS
 MAY CAUSE US TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT, IN THEIR JUDGMENT, COULD ENHANCE THEIR
 EQUITY
 INVESTMENT, EVEN THOUGH SUCH ACTIONS MIGHT INVOLVE RISKS TO YOU AS A HOLDER
 OF
 THE NOTES. 

THERE
 CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OR THE MORRIS FAMILY WILL
 EXERCISE CONTROL IN OUR BEST INTERESTS AS OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN BEST
 INTERESTS. 

THE
 MORRIS FAMILY, INCLUDING WILLIAM S. MORRIS III, OUR CHAIRMAN, AND HIS SON,
 WILLIAM S. MORRIS IV, OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BENEFICIALLY
 OWN ALL OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS, OUR PARENT COMPANY,
 THROUGH THEIR OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK OF SHIVERS TRADING OPERATING COMPANY.
 BY VIRTUE OF SUCH EQUITY OWNERSHIP, THE MORRIS FAMILY HAS THE SOLE POWER
 TO: 

ELECT
 THE ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SHIVERS TRADING OPERATING COMPANY,
 MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS AND EACH OF THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING
 US; 

CONTROL
 ALL OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND POLICIES, INCLUDING AS TO THE MAKING
 OF PAYMENTS
 TO MORRIS FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER AFFILIATES, WHETHER BY WAY OF
 DIVIDEND,
 STOCK REPURCHASE, COMPENSATION OR OTHERWISE OR THE ENTERING INTO
 OTHER
 TRANSACTIONS WITH MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHER
 AFFILIATES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE
 OF CONTROL
 OF MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OR MORRIS PUBLISHING;

 THE OUTCOME OF ANY CORPORATE MATTER OR TRANSACTION, INCLUDING MERGERS,
 JOINT VENTURES, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ASSET SALES, EQUITY ISSUANCES
 OR DEBT
 INCURRENCES. 

WE
 HAVE NO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND NO INDEPENDENT AUDIT COMMITTEE TO REVIEW
 THE
 ACTIONS OF MANAGEMENT OR THE MORRIS FAMILY. 

CURRENTLY
 FIVE OF THE SIX DIRECTORS ON THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF SHIVERS TRADING 
OPERATING COMPANY, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS AND EACH OF THEIR SUBSIDIARIES
 (INCLUDING OUR BOARD) ARE MEMBERS OF THE MORRIS FAMILY
 AND THE SIXTH IS CRAIG S. MITCHELL WHO IS ALSO THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
 -
 FINANCE, SECRETARY AND TREASURER OF SHIVERS TRADING OPERATING COMPANY,
 MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS AND EACH OF THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. MR. MITCHELL SERVES
 AT THE
 PLEASURE OF THE MORRIS FAMILY. NONE OF THESE BOARDS HAS AN AUDIT COMMITTEE
 WITH
 INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND WILL NOT NECESSARILY HAVE AS A MEMBER A FINANCIAL
 EXPERT AS DEFINED UNDER THE RULES OF THE COMMISSION AS A RESULT OF THE
 SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THE MORRIS FAMILY DOES
 NOT
 PLAN TO APPOINT ANY NON-FAMILY MEMBERS TO ANY SUCH BOARDS, OTHER THAN THE
 CURRENT SINGLE EXISTING NON-FAMILY MEMBER DIRECTOR, OR ANY INDEPENDENT 
DIRECTORS. NO MEMBER OF ANY SUCH BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS BEEN ELECTED, OR
 IS
 ANTICIPATED TO BE ELECTED, TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE HOLDERS OF THE
 NOTES. 

IN
 ADDITION, AS PRIVATE COMPANIES, SHIVERS TRADING OPERATING COMPANY, MORRIS
 COMMUNICATIONS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING MORRIS PUBLISHING, HAVE NOT
 BEEN
 REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OR OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE
 SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OR ANY OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OR OTHER RULES AND
 REGULATIONS OF ANY STOCK EXCHANGE OR NATIONAL STOCK QUOTATION SYSTEM. MORRIS
 PUBLISHING HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT,
 BUT
 THOSE PROVISIONS DO NOT REQUIRE MORRIS PUBLISHING TO HAVE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS
 OR AN AUDIT COMMITTEE. 

WE
 DEPEND UPON THE MORRIS FAMILY FOR MANAGEMENT, LEADERSHIP AND GENERAL
 POLICY-MAKING. 

THE
 UNAVAILABILITY FOR ANY REASON OF THE MANAGERIAL SERVICES PRESENTLY PROVIDED
 BY
 THE MORRIS FAMILY (PARTICULARLY OUR CHAIRMAN WILLIAM S. MORRIS III AND OUR
 CHIEF
 EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. MORRIS IV) TO MORRIS
 PUBLISHING, COULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.
 WHILE
 WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THE MORRIS FAMILY HAS NO INTENTION TO ENGAGE IN
 A
 TRANSACTION THAT WOULD LEAD TO A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF SHIVERS TRADING 
OPERATING COMPANY, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OR MORRIS PUBLISHING, NO ASSURANCES
 CAN
 BE GIVEN THAT FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NOT ARISE THAT WOULD
 LEAD
 TO A POSSIBLE CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

VARIOUS
 ENTITIES WHICH ARE AFFILIATED WITH MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS AND THE MORRIS FAMILY
 HAVE ENGAGED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ENGAGE, IN TRANSACTIONS WITH US SOME
 OF
 WHICH MAY BE VIEWED, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A HOLDER OF THE NOTES, AS
 DISADVANTAGEOUS TO US OR AN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF OUR
 RESOURCES. 

THESE
 TRANSACTIONS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSUMMATED ON AN ARM S-LENGTH BASIS AND
 THEREFORE MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE TO US AS THOSE THAT COULD BE NEGOTIATED
 WITH
 NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES. SEE CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
 TRANSACTIONS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THE
 FOLLOWING: 

WE
 ARE MANAGED BY MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS PURSUANT TO A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 AND ALSO PARTICIPATE IN ITS SHARED SERVICES CENTER OPERATED BY
 ITS
 SUBSIDIARY, MSTAR SOLUTIONS, LLC. 

IN
 ADDITION TO THE MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WE MAY SHARE OTHER FACILITIES
 AND
 COSTS WITH MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS AND ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. SHARED
 COSTS
 MAY INCLUDE JOINT PROMOTIONS OR THE USE OF FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT,
 SUPPLIES
 OR EMPLOYEES OF ONE DIVISION FOR THE BENEFIT OF AN AFFILIATE AND
 THE COSTS
 WILL BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE VARIOUS ENTITIES BY MORRIS
 COMMUNICATIONS. 

RENTAL
 ARRANGEMENTS WITH A COMPANY CONTROLLED BY MORRIS FAMILY MEMBERS

 USE OF OUR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA NEWSPAPER
 OPERATION. 

IN
 THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY SELL OR PURCHASE GOODS
 AND
 SERVICES FROM OUR AFFILIATES, SUCH AS RADIO OR OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
 AND
 PROMOTIONS, SPACE IN HOTELS OWNED BY AFFILIATES, OR FARM PRODUCTS
 FROM
 FARMS OWNED BY AFFILIATES, ON TERMS THAT WE DETERMINE TO BE COMPARABLE
 TO
 TRANSACTIONS WITH UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES. WE
 MAY PROVIDE LOANS TO MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES.
 ANY SUCH
 LOANS MAY UTILIZE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES
 THAT MAY
 OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES. IT IS
 EXPECTED
 THAT THE PRINCIPAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS
 AND ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE LOANS BY OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM
 MORRIS
 PUBLISHING.

 OF THE
 GROUP IN THE EVENT OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE TAXES
 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEIR OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE
 OF THE FCC S CROSS-OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS AND MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OWNERSHIP OF
 RADIO STATIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT WOULD BE FAVORABLE,
 OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF EXISTING
 NEWSPAPERS. 

RULES
 OF
 THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, OR FCC, LIMIT THE CROSS-OWNERSHIP
 OF A
 BROADCAST RADIO STATION AND A NEWSPAPER IN THE SAME MARKET. MORRIS
 COMMUNICATIONS OWNS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES WHICH OWN RADIO BROADCAST LICENSES
 THAT
 ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC. THESE SUBSIDIARIES CURRENTLY HOLD,
 UNDER
 WAIVERS GRANTED BY THE FCC, RADIO BROADCAST LICENSES IN TWO OF MORRIS
 PUBLISHING S NEWSPAPER MARKETS: AMARILLO, TEXAS AND TOPEKA, KANSAS. A MORRIS
 SUBSIDIARY IS PARTY TO A RADIO JOINT SALES AGREEMENT JSA IN AMARILLO AS
 WELL. A SUBSIDIARY OF MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS ALSO RECEIVED A 12 MONTH WAIVER
 (WHICH HAS EXPIRED AND FOR WHICH A REQUEST FOR EXTENSION IS PENDING) TO HOLD
 A
 RADIO BROADCAST LICENSE FOR A STATION IT ACQUIRED WITH A SERVICE CONTOUR
 THAT
 INCLUDES NEWTON, KANSAS - ANOTHER MORRIS NEWSPAPER MARKET. IN 2003, THE FCC
 ADOPTED OWNERSHIP RULES THAT WOULD PERMIT CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF A BROADCAST
 RADIO
 STATION AND A NEWSPAPER IN THE SAME MARKET IN MANY INSTANCES, BUT THESE RULES
 WERE CHALLENGED IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, WHICH
 REMANDED THE RULES TO THE FCC AND STAYED THE RULES EFFECTIVE DATE. IN JULY
 2006, THE FCC ISSUED A FURTHER
 NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING 
 (THE
 FURTHER NOTICE ), TO SOLICIT COMMENT ON THE ISSUES REMANDED BY THE THIRD
 CIRCUIT AND TO FULFILL THE COMMISSION S OBLIGATION TO REVIEW ITS MEDIA OWNERSHIP
 RULES EVERY FOUR YEARS. WHEN NEW OWNERSHIP RULES BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON
 COMPLETION OF THE REMAND PROCEEDINGS, MORRIS MAY BE ABLE TO HOLD THE RADIO
 BROADCAST LICENSES DISCUSSED ABOVE WITHOUT WAIVERS. IF, HOWEVER, THE COMMISSION
 OR CONGRESS DECIDES TO ENACT MORE RESTRICTIVE MULTIPLE OR CROSS OWNERSHIP
 RULES
 AND TO REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF NONCOMPLIANT COMBINATIONS, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS
 AND MORRIS PUBLISHING MIGHT NEED TO DIVEST EITHER THEIR RADIO BROADCAST STATION
 HOLDINGS OR THEIR NEWSPAPER INTERESTS IN THESE MARKETS. FURTHER, FCC
 CROSS-OWNERSHIP RULES MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING US FROM PURSUING
 OR
 CONSUMMATING A NEWSPAPER ACQUISITION THAT OUR MANAGEMENT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE
 PURSUED IN MARKETS IN WHICH MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OWNS RADIO
 STATIONS. 

IF
 WE FAIL TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ADVERSELY
 AFFECTED. 

OUR
 FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS ARE DEPENDENT IN LARGE PART UPON
 OUR
 ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE CANNOT ASSURE
 YOU
 THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR BE
 ABLE
 TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT
 WE
 WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN CIRCULATION OF OUR PUBLICATIONS, OBTAIN NEW SOURCES
 OF
 ADVERTISING REVENUES, GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES BY BUILDING ON THE BRAND
 NAMES OF OUR PUBLICATIONS OR RAISE THE COVER PRICES OF OUR PUBLICATIONS WITHOUT
 CAUSING A DECLINE IN CIRCULATION. 

IMPLEMENTATION
 OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY COULD BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS BEYOND
 OUR
 CONTROL, SUCH AS INCREASED COMPETITION, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL
 DEVELOPMENTS OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS OR EXPENSES. IN PARTICULAR, THERE
 HAS
 BEEN A RECENT TREND OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION AMONG MAJOR RETAILERS, INCLUDING
 AS A RESULT OF BANKRUPTCIES OF CERTAIN RETAILERS. THIS TREND MAY ADVERSELY
 AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ADVERTISERS USING
 OUR
 PRODUCTS AND INCREASING THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE CONSOLIDATED RETAILERS,
 THEREBY LEADING TO A DECLINE IN OUR ADVERTISING REVENUES. ANY FAILURE BY
 US TO
 SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY
 TO
 SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
 PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES. WE MAY, IN ADDITION, DECIDE TO ALTER OR DISCONTINUE
 CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AT ANY TIME. 

CONSOLIDATION
 IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE
 DISADVANTAGE . 

RECENTLY,
 SOME OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT
 CONSOLIDATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMBINATIONS OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA CONTENT
 COMPANIES AND NEW MEDIA DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES HAVE RESULTED IN NEW BUSINESS
 MODELS AND STRATEGIES. SHOULD THE REVISED OWNERSHIP RULES ADOPTED BY THE
 FCC
 WITHSTAND COURT AND CONGRESSIONAL CHALLENGES, THEY WILL INCREASE THE POTENTIAL
 OF CONSOLIDATION FOR OUR SECTOR. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EXTENT
 TO
 WHICH THESE TYPES OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR OR THE IMPACT THAT THEY
 MAY
 HAVE. THESE COMBINATIONS COULD POTENTIALLY PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE
 DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO NEGOTIATIONS, SALES, RESOURCES AND OUR ABILITY
 TO
 DEVELOP AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES.

WE
 MAY PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, BUT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE
 ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS OR REALIZE
 THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND WE MAY ENTER INTO JOINT
 VENTURES. 

WE
 MAY
 PURSUE GROWTH IN PART THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL NEWSPAPERS OR
 CERTAIN OTHER BUSINESSES AND ASSETS AND WE MAY ENTER INTO JOINT VENTURES.
 THIS
 STRATEGY IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING: 

AN
 INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FINANCING TO COMPLETE OUR
 ACQUISITIONS; 

INCREASES
 IN PURCHASE PRICES FOR NEWSPAPER ASSETS DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION
 FOR
 ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES; 

AN
 INABILITY TO NEGOTIATE DEFINITIVE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON SATISFACTORY
 TERMS; 

DIFFICULTY
 IN OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL; 

DIFFICULTY
 IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT OF ACQUIRED
 ASSETS
 AND ABSORBING THE INCREASED DEMANDS ON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE, OPERATIONAL
 AND
 FINANCIAL RESOURCES; 

THE
 DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM THEIR OTHER
 RESPONSIBILITIES; 

THE
 LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF OUR
 ACQUISITIONS; 

THE
 FAILURE TO REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF OUR
 ACQUISITIONS; 

OUR
 BEING SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN LIABILITIES;
 AND 

PARTICIPATION
 IN JOINT VENTURES MAY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CASH FLOW OF ASSETS
 CONTRIBUTED TO THE JOINT VENTURE. 

OUR
 INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THESE RISKS COULD FORCE US TO REVISE OUR
 BUSINESS PLAN, INCUR UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES OR FOREGO ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
 FOR EXPANSION. 

WE
 ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. 

WE
 ARE
 SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING,
 AMONG
 OTHER THINGS, EMISSIONS TO THE AIR, WASTE WATER AND STORM WATER DISCHARGES,
 HANDLING, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF WASTES, RECYCLING, REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED
 SITES, OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. ENVIRONMENTAL
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION HAVE CHANGED RAPIDLY IN RECENT
 YEARS AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRESENT
 OR
 FUTURE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LIABILITY TO US. SOME ENVIRONMENTAL
 LAWS IMPOSE STRICT, AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES JOINT AND SEVERAL,
 LIABILITY
 FOR COSTS OF REMEDIATION OF SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION AT OUR FACILITIES
 OR THOSE WHERE OUR WASTES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED. OUR CURRENT AND FORMER PROPERTIES
 MAY HAVE HAD HISTORIC USES WHICH MAY REQUIRE INVESTIGATION OR REMEDIAL
 MEASURES.
 WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
 REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT MATERIAL COSTS AND/OR
 LIABILITIES WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE INCLUDING THOSE WHICH MAY ARISE
 FROM
 DISCOVERY OF CURRENTLY UNKNOWN CONDITIONS. 

THE
 FTC DO NOT CALL RULE HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT OUR
 ABILITY TO SELL NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS BY TELEPHONE MARKETING.

RISKS
 RELATING TO THE NOTES ARE AS FOLLOWS : 

OUR
 SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND PREVENT
 US FROM
 FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES. 

WE
 HAVE A
 SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD 524
 MILLION
 OF DEBT OUTSTANDING, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 224 MILLION OF SENIOR
 DEBT AND
 300 MILLION OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES. IN ADDITION, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING
 THE NOTES AND OUR NEW CREDIT FACILITIES ALLOW US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL
 INDEBTEDNESS IN THE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD 119.8 MILLION
 AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OF OUR SENIOR
 CREDIT FACILITIES. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS MAY HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES,
 INCLUDING: 

MAKING
 IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT
 TO THE
 NOTES; 

LIMITING
 CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,
 POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE
 REQUIREMENTS; 

INCREASING
 OUR VULNERABILITY TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY
 CONDITIONS;

TABLE
 OF CONTENTS 

LIMITING
 OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO FUND FUTURE WORKING
 CAPITAL,
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE
 REQUIREMENTS; 

LIMITING
 OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR
 BUSINESS
 AND INDUSTRY; 

PLACING
 US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH
 LESS
 INDEBTEDNESS; AND 

MAKING
 IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLY WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN
 OUR CREDIT
 FACILITIES. 

WE
 MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE
 OBLIGATIONS . 

OUR
 ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
 PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT, INCLUDING
 THE NOTES, WILL DEPEND ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, WHICH WILL BE AFFECTED
 BY A
 RANGE OF ECONOMIC,
 COMPETITIVE AND BUSINESS FACTORS. WE CANNOT CONTROL MANY OF THESE FACTORS,
 INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE REALLOCATION OF ADVERTISING
 EXPENDITURES TO OTHER AVAILABLE MEDIA AND A DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT SPENT ON
 ADVERTISING IN GENERAL. IF OUR OPERATIONS DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH
 FLOW
 FROM OPERATIONS TO SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY NEED TO SEEK
 ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS OR UNDERTAKE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING
 PLANS, SUCH AS REFINANCING OR RESTRUCTURING OUR DEBT, SELLING ASSETS OR REDUCING
 OR DELAYING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT
 SUCH
 ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ALTERNATIVE FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE
 TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS
 OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ALTERNATIVE FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS
 COULD
 HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS. 

RESTRICTIONS
 IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS REDUCE OUR OPERATING FLEXIBILITY AND CONTAIN COVENANTS
 AND RESTRICTIONS THAT CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULTS. 

THE
 TERMS
 OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND THE INDENTURE RELATING TO THE NOTES RESTRICT,
 AMONG
 OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY
 TO: 

INCUR
 OR REPAY DEBT; 

DISPOSE
 OF ASSETS; 

CREATE
 LIENS; 

MAKE
 INVESTMENTS; 

ENTER
 INTO AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS; AND 

PAY
 DIVIDENDS. 

UNDER
 OUR
 CREDIT FACILITIES WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED FINANCIAL RATIOS
 AND
 LEVELS INCLUDING: 

A
 MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO; 

A
 MINIMUM FIXED CHARGES COVERAGE RATIO;
 AND 

A
 MAXIMUM CASH FLOW RATIO. 

IF
 WE
 FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE TESTS, THE LENDERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE
 ALL
 AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES TO BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE.
 IF
 THIS WAS TO OCCUR, AND THE LENDERS DECIDE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO ACCELERATE
 THE INDEBTEDNESS, IT WOULD CREATE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS FOR US AND COULD
 LEAD TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES. IN SUCH
 AN
 EVENT, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO PAY AMOUNTS
 DUE ON THE NOTES. AS A RESULT, YOU MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN THE FULL AMOUNT
 YOU
 WOULD BE OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ON THE NOTES. ANY OF THESE EVENTS
 COULD
 HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIONS, AND ANY SIMILAR
 RESTRICTIONS IN FUTURE AGREEMENTS, DEPENDS ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.
 SINCE
 OUR PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS
 CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WE MAY BE UNABLE
 TO
 COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIONS IN THE FUTURE.

 PRIOR
 PAYMENT IN FULL OF OUR AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS RESPECTIVE CURRENT AND

 MILLION
 OF SENIOR DEBT THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.

 GUARANTEES ARE PROHIBITED IN THE EVENT OF A PAYMENT DEFAULT ON OUR SENIOR
 CREDIT
 FACILITIES, AND MAY BE PROHIBITED IN ANY FUTURE SENIOR
 INDEBTEDNESS. 

ALL
 OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE GUARANTEED BY MORRIS
 COMMUNICATIONS AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND SUCH GUARANTEES ARE
 SECURED
 WITH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR ASSETS. 

THE
 NOTES AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES ARE EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO ALL OF
 OUR
 AND OUR SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS SECURED INDEBTEDNESS AND ALL INDEBTEDNESS OF OUR
 NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. 

THE
 SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES ARE NOT SECURED. THE LENDERS UNDER OUR SENIOR
 CREDIT
 FACILITIES ARE SECURED BY LIENS ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR AND OUR
 SUBSIDIARIES ASSETS AND BY A PLEDGE OF THE STOCK OF ALL OF THE SUBSIDIARY
 GUARANTORS. IF WE, MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS OR ANY OF THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS
 DECLARE BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE, OR IF PAYMENT UNDER THE CREDIT
 FACILITIES OR ANY OF OUR OTHER SECURED INDEBTEDNESS IS ACCELERATED, OUR
 SECURED
 LENDERS ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A SECURED LENDER
 UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND HAVE A CLAIM ON THOSE ASSETS BEFORE THE HOLDERS
 OF THE
 NOTES. AS A RESULT, THE NOTES ARE EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO OUR AND OUR
 SUBSIDIARIES SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS
 SECURING THAT INDEBTEDNESS, AND THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
 RECOVER RATABLY LESS THAN THE LENDERS OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES SECURED
 INDEBTEDNESS IN THE EVENT OF OUR BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION.
 AS OF
 DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD 224 MILLION OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING,
 NOT
 INCLUDING 119.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL SECURED INDEBTEDNESS THAT WOULD
 HAVE BEEN
 AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OF OUR SENIOR
 CREDIT FACILITIES. 

SOME
 OF
 OUR FUTURE SUBSIDIARIES MAY NOT BE GUARANTORS ON THE NOTES AND SOME OF OUR
 EXISTING SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE RELEASED FROM THEIR GUARANTEES UPON BECOMING
 AN
 UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE. PAYMENTS
 ON THE
 NOTES ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE BY US AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS. AS
 A
 RESULT, NO PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE FROM ASSETS OF SUBSIDIARIES WHICH
 DO
 NOT GUARANTEE THE NOTES. THE NOTES ARE STRUCTURALLY SUBORDINATED TO ALL OF
 THE
 LIABILITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT DO NOT GUARANTEE THE NOTES. IN THE EVENT
 OF
 A BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION OF ANY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY,
 HOLDERS OF ITS INDEBTEDNESS, ITS TRADE CREDITORS AND HOLDERS OF ITS PREFERRED
 EQUITY ARE GENERALLY ENTITLED TO PAYMENT ON THEIR CLAIMS FROM ASSETS OF THAT
 SUBSIDIARY BEFORE ANY ASSETS ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO US. HOWEVER,
 UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TERMS OF THE NOTES PERMIT OUR NON-GUARANTOR
 SUBSIDIARIES TO INCUR ADDITIONAL SPECIFIED INDEBTEDNESS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE
 NO
 NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. 

WE
 MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE NOTES UPON A CHANGE OF
 CONTROL. 

UPON
 THE
 OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC KINDS OF CHANGE OF CONTROL EVENTS, WE ARE
 REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE ALL OUTSTANDING NOTES AT A PRICE EQUAL TO
 101 
 OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO THE
 DATE
 OF REPURCHASE. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT
 FUNDS
 AT
 THE TIME OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL TO MAKE THE REQUIRED REPURCHASE OF NOTES
 OR
 THAT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES WOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH
 REPURCHASE. 

FEDERAL
 AND STATE STATUTES ALLOW COURTS, UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, TO VOID THE
 GUARANTEES OF THE NOTES BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND REQUIRE THE HOLDERS OF THE
 NOTES
 TO RETURN PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE SUBSIDIARY
 GUARANTORS. 

UNDER
 THE
 FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW AND COMPARABLE PROVISIONS OF STATE FRAUDULENT TRANSFER
 LAWS, THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES COULD BE VOIDED, OR CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF
 THE
 SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES COULD BE SUBORDINATED TO ALL OTHER DEBTS OF A SUBSIDIARY
 GUARANTOR IF, EITHER, THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE WAS INCURRED WITH THE INTENT
 TO
 HINDER, DELAY OR DEFRAUD ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE CREDITORS OF THE SUBSIDIARY
 GUARANTOR OR THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR, AT THE TIME IT INCURRED THE INDEBTEDNESS
 EVIDENCED BY ITS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE, RECEIVED LESS THAN REASONABLY EQUIVALENT
 VALUE OR FAIR CONSIDERATION FOR THE INCURRENCE OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AND THE
 SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR EITHER: 

WAS
 INSOLVENT OR RENDERED INSOLVENT BY REASON OF SUCH
 INCURRENCE; 

WAS
 ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS OR TRANSACTION FOR WHICH SUCH SUBSIDIARY
 GUARANTOR S
 REMAINING ASSETS CONSTITUTED UNREASONABLY SMALL CAPITAL;
 OR 

INTENDED
 TO INCUR, OR BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD INCUR, DEBTS BEYOND ITS ABILITY
 TO PAY
 SUCH DEBTS AS THEY MATURE. 

THE
 MEASURES OF INSOLVENCY FOR PURPOSES OF THESE FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS VARY
 DEPENDING UPON THE LAW APPLIED IN ANY PROCEEDING TO DETERMINE WHETHER A
 FRAUDULENT TRANSFER HAS OCCURRED. GENERALLY, HOWEVER, A SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR
 WOULD BE CONSIDERED INSOLVENT IF: 

-21- 

TABLE
 OF CONTENTS 

THE
 SUM OF ITS DEBTS, INCLUDING CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WAS GREATER
 THAN THE
 FAIR SALEABLE VALUE OF ALL OF ITS
 ASSETS; 

THE
 PRESENT FAIR SALEABLE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS WERE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT
 THAT
 WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY ON ITS EXISTING
 DEBTS,
 INCLUDING CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, AS THEY BECOME ABSOLUTE AND MATURE;
 OR 

IT
 COULD NOT PAY ITS DEBTS AS THEY BECOME
 DUE. 

ON
 THE
 BASIS OF HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION, RECENT OPERATING HISTORY AND OTHER
 FACTORS, WE AND EACH SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR BELIEVE THAT NO SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR
 WILL BE INSOLVENT, WILL HAVE UNREASONABLY SMALL CAPITAL FOR THE BUSINESS
 IN
 WHICH IT IS ENGAGED OR WILL HAVE INCURRED DEBTS BEYOND ITS ABILITY TO PAY
 SUCH
 DEBTS AS THEY MATURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, AS TO WHAT STANDARD
 A
 COURT WOULD APPLY IN MAKING SUCH DETERMINATIONS OR THAT A COURT WOULD AGREE
 WITH
 OUR OR THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS CONCLUSIONS IN THIS REGARD. 

AN
 ACTIVE TRADING MARKET MAY NOT DEVELOP FOR THE EXCHANGE
 NOTES. 

THE
 SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES HAVE NO ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET AND ARE NOT
 BEING
 LISTED ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE. THE LIQUIDITY OF ANY MARKET FOR THE NOTES
 DEPENDS UPON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING: 

THE
 NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF THE NOTES; 

THE
 OVERALL MARKET FOR HIGH YIELD
 SECURITIES; 

OUR
 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR PROSPECTS;
 AND 

THE
 PROSPECTS FOR COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY
 GENERALLY. 

ACCORDINGLY,
 WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU OF A MARKET OR LIQUIDITY FOR THE NOTES. HISTORICALLY,
 THE
 MARKET FOR NON-INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS THAT
 HAVE
 CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF
 SECURITIES SIMILAR TO THE NOTES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE MARKET FOR
 THE
 NOTES, IF ANY, WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS. ANY SUCH DISRUPTIONS
 MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT YOU AS A HOLDER OF THE NOTES.

ITEM 1A. "RISK FACTORS THE BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY AND

ALIEN OWNERSHIP. IN GENERAL, THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT PROHIBITS FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES FROM OWNING MORE THAN 20 OF
THE VOTING POWER OR EQUITY OF THE COMPANY. 

ANALOG TO DIGITAL TRANSITION. AS OF JUNE 12, 2009, ALL FULL-POWER BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS WERE REQUIRED TO CEASE
BROADCASTING ANALOG PROGRAMMING AND CONVERT TO ALL DIGITAL BROADCASTS. DIGITAL BROADCASTING PERMITS STATIONS TO OFFER DIGITAL CHANNELS FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES SUCH AS HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO
PROGRAMMING, MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF STANDARD DEFINITION VIDEO PROGRAMMING, AUDIO, DATA, AND OTHER TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS, SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT EACH BROADCASTER PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE FREE
OVER-THE-AIR VIDEO PROGRAM SIGNAL AT LEAST COMPARABLE IN RESOLUTION TO THE STATION'S FORMER ANALOG PROGRAMMING TRANSMISSIONS. 

 CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF TELEVISION BROADCAST STATIONS. THE 1992 CABLE ACT AND IMPLEMENTING FCC
REGULATIONS GOVERN THE RETRANSMISSION OF COMMERCIAL TELEVISION STATIONS BY CABLE TELEVISION OPERATORS. EVERY THREE YEARS, EACH STATION MUST ELECT, WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS WITHIN ITS DMA, EITHER
"MUST CARRY" STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE SYSTEM'S CARRIAGE OF THE STATION IS MANDATORY, OR "RETRANSMISSION CONSENT," PURSUANT TO WHICH THE STATION GIVES UP ITS RIGHT TO MANDATORY CARRIAGE AND
SECURES INSTEAD THE RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE CONSIDERATION IN RETURN FOR CONSENTING TO CARRIAGE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED THE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT OPTION IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CASES FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING
JANUARY 1, 2009, AND, SINCE 2006, HAS IMPLEMENTED A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS OF SEEKING MONETARY CONSIDERATION FOR ITS RETRANSMISSION CONSENT. 

 SIMILARLY,
FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES GOVERN THE RETRANSMISSION OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS BY DBS OPERATORS. DBS OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL
TELEVISION BROADCAST STATIONS REQUESTING CARRIAGE IN LOCAL MARKETS IN WHICH THE DBS OPERATOR CARRIES AT LEAST ONE SIGNAL PURSUANT TO THE STATUTORY LOCAL-TO-LOCAL COMPULSORY
COPYRIGHT LICENSE. EVERY THREE YEARS, EACH TELEVISION STATION IN SUCH MARKETS MUST ELECT "MUST CARRY" OR "RETRANSMISSION CONSENT" STATUS, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO
CABLE SYSTEMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OWNED AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS ARE BEING TRANSMITTED INTO THEIR LOCAL MARKETS BY THE TWO MAJOR DBS OPERATORS PURSUANT TO RETRANSMISSION
CONSENT AGREEMENTS. 

 SINCE
THE BROADCAST TELEVISION TRANSITION FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL IN JUNE 2009, CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED FOR A THREE-YEAR PERIOD TO CARRY MUST-CARRY
SIGNALS IN AN ANALOG FORMAT OR IN THE CASE OF ALL-DIGITAL CABLE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT TO CONVERT MUST-CARRY DIGITAL SIGNALS FOR VIEWING ON ANALOG TELEVISION SETS. CABLE
TELEVISION SYSTEMS, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO CARRY SUCH STATIONS' HIGH DEFINITION SIGNALS. DBS OPERATORS ARE ALSO REQUIRED, OVER A FOUR-YEAR PHASE-IN PERIOD,
TO CARRY THE HIGH DEFINITION SIGNALS OF MUST-CARRY STATIONS. NEITHER CABLE SYSTEMS NOR DBS OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY MORE THAN A STATION'S PRIMARY VIDEO PROGRAMMING CHANNEL. THE
COMPANY HAS AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF MULTIPLE SYSTEM OPERATORS THAT REQUIRE CARRIAGE OF THE ANALOG, DIGITAL AND HIGH-DEFINITION SIGNALS OF THE COMPANY-OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS BEFORE
AND AFTER THE TRANSITION (INCLUDING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DIGITAL PROGRAMMING). 

 CHILDREN'S TELEVISION PROGRAMMING. FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES LIMIT THE AMOUNT AND CONTENT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE
SHOWN ON
TELEVISION STATIONS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 

 I-20 

12 YEARS
OF AGE AND YOUNGER, AND REQUIRE STATIONS TO BROADCAST ON THEIR MAIN PROGRAM STREAM THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL PROGRAMMING ("E/I PROGRAMMING") DESIGNED FOR
CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO IMPOSE E/I PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS ON EACH ADDITIONAL DIGITAL MULTICAST PROGRAM STREAM TRANSMITTED BY TELEVISION STATIONS, WITH THE
REQUIREMENT INCREASING IN PROPORTION TO THE ADDITIONAL HOURS OF FREE PROGRAMMING OFFERED ON MULTICAST CHANNELS. THESE RULES ALSO LIMIT THE DISPLAY DURING CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING OF INTERNET ADDRESSES
OF WEB SITES THAT CONTAIN OR LINK TO COMMERCIAL MATERIAL OR THAT USE PROGRAM CHARACTERS TO SELL PRODUCTS. 

PROGRAM ACCESS. UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CABLE PROGRAMMERS (MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW) ARE GENERALLY
PROHIBITED FROM
OFFERING DIFFERENT PRICES, TERMS OR CONDITIONS TO COMPETING MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS UNLESS THE DIFFERENTIAL IS JUSTIFIED BY CERTAIN PERMISSIBLE FACTORS SET FORTH IN THE FCC'S
REGULATIONS. THE FCC'S "PROGRAM ACCESS" RULES ALSO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CABLE PROGRAMMER TO ENTER INTO EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH CABLE OPERATORS. A CABLE
PROGRAMMER IS CONSIDERED TO BE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UNDER THE FCC'S PROGRAM ACCESS ATTRIBUTION RULES IF IT OWNS OR IS OWNED BY A CABLE OPERATOR IN WHOLE OR IN PART. CABLE OPERATORS FOR THIS PURPOSE
MAY INCLUDE TELEPHONE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE VIDEO PROGRAMMING DIRECTLY TO SUBSCRIBERS. 

THE
COMPANY'S WHOLLY OWNED PROGRAM SERVICES ARE NOT CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM ACCESS RULES. THE COMPANY'S FLEXIBILITY TO NEGOTIATE THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS AVAILABLE FOR CARRIAGE
OF THESE SERVICES AND ITS ABILITY TO OFFER CABLE OPERATORS EXCLUSIVE PROGRAMMING COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM ACCESS RULES. BECAUSE OF NAI'S INTEREST IN BOTH
THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC., VIACOM INC.'S BUSINESSES COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCC'S PROGRAM ACCESS RULES. (SEE ITEM 1A. "RISK
FACTORS THE BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER COMPANY FOR CERTAIN REGULATORY PURPOSES"). 

DIGITAL RADIO. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, THE FCC HAS BEEN DEVELOPING RULES THAT WOULD PERMIT EXISTING AM AND FM RADIO BROADCAST STATIONS TO
BROADCAST
DIGITALLY IN ORDER BOTH TO IMPROVE SOUND QUALITY AND TO PROVIDE SPECTRUM FOR ENHANCED DATA SERVICES TO COMPLEMENT THE EXISTING PROGRAMMING SERVICE AND PROVIDE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR RADIO
BROADCASTERS, INCLUDING MULTICASTING OPPORTUNITIES. THE FCC HAS AUTHORIZED AM AND FM RADIO STATIONS TO BROADCAST DIGITAL SIGNALS USING EXCESS SPECTRUM WITHIN THE SAME ALLOTTED BANDWIDTH USED FOR
ANALOG TRANSMISSIONS. AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2010, 105 OF THE COMPANY'S RADIO STATIONS HAD COMMENCED DIGITAL BROADCASTS. THE FCC RECENTLY INCREASED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE POWER FOR DIGITAL
BROADCASTS, WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS AND GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE OF DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS. 

OUTDOOR 

THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS IN THE U.S. AND
TO NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL RESTRICTIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THESE REGULATIONS CAN AFFECT THE OPERATION OF ADVERTISING DISPLAYS AND INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR, UPGRADING,
HEIGHT, SIZE AND LOCATION OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CONTENT OF ADVERTISING COPY THAT CAN BE DISPLAYED ON THESE STRUCTURES. IN ADDITION, OUTDOOR ADVERTISING IS THE
SUBJECT OF TARGETED STATE AND MUNICIPAL TAXES AND FEES. THESE LAWS MAY AFFECT COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS MARKETS IN VARIOUS WAYS. SUCH LAWS MAY REDUCE THE COMPANY'S EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES, OR
MAY INCREASE OR REDUCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE
FROM OTHERS. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF WILL NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTDOOR BUSINESS. 

 UNDER
U.S. LAW, PRINCIPALLY THE HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION ACT OF 1965 (THE "HBA"), OUTDOOR ADVERTISING IS CONTROLLED ON PRIMARY AND INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS BUILT WITH FEDERAL FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE. AS A CONDITION TO FEDERAL HIGHWAY ASSISTANCE, THE HBA REQUIRES STATES TO RESTRICT BILLBOARDS ON SUCH HIGHWAYS TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS, AND IMPOSES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL SIZE,
SPACING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION AND OPERATION OF BILLBOARDS. OUTDOOR IS NOT AWARE OF ANY STATES WHICH HAVE PASSED LAWS AND ADOPTED REGULATIONS WHICH ARE LESS
RESTRICTIVE THAN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE BILLBOARD OWNER TO REMOVE, AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE AND WITHOUT COMPENSATION, ANY 

 I-21 

NON-GRANDFATHERED
SIGNS ON SUCH HIGHWAYS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. OUTDOOR DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF ITS BILLBOARDS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO REMOVAL UNDER THESE
REGULATIONS IS MATERIAL. NO STATE IN WHICH OUTDOOR OPERATES HAS BANNED BILLBOARDS, BUT SOME HAVE ADOPTED STANDARDS MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. MUNICIPAL AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS
GENERALLY ALSO HAVE SIGN CONTROLS AS PART OF THEIR ZONING LAWS AND BUILDING CODES. SOME STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROHIBIT CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BILLBOARDS AND SOME ALLOW NEW CONSTRUCTION ONLY TO
REPLACE EXISTING STRUCTURES, ALTHOUGH MOST ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF BILLBOARDS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON ZONING, SIZE, SPACING, HEIGHT AND TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION. IN SOME CASES, THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW
BILLBOARDS OR THE RELOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF EXISTING BILLBOARDS IS PROHIBITED. A NUMBER OF CITIES INCLUDING NEW YORK CITY, LOS ANGELES, PHILADELPHIA AND MIAMI HAVE IMPLEMENTED OR INITIATED
LEGISLATIVE BILLBOARD CONTROLS, INCLUDING IMPOSING TAXES, FEES AND/OR REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO DECREASE OR RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF OUTDOOR SIGNS AND/OR TO RAISE REVENUE. THE COMPANY
CONTESTS SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IT BELIEVES UNLAWFULLY RESTRICT ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE GROWTH OF ITS OUTDOOR ADVERTISING BUSINESS. 

 U.S.
LAW NEITHER REQUIRES NOR PROHIBITS REMOVAL OF EXISTING LAWFUL BILLBOARDS, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION IF A STATE OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISION COMPELS THE REMOVAL OF A
LAWFUL BILLBOARD ALONG A PRIMARY OR INTERSTATE HIGHWAY THAT WAS BUILT WITH FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURCHASED AND REMOVED LEGAL BILLBOARDS FOR BEAUTIFICATION OBJECTIVES IN
THE PAST USING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. STATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES FROM TIME TO TIME USE THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN TO REMOVE
BILLBOARDS. THUS FAR, OUTDOOR HAS BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN SATISFACTORY COMPENSATION FOR ITS BILLBOARDS PURCHASED OR REMOVED AS A RESULT OF THIS TYPE OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ASSURANCE
THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT GENERALLY PURCHASE BILLBOARDS FOR BEAUTIFICATION, BUT SOME HAVE ATTEMPTED TO FORCE REMOVAL OF LEGAL BUT NONCONFORMING
BILLBOARDS (BILLBOARDS WHICH CONFORMED WITH APPLICABLE ZONING REGULATIONS WHEN BUILT BUT WHICH DO NOT CONFORM TO CURRENT ZONING REGULATIONS) AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS UNDER A CONCEPT CALLED
AMORTIZATION. UNDER THIS CONCEPT THE GOVERNMENTAL BODY ASSERTS THAT JUST COMPENSATION IS EARNED BY CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE BILLBOARD OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME QUESTION AS TO THE LEGALITY OF
AMORTIZATION UNDER FEDERAL AND MANY STATE LAWS, AMORTIZATION HAS BEEN UPHELD IN SOME INSTANCES. OUTDOOR GENERALLY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES FOR BILLBOARDS
REQUIRED TO BE REMOVED. RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS ALSO LIMIT OUTDOOR'S ABILITY TO REBUILD OR REPLACE NONCONFORMING BILLBOARDS. 

 AS
THE OWNER OR OPERATOR OF VARIOUS REAL PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES IN OUTDOOR ADVERTISING OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, SAFETY AND LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY AND ITS PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE USE, STORAGE, DISPOSAL, EMISSION AND RELEASE OF
HAZARDOUS AND NON-HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY, AS WELL AS ZONING AND OTHER LAND USE RESTRICTIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE HOURS OF OPERATION AND
ILLUMINATION AS WELL AS METHODS AND CONDITIONS OF MAINTENANCE OF FACILITIES AND ADVERTISING INSTALLATION. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS.
HOWEVER, FUTURE LAWS OR A FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF OR LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING LAWS COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES AND OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO USE OR
OPERATE SOME OF ITS DISPLAYS. 

 OUT-OF-COURT
SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN THE MAJOR U.S. TOBACCO COMPANIES, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND ALL 50 STATES INCLUDE A BAN ON THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO
PRODUCTS. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO INITIATE PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO LIMIT OUTDOOR ADVERTISING OF ALCOHOL. OTHER PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TYPES OF DISPLAYS MAY BE TARGETED IN THE FUTURE.
LEGISLATION REGULATING ALCOHOL-RELATED ADVERTISING DUE TO CONTENT-RELATED RESTRICTIONS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN OUTDOOR'S DIRECT REVENUE FROM SUCH ADVERTISEMENTS AND A SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE IN THE
AVAILABLE SPACE ON THE EXISTING INVENTORY OF BILLBOARDS IN THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY. 

 I-22 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

 THE COMPANY CREATES, OWNS, DISTRIBUTES AND EXPLOITS UNDER LICENSES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WORLDWIDE. IT IS THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE TO
PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ITS TELEVISION, RADIO AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTS, CHARACTERS, PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER ORIGINAL AND ACQUIRED WORKS AND AUDIOVISUAL WORKS MADE FOR DIGITAL EXPLOITATION.
THE FOLLOWING LOGOS, TRADE NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND RELATED TRADEMARK FAMILIES ARE AMONG THOSE STRONGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE PRODUCT LINES THEY REPRESENT AND ARE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OF THE COMPANY: CBS , CBS ENTERTAINMENT ,

ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AGAINST INFRINGEMENTS.

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," AND
THE DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, CONTAIN BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALL STATEMENTS OTHER THAN STATEMENTS OF
HISTORICAL FACT ARE, OR MAY BE DEEMED TO BE, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS, BUT RATHER REFLECT THE COMPANY'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING FUTURE RESULTS AND EVENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
GENERALLY CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF STATEMENTS THAT INCLUDE PHRASES SUCH AS "BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "INTEND," "PLAN," "FORESEE," "LIKELY," "WILL" OR OTHER SIMILAR WORDS OR PHRASES.
SIMILARLY, STATEMENTS THAT DESCRIBE THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES, PLANS OR GOALS ARE OR MAY BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES
AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE STATEMENTS. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS IS SET FORTH BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS MAY BE DESCRIBED IN
THE COMPANY'S NEWS RELEASES AND OTHER FILINGS MADE 

 I-23 

UNDER
THE SECURITIES LAWS. THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND FACTORS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY VIEW AS MATERIAL OR THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN. THE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS DOCUMENT ARE ONLY MADE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS DOCUMENT AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

 RISK FACTORS 

 FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE
FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. THERE MAY BE OTHER CURRENTLY UNKNOWN OR UNPREDICTABLE ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, COMPETITIVE, REGULATORY OR OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE
RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION" AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" OF THIS FORM 10-K. 

 A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD OR IN SPECIFIC MARKETS 

 THE COMPANY DERIVES SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF ADVERTISING ON ITS BROADCAST AND BASIC CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION STATIONS,
RADIO STATIONS, OUTDOOR MEDIA AND SYNDICATED PROGRAMMING. A DECLINE IN THE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS OF ADVERTISERS, THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR THE ECONOMY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL GEOGRAPHIC MARKET, PARTICULARLY A
MAJOR MARKET SUCH AS LOS ANGELES, NEW YORK OR CHICAGO, IN WHICH THE COMPANY OWNS AND OPERATES SIZEABLE BUSINESSES, COULD ALTER CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE ADVERTISERS' SPENDING PRIORITIES. DISASTERS, ACTS
OF TERRORISM, POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY OR HOSTILITIES COULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF UNINTERRUPTED NEWS COVERAGE AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES
MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY INCREASING COMPETITION FOR THE LEISURE TIME OF AUDIENCES. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES BY COMPANIES IN CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING THE AUTOMOTIVE,
FINANCIAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENTS, REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S ADVERTISING REVENUES. ANY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THESE
SECTORS' ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REVENUE. ADVERTISERS' WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE ADVERTISING FROM THE COMPANY MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN AUDIENCE RATINGS
FOR THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMMING, THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RETAIN THE RIGHTS TO POPULAR PROGRAMMING, INCREASING AUDIENCE FRAGMENTATION CAUSED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW MEDIA FORMATS, INCLUDING
CABLE NETWORKS, THE INTERNET AND VIDEO-ON-DEMAND AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF PORTABLE DIGITAL DEVICES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ALLOW CONSUMERS TO TIME SHIFT PROGRAMMING, MAKE AND
STORE DIGITAL COPIES AND SKIP OR FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES FROM OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ALSO DEPEND ON THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO
USE EFFECTIVE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SPACE. ANY REDUCTION IN ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON AUDIENCE ACCEPTANCE OF ITS CONTENT, PARTICULARLY ITS TELEVISION AND RADIO PROGRAMS AND MOTION PICTURES, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT 

 TELEVISION, RADIO AND MOTION PICTURE CONTENT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION ARE INHERENTLY RISKY BUSINESSES BECAUSE THE REVENUES DERIVED
FROM THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF A TELEVISION OR RADIO PROGRAM OR MOTION PICTURE, AND THE LICENSING OF RIGHTS TO THE ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THEIR ACCEPTANCE BY
THE PUBLIC, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF A TELEVISION OR RADIO PROGRAM OR MOTION PICTURE ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE QUALITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF OTHER COMPETING PROGRAMS AND MOTION
PICTURES RELEASED INTO THE MARKETPLACE AT OR NEAR THE SAME TIME, THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

 I-24 

AND
OTHER TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE FACTORS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. RATING POINTS ARE ALSO FACTORS THAT ARE WEIGHED WHEN DETERMINING THE ADVERTISING RATES THAT THE COMPANY RECEIVES. THE
USE OF NEW RATINGS TECHNOLOGIES AND MEASUREMENTS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S PROGRAM RATINGS.
POOR RATINGS CAN LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN PRICING AND ADVERTISING SPENDING. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY REPLACEMENT PROGRAMMING ON THE COMPANY'S RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS WILL
GENERATE THE SAME LEVEL OF REVENUES OR PROFITABILITY OF PREVIOUS PROGRAMMING. IN ADDITION, THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CABLE NETWORKS AND SIMON SCHUSTER IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON AUDIENCE
ACCEPTANCE OF ITS PROGRAMMING AND PUBLICATIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE THEATRICAL SUCCESS OF A MOTION PICTURE, BASED IN LARGE PART UPON AUDIENCE ACCEPTANCE, IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE
REVENUES IT IS LIKELY TO GENERATE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES, LICENSING FEES AND OTHER EXPLOITATION DURING THE VARIOUS OTHER DISTRIBUTION WINDOWS. CONSEQUENTLY, LOW PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPANY'S
CONTENT, PARTICULARLY ITS TELEVISION AND RADIO PROGRAMS AND MOTION PICTURES, WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 FAILURE BY THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN, CREATE AND RETAIN THE RIGHTS IN POPULAR PROGRAMMING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REVENUES 

OPERATING RESULTS FROM THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING MOTION PICTURES) BUSINESSES FLUCTUATE PRIMARILY WITH THE ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
PROGRAMMING BY THE PUBLIC, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S REVENUE FROM ITS TELEVISION, RADIO AND MOTION PICTURE BUSINESS IS THEREFORE PARTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED
ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER TASTES AND BEHAVIOR ON A TIMELY BASIS. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY DERIVES A PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF ITS EXTENSIVE LIBRARY OF
TELEVISION PROGRAMMING. GENERALLY, A TELEVISION SERIES MUST HAVE A NETWORK RUN OF AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY SOLD IN DOMESTIC SYNDICATION. IF THE CONTENT OF ITS TELEVISION
PROGRAMMING LIBRARY CEASES TO BE WIDELY ACCEPTED BY AUDIENCES OR IS NOT CONTINUOUSLY REPLENISHED WITH POPULAR CONTENT, THE COMPANY'S REVENUES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY OBTAINS A
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS POPULAR PROGRAMMING FROM THIRD PARTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF CBS TELEVISION NETWORK'S MOST WIDELY VIEWED BROADCASTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS, GOLF'S MASTERS
TOURNAMENT AND PGA CHAMPIONSHIP, AND NFL GAMES, ARE MADE AVAILABLE BASED UPON PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OF VARYING DURATION THAT THE COMPANY HAS NEGOTIATED WITH THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, SHOWTIME NETWORKS
ENTERS INTO COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE RIGHTS TO CERTAIN PROGRAMMING FOR SHOWTIME , THE MOVIE CHANNEL AND FLIX 
FROM MOTION PICTURE PRODUCERS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS FOR VARYING DURATIONS, AND CBS RADIO ACQUIRES THE BROADCAST RIGHTS TO SYNDICATED SHOWS AND TO
VARIOUS PROGRAMS, SUCH AS SPORTS EVENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES. CBS FILMS COMPETES FOR COMPELLING SOURCE MATERIAL FOR AND THE TALENT NECESSARY TO PRODUCE MOTION PICTURES. COMPETITION FOR POPULAR
PROGRAMMING THAT IS LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES IS INTENSE, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE OUTBID BY ITS COMPETITORS FOR THE RIGHTS TO NEW, POPULAR PROGRAMMING OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE RENEWAL OF POPULAR
PROGRAMMING CURRENTLY LICENSED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR RETAIN RIGHTS TO POPULAR CONTENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REVENUES. 

 ANY DECREASE IN POPULARITY OF THE PROGRAMMING FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS PROFITABILITY 

 PROGRAMMING AND TALENT COMMITMENTS OF THE COMPANY, ESTIMATED TO AGGREGATE APPROXIMATELY 10.28 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2009, PRIMARILY INCLUDED 6.63 BILLION FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, 2.74 BILLION RELATING TO TELEVISION, RADIO AND FILM PRODUCTION AND LICENSING AND 906.3 MILLION FOR TALENT
CONTRACTS, WITH 706.6 MILLION OF THESE AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN AND AFTER 2015. A SHORTFALL, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, IN THE EXPECTED POPULARITY OF THE SPORTS EVENTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED
RIGHTS, OR IN THE TELEVISION AND RADIO PROGRAMMING THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO AIR, COULD LEAD TO DECREASED PROFITABILITY OR LOSSES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. 

 I-25 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND CUSTOMERS 

 THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE EXPERIENCED SLOWDOWNS AND VOLATILITIES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THIS DOWNTURN
COULD LEAD TO LOWER CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY IF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADVERTISERS, SUBSCRIBERS, LICENSEES, RETAILERS, THEATER OPERATORS AND
OTHER CONSUMERS OF THE COMPANY'S CONTENT OFFERINGS AND SERVICES, REDUCE DEMANDS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, IN UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY
HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING CAPITAL AT ADEQUATE OR HISTORICAL LEVELS TO FINANCE THEIR ONGOING BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS AND MAY FACE INSOLVENCY, ALL OF WHICH COULD IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY
PAYMENTS AND CONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF WEAKENED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND SUCH CONDITIONS AND RESULTANT EFFECTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE
COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

 VOLATILITY AND WEAKNESS IN CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND RELATED FINANCING COSTS FOR THE COMPANY 

 BANK AND CAPITAL MARKETS CAN EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION. IF THE DISRUPTION IN THESE MARKETS IS PROLONGED, THE
COMPANY'S ABILITY TO REFINANCE, AND THE RELATED COST OF REFINANCING, SOME OR ALL OF ITS DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CAN CURRENTLY ACCESS THE BANK AND CAPITAL MARKETS, THERE
IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FINANCING FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ACCESS TO AND COST OF BORROWING CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S SHORT-
AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY RATINGS
AGENCIES. THESE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MARKETS, OR A DECREASE IN THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN COST-EFFECTIVE
FINANCING. 

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS 

 THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS HAS EXPERIENCED AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SEASONALITY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SEASONAL
ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND SEASONAL INFLUENCES ON PEOPLE'S VIEWING, READING, ATTENDANCE AND LISTENING HABITS. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING INCREASES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER,
SIMON SCHUSTER GENERATES A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS REVENUES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND CBS FILMS' REVENUE FROM MOTION PICTURES IS DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING, MIX, NUMBER AND AVAILABILITY OF
ITS PICTURES AND WILL GENERALLY EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN THE SUMMER AROUND HOLIDAYS AND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING REVENUES IN EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS BENEFIT FROM
ADVERTISING PLACED BY CANDIDATES FOR POLITICAL OFFICES. THE EFFECTS OF SUCH SEASONALITY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS RESULTS OF ANY SPECIFIC QUARTER AND
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS. 

 THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES 

 THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH OTHER MEDIA COMPANIES FOR HIGH QUALITY CONTENT AND ATTRACTIVE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SPACE TO ACHIEVE LARGE
AUDIENCES AND TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUE. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES FOR DISTRIBUTION ON VARIOUS CABLE, DBS AND OTHER PLATFORMS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES AND ADVERTISERS AND
OBTAIN FAVORABLE DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE POPULAR TELEVISION, SYNDICATED PROGRAMMING AND RADIO PROGRAMMING, MOTION PICTURES AND BOOKS, AS WELL AS WELL-PLACED
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING FACES. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION OF ADVERTISING AGENCIES, DISTRIBUTORS AND TELEVISION SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS MADE COMPETITION FOR AUDIENCES, ADVERTISING REVENUE, AND
DISTRIBUTION MORE INTENSE. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATION AMONG BOOK RETAILERS AND THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE SALES HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITION FOR LIMITED PHYSICAL SHELF SPACE FOR THE
COMPANY'S PUBLICATIONS AND FOR THE ATTENTION OF CONSUMERS ON-LINE. COMPETITION FOR AUDIENCES AND ADVERTISING COMES FROM: BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS AND NETWORKS; CABLE TELEVISION
SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS; MOTION PICTURE STUDIOS; THE INTERNET; TERRESTRIAL AND SATELLITE RADIO AND PORTABLE DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYERS; OUTDOOR ADVERTISERS; LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS; DIRECT
MAIL; AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND ADVERTISING MEDIA THAT OPERATE IN THESE MARKETS. OTHER TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS OR CABLE NETWORKS MAY CHANGE THEIR FORMATS 

 I-26 

OR
PROGRAMMING, A NEW STATION OR NEW NETWORK MAY ADOPT A FORMAT TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPANY'S STATIONS OR NETWORKS, OR STATIONS OR NETWORKS MIGHT ENGAGE IN AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS.
IN BOOK PUBLISHING, PRICE COMPETITION AMONG ELECTRONIC AND PRINT BOOK RETAILERS COULD DECREASE THE PRICES FOR NEW RELEASES AND THE OUTLETS AVAILABLE FOR BOOK SALES. THIS COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN
LOWER RATINGS AND ADVERTISING AND SUBSCRIPTION AND OTHER REVENUES OR INCREASED PROMOTIONAL
AND OTHER EXPENSES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, LOWER EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE AGAINST EXISTING OR
POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, OR THAT COMPETITION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 THE COMPANY MUST RESPOND TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, CONTENT CREATION, SERVICES AND STANDARDS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE 

 VIDEO, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, RADIO AND DATA SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY AS ARE THE
DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION MODELS FOR BOOKS. ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGIES OR ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PRODUCT DELIVERY OR STORAGE, OR CERTAIN CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR DRIVEN BY THESE OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND
METHODS OF DELIVERY AND STORAGE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES. EXAMPLES OF THE FOREGOING INCLUDE VIDEO-ON-DEMAND, SATELLITE RADIO, NEW VIDEO AND
ELECTRONIC BOOK FORMATS, USER-GENERATED CONTENT SITES, THE CONVERGENCE OF TELEVISION BROADCASTS AND ONLINE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMMING TO TELEVISIONS, INTERNET AND MOBILE DISTRIBUTION OF VIDEO
CONTENT, STREAMING AND DOWNLOADING FROM THE INTERNET AND DIGITAL OUTDOOR DISPLAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEVICES THAT ALLOW USERS TO VIEW OR LISTEN TO TELEVISION OR RADIO PROGRAMS ON A TIME-DELAYED
BASIS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE USERS TO FAST-FORWARD OR SKIP ADVERTISEMENTS, SUCH AS DVRS AND PORTABLE DIGITAL DEVICES AND SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE USERS TO STORE PROGRAMMING, MAY CAUSE
CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THAT COULD AFFECT THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S OFFERINGS TO ADVERTISERS AND COULD THEREFORE ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REVENUES. ALSO, THE GROWING USES OF NEW,
USER-GENERATED CONTENT SITES, INCLUDING THOSE EMANATING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, FURTHER INCREASES IN THE USE
OF DIGITAL DEVICES WHICH ALLOW USERS TO VIEW OR LISTEN TO CONTENT OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING, IN THEIR OWN TIME, WHILE AVOIDING TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S
RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING ADVERTISING AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES. CABLE PROVIDERS AND DBS OPERATORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW THEM TO TRANSMIT MORE CHANNELS ON THEIR EXISTING
EQUIPMENT TO HIGHLY TARGETED AUDIENCES, REDUCING THE COST OF CREATING CHANNELS AND POTENTIALLY LEADING TO THE DIVISION OF THE TELEVISION MARKETPLACE INTO MORE SPECIALIZED NICHE AUDIENCES. MORE
TELEVISION OPTIONS INCREASE COMPETITION FOR VIEWERS AND COMPETITORS TARGETING PROGRAMMING TO NARROWLY DEFINED AUDIENCES MAY GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE COMPANY FOR TELEVISION ADVERTISING AND
SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES. IN PUBLISHING, THE GROWING EBOOK MARKET THREATENS TO IMPOSE PRESSURE ON THE PRICE CONSUMERS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR NEW RELEASES, DISPROPORTIONATE TO ANY COST SAVINGS PRESENTED
BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. GENERALLY, CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION METHODS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY REDUCING VIEWERSHIP OF ITS PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING MOTION
PICTURES), THE DEMAND FOR DVD PRODUCT AND/OR THE DESIRE TO SEE MOTION PICTURES IN THEATERS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. THE ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE
AND ADAPT TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY ON A TIMELY BASIS AND EXPLOIT NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM THESE CHANGES WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND INCREASE ITS REVENUE. 

 INCREASED PROGRAMMING AND CONTENT COSTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S PROFITS 

 THE COMPANY PRODUCES AND ACQUIRES PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING MOTION PICTURES) AND CONTENT AND INCURS COSTS FOR ALL TYPES OF CREATIVE
TALENT, INCLUDING ACTORS, AUTHORS, WRITERS AND PRODUCERS AS WELL AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. AN INCREASE IN ANY OF THESE COSTS MAY LEAD TO DECREASED PROFITABILITY. 

 I-27 

PIRACY OF THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMMING AND OTHER CONTENT, INCLUDING DIGITAL AND INTERNET PIRACY, MAY DECREASE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF THE COMPANY'S
PROGRAMMING AND OTHER CONTENT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES AND PROFITABILITY 

 PIRACY OF PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING MOTION PICTURES) IS PREVALENT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD AND IS MADE EASIER BY THE AVAILABILITY OF
DIGITAL COPIES OF CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES ALLOWING CONVERSION OF SUCH PROGRAMMING AND OTHER CONTENT INTO DIGITAL FORMATS, WHICH FACILITATES THE CREATION, TRANSMISSION AND SHARING OF HIGH
QUALITY UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE COMPANY'S CONTENT. THE PROLIFERATION OF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES AND PIRACY OF THESE PRODUCTS HAS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND PROFITABILITY BECAUSE
THESE PRODUCTS REDUCE THE REVENUE THAT THE COMPANY POTENTIALLY COULD RECEIVE FROM THE LEGITIMATE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, IF PIRACY WERE TO INCREASE, IT WOULD
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND PROFITABILITY. 

 CHANGES IN U.S. COMMUNICATIONS LAWS OR OTHER REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS 

 THE TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING AND DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRIES IN THE U.S. ARE HIGHLY REGULATED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS
ISSUED AND ADMINISTERED BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE FCC. THE TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FCC UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM THE FCC TO OPERATE ITS RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS. THE COMPANY CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT THE FCC WILL APPROVE ITS FUTURE RENEWAL APPLICATIONS
OR THAT THE RENEWALS WILL BE FOR FULL TERMS OR WILL NOT INCLUDE CONDITIONS OR QUALIFICATIONS. THE NON-RENEWAL, OR RENEWAL WITH SUBSTANTIAL CONDITIONS OR MODIFICATIONS, OF ONE OR MORE OF
THE COMPANY'S LICENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUES. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH EXTENSIVE FCC REGULATIONS AND POLICIES IN THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF ITS
TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS AND ITS TELEVISION NETWORKS. FCC REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE OWNERSHIP OF MORE THAN ONE OF THE TOP FOUR NETWORKS, ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC, AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION
AND RADIO STATIONS THAT A LICENSEE CAN OWN IN A MARKET AND THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS THAT CAN BE OWNED NATIONWIDE, WHICH COULD RESTRICT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE FUTURE TRANSACTIONS
AND IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD REQUIRE IT TO DIVEST SOME TELEVISION OR RADIO STATIONS. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FCC CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER CONSIDERATION, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ADOPT, NEW LAWS,
REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES REGARDING A WIDE VARIETY OF MATTERS THAT COULD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AFFECT THE OPERATION AND OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY'S RADIO AND TELEVISION PROPERTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, FROM
TIME TO TIME, PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN ADVANCED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS AND AT THE FCC TO REQUIRE RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST STATIONS TO PROVIDE ADVERTISING TIME TO POLITICAL CANDIDATES FOR FREE OR AT A
REDUCED CHARGE. ANY RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE FCC HAS INITIATED A PROCEEDING TO EXAMINE AND POTENTIALLY REGULATE MORE CLOSELY
EMBEDDED ADVERTISING SUCH AS PRODUCT PLACEMENT AND PRODUCT INTEGRATION. ENHANCED RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING THESE MEANS OF DELIVERING ADVERTISING MESSAGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ADVERTISING
REVENUES. CHANGES TO THE MEDIA OWNERSHIP AND OTHER FCC RULES MAY AFFECT THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN WAYS THAT COULD INCREASE THE COMPETITION FACED BY THE COMPANY. PROPOSALS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADVANCED
FROM TIME TO TIME BEFORE THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FCC TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM ACCESS RULES (CURRENTLY APPLICABLE ONLY TO THOSE CABLE PROGRAM SERVICES WHICH ALSO OWN OR ARE OWNED BY CABLE DISTRIBUTION
SYSTEMS) TO ALL CABLE PROGRAM SERVICES. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS AVAILABLE FOR ITS CONTENT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SHOULD SUCH AN EXTENSION BE ENACTED INTO LAW.
THERE IS LEGISLATION CURRENTLY PENDING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS WHICH COULD REMOVE OVER-THE-AIR BROADCASTERS' EXISTING EXEMPTION FROM PAYMENT OF A PERFORMANCE ROYALTY TO RECORD
COMPANIES AND PERFORMERS OF MUSIC WHICH IS BROADCAST ON RADIO STATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COST OF MUSIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN
INTERNATIONAL LAWS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE EFFECT THAT ANY SUCH LAWS, REGULATIONS OR POLICIES MAY HAVE ON ITS
OPERATIONS. 

 I-28 

VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OR ENHANCEMENT OF FCC INDECENCY AND OTHER PROGRAM CONTENT RULES AGAINST THE BROADCAST AND CABLE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S
BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 THE FCC'S RULES PROHIBIT THE BROADCAST OF OBSCENE MATERIAL AT ANY TIME AND INDECENT OR PROFANE MATERIAL ON TELEVISION OR RADIO
BROADCAST STATIONS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 6 A.M. AND 10 P.M. BROADCASTERS RISK VIOLATING THE PROHIBITION AGAINST BROADCASTING INDECENT MATERIAL BECAUSE OF THE VAGUENESS OF THE FCC'S
INDECENCY/PROFANITY DEFINITION, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. THE FCC VIGOROUSLY ENFORCES ITS INDECENCY RULES AGAINST THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY. THE FCC HAS STEPPED UP ITS
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AS THEY APPLY TO INDECENCY AND HAS THREATENED TO INITIATE LICENSE REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS AGAINST BROADCAST LICENSEES FOR "SERIOUS" INDECENCY VIOLATIONS. THE FCC HAS FOUND ON A
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THAT THE CONTENT OF RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTS HAS CONTAINED INDECENT MATERIAL. IN SUCH INSTANCES, THE FCC ISSUED FINES OR ADVISORY WARNINGS TO THE OFFENDING LICENSEES.
MOREOVER, THE FCC HAS IN SOME INSTANCES IMPOSED SEPARATE FINES FOR EACH ALLEGEDLY INDECENT "UTTERANCE," IN CONTRAST WITH ITS PREVIOUS POLICY, WHICH GENERALLY CONSIDERED ALL INDECENT WORDS OR PHRASES
WITHIN A GIVEN PROGRAM AS CONSTITUTING A SINGLE VIOLATION. THE FINES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT MATERIAL ARE A MAXIMUM OF 325,000 PER UTTERANCE. IF THE FCC DENIED A LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOKED THE
LICENSE FOR ONE OF THE COMPANY'S BROADCAST RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS, THE COMPANY WOULD LOSE ITS AUTHORITY TO OPERATE THE STATION. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER CONTENT IS INDECENT IS INHERENTLY
SUBJECTIVE AND, AS SUCH, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER PARTICULAR CONTENT COULD VIOLATE INDECENCY STANDARDS. THE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING WHETHER INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS, WORDS OR PHRASES MAY
VIOLATE THE FCC'S INDECENCY RULES ADDS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES. VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY RULES COULD LEAD TO SANCTIONS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT
THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SOME POLICYMAKERS SUPPORT THE EXTENSION OF THE INDECENCY RULES THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO OVER-THE-AIR BROADCASTERS TO COVER
CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING AND/OR ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT OF OR OTHERWISE EXPAND EXISTING LAWS AND RULES. IF SUCH AN EXTENSION, ATTEMPT TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER EXPANSION TOOK
PLACE AND WERE FOUND TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S CABLE CONTENT COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION AND VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. 

 THE LOSS OF AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS OR RETRANSMISSION AGREEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK PROVIDES ITS AFFILIATES WITH UP TO 98 HOURS OF PROGRAMMING PER WEEK. IN RETURN, THE CBS TELEVISION
NETWORK'S AFFILIATED STATIONS BROADCAST NETWORK-INSERTED COMMERCIALS DURING THAT PROGRAMMING. LOSS OF NETWORK AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS OF THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REDUCING THE REACH OF THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMMING AND THEREFORE ITS ATTRACTIVENESS TO ADVERTISERS, AND RENEWAL ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE NON-RENEWAL OR TERMINATION OF RETRANSMISSION AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE, DBS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OR CONTINUED DISTRIBUTION ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, COULD ALSO
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE ITS NETWORK PROGRAMMING TO A NATIONWIDE AUDIENCE AND AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SELL ADVERTISING, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SHOWTIME NETWORKS AND THE CBS COLLEGE SPORTS NETWORK ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE, DBS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS,
AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL BE RENEWED IN THE FUTURE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO SUCH PROGRAMMERS. THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS COULD REDUCE THE DISTRIBUTION
OF SHOWTIME NETWORKS' AND CBS COLLEGE SPORTS NETWORK'S PROGRAM SERVICES AND REDUCE REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIBER FEES AND ADVERTISING, AS APPLICABLE. FURTHER, THE LOSS OF FAVORABLE PACKAGING, POSITIONING,
PRICING OR OTHER MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES WITH ANY DISTRIBUTOR COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIBER FEES. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATION AMONG CABLE AND DBS DISTRIBUTORS AND INCREASED VERTICAL INTEGRATION
OF SUCH DISTRIBUTORS INTO THE CABLE OR BROADCAST NETWORK BUSINESS HAVE PROVIDED MORE LEVERAGE TO THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR OBTAIN DISTRIBUTION
FOR ITS NETWORK PROGRAMMING OR DISTRIBUTION 

 I-29 

AND/OR
MARKETING OF ITS SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM SERVICES ON FAVORABLE OR COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. 

 THE FAILURE OR DESTRUCTION OF SATELLITES AND TRANSMITTER FACILITIES THAT THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PROGRAMMING COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 THE COMPANY USES SATELLITE SYSTEMS TO TRANSMIT ITS BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS TO AFFILIATES. THE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES INCLUDE
UPLINKS, COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES AND DOWNLINKS. TRANSMISSIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED AS A RESULT OF LOCAL DISASTERS INCLUDING EXTREME WEATHER THAT IMPAIR ON-GROUND UPLINKS OR DOWNLINKS, OR AS
A RESULT OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A SATELLITE. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES AVAILABLE FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF PROGRAMMING. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO SECURE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER. FAILURE TO SECURE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S
BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, EACH OF THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS AND CABLE NETWORKS USES STUDIO AND TRANSMITTER FACILITIES
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. FAILURE TO RESTORE SUCH FACILITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 THE COMPANY COULD SUFFER LOSSES DUE TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FCC LICENSES AND PROGRAMMING 

 THE COMPANY WILL TEST GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING FCC LICENSES, FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER
OF EACH YEAR AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. A DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS,
INCLUDING FCC LICENSES, COULD RESULT IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. ALSO, ANY SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, IN THE EXPECTED POPULARITY OF THE PROGRAMMING FOR WHICH THE
COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED RIGHTS COULD LEAD TO A DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. ANY SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND/OR PROGRAMMING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REPORTED NET EARNINGS. 

 DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND RATES CANNOT BE GUARANTEED 

 THE OVERALL WEAKENED ECONOMY AND TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS MAY CAUSE COMPANIES TO RECALIBRATE THEIR BUSINESS PLANS WITH
A RENEWED FOCUS ON LIQUIDITY AND MAINTENANCE OF A STRONG BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ASSESSES RELEVANT FACTORS WHEN CONSIDERING THE DECLARATION OF A DIVIDEND ON THE COMPANY'S
COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING AT THE SAME OR SIMILAR RATES. 

 THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TALENT, COULD DISRUPT THE MANAGEMENT OR OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REVENUES 

 THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED EFFORTS, ABILITIES AND EXPERTISE OF ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER KEY
EMPLOYEES AND ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE POSSESSED BY ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE, AND THAT THE
LOSS OF ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY
EMPLOYS OR INDEPENDENTLY CONTRACTS WITH SEVERAL ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES AND AUTHORS WITH SIGNIFICANT LOYAL AUDIENCES. ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES ARE SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
RANKING OF A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION AND, THEREFORE, THE ABILITY OF THE STATION TO SELL ADVERTISING, AND AN AUTHOR'S POPULARITY CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESS OF A PARTICULAR
BOOK. CBS FILMS PRODUCES MOTION PICTURES WITH HIGHLY REGARDED DIRECTORS, ACTORS AND OTHER TALENT WHO ARE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING AUDIENCE ENDORSEMENT OF ITS MOTION PICTURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE
THAT THESE ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES, AUTHORS AND TALENT WILL REMAIN WITH
OR BE DRAWN TO THE COMPANY OR WILL RETAIN THEIR CURRENT AUDIENCES OR READERSHIP. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT THESE ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES, AUTHORS AND TALENT OR THEY LOSE THEIR
CURRENT AUDIENCES OR READERSHIP, THE COMPANY'S REVENUES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

 I-30 

REGULATION OF THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OUTDOOR BUSINESS 

 THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS
IN THE U.S. AND TO NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL RESTRICTIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THESE REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS CAN AFFECT THE OPERATION AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS OF ADVERTISING
DISPLAYS AND INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR, UPGRADING, HEIGHT, SIZE AND LOCATION OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CONTENT OF ADVERTISING COPY THAT CAN
BE DISPLAYED ON THESE STRUCTURES. IN ADDITION, OUTDOOR ADVERTISING IS THE SUBJECT OF TARGETED STATE AND MUNICIPAL TAXES. SUCH LAWS MAY REDUCE THE COMPANY'S EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES OR MAY INCREASE
COMPETITIVE PRESSURE FROM OTHERS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCE THAT EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS OUTDOOR BUSINESS. 

 FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THESE CURRENCIES FLUCTUATES
RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 THE COMPANY'S LIABILITIES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND FORMER BUSINESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION 

 THE COMPANY HAS BOTH RECOGNIZED AND POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND COSTS RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND FORMER BUSINESSES, CERTAIN
OF WHICH ARE UNRELATED TO THE MEDIA BUSINESS, INCLUDING LEASES, GUARANTEES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE PENSIONS AND MEDICAL EXPENSES OF RETIREES, ASBESTOS LIABILITIES,
CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES AND OTHER PENDING AND THREATENED LITIGATION. THE COMPANY CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT ITS RESERVES ARE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THESE LIABILITIES IN THEIR ENTIRETY OR ANY ONE OF THESE
LIABILITIES WHEN IT BECOMES DUE OR AT WHAT POINT ANY OF THESE LIABILITIES MAY COME DUE. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THESE LIABILITIES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOW. 

 THE COMPANY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY STRIKES AND OTHER UNION ACTIVITY 

 THE COMPANY AND ITS SUPPLIERS ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS AND OTHER TALENT, TRADE EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS WHO ARE
SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUPPLIERS ARE UNABLE TO RENEW EXPIRING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE AFFECTED UNIONS COULD TAKE ACTION IN
THE FORM OF STRIKES OR WORK STOPPAGES. SUCH ACTIONS, HIGHER COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AGREEMENTS OR A SIGNIFICANT LABOR DISPUTE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION, RADIO AND MOTION
PICTURE BUSINESSES BY CAUSING DELAYS IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION OR RADIO PROGRAMMING, MOTION PICTURES OR THE COMPANY'S OUTDOOR BUSINESS BY DISRUPTING ITS ABILITY TO PLACE
ADVERTISING ON OUTDOOR FACES. DEPENDING ON THEIR DURATION, STRIKES OR WORK STOPPAGES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. 

 POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COULD HARM THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES OPERATE AND HAVE CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE. INHERENT RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS INCLUDE, AMONG
OTHER RISKS, CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, EXPORT RESTRICTIONS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS AND LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES. THE COMPANY MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE AS A
RESULT OF THE IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE EXISTING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE REGIONS WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR OTHER HOSTILITIES, OR OTHER FUTURE
FINANCIAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, COULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN 

 I-31 

ADVERTISING
EXPENDITURES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 NAI, THROUGH ITS VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, IS IN A POSITION TO CONTROL ACTIONS THAT REQUIRE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL 

 NAI, THROUGH ITS BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY'S CLASS A COMMON STOCK, HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.
MR. SUMNER M. REDSTONE, THE CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF NAI, SERVES AS EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND
MS. SHARI REDSTONE, THE PRESIDENT AND A DIRECTOR OF NAI, SERVES AS VICE CHAIR OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION, MR. DAVID R. ANDELMAN IS A DIRECTOR OF NAI AND SERVES AS A
DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. NAI IS IN A POSITION TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF CORPORATE ACTIONS THAT REQUIRE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING A CHANGE OF
CONTROL. OTHER STOCKHOLDERS ARE UNABLE TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE CORPORATE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY FOR SO LONG AS NAI RETAINS VOTING CONTROL. 

 SALES OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BY NAI COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE STOCK PRICE 

 NAI, THROUGH ITS BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY'S CLASS A COMMON STOCK, HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. IN CONNECTION
WITH MEETING REQUIREMENTS UNDER NAI'S CREDIT FACILITIES, IN OCTOBER 2009, NAI SOLD APPROXIMATELY 343 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S NON-VOTING CLASS B COMMON STOCK; AND, IN
OCTOBER 2008, NAI SOLD APPROXIMATELY 119 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S NON-VOTING CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT NAI AT SOME FUTURE TIME WILL NOT SELL
ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE. 

 ALSO
AS PART OF A RESTRUCTURING OF NAI'S CREDIT FACILITIES, IN MAY 2009, NAI ADVISED THE COMPANY THAT NAI HAD PLEDGED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS, INCLUDING THE SHARES OF THE
COMPANY'S VOTING CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND NON-VOTING CLASS B COMMON STOCK THAT NAI OWNS, TO SECURE THOSE OBLIGATIONS. IF NAI DEFAULTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THE CREDITORS FORECLOSE ON
THE COLLATERAL, THE CREDITORS OR ANYONE TO WHOM THE CREDITORS TRANSFER SUCH SHARES COULD CONVERT THOSE SHARES OF VOTING CLASS A COMMON STOCK INTO SHARES OF NON-VOTING CLASS B COMMON
STOCK AND SELL SUCH SHARES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE CREDITORS FORECLOSE ON THE PLEDGED SHARES OF VOTING CLASS A COMMON STOCK, NAI WILL NO
LONGER OWN THOSE SHARES AND WILL THEREFORE NO LONGER HAVE VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. 

 MANY FACTORS MAY CAUSE THE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK TO FLUCTUATE 

THE STOCK PRICE OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS.
THESE FACTORS, SOME OR ALL OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, INCLUDE: 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN CBS CORP.'S OPERATING RESULTS; 
 CHANGES IN EXPECTATIONS AS TO CBS CORP.'S FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES OF SECURITIES
ANALYSTS; 
 SUCCESS OF CBS CORP.'S OPERATING AND GROWTH STRATEGIES; 
 INVESTOR ANTICIPATION OF STRATEGIC, TECHNOLOGICAL OR REGULATORY THREATS, WHETHER OR NOT WARRANTED BY ACTUAL EVENTS; 
 OPERATING AND STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER COMPARABLE COMPANIES; AND 
 REALIZATION OF ANY OF THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN THESE RISK FACTORS. 

IN
ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED VOLATILITY THAT OFTEN HAS BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR COMPANIES. THESE BROAD MARKET AND INDUSTRY
FLUCTUATIONS MAY 

 I-32 

ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE TRADING PRICES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, REGARDLESS OF THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE. 

RISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION 

 THE BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER COMPANY FOR CERTAIN REGULATORY PURPOSES 

 SO LONG AS THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. ARE UNDER COMMON CONTROL, EACH COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS THE BUSINESSES OF ANY
OTHER COMMONLY CONTROLLED COMPANY, WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER COMPANY FOR PURPOSES OF CERTAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FCC AND CERTAIN RULES REGARDING POLITICAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS IN
THE U.S., AMONG OTHERS POTENTIALLY. THE BUSINESSES OF ONE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER COMPANY FOR CERTAIN FCC PURPOSES EVEN AFTER THE TWO COMPANIES CEASE TO BE COMMONLY
CONTROLLED, IF THE TWO COMPANIES SHARE COMMON OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, OR ATTRIBUTABLE STOCKHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, THE BUSINESSES AND CONDUCT OF VIACOM INC. MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING AND
AFFECTING THE ACTIVITIES, STRATEGIC BUSINESS ALTERNATIVES AND BUSINESS TERMS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY. 

 THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT PROHIBITS THE COMPANY FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSINESSES 

 UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEPARATION,
THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE ACQUISITIONS, ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS OR ACCEPT OR AGREE TO ANY CONDITION THAT PURPORTS TO BIND VIACOM INC. OR SUBJECTS VIACOM INC. TO RESTRICTIONS IT IS NOT
OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO BY LEGAL ORDER WITHOUT VIACOM INC.'S CONSENT. THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD LIMIT AND AFFECT THE ACTIVITIES, STRATEGIC BUSINESS ALTERNATIVES AND BUSINESS TERMS AVAILABLE TO THE
COMPANY. 

 IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEPARATION, EACH COMPANY WILL RELY ON THE OTHER COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE UNDER VARIOUS AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANIES 

 IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEPARATION, THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THE SEPARATION
AGREEMENT, A TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 30, 2005, WHICH IS FILED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS REPORT, EFFECTIVE AS OF THE SEPARATION (THE "TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT") AND CERTAIN RELATED PARTY
ARRANGEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. WILL PROVIDE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO EACH OTHER FROM AND AFTER THE SEPARATION. THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE ALLOCATION OF
ASSETS, LIABILITIES, RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. FOLLOWING THE SEPARATION, AND INCLUDES INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS FOR SUCH LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION,
PURSUANT TO THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT, CERTAIN INCOME TAX LIABILITIES AND RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN, AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSUMED BY, EACH OF THE COMPANY AND NEW
VIACOM. EACH COMPANY WILL RELY ON THE OTHER TO SATISFY ITS PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. CERTAIN OF THE LIABILITIES TO BE ASSUMED OR INDEMNIFIED BY THE COMPANY OR
VIACOM INC. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE LEGAL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITIES OF THE OTHER COMPANY. IF VIACOM INC. WERE TO BREACH OR BE UNABLE TO SATISFY ITS MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE
AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING A FAILURE TO SATISFY ITS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD SUFFER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES OR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. 

 CERTAIN MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT, DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY FACE ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

 THE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY MAY OWN BOTH CBS CORP. COMMON STOCK AND VIACOM INC. COMMON STOCK, AND BOTH THE
COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. ARE CONTROLLED BY NAI. MR. REDSTONE, THE CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF NAI, SERVES AS EXECUTIVE
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF VIACOM INC.'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. MS. REDSTONE, THE PRESIDENT AND A DIRECTOR OF NAI, SERVES AS VICE CHAIR OF THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EACH OF THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. MR. DAVID R. ANDELMAN IS A DIRECTOR OF NAI AND SERVES AS A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. MR. FREDERIC V. SALERNO IS A DIRECTOR
OF VIACOM INC. AND SERVES AS A 

 I-33 

DIRECTOR
OF THE COMPANY. THIS OWNERSHIP OVERLAP AND THESE COMMON DIRECTORS COULD CREATE, OR APPEAR TO CREATE, POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHEN THE COMPANY'S AND VIACOM INC.'S MANAGEMENT,
DIRECTORS AND CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER FACE DECISIONS THAT COULD HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. FOR EXAMPLE, POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ARISE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. REGARDING THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE SEPARATION AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND
VIACOM INC. THEREAFTER. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT AND ANY COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. ON
OCCASION, THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. MAY COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER IN VARIOUS COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ALSO ARISE IF THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. ENTER
INTO ANY COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER IN THE FUTURE. EACH OF MR. REDSTONE AND MS. REDSTONE MAY ALSO FACE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH REGARD TO THE ALLOCATION OF HIS OR HER TIME
BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC. CBS CORP.'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS PROVISIONS RELATED TO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO BOTH THE COMPANY AND
VIACOM INC. CBS CORP.'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION PROVIDES THAT IN THE EVENT THAT A DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER OF THE COMPANY WHO IS ALSO A DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR CONTROLLING
STOCKHOLDER OF VIACOM INC. ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF A POTENTIAL CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND VIACOM INC., SUCH DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER MAY PRESENT
SUCH OPPORTUNITY TO THE COMPANY OR VIACOM INC. OR BOTH, AS SUCH DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER DEEMS APPROPRIATE IN HIS OR HER SOLE DISCRETION, AND THAT BY DOING SO SUCH PERSON
WILL HAVE SATISFIED HIS OR HER FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, CBS CORP.'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION PROVIDES THAT THE COMPANY RENOUNCES ANY INTEREST IN ANY SUCH
OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO VIACOM INC. THESE PROVISIONS CREATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT A CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY OF ONE OF SUCH COMPANIES MAY BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER COMPANY.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

ENSERVCO S SECURITIES
ARE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER ITEMS THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE BELOW
RISK FACTORS ARE INTENDED TO GENERALLY DESCRIBE CERTAIN RISKS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY AND ITS CURRENT BUSINESS
OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES. 

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE HEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DECISION WHETHER TO ACQUIRE, HOLD OR SELL THE COMPANY S
SECURITIES. IF ANY OF THE CONTINGENCIES DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS OR OTHER MATERIALLY ADVERSE EVENTS ACTUALLY OCCURS,
THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASE, THE TRADING
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 

OPERATIONS RELATED RISKS 

WE
HAD A 2.7 MILLION WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WHICH, IF NOT REMEDIATED, MAY RESTRICT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS. 

AT
DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT (CURRENT ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS APPROXIMATELY 2.7 MILLION. UNLESS
WE ARE ABLE TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT FACILITIES WITH OUR PRIMARY LENDER, RAISE SUFFICIENT FINANCING, OR IMPROVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL
THROUGH RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR TO ADDRESS OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ISSUES RESULTING
FROM THIS WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MADE THE NECESSARY
STEPS TO IMPROVE AND ELIMINATE THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT THROUGH RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD AND HAS INITIATED STEPS
TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT AND RAISE SUFFICIENT FINANCING, WE CANNOT OFFER ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS
WITH OUR PRIMARY LENDER OR RAISE SUFFICIENT FINANCING TO ADEQUATELY REMEDIATE THESE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT CONCERNS. 

OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON KEY MEMBERS OF OUR MANAGEMENT, THE LOSS OF ANY OF WHOM COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. 

WE
DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF MICHAEL D. HERMAN OR
RICK D. KASCH AND/OR AUSTIN PEITZ, OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENTS WITH MESSRS. HERMAN, KASCH AND PEITZ, THAT CONTAIN, AMONG OTHER THINGS NON-COMPETE AND CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS,
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE NON-COMPETE AND/OR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS IN THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. 

WE
DEPEND ON SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, AND A LOSS OF ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

ENSERVCO S
CUSTOMERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MAJOR AND INDEPENDENT OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMPANIES. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, ONLY ONE
OF THE COMPANY S CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10 OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AT APPROXIMATELY 12 DURING 2011 AND 13 
DURING 2010 (ALL OTHER CUSTOMERS WERE INDIVIDUALLY LESS THAN 9 AND 7 OF REVENUES DURING THESE YEARS, RESPECTIVELY). 

THE
COMPANY NOTES, THAT THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY ONE CUSTOMER THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10 OF REVENUES DURING 2011, THE COMPANY S
TOP FIVE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 38 OF ITS TOTAL REVENUES DURING THE YEAR. THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS
OR A SUSTAINED DECREASE IN DEMAND BY ANY OF SUCH CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF REVENUES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON ENSERVCO S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

WHILE THE COMPANY
BELIEVES ITS EQUIPMENT COULD BE REDEPLOYED IN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT IF DILLCO AND/OR HEAT WAVES LOST ANY MATERIAL CUSTOMERS,
SUCH LOSS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY S BUSINESS UNTIL THE EQUIPMENT IS REDEPLOYED. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED
IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE MARKET FOR ENSERVCO S SERVICES IS SUFFICIENTLY DIVERSIFIED THAT IT IS NOT
DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS. 

13 

OUR
BUSINESS DEPENDS ON DOMESTIC SPENDING BY THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, AND OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE,
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 

WE DEPEND ON OUR CUSTOMERS 
WILLINGNESS TO MAKE OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES.
CUSTOMERS EXPECTATIONS FOR LOWER MARKET PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL FOR OPERATING
AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, MAY CAUSE THEM TO CURTAIL SPENDING, THEREBY REDUCING DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT. AS AN EXAMPLE,
ENSERVCO BELIEVES THE WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS DURING MUCH OF 2009 SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED
TO THE COMPANY S NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 5.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GENERALLY IMPROVING ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS AND INCREASING ACTIVITY IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN LATE 2010 AND THROUGHOUT 2011 HAS LIKELY BENEFITTED ENSERVCO. 

INDUSTRY
CONDITIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS OVER WHICH ENSERVCO HAS NO CONTROL, SUCH AS THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR OIL AND
NATURAL GAS, DOMESTIC AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WEATHER CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING
COUNTRIES (SUCH AS CURRENTLY OCCURRING IN THE MIDDLE EAST), AND MERGER AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY AMONG OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.
THE VOLATILITY OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPACT ON EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITY COULD ADVERSELY
IMPACT THE LEVEL OF DRILLING AND ACTIVITY BY SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS REDUCTION MAY CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR ENSERVCO S
SERVICES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF ITS SERVICES. IN ADDITION, REDUCED DISCOVERY RATES OF NEW OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES
IN ENSERVCO S MARKET AREAS ALSO MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE LONG-TERM IMPACT ON ITS BUSINESS, EVEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF STRONGER
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, TO THE EXTENT EXISTING PRODUCTION IS NOT REPLACED AND THE NUMBER OF PRODUCING WELLS FOR ENSERVCO TO
SERVICE DECLINES. 

ON-GOING
VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS CAUSED THE OILFIELD SERVICES INDUSTRY TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY
IN TERMS OF DEMAND, AND THE RATE AT WHICH DEMAND MAY SLOW, OR RETURN TO FORMER LEVELS, IS UNCERTAIN. AT TIMES THE RECENT VOLATILITY
IN PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAS LED MANY OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS TO ANNOUNCE REDUCTIONS IN THEIR CAPITAL BUDGETS FOR
CERTAIN PERIODS. LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, OR HIGHER COSTS OF CAPITAL, FOR FINANCING EXPENDITURES MAY CAUSE
THESE AND OTHER OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS TO MAKE ON-GOING OR ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO CAPITAL BUDGETS IN THE FUTURE EVEN
IF COMMODITY PRICES INCREASE FROM CURRENT LEVELS. THESE CUTS IN SPENDING WILL CURTAIL DRILLING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS DISCRETIONARY
SPENDING ON WELL SERVICES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE DEMAND FOR ENSERVCO S SERVICES, THE RATES WE CAN CHARGE
AND OUR UTILIZATION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF ENSERVCO S CUSTOMERS COULD BECOME UNABLE TO PAY THEIR SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING
ENSERVCO. ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS OR EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 

IF
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES REMAIN VOLATILE IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. 

THE
DEMAND FOR MANY OF OUR SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, AND THE RELATED
GENERAL PRODUCTION SPENDING AND LEVEL OF DRILLING ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS. 

14 

THOUGH
WE FEEL THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS REBOUNDED IN 2011 AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS HISTORICALLY
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY VOLATILE IN PRIOR YEARS AND LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE. VOLATILITY OR WEAKNESS IN OIL AND NATURAL
GAS PRICES (OR THE PERCEPTION THAT OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WILL DECREASE) AFFECTS THE SPENDING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND
MAY RESULT IN THE DRILLING OF FEWER NEW WELLS OR LOWER PRODUCTION SPENDING ON EXISTING WELLS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN LOWER
DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND MAY CAUSE LOWER RATES AND LOWER UTILIZATION OF ENSERVCO S WELL SERVICE EQUIPMENT. 

HIGHER
OIL AND GAS PRICES DO NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN INCREASED DRILLING ACTIVITY BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE
PRICES ALSO DRIVES DEMAND FOR DRILLING SERVICES. OIL AND GAS PRICES AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR ENSERVCO S SERVICES ALSO DEPENDS
UPON OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND ENSERVCO S CONTROL, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

DEMAND
 FOR OILS AND NATURAL
 GAS; 

COST
 OF EXPLORING FOR,
 PRODUCING, AND
 DELIVERING OIL
 AND NATURAL GAS; 

EXPECTATIONS
 REGARDING FUTURE
 ENERGY PRICES; 

ADVANCEMENTS
 IN EXPLORATION
 AND DEVELOPMENT
 TECHNOLOGY; 

ADOPTION
 OR REPEAL OF LAWS
 REGULATING OIL
 AND GAS PRODUCTION
 IN THE U.S.; 

IMPOSITION
 OR LIFTING OF ECONOMIC
 SANCTIONS AGAINST
 FOREIGN COMPANIES; 

WEATHER
 CONDITIONS; 

RATE
 OF DISCOVERY OF
 NEW OIL AND NATURAL
 GAS RESERVES; 

TAX
 POLICY REGARDING
 THE OIL AND GAS
 INDUSTRY; AND 

DEVELOPMENT
 AND USE OF ALTERNATIVE
 ENERGY SOURCES. 

DEMAND FOR THE
MAJORITY OF OUR SERVICES IS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE LEVELS OF EXPENDITURES BY THE DOMESTIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY.
ENSERVCO HAS NO INFLUENCE OVER ITS CUSTOMERS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ON-GOING ECONOMIC VOLATILITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 

DEMAND FOR THE MAJORITY
OF OUR SERVICES DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES BY PARTICIPANTS IN THE DOMESTIC (UNITED STATES) OIL AND NATURAL
GAS INDUSTRY FOR THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE
TO THE INDUSTRY S VIEW OF FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, AND THE RESULTING IMPACT ON DEMAND
FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE WORLDWIDE DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, WHICH BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008,
RESULTED IN DIMINISHED DEMAND FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DURING 2009 AND AT LEAST
THE FIRST HALF OF 2010. THIS CAUSED MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY THEIR OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
SPENDING IN 2009 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2010, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY REDUCED THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, AND EXERTED DOWNWARD PRESSURE
ON THE PRICES THAT WE CHARGED FOR OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THOUGH WE FEEL THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS REBOUNDED IN
2011 AS COMPARED TO 2009 AND 2010, OTHER WORLDWIDE POLITICAL EVENTS MAY RESULT IN HIGHER OR LOWER PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS
AND IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. 

FURTHERMORE, INCREASING
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES CAN LEAD TO INCREASING COSTS OF EXPLORING FOR AND PRODUCING OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THOUGH THE ADDITION
OF FRAC STIMULATION INTO THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS SOMEWHAT REDUCED THE OVERALL COSTS OF PRODUCING OIL AND NATURAL
GAS, THE PRICE OF DRILL RIGS, PIPE, OTHER EQUIPMENT, FLUIDS, AND OIL FIELD SERVICES AND THE COST TO COMPANIES LIKE ENSERVCO OF
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES, HAS GENERALLY INCREASED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. THE RESULTING REDUCTION
IN CASH FLOWS BEING EXPERIENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS DURING THE PAST YEARS DUE TO THE GENERAL DETERIORATION OF THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT
MARKETS AND THE INCREASE OF THE COSTS OF EXPLORING FOR AND PRODUCING OIL AND NATURAL GAS AS NOTED ABOVE, TOGETHER WITH THE REDUCED
AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND INCREASED COSTS OF BORROWING FUNDS, COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION
OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD RESULT IN PROJECT MODIFICATIONS, DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS, GENERAL BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, AND
DELAY IN, OR NONPAYMENT OF, AMOUNTS THAT ARE OWED TO THE COMPANY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 

15 

ENVIRONMENTAL
COMPLIANCE COSTS AND LIABILITIES COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO
INCREASINGLY STRINGENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO IMPORTATION AND USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,
INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING AIR EMISSIONS, WATER DISCHARGES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. WE INCUR, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE
TO INCUR, CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS OF THESE LAWS
AND REGULATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, STRINGENT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT. THESE LAWS MAY PROVIDE FOR STRICT
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES OR THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. STRICT LIABILITY CAN RENDER A PARTY
LIABLE FOR DAMAGES WITHOUT REGARD TO NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT ON THE PART OF THE PARTY. SOME ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND
SEVERAL STRICT LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION OF SPILLS AND RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. 

THE COMPANY USES HAZARDOUS
SUBSTANCES AND WASTES IN ITS OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO POTENTIALLY MATERIAL LIABILITIES RELATING TO
THE INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES, AND TO CLAIMS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE AS THE RESULT
OF EXPOSURES TO, OR RELEASES OF, HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. IN ADDITION, STRICTER ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, NEW
LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CONTAMINATION OR THE IMPOSITION OF NEW OR INCREASED REQUIREMENTS COULD
REQUIRE ENSERVCO TO INCUR COSTS OR BECOME THE BASIS OF NEW OR INCREASED LIABILITIES THAT COULD REDUCE ITS EARNINGS AND CASH AVAILABLE
FOR OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS CURRENTLY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 

COMPETITION
WITHIN THE WELL SERVICES INDUSTRY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR SERVICES. 

THE
WELL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED AND INCLUDES NUMEROUS SMALL COMPANIES CAPABLE OF COMPETING EFFECTIVELY
IN OUR MARKETS ON A LOCAL BASIS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL LARGE COMPANIES THAT POSSESS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES
THAN ENSERVCO. THE COMPANY S LARGER COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER RESOURCES THAT COULD ALLOW THOSE COMPETITORS TO COMPETE MORE
EFFECTIVELY THAN CAN ENSERVCO. THE AMOUNT OF EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE MAY EXCEED DEMAND, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ACTIVE PRICE COMPETITION. 

OUR
OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE RISKS MAY BE SELF-INSURED, OR MAY NOT BE
FULLY COVERED UNDER OUR INSURANCE POLICIES BUT, TO THE EXTENT NOT COVERED, ARE SELF-INSURED BY ENSERVCO. 

OUR OPERATIONS ARE
SUBJECT TO HAZARDS INHERENT IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCIDENTS, BLOWOUTS, EXPLOSIONS,
FIRES AND OIL SPILLS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE: 

PERSONAL
 INJURY OR LOSS
 OF LIFE, 

DAMAGE
 TO OR DESTRUCTION
 OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT
 AND THE ENVIRONMENT, AND 

SUSPENSION
 OF OPERATIONS
 BY OUR CUSTOMERS. 

16 

THE
OCCURRENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT EVENT OR ADVERSE CLAIM IN EXCESS OF THE INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT WE MAINTAIN OR THAT IS NOT COVERED
BY INSURANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CLAIMS FOR
LOSS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND DAMAGE TO FORMATIONS CAN OCCUR IN THE WELL SERVICES INDUSTRY. LITIGATION ARISING FROM
A CATASTROPHIC OCCURRENCE AT A LOCATION WHERE OUR EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES ARE BEING USED MAY RESULT IN OUR BEING NAMED AS A DEFENDANT
IN LAWSUITS ASSERTING LARGE CLAIMS. 

THE
COMPANY MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY AGAINST THESE HAZARDS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT
HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST ALL FORESEEABLE RISKS, EITHER BECAUSE INSURANCE IS NOT AVAILABLE OR BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PREMIUM COSTS.
AS SUCH, NOT ALL OF OUR PROPERTY IS INSURED. THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT NOT FULLY INSURED AGAINST, OR THE FAILURE OF AN INSURER
TO MEET ITS INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INSURANCE
IN THE FUTURE AT REASONABLE RATES. INSURANCE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO COVER ANY OR ALL OF THE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, OR,
EVEN IF AVAILABLE, IT MAY BE INADEQUATE, OR INSURANCE PREMIUMS OR OTHER COSTS COULD RISE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE SO AS TO
MAKE SUCH INSURANCE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. IT IS LIKELY THAT, IN OUR INSURANCE RENEWALS, OUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES WILL BE
HIGHER, AND CERTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE EITHER WILL BE UNAVAILABLE OR CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE RECENT
PAST. IN ADDITION, OUR INSURANCE IS SUBJECT TO COVERAGE LIMITS, AND SOME POLICIES EXCLUDE COVERAGE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION. 

WE
MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING, MAKING AND INTEGRATING OUR ACQUISITIONS, IF ANY, IN THE FUTURE. 

WE
ANTICIPATE THAT A COMPONENT OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY MAY BE TO MAKE GEOGRAPHIC-FOCUSED ACQUISITIONS AIMED TO STRENGTHEN OUR PRESENCE
IN SELECTED REGIONAL MARKETS. PURSUIT OF THIS STRATEGY MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE ON-GOING VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY WITHIN THE
CREDIT MARKETS WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR SUCH ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION TO RESTRICTED FUNDING
AVAILABILITY, THE SUCCESS OF THIS STRATEGY WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AND TO NEGOTIATE
ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO. THE SUCCESS OF AN ACQUISITION DEPENDS
ON OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM ADEQUATE DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE THE ACQUISITION AND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE ACQUISITION AFTER
IT IS COMPLETED. WHILE THE COMPANY INTENDS TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT IT CONDUCTS COMPREHENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE,
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL POTENTIAL RISKS AND LIABILITIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION. SIMILARLY,
WHILE WE EXPECT TO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT TIME AND EFFORT, TO INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO
OURS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATING THESE BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE COMPANY
BE ABLE TO RETAIN BOTH KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND ITS CUSTOMER BASE. A LOSS OF EITHER KEY PERSONNEL OR CUSTOMERS
COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OF ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESS. 

COMPLIANCE
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION OR INITIATIVES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 

THE
U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED LEGISLATION TO MANDATE REDUCTIONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CERTAIN STATES HAVE ALREADY
IMPLEMENTED, OR MAY BE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING, SIMILAR LEGISLATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS HELD
IN ITS DECISIONS THAT CARBON DIOXIDE CAN BE REGULATED AS AN AIR POLLUTANT UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT, WHICH COULD RESULT
IN FUTURE REGULATIONS EVEN IF THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT ADOPT NEW LEGISLATION REGARDING EMISSIONS. AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT
POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW LEGISLATION OR NEW FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT MANDATES REGARDING THE EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES COULD
IMPACT OUR BUSINESS; HOWEVER, ANY SUCH FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE US OR OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVOTE POTENTIALLY MATERIAL
AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL OR OTHER RESOURCES IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS. THESE EXPENDITURES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. 

17 

DEBT RELATED RISKS 

OUR
INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY COLLATERALIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS, COULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS AND MAKE
US MORE VULNERABLE TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 

WE
CURRENTLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY OWED APPROXIMATELY 11.9 MILLION TO
BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHICH HAS BEEN GUARANTEED BY ENSERVCO AS DILLCO S PARENT CORPORATION),
WITH ANOTHER 2.3 MILLION DUE THROUGH A REVOLVING LETTER OF CREDIT AND ANOTHER 1.5 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED DEBT TO MR. HERMAN,
(THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDER OF THE COMPANY). 

OUR
CURRENT AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD: 

IMPAIR
 OUR ABILITY TO
 MAKE INVESTMENTS
 AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL
 FINANCING FOR
 WORKING CAPITAL,
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,
 ACQUISITIONS OR
 OTHER GENERAL
 CORPORATE PURPOSES, 

LIMIT
 OUR ABILITY TO
 USE OPERATING
 CASH FLOW IN OTHER
 AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS
 BECAUSE WE MUST
 DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL
 PORTION OF THESE
 FUNDS TO MAKE
 PRINCIPAL AND
 INTEREST PAYMENTS
 ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, 

MAKE
 US MORE VULNERABLE
 TO A DOWNTURN
 IN OUR BUSINESS,
 OUR INDUSTRY OR
 THE ECONOMY IN
 GENERAL AS A SUBSTANTIAL
 PORTION OF OUR
 OPERATING CASH
 FLOW WILL BE REQUIRED
 TO MAKE PRINCIPAL
 AND INTEREST PAYMENTS
 ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS,
 MAKING IT MORE
 DIFFICULT TO REACT
 TO CHANGES IN
 OUR BUSINESS AND
 IN INDUSTRY AND
 MARKET CONDITIONS, 

PUT
 US AT A COMPETITIVE
 DISADVANTAGE TO
 COMPETITORS THAT
 HAVE LESS DEBT, AND 

INCREASE
 OUR VULNERABILITY
 TO INTEREST RATE
 INCREASES TO THE
 EXTENT THAT WE
 INCUR VARIABLE
 RATE INDEBTEDNESS. 

IF
WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW OR ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE FUNDS REQUIRED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, OR IF WE OTHERWISE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE VARIOUS DEBT SERVICE COVENANTS AND/OR REPORTING COVENANTS
IN THE BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENTS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING OUR CURRENT OR ANY FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS, WE COULD BE IN DEFAULT
UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OR SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, THE HOLDERS OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS
COULD ELECT TO DECLARE ALL THE FUNDS BORROWED UNDER THOSE INSTRUMENTS TO BE DUE AND PAYABLE TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST,
THE LENDERS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY COULD ELECT TO TERMINATE THEIR COMMITMENTS THERE UNDER AND WE OR ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES
COULD BE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY OR LIQUIDATION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING CONSEQUENCES COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS
AND CAUSE THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. 

18 

WE
MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE TERMS OF OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH
GREAT WESTERN BANK. 

DILLCO S
AGREEMENTS WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK IMPOSE VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON DILLCO, EACH OF WHICH ENSERVCO (AS THE
PARENT CORPORATION) HAS GUARANTEED. THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK IS DUE IN FULL IN OCTOBER
2012 UNLESS IT IS RENEWED ON A YEAR-TO-YEAR BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE TERM LOAN WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK WAS AMENDED DURING
2011, ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT FOR DILLCO TO MAKE A 1.0 MILLION PRINCIPAL PAYMENT DURING THE YEAR AND ALSO AMENDED THE MATURITY
DATE OF THE TERM LOAN FROM JUNE 2015 TO MARCH 2015, EFFECTIVELY INCREASING THE MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE THROUGH
MATURITY. BOTH OF THESE LOANS WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE, ARE GUARANTEED BY ENSERVCO (AS THE PARENT
CORPORATION) AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ARE COLLATERALIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF DILLCO S AND HEAT WAVES 
ASSETS. 

FURTHER,
THE RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH GREAT WESTERN AND THE BANK IMPOSE VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON DILLCO INCLUDING MAINTAINING A PRESCRIBED
DEBT SERVICE RATIO, MINIMUM NET WORTH, MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO, AND LIMIT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT
OBLIGATIONS. IF DILLCO IS UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AND COVENANTS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENTS AND IT DECLARES AN EVENT
OF DEFAULT ALL OF DILLCO S OBLIGATIONS TO GREAT WESTERN BANK COULD BE IMMEDIATELY DUE. BECAUSE ENSERVCO (AS THE PARENT CORPORATION)
GUARANTEED DILLCO S DEBT TO GREAT WESTERN BANK, ANY DEFAULT BY DILLCO ON ITS OBLIGATIONS TO GREAT WESTERN WOULD LIKELY DIRECTLY
IMPACT ENSERVCO. 

AT
DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY DID NOT MEET SOME OF THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IMPOSED BY THE LOAN AGREEMENTS WHICH RESULTED IN AN
EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS. GREAT WESTERN BANK HAS WAIVED THE EFFECT OF THIS EVENT OF DEFAULT AND HAS AGREED TO
MODIFY THE DEBT COVENANTS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENTS FOR FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS FOR THOSE COVENANTS WHICH WERE IN DEFAULT AT DECEMBER
31, 2011. IF ANY FURTHER EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS UNDER ANY OF THE GREAT WEST BANK LOAN AGREEMENTS, WE CANNOT OFFER ANY ASSURANCE
THAT THE BANK WILL GRANT A SIMILAR WAIVER. 

THE
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN DILLCO AND ITS PRIMARY LENDER CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS WITH THE DEBT OF OUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER,
MICHAEL D. HERMAN. 

MICHAEL
D. HERMAN IS OUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER, A DIRECTOR, AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. BEFORE CLOSING OF THE MERGER TRANSACTION, MR.
HERMAN CONTROLLED DILLCO AND ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES, AND HAD VARIOUS PERSONAL AND UNRELATED BUSINESS LOANS WITH GREAT WESTERN
BANK AND ITS PREDECESSOR LENDERS. WHEN THE COMPANY NEGOTIATED ITS LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK, THE BANK INSISTED THAT
THEY CONTAIN CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS SO THAT A DEFAULT BY MR. HERMAN ON HIS PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK WOULD
CONSTITUTE A DEFAULT ON GREAT WESTERN S LOANS TO DILLCO. AS A RESULT OF THESE CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, SHOULD MR. HERMAN
DEFAULT ON ANY OF THE OTHER DEBT HE HAS THROUGH THE BANK IN HIS PERSONAL CAPACITY, THE BANK COULD DECLARE DILLCO S LOANS
IN DEFAULT AND CALL UPON ENSERVCO S GUARANTEE WITH RESPECT TO DILLCO S LOANS (BUT NOT MR. HERMAN S SEPARATE
OBLIGATIONS). UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT BY MR. HERMAN, DILLCO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS TO GREAT WESTERN BANK
WHICH WOULD LIKELY ADVERSELY IMPAIR ENSERVCO S ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND PAY ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS
NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. NEITHER DILLCO NOR ENSERVCO HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHETHER THERE OCCURS AN EVENT
OF DEFAULT UNDER MR. HERMAN S PERSONAL LOAN AGREEMENTS. 

19 

THE
VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS WITH GREAT WESTERN BANK SUBJECTS US TO INTEREST RATE RISK, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS
TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

DILLCO S
BORROWINGS THROUGH GREAT WESTERN BANK BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES, EXPOSING THE COMPANY TO INTEREST RATE RISK. ABSENT OUR
ABILITY TO HEDGE OUR VARIABLE RATES, IF SUCH RATES INCREASE, DILLCO S DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS ON THE VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS
WOULD INCREASE EVEN THOUGH THE AMOUNT BORROWED REMAINED THE SAME AND THE COMPANY S NET INCOME AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR SERVICING
DILLCO S INDEBTEDNESS WOULD DECREASE. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON
STOCK 

OUR COMMON STOCK
IS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES WHICH LIMITS THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK . 

BECAUSE OUR STOCK
IS NOT QUOTED ON AN EXCHANGE AND SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK IS LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE, THE COMMON STOCK IS
CLASSIFIED AS A PENNY STOCK . SEC RULE 15G-9 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE 1934 ACT IMPOSES ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS THAT RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF PENNY STOCKS TO PERSONS
OTHER THAN THOSE WHO QUALIFY AS AN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER OR AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR. THIS INCLUDES THE
REQUIREMENT THAT A BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT INVESTMENTS IN PENNY STOCKS ARE SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER AND
MUST MAKE SPECIAL DISCLOSURES TO THE CUSTOMERS CONCERNING THE RISK OF PENNY STOCKS. MANY BROKER-DEALERS DECLINE TO PARTICIPATE
IN PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS. APPLICATION OF THE PENNY STOCK
RULES TO OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES THE MARKET LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHARES, WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON
STOCK TO RESELL THE SHARES THEY PURCHASE, AND THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL AT PRICES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICES THEY PAID. 

IT IS LIKELY
THAT ANY EFFORTS WE MAY MAKE TO RAISE CAPITAL OR EFFECT A BUSINESS TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL DILUTION
TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. 

AS PART OF OUR GROWTH
STRATEGY WE MAY DESIRE TO RAISE CAPITAL AND OR UTILIZE ITS COMMON STOCK TO EFFECT STRATEGIC BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. EITHER SUCH
ACTION WILL LIKELY REQUIRE THAT WE ISSUE EQUITY (OR DEBT) SECURITIES WHICH WOULD RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.
ALTHOUGH WE WILL ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE CAPITAL-RAISING ACTIVITIES OR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, WE
CANNOT OFFER ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO. IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, WE MAY HAVE
TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT PRICES AT A DISCOUNT FROM THE THEN-CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

THE MAJORITY
OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERED RESTRICTED STOCK AND OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE TO BE RESOLD PURSUANT
TO RULE 144. 

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION
OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK WAS ISSUED TO OUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS IN JULY 2010 AS RESTRICTED SECURITIES UNDER
RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. ASPEN ISSUED THESE SHARES TO MR. MRS. HERMAN AND MR. KASCH IN CONSIDERATION FOR THEIR
INTERESTS IN DILLCO. AS A FORMER SHELL COMPANY, TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY PERSON HOLDS RESTRICTED SECURITIES OF ENSERVCO OR OTHERWISE
MUST RELY ON RULE 144 FOR RESALE, RULE 144(I) IMPOSES ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF ANY HOLDER TO UTILIZE THE EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION FOR SALES CONTAINED IN RULE 144. 

20 

BECAUSE
WE HAVE NO PLANS TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MUST LOOK SOLELY TO STOCK APPRECIATION FOR A RETURN ON THEIR
INVESTMENT IN US. 

WE
DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO RETAIN ALL FUTURE
EARNINGS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. ANY PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS,
STATUTORY AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS APPLYING TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
DEEMS RELEVANT. THE TERMS OF DILLCO S EXISTING SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS WITHOUT THE PRIOR
WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LENDERS. 

 INVESTORS MUST
RELY ON SALES OF THEIR COMMON STOCK AFTER PRICE APPRECIATION, WHICH MAY NEVER OCCUR, AS THE ONLY WAY TO REALIZE A RETURN ON THEIR
INVESTMENT. INVESTORS SEEKING CASH DIVIDENDS SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. 

GENERAL CORPORATE RISKS 

CONCENTRATION
OF OWNERSHIP IN MR. HERMAN MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT ANY STOCKHOLDER WILL BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS OR ENGAGE
IN A CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION. 

BECAUSE MR. HERMAN
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY OWNS APPROXIMATELY 60 OF THE COMPANY S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE HAS THE ABILITY TO ELECT ALL
OF OUR DIRECTORS WHEN THEY AGAIN STAND FOR REELECTION. FURTHERMORE, NO PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OF ENSERVCO THROUGH STOCK OWNERSHIP
WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN DOING SO WITHOUT NEGOTIATING AN ARRANGEMENT TO DO SO WITH MR. HERMAN. FOR SO LONG AS MR. HERMAN CONTINUES
TO OWN A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ENSERVCO COMMON STOCK, HE WILL RETAIN SUCH CONTROL OVER THE ELECTION
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE NEGOTIATION OF ANY CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION. 

RISK OF CHANGE
OF CONTROL. 

MR. HERMAN DIRECTLY
AND INDIRECTLY OWNS APPROXIMATELY 60 OF THE COMPANY S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. MR. HERMAN HAS SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS
TO GREAT WESTERN BANK, ALSO THE COMPANY S PRINCIPAL LENDER. MR. HERMAN HAS GRANTED GREAT WESTERN BANK A BLANKET LIEN ON
HIS PERSONAL ASSETS. THEREFORE, SHOULD MR. HERMAN DEFAULT ON HIS PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO THE BANK, THE BANK MAY INSTITUTE A COLLECTION
ACTION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE TRANSFER OF MR. HERMAN S INTEREST IN ENSERVCO TO THE BANK WHICH TRANSFER WOULD
RESULT IN A CHANGE OF CONTROL. 

PROVISIONS
IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS COULD PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE IN CONTROL OR A TAKEOVER. 

PROVISIONS IN OUR
BYLAWS PROVIDE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS WHICH PRECLUDE A STOCKHOLDER FROM NOMINATING A CANDIDATE TO
STAND FOR ELECTION AT ANY ANNUAL MEETING. AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2.12 OF THE COMPANY S BYLAWS, NOMINATIONS MUST BE PRESENTED
TO THE COMPANY WELL IN ADVANCE OF A SCHEDULED ANNUAL MEETING, AND THE NOTIFICATION MUST INCLUDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS SET FORTH
IN THAT SECTION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SUCH A PROVISION PROVIDES REASONABLE NOTICE OF THE NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
BUT IT MAY PRECLUDE STOCKHOLDER NOMINATION AT A MEETING WHERE THE STOCKHOLDER IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH NOMINATION PROCEDURES AND,
THEREFORE, MAY PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR TAKEOVER. 

21 

ALTHOUGH THE DELAWARE
GENERAL CORPORATION LAW INCLUDES 112 WHICH PROVIDES THAT BYLAWS OF DELAWARE CORPORATIONS MAY REQUIRE THE CORPORATION TO
INCLUDE IN ITS PROXY MATERIALS ONE OR MORE NOMINEES SUBMITTED BY STOCKHOLDERS IN ADDITION TO INDIVIDUALS NOMINATED BY THE BOARD
OF DIRECTORS, THE BYLAWS OF ENSERVCO DO NOT SO PROVIDE. AS A RESULT, IF ANY STOCKHOLDER DESIRES TO NOMINATE PERSONS FOR ELECTION
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE PROPONENT WILL HAVE TO INCUR ALL OF THE COSTS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A CONTESTED PROXY CONTEST
AND THEN, BECAUSE OF MR. HERMAN S CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP, WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN ITS ENDEAVOR. 

THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION RECENTLY ADOPTED RULES THAT ARE ALSO INTENDED TO HELP STOCKHOLDERS NOMINEES FOR ELECTION, BUT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY
CLEAR WHEN OR IF THESE RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE. THEREFORE, STOCKHOLDERS WHO DESIRE TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN NEWLY ENACTED (OR CONTEMPLATED) STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE AIMED TO HELP STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES
BE ELECTED TO BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, WHICH IS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT MAY DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR A TAKEOVER. 

INDEMNIFICATION
OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY RESULT IN UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES. 

THE DELAWARE GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW AND OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS PROVIDE FOR THE INDEMNIFICATION OF OUR DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AGAINST ATTORNEY S FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY THEM
IN ANY LITIGATION TO WHICH THEY BECOME A PARTY ARISING FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH US OR ACTIVITIES ON OUR BEHALF. WE ALSO WILL
BEAR THE EXPENSES OF SUCH LITIGATION FOR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS, UPON SUCH PERSON S PROMISE
TO REPAY THEM IF IT IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED THAT ANY SUCH PERSON SHALL NOT HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION. THIS INDEMNIFICATION
POLICY COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES BY US THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RECOUP AND COULD DIRECT FUNDS AWAY FROM OUR BUSINESS
AND PRODUCTS (IF ANY). 

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 1934 ACT. 

BECAUSE WE ARE A PUBLIC
COMPANY FILING REPORTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ACT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND EXTENSIVE
AND COMPLEX REGULATION. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS THE RIGHT TO REVIEW THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF OUR REPORTS,
PRESS RELEASES, AND OTHER PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS TO INSTITUTE AND MAINTAIN FINANCIAL
ACCOUNTING CONTROLS AND FOR THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF OUR BOOKS AND RECORDS. NORMALLY THESE ACTIVITIES ARE OVERSEEN BY
AN AUDIT COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. A MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CURRENTLY DOES NOT CONSIST
OF DIRECTORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROTECTIONS NORMALLY PROVIDED TO STOCKHOLDERS BY
BOARDS OF DIRECTORS COMPRISED BY A MAJORITY OF PERSONS CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH
WE HOPE TO APPOINT QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS IN THE FUTURE SHOULD WE ENTER INTO A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR ACQUIRE A BUSINESS,
WE CANNOT OFFER ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL LOCATE ANY PERSON WILLING TO SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE
TO BE INACCURATE. 

IN OUR EFFORT TO MAKE
THE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT MORE MEANINGFUL, THIS REPORT CONTAINS BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALL STATEMENTS
OTHER THAN STATEMENTS OF HISTORICAL FACT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANINGS OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 AND SECTION 21E OF THE 1934 ACT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT ARE NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS, BUT RATHER
REFLECT THE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF OUR MANAGEMENT CONCERNING FUTURE RESULTS AND EVENTS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BECAUSE WE ARE
A PENNY STOCK, THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND SECTION 21E OF THE 1934
ACT DO NOT APPLY TO US. WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO QUALIFY OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITH APPROPRIATE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE JUDICIALLY-CREATED DOCTRINE OF BESPEAKS CAUTION AND OTHER PROTECTIONS. 

22 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS
TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS
ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALL OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN
THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K. OTHER UNKNOWN OR UNPREDICTABLE FACTORS ALSO COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS
ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

 RISK FACTORS THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION
DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS OUR DISCLOSURE AND
ANALYSIS IN THIS 2007 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT S PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT
FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY EACH SUCH STATEMENT BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, 
 WILL, TARGET, FORECAST AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE
OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 16 

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE
BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE
INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE
ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE OR RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS
RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR
UNCERTAINTIES. FINANCIAL RISKS AND RISKS OF OPERATION WE DEPEND ON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL WHEN NECESSARY. UNLIKE
REGULAR C CORPORATIONS, WE MUST FINANCE OUR GROWTH AND FUND DEBT REPAYMENTS LARGELY WITH EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL BECAUSE WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AT LEAST 90 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME (OTHER THAN NET CAPITAL GAIN) IN ORDER
TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, INCLUDING TAXABLE INCOME WE RECOGNIZE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES BUT WITH REGARD TO WHICH WE DO NOT RECEIVE CORRESPONDING CASH. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE EXTERNAL CAPITAL WE REQUIRE COULD BE HAMPERED BY A NUMBER OF
FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING DECLINING GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, UNFAVORABLE MARKET PERCEPTION OF OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL, DECREASES IN OUR CURRENT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE EARNINGS, EXCESSIVE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR
DECREASES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF HOST S COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED BY THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RESTRICTS OUR INCURRENCE OF DEBT AND
THE PAYMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION, COULD PREVENT US FROM BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN THE EXTERNAL CAPITAL WE REQUIRE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL AND THE
FAILURE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY EXTERNAL CAPITAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR FUTURE GROWTH. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL
DEBT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY 5.6 BILLION. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES. IT CURRENTLY REQUIRES US TO DEDICATE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO
DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH FLOW TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPANSION EFFORTS, DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARTNERS AND OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES. ADDITIONALLY, IT COULD: 

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS; 

LIMIT OUR ABILITY IN THE FUTURE TO UNDERTAKE REFINANCINGS OF OUR DEBT OR OBTAIN FINANCING FOR EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS
PURPOSES ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL; OR 

AFFECT ADVERSELY OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY UNDER ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 
 17 

BECAUSE WE MUST DISTRIBUTE 90 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME (OTHER THAN NET CAPITAL GAIN) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, WE DEPEND UPON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL FOR FUTURE GROWTH. IF OUR CASH FLOW AND WORKING CAPITAL WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXPENDITURES OR SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS
THROUGH: 

SALES OF OUR EQUITY; 

THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL PERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS BY HOST LP; OR 

THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. WE CANNOT
MAKE ANY ASSURANCES TO YOU THAT ANY OF THESE SOURCES OF FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO US OR, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD BE ON TERMS THAT WE WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE OR IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT FOR US TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS OR FULFILL OUR BUSINESS PLAN.
 OUR REVENUES AND THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE LODGING INDUSTRY. THE LODGING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN TRAVEL PATTERNS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVELERS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS
INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY, THE EFFECT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AND TERROR ALERTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL AS OTHER GEOPOLITICAL DISTURBANCES. WHILE OUR OPERATIONS HAVE IMPROVED OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, CHANGES IN
TRAVEL PATTERNS OF BOTH BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVELERS MAY CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR THE INDUSTRY OVER THE LONG-TERM AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND ANY FORECAST WE MAKE, MAY BE AFFECTED AND CAN CHANGE BASED ON THE
FOLLOWING RISKS: 

CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE; 

CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVEL PATTERNS; 

LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS SUCH AS AN OVERSUPPLY OF HOTEL ROOMS OR A REDUCTION IN LODGING DEMAND; 

THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR HOTELS TO CONSUMERS RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITION; 

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGERS OF OUR HOTELS; 

CHANGES IN ROOM RATES AND INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS DUE TO INFLATION AND OTHER FACTORS; 

UNIONIZATION OF THE LABOR FORCE AT OUR HOTELS; AND 

DECLINES IN LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, REDUCING OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND CREATING DEFAULT RISKS. THE DOCUMENTS GOVERNING THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING SENIOR NOTES AND OUR CREDIT FACILITY CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THESE COVENANTS WILL RESTRICT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR
ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO: 

CONDUCT ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS OR CONSOLIDATIONS UNLESS THE SUCCESSOR ENTITY IN SUCH TRANSACTION ASSUMES OUR INDEBTEDNESS; 

INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AND WITHOUT SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL METRICS; 

CREATE LIENS SECURING INDEBTEDNESS, UNLESS EFFECTIVE PROVISION IS MADE TO SECURE OUR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS BY SUCH LIENS; 

SELL ASSETS WITHOUT USING THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH SALES FOR CERTAIN PERMITTED USES OR TO MAKE AN OFFER TO REPAY OR REPURCHASE OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS;

MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN THRESHOLDS; 

RAISE CAPITAL; 
 18 

PAY DIVIDENDS WITHOUT SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL METRICS; AND 

CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES OTHER THAN ON AN ARMS LENGTH BASIS AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WITHOUT OBTAINING OPINIONS AS TO THE FAIRNESS OF SUCH
TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRE US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE TESTS. IF WE FAIL TO MEET SUCH TESTS, THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE(S), THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE DOCUMENTS GOVERNING OUR OTHER DEBT (INCLUDING OUR MORTGAGE DEBT) WILL REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN CONDUCTING OUR
OPERATIONS AND WILL LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE IN OUR LONG-TERM BEST INTEREST. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS COULD RESULT IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT THAT, IF NOT CURED OR WAIVED, COULD RESULT IN THE
ACCELERATION OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR DEBT. FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE DOCUMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, SEE MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION . OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS MAY BE LIMITED OR PROHIBITED BY THE TERMS OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS.
 WE ARE, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME, PARTY TO AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS THAT RESTRICT OR PREVENT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON OUR
CLASSES AND SERIES OF CAPITAL STOCK. UNDER THE TERMS OF HOST LP S CREDIT FACILITY AND SENIOR NOTES INDENTURE, DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOST BY HOST LP, UPON WHICH HOST DEPENDS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE CASH NECESSARY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ARE PERMITTED ONLY
TO THE EXTENT THAT, AT THE TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTION, HOST LP CAN SATISFY CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANT TESTS (CONCERNING LEVERAGE, FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE AND UNSECURED INTEREST COVERAGE) AND MEET OTHER REQUIREMENTS. FORECLOSURE ON OUR MORTGAGE DEBT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, 16 OF OUR HOTELS AND ASSETS RELATED THERETO ARE SUBJECT TO MORTGAGES IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 1.4 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THE DEBT IS GENERALLY NON-RECOURSE TO US, IF THESE
HOTELS DO NOT PRODUCE ADEQUATE CASH FLOW TO SERVICE THE DEBT SECURED BY SUCH MORTGAGES, THE MORTGAGE LENDERS COULD FORECLOSE ON THESE ASSETS. WE MAY OPT TO ALLOW SUCH FORECLOSURE TO OCCUR RATHER THAN MAKE THE NECESSARY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WITH FUNDS
FROM OTHER SOURCES. HOWEVER, HOST LP S SENIOR NOTES INDENTURE AND CREDIT FACILITY CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, WHICH, DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF SECURED DEBT OF WHICH IS DEFAULTED, COULD CAUSE A CROSS-DEFAULT UNDER BOTH OF THESE
AGREEMENTS. HOST LP S CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH CONTAINS A MORE RESTRICTIVE CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION THAN THE SENIOR NOTES INDENTURE, PROVIDES THAT A CREDIT FACILITY DEFAULT OCCURS IN THE EVENT HOST LP DEFAULTS ON NON-RECOURSE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS
IN EXCESS OF 1 OF ITS TOTAL ASSETS (USING UNDEPRECIATED REAL ESTATE VALUES) OR DEFAULTS ON OTHER INDEBTEDNESS IN EXCESS OF 50 MILLION. FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS, PERMITTING A FORECLOSURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS
PROSPECTS. AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD INCREASE OUR INTEREST COSTS ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND ANY VARIABLE RATE DEBT WE INCUR AND COULD
ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR SELL ASSETS. UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE
BASED ON FLOATING RATES. TO THE EXTENT WE DRAW ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WILL REDUCE OUR CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING INVESTMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO. FURTHER, RISING INTEREST RATES COULD LIMIT
OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT WHEN IT MATURES AND INCREASE INTEREST COSTS ON ANY DEBT THAT IS REFINANCED. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CAPS, FLOORS AND OTHER INTEREST RATE HEDGING CONTRACTS.
WHILE THESE AGREEMENTS MAY LESSEN THE IMPACT OF RISING INTEREST RATES, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO THE RISK THAT OTHER PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT PERFORM OR THAT THE AGREEMENTS WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES
COULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT THIRD PARTIES ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR OUR ASSETS, THEREBY LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. 
 19 

RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL. BOTH OUR SENIOR NOTES AND OUR PREFERRED STOCK ARE RATED BY MOODY S INVESTORS SERVICE, STANDARD POOR S AND FITCH RATINGS. THESE
INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES MAY ELECT TO DOWNGRADE THEIR RATINGS ON OUR SENIOR NOTES AND OUR PREFERRED STOCK AT ANY TIME. SUCH DOWNGRADES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL. THE ACQUISITION CONTRACTS RELATING TO SOME HOTELS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR REFINANCE THOSE HOTELS. FOR REASONS RELATING TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF THE FORMER AND CURRENT OWNERS OF FIVE HOTELS, WE HAVE AGREED TO RESTRICTIONS ON
SELLING THE HOTELS, OR REPAYING OR REFINANCING THE MORTGAGE DEBT FOR VARYING PERIODS DEPENDING ON THE HOTEL. MOST OF THESE AGREEMENTS WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED NOT TO SELL MORE THAN 50 OF THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATED VALUE
ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PORTFOLIO OF 11 ADDITIONAL HOTELS, OR TO TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION AND ALLOCATION OF GAIN TO THE FORMER OWNERS OF SUCH HOTELS FOR FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX PURPOSES PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009. AS
A RESULT, EVEN IF IT WERE IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO SELL THESE HOTELS OR REPAY OR OTHERWISE REDUCE THE LEVEL OF THE MORTGAGE DEBT ON SUCH HOTELS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY TO DO SO DURING THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCK-OUT PERIODS. IN SPECIFIED
CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY AGREE TO SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH FUTURE HOTEL ACQUISITIONS. OUR ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES MAY HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE
SEEK TO ACQUIRE LUXURY AND UPPER UPSCALE HOTEL PROPERTIES. WE MAY ACQUIRE PROPERTIES THROUGH VARIOUS STRUCTURES, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PORTFOLIOS, SINGLE ASSETS, JOINT VENTURES AND ACQUISITIONS OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE
SECURITIES OR ASSETS OF OTHER REITS OR SIMILAR REAL ESTATE ENTITIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL BE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF METHODS, INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM HOST EQUITY OFFERINGS, ISSUANCE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF
HOST LP, ADVANCES UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, THE INCURRENCE OR ASSUMPTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF ASSETS. RECENT DECLINES IN CREDIT MARKETS MAY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF PURCHASERS TO FINANCE HOTELS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
DISPOSITION STRATEGY AND OUR ABILITY TO USE PROCEEDS TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS. WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, BE IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING, ANALYZING AND NEGOTIATING POSSIBLE ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.
WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN CONSUMMATING FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR THAT WE WILL REALIZE THE BENEFITS THAT WE ANTICIPATE FROM THE ACQUISITIONS THAT WE CONSUMMATE. OUR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE ONE OR MORE
ACQUISITIONS ON SUCH TERMS, OR OUR FAILURE TO REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS FROM ONE OR MORE ACQUISITIONS, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF
OUR INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE AND OUR ASSUMPTION OF UNFORESEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. WE MAY ACQUIRE HOTEL
PROPERTIES THROUGH JOINT VENTURES WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT COULD RESULT IN CONFLICTS. WE HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN A
EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE, WHICH OWNS TEN HOTELS IN EUROPE. WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, INVEST AS A CO-VENTURER IN OTHER ENTITIES HOLDING HOTEL PROPERTIES INSTEAD OF PURCHASING HOTEL PROPERTIES DIRECTLY. CO-VENTURERS OFTEN SHARE CONTROL OVER THE
OPERATION OF A JOINT VENTURE. ACTIONS BY A CO-VENTURER COULD SUBJECT THE ASSETS TO ADDITIONAL RISK AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: 

OUR CO-VENTURER IN AN INVESTMENT MIGHT HAVE ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR, OR THE JOINT VENTURE S, INTERESTS OR GOALS;
OR 

OUR CO-VENTURER MAY BE IN A POSITION TO TAKE ACTION CONTRARY TO OUR INSTRUCTIONS OR REQUESTS OR CONTRARY TO OUR POLICIES OR OBJECTIVES.
 ALTHOUGH WE GENERALLY WILL SEEK TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CONTROL OF ANY JOINT VENTURE TO PERMIT OUR OBJECTIVES TO BE
ACHIEVED, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS. 
 20 

THE EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS INTO NEW MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL EXPOSE US TO RISKS RELATING TO OWNING
HOTELS IN THOSE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO EXPAND OUR PRESENCE INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.
WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY MANAGING OUR EXPANSION INTO NEW GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WHERE WE HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY, AN ABSENCE OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREA, OR UNFAMILIARITY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND
PERMITTING PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS. THROUGH THE EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE, WE HAVE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN TEN HOTELS IN FIVE FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO OWN SEVEN OTHER HOTELS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE RISKS INHERENT
IN CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, WHICH INCLUDE: 

EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND PRACTICES; 

TAX LAWS WHICH MAY PROVIDE FOR RATES THAT EXCEED THOSE OF THE U.S. AND WHICH MAY PROVIDE THAT OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER
RESTRICTIONS; 

COMPLIANCE WITH AND UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR MONETARY POLICY; 

THE WILLINGNESS OF DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN LENDERS TO PROVIDE FINANCING AND CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY, COST AND TERMS OF SUCH FINANCING; 

ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOCAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS; 

THE POTENTIAL FOR UNINSURED CASUALTY AND OTHER LOSSES; 

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND/OR THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS REGARDING THE INCURRENCE OF DEBTS; AND 

DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLYING WITH U.S. RULES GOVERNING REITS WHILE OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY. ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALL OF THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF OUR JOINT VENTURES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE FOREIGN HOTELS INTO OUR ORGANIZATION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND THE VALUE OF HOST COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE. EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
FINANCIAL RESULTS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION OF HOST S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD
AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. HOST EXPECTS TO GENERATE AN INCREASING PORTION OF ITS REVENUE AND ITS EXPENSES IN SUCH FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, THE MEXICAN PESO, THE BRITISH POUND, THE POLISH
ZLOTY AND THE CHILEAN PESO. ALTHOUGH HOST MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THESE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS, IF ENTERED INTO,
WILL NOT ELIMINATE THAT RISK ENTIRELY. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT HOST IS UNABLE TO MATCH REVENUE RECEIVED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WITH COSTS PAID IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HOST S
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE HOST S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN US DOLLARS, IF HOST GENERATES REVENUES OR EARNINGS IN OTHER CURRENCIES THE TRANSLATION OF THOSE RESULTS INTO US DOLLARS
CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THOSE REVENUES OR EARNINGS. WE DO NOT CONTROL OUR HOTEL OPERATIONS AND WE ARE
DEPENDENT ON THE MANAGERS OF OUR HOTELS. SINCE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS RESTRICT REITS AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES FROM OPERATING OR MANAGING
A HOTEL, WE DO NOT OPERATE OR MANAGE OUR HOTELS. INSTEAD, WE LEASE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR HOTELS TO SUBSIDIARIES WHICH QUALIFY AS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES UNDER APPLICABLE REIT LAWS, AND OUR TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES RETAIN
THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS TO OPERATE OUR HOTELS PURSUANT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. OUR CASH FLOW FROM THE HOTELS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR MANAGERS FAIL TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES AND AMENITIES OR IF THEY OR THEIR AFFILIATES FAIL TO 
 
 21 

MAINTAIN A QUALITY BRAND NAME. WHILE OUR TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES MONITOR THE HOTEL MANAGERS PERFORMANCE, WE HAVE LIMITED RECOURSE UNDER OUR
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS IF WE BELIEVE THAT THE HOTEL MANAGERS ARE NOT PERFORMING ADEQUATELY. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE HAD, AND CONTINUE TO HAVE, DIFFERENCES WITH THE MANAGERS OF OUR HOTELS OVER THEIR PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE
TERMS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. WE GENERALLY RESOLVE ISSUES WITH OUR MANAGERS THROUGH DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH SATISFACTORY RESULTS THROUGH DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS, WE MAY CHOOSE TO LITIGATE THE
DISPUTE OR SUBMIT THE MATTER TO THIRD-PARTY DISPUTE RESOLUTION. FAILURE BY OUR HOTEL MANAGERS TO FULLY PERFORM THE DUTIES AGREED TO IN OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR HOTEL MANAGERS OR
THEIR AFFILIATES MANAGE, AND IN SOME CASES OWN OR HAVE INVESTED IN, HOTELS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR HOTELS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. AS A RESULT, OUR HOTEL MANAGERS HAVE IN THE PAST MADE AND MAY IN THE FUTURE MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING
COMPETING LODGING FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT OR WOULD NOT BE IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF HOTEL
PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY WITH HOTELS THAT EMPLOY UNIONIZED LABOR. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS
TO OPERATE OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES. OUR THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIRING AND MAINTAINING THE LABOR FORCE AT EACH OF OUR HOTELS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT DIRECTLY EMPLOY OR MANAGE THE LABOR FORCE AT OUR HOTELS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO MANY OF THE
COSTS AND RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HOTEL LABOR FORCE, PARTICULARLY THOSE HOTELS WITH UNIONIZED LABOR. FROM TIME TO TIME, HOTEL OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED THROUGH STRIKES, LOCKOUTS, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS OR OTHER NEGATIVE ACTIONS AND
PUBLICITY. WE MAY ALSO INCUR INCREASED LEGAL COSTS AND INDIRECT LABOR COSTS AS A RESULT OF CONTRACT DISPUTES OR OTHER EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY, HOTELS WHERE OUR MANAGERS HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES (APPROXIMATELY 21 OF OUR
CURRENT PORTFOLIO, BY REVENUES) ARE MORE HIGHLY AFFECTED BY LABOR FORCE ACTIVITIES THAN OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE RESOLUTION OF LABOR DISPUTES OR RE-NEGOTIATED LABOR CONTRACTS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED LABOR COSTS, EITHER BY INCREASES IN WAGES OR
BENEFITS OR BY CHANGES IN WORK RULES THAT RAISE HOTEL OPERATING COSTS. FURTHERMORE, LABOR AGREEMENTS MAY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF OUR MANAGERS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF HOTEL WORKFORCES DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BECAUSE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE MANAGERS OF OUR HOTELS AND LABOR UNIONS. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS. OUR
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS COULD IMPAIR THE SALE OR FINANCING OF OUR HOTELS. UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, WE GENERALLY MAY
NOT SELL, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER OUR HOTELS UNLESS THE TRANSFEREE IS NOT A COMPETITOR OF THE MANAGER AND THE TRANSFEREE ASSUMES THE RELATED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND MEETS SPECIFIED OTHER CONDITIONS. OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OR SELL OUR
PROPERTIES, DEPENDING UPON THE STRUCTURE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, MAY REQUIRE THE MANAGER S CONSENT. IF THE MANAGER DOES NOT CONSENT TO SUCH SALE OR FINANCING, WE MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM TAKING ACTIONS IN OUR BEST INTEREST WITHOUT BREACHING THE
APPLICABLE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. OUR HOTELS HAVE AN ONGOING NEED FOR RENOVATIONS AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE
IN THE MARKETPLACE, MAINTAIN BRAND STANDARDS OR TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS. THE TIMING AND COSTS OF SUCH RENOVATIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS MAY RESULT IN REDUCED OPERATING PERFORMANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION AND MAY NOT IMPROVE THE RETURN ON
THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REQUIRED BY OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS OR AGREEMENTS WITH OUR HOTEL MANAGERS, WE WILL
NEED TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER HOTELS, TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR HOTELS AND TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE TIMING OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS CAN AFFECT HOTEL PERFORMANCE PARTICULARLY IF
THE IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRE CLOSURES OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ROOMS OR THE CLOSURE OF OTHER FEATURES OF THE HOTELS SUCH AS BALLROOMS, MEETING SPACE AND RESTAURANTS. THESE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND ARE
SUBJECT TO COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE WE DEPEND ON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO INVEST AND IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR PROPERTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH BRAND STANDARDS SET BY OUR MANAGERS, THE
MANAGER MAY TERMINATE THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. MOREOVER, WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SIGNIFICANT, OR ANY, IMPROVEMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HOTELS IN WHICH WE MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. 
 22 

OUR EXPENSES MAY NOT DECREASE IF OUR REVENUE DECREASES. MANY OF THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING AND OPERATING HOTELS, SUCH AS DEBT PAYMENTS, PROPERTY TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, AND EMPLOYEE WAGES AND
BENEFITS, ARE RELATIVELY INFLEXIBLE AND DO NOT NECESSARILY DECREASE IN TANDEM WITH A REDUCTION IN REVENUE AT THE HOTELS. OUR EXPENSES WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY INFLATIONARY INCREASES, AND CERTAIN COSTS, SUCH AS WAGES, BENEFITS AND INSURANCE, MAY
EXCEED THE RATE OF INFLATION IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR MANAGERS MAY BE UNABLE TO OFFSET ANY SUCH INCREASED EXPENSES WITH HIGHER ROOM RATES. ANY OF OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE OPERATING COSTS OR FAILURE TO MAKE SCHEDULED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES. OUR GROUND LEASE PAYMENTS MAY INCREASE FASTER THAN THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE ON
THE HOTELS SITUATED ON THE LEASED PROPERTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, 37 OF OUR HOTELS ARE SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY GROUND LEASES
(ENCUMBERING ALL OR A PORTION OF THE HOTEL). THESE GROUND LEASES GENERALLY REQUIRE PERIODIC INCREASES IN GROUND RENT PAYMENTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN BASED ON ECONOMIC INDICATORS SUCH AS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. OUR ABILITY TO PAY GROUND RENTAL COULD BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR REVENUES DO NOT INCREASE AT THE SAME OR A GREATER RATE THAN THE INCREASES IN RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE GROUND LEASES. IN ADDITION, IF WE WERE TO SELL A HOTEL ENCUMBERED BY A GROUND LEASE, THE BUYER WOULD
HAVE TO ASSUME THE GROUND LEASE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LOWER SALES PRICE. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL PROPERTIES BECAUSE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE
INHERENTLY ILLIQUID. REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES GENERALLY CANNOT BE SOLD QUICKLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO VARY OUR PORTFOLIO
PROMPTLY IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS. THE INABILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO CHANGES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE
LIMITATIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS APPLICABLE TO REITS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THE FULL ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM A SALE OF OUR ASSETS. APPLICABLE REIT LAWS MAY RESTRICT CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. AS A REIT WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON OUR
INCOME, ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES. BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY APPLICABLE REIT LAWS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE USES OF REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR SALE OF TIMESHARE OR
CONDOMINIUM UNITS. DUE TO THESE RESTRICTIONS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONDUCT CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE, IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES. OUR TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES ARE TAXABLE AS REGULAR C
CORPORATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND, IF APPLICABLE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAXATION ON THEIR TAXABLE INCOME AT APPLICABLE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, UNDER REIT LAWS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF ASSETS HELD BY A REIT S
TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES MAY NOT EXCEED 20 OF THE VALUE OF ALL OF THE REIT S ASSETS. WE DEPEND ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. NONE OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND WE DO NOT
MAINTAIN KEY PERSON LIFE INSURANCE FOR ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE KEY PERSONNEL WILL REMAIN EMPLOYED BY US. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD FIND REPLACEMENTS FOR THESE KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF THEIR SERVICES
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS OR CHANGES IN TERROR ALERT LEVELS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
US. PREVIOUS TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SUBSEQUENT TERRORIST ALERTS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE TRAVEL AND HOSPITALITY
INDUSTRIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE IMPACT THAT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE COULD HAVE ON DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR IS INDETERMINABLE. 
 
 23 

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH ATTACKS OR THE THREAT OF SUCH ATTACKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS, OUR
ABILITY TO INSURE OUR PROPERTIES AND/OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS A WHOLE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY UNDER OUR
EXISTING TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY SOME TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, AND FEDERAL TERRORISM LEGISLATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN TERRORISM INSURANCE IN ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OR AT ACCEPTABLE PREMIUM LEVELS IN THE FUTURE.
 WE OBTAIN TERRORISM INSURANCE AS PART OF OUR ALL-RISK PROPERTY INSURANCE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OUR GENERAL LIABILITY AND DIRECTORS 
AND OFFICERS COVERAGES. HOWEVER, OUR ALL-RISK POLICIES HAVE LIMITATIONS SUCH AS PER OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND SUBLIMITS WHICH MIGHT HAVE TO BE SHARED PROPORTIONALLY ACROSS PARTICIPATING HOTELS UNDER CERTAIN LOSS SCENARIOS. ALSO, ALL-RISK INSURERS
ONLY HAVE TO PROVIDE TERRORISM COVERAGE TO THE EXTENT MANDATED BY THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT (TRIPRA) EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 26, 2007. TRIPRA REPLACED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT (TRIEA) WHICH WAS SET TO
EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2007. TRIPRA PROVIDES THE SAME COVERAGE AS ITS PREDECESSOR, WITH ONE MAJOR IMPROVEMENT; THE DEFINITION OF A CERTIFIED CLAIM (A CLAIM THAT TRIGGERS COVERAGE UNDER THE PROGRAM). TRIEA DEFINED CERTIFIED ACTS
OF TERRORISM AS ONE WHICH IS COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR INTERESTS, LEAVING UNCOVERED ANY TERRORISTIC ACT COMMITTED BY UNITED STATES PERSONS OR INTERESTS; TRIPRA ELIMINATES THIS DISTINCTION AND THIS COVERAGE GAP. PROPERTY
DAMAGE RELATED TO WAR AND TO NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL INCIDENTS IS EXCLUDED UNDER OUR POLICIES. WHILE TRIPRA WILL REIMBURSE INSURERS FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL PERILS, TRIPRA DOES NOT REQUIRE INSURERS TO OFFER
COVERAGE FOR THESE PERILS AND, TO DATE, INSURERS ARE NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE, EVEN WITH GOVERNMENT REINSURANCE. HOST HAS CREATED A WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES A POLICY OF NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL OR
RADIOLOGICAL (NBCR) COVERAGE TO US, AND HAS THE SAME ABILITY TO APPLY TO THE US TREASURY FOR REIMBURSEMENT, AS PROVIDED FOR IN TRIPRA, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE SAME DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS AS OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES. THIS APPLIES
TO PROPERTY INSURANCE ONLY, AND NOT TO GENERAL LIABILITY OR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE, AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER ANY OR ALL OF OUR NCBR LOSSES UNDER THIS PROGRAM. SOME POTENTIAL LOSSES ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE, OR OUR HOTEL MANAGERS, CARRY COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND OTHER RISKS WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF OUR HOTELS AND OTHER PROPERTIES. THESE POLICIES OFFER COVERAGE FEATURES AND
INSURED LIMITS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE CUSTOMARY FOR SIMILAR TYPE PROPERTIES. GENERALLY, OUR ALL-RISK PROPERTY POLICIES PROVIDE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE ON A PER OCCURRENCE BASIS AND THAT, FOR EACH OCCURRENCE, HAS AN OVERALL LIMIT, AS WELL
AS VARIOUS SUB-LIMITS, ON THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS WE CAN RECEIVE. SUB-LIMITS EXIST FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF CLAIMS SUCH AS SERVICE INTERRUPTION, ABATEMENT, EXPEDITING COSTS, LANDSCAPING REPLACEMENT AND NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES AND
HURRICANES AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THESE SUB-LIMITS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THE OVERALL COVERAGE LIMIT. IN THIS REGARD, HOTELS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA HAVE IN THE PAST AND CONTINUE TO
BE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE FROM EARTHQUAKES AND HURRICANES. RECOVERY UNDER THE APPLICABLE POLICIES, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL DEDUCTIBLES AND COMPLEX CALCULATIONS OF LOST BUSINESS INCOME. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS
INSURANCE, WHERE MAINTAINED, WILL FULLY FUND THE RE-BUILDING OR RESTORATION OF A HOTEL IMPACTED BY AN EARTHQUAKE, HURRICANE OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, OR THE INCOME LOST AS A RESULT OF THE DAMAGE. OUR PROPERTY POLICIES ALSO PROVIDE THAT ALL OF THE
CLAIMS FROM EACH OF OUR PROPERTIES RESULTING FROM A PARTICULAR INSURABLE EVENT MUST BE COMBINED TOGETHER FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING WHETHER THE AGGREGATE LIMITS AND SUB-LIMITS CONTAINED IN OUR POLICIES HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED AND, IN THE CASE OF ONE OF
OUR HOTELS WHERE THE MANAGER PROVIDES THIS COVERAGE, ANY SUCH CLAIMS WILL ALSO BE COMBINED WITH THE CLAIMS OF OTHER OWNERS PARTICIPATING IN THE MANAGERS PROGRAM FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. THEREFORE, IF AN INSURABLE EVENT OCCURS THAT AFFECTS MORE
THAN ONE OF OUR HOTELS, OR, IN THE CASE OF HOTELS WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY, AFFECTS HOTELS OWNED BY OTHERS, THE CLAIMS FROM EACH AFFECTED HOTEL WILL BE ADDED TOGETHER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AGGREGATE LIMIT OR
SUB-LIMITS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CLAIM, HAVE BEEN REACHED AND EACH AFFECTED HOTEL MAY ONLY RECEIVE A PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE POLICY IF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LOSS EXCEEDS THE AGGREGATE LIMITS

24 

AVAILABLE. WE MAY INCUR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS AND, AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE COMPLETE COVERAGE FOR RISKS THAT AFFECT
MULTIPLE PROPERTIES SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES OR CERTAIN TYPES OF TERRORISM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER RISKS, SUCH AS SOME
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, THAT MAY BE DEEMED TO FALL COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE GENERAL COVERAGE LIMITS OF OUR POLICIES OR MAY BE UNINSURABLE OR MAY BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO JUSTIFY COVERAGE. WE MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES WITH AN INSURANCE PROVIDER REGARDING WHETHER IT WILL PAY A PARTICULAR CLAIM THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE COVERED UNDER OUR
POLICY. SHOULD A LOSS IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS OR AN UNINSURED LOSS OCCUR, OR SHOULD WE BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING COVERAGE FROM AN INSURANCE CARRIER, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR A PART OF THE CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN A PROPERTY, AS WELL AS THE
ANTICIPATED FUTURE REVENUE FROM THE HOTEL. IN THAT EVENT, WE MIGHT NEVERTHELESS REMAIN OBLIGATED FOR ANY MORTGAGE DEBT OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE PROPERTY. LITIGATION JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE ARE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING EACH OF THESE CLAIMS. CURRENTLY, NONE OF THESE CLAIMS SEEKS RELIEF THAT, IF GRANTED, WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, WE COULD BECOME THE SUBJECT OF CLAIMS BY THE OPERATORS OF OUR HOTELS, INDIVIDUALS OR COMPANIES WHO USE OUR HOTELS, OUR INVESTORS, OR REGULATING ENTITIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON
OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PERFORMANCE. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED FROM STARWOOD. 
 ASSETS AND ENTITIES THAT WE ACQUIRED FROM STARWOOD MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNKNOWN OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR WHICH WE MAY HAVE NO RECOURSE,
OR ONLY LIMITED RECOURSE, AGAINST STARWOOD. IN GENERAL, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY STARWOOD UNDER THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT DID NOT SURVIVE THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTIONS. WHILE STARWOOD IS REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY US WITH RESPECT
TO BREACHES OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT DID SURVIVE THE CLOSING, SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS LIMITED AND SUBJECT TO VARIOUS MATERIALITY THRESHOLDS, A SIGNIFICANT DEDUCTIBLE AND AN AGGREGATE CAP ON LOSSES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL RECOVER ANY AMOUNTS WITH RESPECT TO LOSSES DUE TO BREACHES BY STARWOOD OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED
HOTELS AND ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR EXPECTATIONS, PLUS WE MAY EXPERIENCE OTHER UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE EFFECTS, ALL OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, EXPENSES, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FINALLY, THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND STARWOOD PROVIDES THAT STARWOOD WILL RETAIN CERTAIN SPECIFIED LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE ASSETS
AND ENTITIES ACQUIRED BY US. WHILE STARWOOD IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY ALL LOSSES AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATING TO SUCH RETAINED LIABILITIES WITHOUT REGARD TO SURVIVAL LIMITATIONS, MATERIALITY THRESHOLDS, THE DEDUCTIBLE OR CAP ON LOSSES, THERE
CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT WILL NOT REQUIRE US TO INCUR LOSSES OR OTHER EXPENSES AS WELL. IF WE WERE TO ACQUIRE OTHER HOTEL
PORTFOLIOS IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS. ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE POSSIBLE AND CAN BE COSTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PROPERTIES COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. UNIDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES COULD ARISE,
HOWEVER, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PERFORMANCE. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT MAY REQUIRE A CURRENT OR PREVIOUS OWNER OR OPERATOR OF REAL
ESTATE TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT RELEASES AT THE PROPERTY. THE OWNER OR OPERATOR MAY HAVE TO PAY A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR THIRD PARTIES FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION
COSTS 
 
 25 

INCURRED BY THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTAMINATION. THESE LAWS TYPICALLY IMPOSE CLEAN-UP RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE
OWNER OR OPERATOR KNEW OF OR CAUSED THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTAMINANTS. EVEN IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTAMINATION, EACH PERSON COVERED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE CLEAN-UP COSTS
INCURRED. IN ADDITION, THIRD PARTIES MAY SUE THE OWNER OR OPERATOR OF A SITE FOR DAMAGES AND COSTS RESULTING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION EMANATING FROM THAT SITE. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ALSO GOVERN THE PRESENCE, MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL OF ASBESTOS.
THESE LAWS REQUIRE THAT OWNERS OR OPERATORS OF BUILDINGS CONTAINING ASBESTOS PROPERLY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN THE ASBESTOS, THAT THEY NOTIFY AND TRAIN THOSE WHO MAY COME INTO CONTACT WITH ASBESTOS AND THAT THEY UNDERTAKE SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS, INCLUDING
REMOVAL OR OTHER ABATEMENT, IF ASBESTOS WOULD BE DISTURBED DURING RENOVATION OR DEMOLITION OF A BUILDING. THESE LAWS MAY IMPOSE FINES AND PENALTIES ON BUILDING OWNERS OR OPERATORS WHO FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY ALLOW THIRD
PARTIES TO SEEK RECOVERY FROM OWNERS OR OPERATORS FOR PERSONAL INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FIBERS. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS CAN BE COSTLY. OUR HOTELS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF REGULATION, INCLUDING TITLE III OF THE AMERICANS WITH
DISABILITIES ACT, BUILDING CODES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO FIRE SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE REGULATIONS MAY BE CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME, OR NEW REGULATIONS ADOPTED,
RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL LITIGATION. ANY INCREASED COSTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK MAY ALSO BE LIMITED OR PROHIBITED BY THE TERMS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK. UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR OUTSTANDING CLASS E PREFERRED STOCK, WE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK UNLESS CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS HAVE
BEEN PAID (OR FUNDS FOR PAYMENT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR PAYMENT) ON SUCH CLASS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS THAT ACCRUE ON THE CLASS E PREFERRED STOCK EACH QUARTER IS APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION. IN THE EVENT THAT WE FAIL TO PAY THE ACCRUED DIVIDENDS ON OUR CLASS E PREFERRED STOCK FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING ANY RESTRICTION ON PAYING SUCH DIVIDENDS
UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE), DIVIDENDS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE ON SUCH PREFERRED STOCK AND WE WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM PAYING ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK UNTIL ALL SUCH ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS ON OUR CLASS
E PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID (OR FUNDS FOR SUCH PAYMENT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE). RISKS OF OWNERSHIP OF HOST S COMMON STOCK THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE ACQUISITION OF HOST COMMON STOCK AND CHANGES IN CONTROL. HOST S CHARTER AND BYLAWS, THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF HOST LP, HOST S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW CONTAIN A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS, THE EXERCISE OF WHICH COULD DELAY,
DEFER OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OR HOST LP UNIT HOLDERS OR OTHERWISE BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF HOST S STOCK. TO MAINTAIN HOST S QUALIFICATION AS A REIT FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES, NOT MORE THAN 50 IN VALUE OF HOST S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK MAY BE OWNED IN THE LAST HALF OF THE TAXABLE YEAR, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY FIVE OR FEWER INDIVIDUALS, WHICH, AS DEFINED IN THE CODE, MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN
ENTITIES. BECAUSE SUCH OWNERSHIP COULD JEOPARDIZE HOST S QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, A PERSON CANNOT OWN, DIRECTLY OR BY ATTRIBUTION, 10 OR MORE OF AN INTEREST IN A HOST LESSEE, NOR CAN A HOST LESSEE OF ANY PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH HOST IS A PARTNER
OWN, DIRECTLY OR BY ATTRIBUTION, 10 OR MORE OF HOST S SHARES, IN EACH CASE UNLESS EXEMPTED BY HOST S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
 26 

HOST S CHARTER PROHIBITS OWNERSHIP, DIRECTLY OR BY VIRTUE OF THE ATTRIBUTION PROVISIONS OF THE CODE,
BY ANY PERSON OR PERSONS ACTING AS A GROUP, OF MORE THAN 9.8 IN VALUE OR NUMBER, WHICHEVER IS MORE RESTRICTIVE, OF SHARES OF HOST S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR ANY OTHER STOCK, EACH CONSIDERED AS A SEPARATE CLASS OR SERIES FOR
THIS PURPOSE. TOGETHER, THESE LIMITATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT. STOCK ACQUIRED OR HELD IN VIOLATION OF THE
OWNERSHIP LIMIT WILL BE TRANSFERRED AUTOMATICALLY TO A TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF A DESIGNATED CHARITABLE BENEFICIARY, AND THE PERSON WHO ACQUIRED THE STOCK IN VIOLATION OF THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY DISTRIBUTIONS THEREON, TO VOTE
THOSE SHARES OF STOCK OR TO RECEIVE ANY PROCEEDS FROM THE SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THE STOCK IN EXCESS OF THE LESSER OF THE PRICE PAID FOR THE STOCK OR THE AMOUNT REALIZED FROM THE SALE. A TRANSFER OF SHARES OF HOST S STOCK TO A PERSON WHO, AS A
RESULT OF THE TRANSFER, VIOLATES THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT MAY BE VOID UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AND, IN ANY EVENT, WOULD DENY THAT PERSON ANY OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF OWNING SHARES OF HOST S STOCK IN EXCESS OF THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT. THESE
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND OWNERSHIP WILL NOT APPLY IF HOST S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINES THAT IT IS NO LONGER IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. 

REMOVAL OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS. HOST S CHARTER PROVIDES THAT, EXCEPT FOR ANY DIRECTORS WHO MAY BE ELECTED BY HOLDERS OF A CLASS OR
SERIES OF SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, DIRECTORS MAY BE REMOVED ONLY FOR CAUSE AND ONLY BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST FOR THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.
VACANCIES ON HOST S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY BE FILLED BY THE CONCURRING VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING DIRECTORS (EXCEPT THAT A VACANCY RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS MUST BE FILLED BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ENTIRE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS) AND, IN THE CASE OF A VACANCY RESULTING FROM THE REMOVAL OF A DIRECTOR BY THE STOCKHOLDERS, BY AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. 

PREFERRED SHARES; CLASSIFICATION OR RECLASSIFICATION OF UNISSUED SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. HOST S
CHARTER PROVIDES THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK OF ALL CLASSES THAT WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE IS 800,000,000, INITIALLY CONSISTING OF 750,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND 50,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK. HOST S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY, WITHOUT A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS, TO CLASSIFY OR RECLASSIFY ANY UNISSUED SHARES OF STOCK, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK INTO PREFERRED STOCK OR VICE VERSA, AND TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF ANY PREFERRED OR OTHER
CLASS OR SERIES OF SHARES TO BE ISSUED. BECAUSE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE POWER TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF ADDITIONAL CLASSES OR SERIES OF STOCK WITHOUT A STOCKHOLDER VOTE, HOST S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY GIVE THE HOLDERS OF
ANY CLASS OR SERIES OF STOCK PREFERENCES, POWERS AND RIGHTS, INCLUDING VOTING RIGHTS, SENIOR TO THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF EXISTING STOCK. 

CONSENT RIGHTS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS. UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF HOST LP, WE GENERALLY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MERGE OR
CONSOLIDATE WITH ANOTHER ENTITY WITH THE CONSENT OF PARTNERS HOLDING LIMITED PARTNER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS THAT ARE MORE THAN 50 OF THE AGGREGATE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE OUTSTANDING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE MERGER OR
CONSOLIDATION, INCLUDING ANY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS HELD BY US, AS LONG AS THE HOLDERS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS EITHER RECEIVE OR HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE SAME CONSIDERATION AS HOST S STOCKHOLDERS. HOST, AS HOLDER OF A
MAJORITY OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF HOST LP, WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOTE. UNDER HOST S CHARTER, GENERALLY HOLDERS OF AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF HOST S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MUST APPROVE A MERGER OR
CONSOLIDATION. 

MARYLAND BUSINESS COMBINATION LAW. UNDER THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, SPECIFIED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING
SPECIFIED ISSUANCES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, BETWEEN A MARYLAND CORPORATION AND ANY PERSON WHO OWNS 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE CORPORATION S THEN OUTSTANDING SHARES, OR AN AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE OF THE CORPORATION WHO AT ANY TIME
DURING THE TWO YEAR PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE IN QUESTION OWNED 10 OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (EACH, AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER ), OR AN AFFILIATE OF THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, ARE PROHIBITED
FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER THE MOST RECENT DATE ON WHICH THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER BECOMES AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER. THEREAFTER, ANY OF THESE SPECIFIED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY 
 
 27 

80 OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST BY THE HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES AND BY TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST BY THE HOLDERS OF VOTING
SHARES OTHER THAN VOTING SHARES HELD BY AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER UNLESS, AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, THE CORPORATION S COMMON STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE A MINIMUM PRICE, AS DEFINED IN THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, FOR THEIR SHARES AND THE
CONSIDERATION IS RECEIVED IN CASH OR IN THE SAME FORM AS PREVIOUSLY PAID BY THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER. AS A MARYLAND CORPORATION, HOST IS SUBJECT TO THE MARYLAND BUSINESS COMBINATION STATUTE. 

MARYLAND CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION LAW. UNDER THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, CONTROL SHARES ACQUIRED IN A
 CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION HAVE NO VOTING RIGHTS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT APPROVED BY A VOTE OF TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST ON THE MATTER, EXCLUDING SHARES OWNED BY THE ACQUIROR, BY OFFICERS OR BY DIRECTORS WHO ARE EMPLOYEES
OF THE CORPORATION. CONTROL SHARES ARE VOTING SHARES WHICH, IF AGGREGATED WITH ALL OTHER VOTING SHARES PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED BY THE ACQUIROR OR OVER WHICH THE ACQUIROR IS ABLE TO EXERCISE OR DIRECT THE EXERCISE OF VOTING POWER (EXCEPT
SOLELY BY VIRTUE OF A REVOCABLE PROXY), WOULD ENTITLE THE ACQUIROR TO EXERCISE VOTING POWER IN ELECTING DIRECTORS WITHIN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RANGES OF VOTING POWER: (1) ONE-TENTH OR MORE BUT LESS THAN ONE-THIRD, (2) ONE-THIRD OR MORE BUT
LESS THAN A MAJORITY OR (3) A MAJORITY OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER. CONTROL SHARES DO NOT INCLUDE SHARES THE ACQUIRING PERSON IS THEN ENTITLED TO VOTE AS A RESULT OF HAVING PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. A CONTROL SHARE
ACQUISITION MEANS THE ACQUISITION OF CONTROL SHARES, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS. HOST IS SUBJECT TO THESE CONTROL SHARE PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW. 

MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, SHARE EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF HOST S ASSETS. UNDER HOST S CHARTER, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF ANY
OUTSTANDING CLASS OR SERIES OF CAPITAL STOCK, WE CAN MERGE WITH OR INTO ANOTHER ENTITY, CONSOLIDATE WITH ONE OR MORE OTHER ENTITIES, PARTICIPATE IN A SHARE EXCHANGE OR TRANSFER HOST S ASSETS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW IF APPROVED (1) BY HOST S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW AND (2) BY HOST S STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST ON THE MATTER,
EXCEPT THAT ANY MERGER OF HOST WITH OR INTO A TRUST ORGANIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHANGING HOST S FORM OF ORGANIZATION FROM A CORPORATION TO A TRUST REQUIRES ONLY THE APPROVAL OF HOST S STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING A MAJORITY OF ALL VOTES ENTITLED
TO BE CAST ON THE MERGER. UNDER THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, SPECIFIED MERGERS MAY BE APPROVED WITHOUT A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS AND A SHARE EXCHANGE IS ONLY REQUIRED TO BE APPROVED BY A MARYLAND CORPORATION BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS IF THE
CORPORATION IS THE SUCCESSOR ENTITY. HOST S VOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION ALSO WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL OF STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST ON THE MATTER. 

CERTAIN CHARTER AND BYLAW AMENDMENTS. HOST S CHARTER CONTAINS PROVISIONS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY OF
HOST S STOCK, FIXING THE SIZE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITHIN THE RANGE SET FORTH IN THE CHARTER, REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS AND THE FILLING OF VACANCIES, ALL OF WHICH MAY BE AMENDED ONLY BY A RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
APPROVED BY HOST S STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST ON THE MATTER. AS PERMITTED UNDER THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, HOST S BYLAWS PROVIDE THAT DIRECTORS HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO AMEND HOST S
BYLAWS. THESE PROVISIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO AMEND HOST S CHARTER AND BYLAWS TO ALTER THE PROVISIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN THAT COULD DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A TRANSACTION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL OR THE ACQUISITION OF HOST COMMON STOCK,
WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN. WE ADOPTED A STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN WHICH PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WHEN SPECIFIED EVENTS OCCUR,
HOST S STOCKHOLDERS, OTHER THAN AN ACQUIRING PERSON, WILL BE ENTITLED TO PURCHASE FROM US A NEWLY CREATED CLASS OR SERIES OF JUNIOR PREFERRED STOCK, SUBJECT TO HOST S OWNERSHIP LIMITS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
ARE TRIGGERED BY THE EARLIER TO OCCUR OF (1) TEN DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A PERSON OR GROUP ACTING IN CONCERT HAS ACQUIRED, OR OBTAINED THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 20 OR MORE OF HOST S
OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR (2) TEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF OR ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INTENTION TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER OR EXCHANGE OFFER, THE CONSUMMATION OF WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE ACQUIRING PERSON BECOMING THE
BENEFICIAL OWNER OF 20 OR MORE OF HOST S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. THE EXERCISE OF THE PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS WOULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO A PERSON OR GROUP THAT ATTEMPTS TO ACQUIRE US ON TERMS NOT APPROVED BY HOST S BOARD
OF DIRECTORS.

SHARES OF HOST S COMMON STOCK THAT ARE OR BECOME AVAILABLE FOR SALE COULD AFFECT THE SHARE PRICE. 
 SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF HOST S COMMON STOCK, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SALES COULD OCCUR, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET
PRICES FOR HOST S COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, HOLDERS OF UNITS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST OF HOST LP, WHOSE OP UNITS MAY BE REDEEMED, AT HOST S ELECTION, IN EXCHANGE FOR COMMON STOCK, WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THOSE SHARES FREELY, UNLESS
THE PERSON IS OUR AFFILIATE AND RESALE OF THE AFFILIATE S SHARES IS NOT COVERED BY AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT. FURTHER, A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF HOST S COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE ISSUED OR RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE
FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RESERVED FOR OPTIONS, OR PURSUANT TO SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF HOST COMMON STOCK OR SECURITIES (OTHER THAN OP UNITS) THAT HOST LP
HAS ISSUED THAT ARE EXCHANGEABLE FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 18.3 MILLION OP UNITS OUTSTANDING THAT ARE REDEEMABLE AND 1.1 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF TWO SERIES OF
EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR DEBENTURES OF HOST LP THAT COULD BECOME EXCHANGEABLE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY 49 MILLION SHARES OF HOST COMMON STOCK (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT OF
DIVIDENDS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS). MOREOVER, ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED BY HOST WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE FOR SALE IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS. WE CAN MAKE NO PREDICTION ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE ON
THE MARKET PRICE OF HOST COMMON STOCK. OUR EARNINGS AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS WILL AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF SHARES OF HOST S COMMON STOCK. 
 WE BELIEVE THAT THE MARKET VALUE OF A REIT S EQUITY SECURITIES IS BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE MARKET S PERCEPTION OF THE REIT S
GROWTH POTENTIAL AND ITS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS, WHETHER FROM OPERATIONS, SALES, ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT OR REFINANCINGS, AND IS SECONDARILY BASED UPON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. FOR THAT REASON, SHARES OF
HOST S COMMON STOCK MAY TRADE AT PRICES THAT ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE. TO THE EXTENT WE RETAIN OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, WORKING CAPITAL RESERVES OR OTHER PURPOSES RATHER THAN DISTRIBUTING THE
CASH FLOW TO STOCKHOLDERS, THESE RETAINED FUNDS, WHILE INCREASING THE VALUE OF OUR UNDERLYING ASSETS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET PRICE OF HOST S COMMON STOCK. OUR FAILURE TO MEET THE MARKET S EXPECTATION WITH REGARD TO FUTURE
EARNINGS AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD LIKELY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF HOST S COMMON STOCK. MARKET INTEREST RATES MAY AFFECT THE PRICE
OF SHARES OF HOST S COMMON STOCK. WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT INVESTORS CONSIDER IMPORTANT IN DECIDING WHETHER TO BUY
OR SELL SHARES OF A REIT IS THE DIVIDEND RATE ON THE SHARES, CONSIDERED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE PRICE OF THE SHARES, RELATIVE TO MARKET INTEREST RATES. IF MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF REIT SHARES MAY EXPECT A HIGHER
DIVIDEND RATE. THUS, HIGHER MARKET INTEREST RATES COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF HOST S SHARES TO DECREASE. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS
 TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, HOST AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90 OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL
GAIN, REGARDLESS OF AVAILABLE CASH OR OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS. TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR
STOCKHOLDERS WITH RESPECT TO EACH YEAR AT LEAST 90 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAIN. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SATISFY THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BUT DISTRIBUTE LESS THAN 100 OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND NET CAPITAL GAIN FOR THE
TAXABLE YEAR, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE CORPORATE INCOME TAX ON OUR UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME AND NET CAPITAL GAIN. IN ADDITION, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 4 NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX ON THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, BY WHICH DISTRIBUTIONS MADE
BY US WITH RESPECT TO THE CALENDAR YEAR ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF 85 OF OUR ORDINARY INCOME AND 95 OF OUR NET CAPITAL GAIN FOR THAT YEAR AND ANY UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM PRIOR YEARS LESS EXCESS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM PRIOR YEARS. WE INTEND TO
MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CASH AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY DEBT COVENANTS, TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO COMPLY WITH THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT AND TO AVOID THE NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX AND WILL RELY FOR THIS PURPOSE ON
DISTRIBUTIONS FROM HOST LP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN OUR RECOGNITION OF TAXABLE INCOME AND OUR RECEIPT OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION 
 
 29 

DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SEASONALITY OF THE LODGING INDUSTRY AND THE FACT THAT SOME TAXABLE INCOME WILL BE PHANTOM INCOME, WHICH IS
TAXABLE INCOME THAT IS NOT MATCHED BY CORRESPONDING CASH FLOW. DUE TO SOME TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO IN YEARS PRIOR TO HOST S CONVERSION TO A REIT, HOST COULD RECOGNIZE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF PHANTOM INCOME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
THESE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAXABLE INCOME AND THE RECEIPT OF RELATED CASH COULD REQUIRE US TO BORROW FUNDS OR TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO ENABLE HOST TO MEET THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT AND, THEREFORE, TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT STATUS, AND TO AVOID THE
NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT PREVENTS HOST FROM RETAINING EARNINGS, WE WILL GENERALLY BE REQUIRED TO REFINANCE DEBT AT ITS MATURITY WITH ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF THESE
SOURCES OF FUNDS, IF AVAILABLE AT ALL, WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET HOST S DISTRIBUTION AND TAX OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE
STARWOOD TRANSACTIONS, HOST OWNS, THROUGH HOST LP, 100 OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK (AND A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK) OF TWO ENTITIES THAT HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS REITS. EACH OF THESE SUBSIDIARY REITS OF HOST WILL BE
SUBJECT TO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT HOST MUST SATISFY IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADVERSE
TAX CONSEQUENCES WOULD APPLY IF HOST OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. WE BELIEVE THAT HOST HAS BEEN ORGANIZED
AND HAS OPERATED IN SUCH A MANNER SO AS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE, COMMENCING WITH OUR TAXABLE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 1999, AND HOST CURRENTLY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS A REIT DURING FUTURE YEARS. IN ADDITION, AFTER THE
STARWOOD TRANSACTIONS, HOST OWNS, THROUGH HOST LP, TWO ENTITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THAT HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS REITS. AS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE
FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS GOVERNING QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT ARE LIMITED, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED THAT HOST CURRENTLY QUALIFIES AS A REIT OR WILL CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT OR THAT EACH OF HOST S SUBSIDIARY REITS QUALIFY AS A
REIT. IF ANY OF THE SUBSIDIARY REITS WERE TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HOST WOULD FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNLESS WE (OR THE SUBSIDIARY REIT) COULD AVAIL OURSELVES (ITSELF) OF CERTAIN RELIEF PROVISIONS. NEW LEGISLATION,
TREASURY REGULATIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OR COURT DECISIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO AN ENTITY S QUALIFICATION AS A REIT OR THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ITS REIT QUALIFICATION. IF HOST OR ANY
OF THE SUBSIDIARY REITS WERE TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AND ANY AVAILABLE RELIEF PROVISIONS DID NOT APPLY, THE NON-QUALIFYING REIT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A DEDUCTION FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS IN COMPUTING ITS TAXABLE INCOME, AND
IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE CORPORATE INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX, ON ITS TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES. MOREOVER, UNLESS ENTITLED TO STATUTORY RELIEF, THE NON-QUALIFYING REIT COULD NOT
QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR DURING WHICH REIT QUALIFICATION IS LOST. ANY DETERMINATION THAT HOST OR
ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MATERIALLY. THE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY OF HOST OR THE SUBSIDIARY REIT FOR THE
YEAR, OR YEARS, IN WHICH THE RELEVANT ENTITY DID NOT QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD REDUCE ITS NET EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT, DEBT SERVICE OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS. FURTHERMORE, THE NON-QUALIFYING ENTITY WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO MAKE
ANY DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS AS A CONDITION TO REIT QUALIFICATION AND ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS WOULD BE TAXABLE AS REGULAR C CORPORATION DIVIDENDS TO THE EXTENT OF ITS CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. THIS MEANS, IF
HOST WERE TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, THAT HOST S STOCKHOLDERS CURRENTLY TAXED AS INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE TAXED ON THOSE DIVIDENDS AT CAPITAL GAIN RATES AND OUR CORPORATE STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED
DEDUCTION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DIVIDENDS, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE, TO APPLICABLE LIMITATIONS UNDER THE CODE. HOST S FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT ALSO WOULD CAUSE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER HOST LP S CREDIT FACILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO AN
ACCELERATION OF THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH, IN TURN, WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER HOST LP S OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES. IF OUR LEASES ARE NOT RESPECTED AS TRUE LEASES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, HOST AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS WOULD FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, HOST MUST SATISFY TWO GROSS INCOME TESTS, UNDER WHICH SPECIFIED PERCENTAGES OF OUR GROSS INCOME MUST BE PASSIVE INCOME, SUCH AS RENT. FOR THE RENT PAID PURSUANT TO THE HOTEL LEASES WITH OUR TRS

30 

SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH CURRENTLY CONSTITUTES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF HOST S AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS GROSS INCOME, TO QUALIFY FOR PURPOSES OF
THE GROSS INCOME TESTS, THE LEASES MUST BE RESPECTED AS TRUE LEASES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND MUST NOT BE TREATED AS SERVICE CONTRACTS, JOINT VENTURES OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEASES WILL BE RESPECTED AS TRUE
LEASES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL AGREE WITH THIS CHARACTERIZATION. IF THE LEASES WERE NOT RESPECTED AS TRUE LEASES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, NEITHER HOST NOR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARY
REITS WOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY EITHER OF THE TWO GROSS INCOME TESTS APPLICABLE TO REITS AND EACH WOULD MOST LIKELY LOSE ITS REIT STATUS. IF OUR
AFFILIATED LESSEES FAIL TO QUALIFY AS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES, HOST AND EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS WOULD FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. RENT PAID BY A LESSEE THAT IS A RELATED PARTY TENANT OF HOST WILL NOT BE QUALIFYING INCOME FOR PURPOSES OF THE TWO GROSS INCOME TESTS APPLICABLE TO REITS. WE LEASE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR HOTELS TO OUR SUBSIDIARY THAT IS
TAXABLE AS A REGULAR C CORPORATION AND THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY WITH RESPECT TO HOST. EACH OF THE HOTELS ACQUIRED FROM STARWOOD ARE ALSO LEASED TO EITHER A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY OF HOST OR A TAXABLE REIT
SUBSIDIARY OF A SUBSIDIARY REIT. SO LONG AS ANY AFFILIATED LESSEE QUALIFIES AS A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY, IT WILL NOT BE TREATED AS A RELATED PARTY TENANT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AFFILIATED LESSEES HAVE QUALIFIED AND WILL CONTINUE TO
QUALIFY, AND THAT THE TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS WILL QUALIFY, TO BE TREATED AS TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE THE STATUS OF A
TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES OR THAT A COURT WOULD NOT SUSTAIN SUCH A CHALLENGE. IF THE IRS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DISQUALIFYING ANY OF OUR AFFILIATED LESSEES (INCLUDING THE TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS)
FROM TREATMENT AS A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HOST OR A SUBSIDIARY REIT WOULD FAIL TO MEET THE ASSET TESTS APPLICABLE TO REITS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INCOME WOULD FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR THE GROSS INCOME TESTS. IF THIS OCCURRED,
HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS WOULD LIKELY LOSE THEIR REIT STATUS. DESPITE THE REIT STATUS OF HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS, WE REMAIN SUBJECT TO
VARIOUS TAXES. HOST OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARY REITS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT THE HIGHEST REGULAR CORPORATE RATE ON
 BUILT-IN GAIN RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF ANY SALE OF A HOTEL ASSET BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE 10-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD OF ASSETS, INCLUDING CERTAIN HOTELS ACQUIRED AS PART OF HOST S CONVERSION TO A REIT OR FROM STARWOOD
AND ITS AFFILIATES AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE STARWOOD PORTFOLIO. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GAIN ON WHICH HOST WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CORPORATE INCOME TAX IF ALL OF THESE BUILT-IN GAIN ASSETS WERE SOLD IN A TAXABLE TRANSACTION PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION
OF THE APPLICABLE 10-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD WOULD BE MATERIAL TO US. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THAT WE COULD RECOGNIZE OTHER SUBSTANTIAL DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING RECEIPT OF CASH. NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR STATUS AS A REIT, HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS) WILL BE SUBJECT TO SOME FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND
FOREIGN TAXES ON THEIR INCOME AND PROPERTY. FOR EXAMPLE, HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS WILL PAY TAX ON CERTAIN TYPES OF INCOME THAT IS NOT DISTRIBUTED AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 100 EXCISE TAX ON TRANSACTIONS WITH A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY THAT ARE
NOT CONDUCTED ON AN ARM S LENGTH BASIS. MOREOVER, THE TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES OF HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS ARE TAXABLE AS REGULAR C CORPORATIONS AND WILL PAY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX ON THEIR NET INCOME AT THE APPLICABLE
CORPORATE RATES, AND FOREIGN TAXES TO THE EXTENT THEY OWN ASSETS OR CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOST LP IS OBLIGATED
UNDER ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO PAY ALL SUCH TAXES (AND ANY RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES) INCURRED BY HOST. IF THE IRS WERE TO CHALLENGE
SUCCESSFULLY HOST LP S STATUS AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, HOST WOULD CEASE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT AND SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. WE BELIEVE THAT HOST LP QUALIFIES TO BE TREATED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AS A PARTNERSHIP, IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON ITS INCOME. INSTEAD, EACH OF ITS PARTNERS, INCLUDING HOST,
IS 
 
 31 

REQUIRED TO PAY TAX ON SUCH PARTNER S ALLOCABLE SHARE OF ITS INCOME. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE HOST
LP S STATUS AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, OR THAT A COURT WOULD NOT SUSTAIN SUCH A CHALLENGE. IF THE IRS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN TREATING HOST LP AS A CORPORATION FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, HOST WOULD FAIL TO MEET THE GROSS
INCOME TESTS AND CERTAIN OF THE ASSET TESTS APPLICABLE TO REITS AND, ACCORDINGLY, CEASE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. IF HOST LP FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES OR HOST FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, EITHER FAILURE WOULD CAUSE
AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER HOST LP S CREDIT FACILITY THAT, IN TURN, COULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER HOST LP S OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES. ALSO, THE FAILURE OF HOST LP TO QUALIFY AS A PARTNERSHIP WOULD CAUSE IT TO BECOME SUBJECT
TO FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN CORPORATE INCOME TAX, WHICH WOULD REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE AMOUNT OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION TO ITS PARTNERS, INCLUDING HOST. AS A REIT, EACH OF HOST AND OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON ITS OWNERSHIP OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, A REIT IS GENERALLY PROHIBITED FROM OWNING SECURITIES IN ANY ONE ISSUER TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES EXCEEDS 5 OF THE VALUE OF THE REIT S TOTAL ASSETS OR THE
SECURITIES OWNED BY THE REIT REPRESENT MORE THAN 10 OF THE ISSUER S OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OR MORE THAN 10 OF THE VALUE OF THE ISSUER S OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. A REIT IS PERMITTED TO OWN SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY IN AN AMOUNT
THAT EXCEEDS THE 5 VALUE TEST AND THE 10 VOTE OR VALUE TEST IF THE SUBSIDIARY ELECTS TO BE A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY. HOWEVER, A REIT MAY NOT OWN SECURITIES OF TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES THAT REPRESENT IN THE AGGREGATE MORE THAN 20 OF THE VALUE OF
THE REIT S TOTAL ASSETS. IF HOST OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY REITS WERE TO VIOLATE THESE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS, EACH WOULD LIKELY LOSE ITS REIT STATUS. HOST OR OUR SUBSIDIARY REITS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A PENALTY TAX UPON THE SALE OF A HOTEL. THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO REITS PROVIDE THAT ANY GAIN REALIZED BY A REIT ON THE SALE OF PROPERTY HELD AS INVENTORY OR OTHER PROPERTY HELD PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IS TREATED AS INCOME FROM A PROHIBITED
TRANSACTION THAT IS SUBJECT TO A 100 EXCISE TAX. UNDER EXISTING LAW, WHETHER PROPERTY, INCLUDING HOTELS, IS HELD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IS A QUESTION OF FACT THAT DEPENDS UPON ALL OF
THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION. WE INTEND TO HOLD OUR HOTELS FOR INVESTMENT WITH A VIEW TO LONG-TERM APPRECIATION, TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING AND OWNING HOTELS AND TO MAKE OCCASIONAL SALES OF
HOTELS AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE IRS MIGHT NOT CONTEND THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE SALES ARE SUBJECT TO THE 100 EXCISE TAX.

 INDUSTRY GROWTH AND POTENTIAL 
 
 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, THE STATISTICAL DATA BELOW WAS DERIVED FROM THE MARCH 2008 COMSCORE WIRELESS REPORT. WORLDWIDE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE 2.5 TIMES MORE CELL PHONES THAN COMPUTERS (2.5 BILLION CELL PHONES
COMPARED TO 1 BILLION COMPUTERS). THE AGE AT WHICH PEOPLE ARE USING CELL PHONES CONTINUES TO DECLINE AND OVERALL CONSUMER DEPENDENCE ON CELL PHONES CONTINUES TO GROW. ANNUAL EXPENDITURE ON MOBILE ADVERTISING IS EXPECTED TO REACH 11.4 BILLION BY
2012 1 . TO DATE, CONSUMERS ARE PROVING TO BE SOMEWHAT RESISTANT TO MOBILE ADVERTISING, WITH SURVEY RESULTS INDICATING THAT LOCATION-BASED COUPON
SERVICES DRAW LITTLE ENTHUSIASM FROM CONSUMERS (ONLY 14 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THE SERVICE - WHICH WAS FLAT COMPARED TO A 2006 SURVEY FINDING). AT T WIRELESS AND VERIZON WIRELESS CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT WIRELESS
PROVIDERS. BOTH COMPANIES CONTINUED TO ADD TO THEIR ALREADY LARGE SUBSCRIBER COUNT (AT T WIRELESS AND VERIZON WIRELESS ENDED 2007 WITH 70.1 MILLION AND 65.7 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, RESPECTIVELY 2 . 
 
 FOR MANY CONSUMERS, CELLULAR PHONES HAVE ALREADY MADE THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMUNICATION DEVICE TO A MEDIA-CONSUMPTION DEVICE. WITH CONTINUING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE DEPENDENT ON THEIR CELL
PHONES AND LESS DEPENDENT ON LANDLINES. 
 
 CELLULAR PHONES CONTINUE TO PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONSUMERS LIVES. FOR MANY, THEY HAVE BECOME MORE THAN JUST A COMMUNICATION TOOL. MOBILE INTERNET USAGE CONTINUES TO RISE AND MANY CUSTOMERS REPORT
HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION: 

THE NUMBER OF MOBILE INTERNET SUBSCRIBERS ACCESSING MOBILE INTERNET HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST YEAR 
 
 E-MAIL DOMINATES THE REASON THESE SUBSCRIBERS ACCESS THE MOBILE INTERNET. 

MOBILE INTERNET USAGE IS AT A TIPPING POINT: 
 
 CURRENT MOBILE INTERNET USERS ARE ACCESSING MORE TYPES OF ONLINE CONTENT ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICES. 
 
 NON-USERS REPORT THAT COST IS THE BIGGEST DETERRENT IN SUBSCRIBING TO MOBILE INTERNET SERVICE, REPRESENTING A CHANGE FROM

STI S POSITION IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY 
 
 THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS GROWING RAPIDLY WITH MORE THAN 47 MILLION NEW SUBSCRIBERS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND AN 18 INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE OVER THAT PERIOD. THE PRINCIPAL DRIVER OF THIS GROWTH IS REVENUE FROM DATA
DOWNLOADS WHICH HAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 63 OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. STI IS POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TRAFFIC THROUGH ITS ADC PLATFORM. ADC S HAVE REACHED A BROAD DEMOGRAPHIC AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY SEEN HIGH CONVERSION NUMBERS.
SOME COMPANIES THAT ALREADY HAVE PRODUCTION SMS PROGRAMS HAVE CONTACTED STI TO EXPAND THEIR DELIVERY OPTIONS BY ADDING ADC CODES.

 LINES OF BUSINESS: 

ABBREVIATED DIAL CODE - ABBREVIATED DIAL CODE ADC WOULD BE BEST UNDERSTOOD AS DIALING 411 FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN ADC. SINGLE TOUCH HAS DEVELOPED A MEANS
FOR BRANDS TO UTILIZE AN ADC AS AN EASY TO USE AND REMEMBER MOBILE TELEPHONE ACCESS POINT FOR A BRANDS CUSTOMERS TO INTERACT WITH A BRANDS PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERING. THE
ADC PROGRAMS ARE AN EASY TO USE AND ACCESS DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL THAT SUPPORTS AND FACILITATES THE DOWNLOAD OF CONTENT IN MANY FORMS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DELIVERY OF AN APPLICATION, A CONNECTION TO A CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT, AND A CONNECTION TO AN IVR. IN ADDITION, ADC PROGRAMS CAN BE USED TO INITIATE A WAP, MMS OR SMS SESSION, TO DIGITALLY POPULATE A FORM, TO PROVIDE LEAD GENERATION AND
CAN ALSO EVOKE A PLURALITY OF OTHER FEATURES AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICE TO END USER MOBILE DEVICES. ADC PROGRAMS CAN ALSO SUPPORT VARIOUS BRANDING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AS IT IS AS
EASY AS DIALING A PHONE NUMBER. STI WAS THE FIRST TO DELIVER SUCCESSFUL ADC PROGRAMS COMMERCIALLY ON MULTIPLE CARRIERS IN THE UNITED STATES. ADC VANITY NUMBERS SUCH AS #MTV FOR MUSIC TELEVISION AND # BET FOR
BLACK ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION, MAKE IT EASY TO REMEMBER HOW TO ACCESS A BRAND. CERTAIN ADC S CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CORPORATE NAME, SUCH AS #SEARS AND # HERTZ. ANOTHER
APPLICATION OF ADC S INDICATES A PARTICULAR AVAILABLE SERVICE OR PRODUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WALMART RECENTLY LAUNCHED THE ADC #MEALS TO ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE SIMPLE MEAL
PLANS AND IDEAS AND EVEN RECEIVE RECIPES ON THEIR MOBILE PHONES. USING A CUSTOM VOICE THAT EVERYONE IN YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC IS FAMILIAR WITH ADDS PERSONALITY TO A PROGRAM. BLACK ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION, FOR
EXAMPLE, USES THEIR TOP RATED VIDEO JOCKEY TO BE THE VOICE OF #BET. THE STI ADC PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND OUR PARTICIPANTS HAVE ADDED A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE
THE FOLLOWING: DOWNLOADING CONTENT (#MTV, #BET), REDIRECTING CALLS TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (#SEARS), STREAMING AUDIO FROM FOX NEWS (#FOXN), AND EVEN LISTENING TO LIVE
CONCERTS (#323). A RECENT REVIEW HAS INDICATED THAT, STI ADC PROGRAMS HAVE HAD OVER 14 MILLION CALLS WITH OVER 30 OF THOSE CALLERS MAKING A TRANSACTION. STI S ADC PROGRAM RECEIVED THE 2006 MOBILE
MARKETING ASSOCIATION AWARD FOR INNOVATION. 

BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, OUR ADC PROGRAM AND IVR SYSTEM MAY BE UTILIZED AS FOLLOWS:

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 MATERIAL CONTRACT AND AGREEMENTS 
 
 OUR BUSINESS AGREEMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS AND CARRIER AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES WHICH HAVE SALES RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE END USERS OF THE TRANSACTED MEDIA
CONTENT OR SERVICE APPLICATION. THESE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE A SPLIT OF THE FEES RECEIVED BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND SINGLE TOUCH OR A FIXED FEE PER TRANSACTION. CARRIER AGREEMENTS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IN NATURE AND ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION TO THE
END USER THAT ENABLES SINGLE TOUCH TO DELIVER AND COLLECT PAYMENT FOR THE TRANSACTED MEDIA CONTENT OR SERVICE APPLICATION. CARRIER AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE A SPLIT OF THE FEES RECEIVED BETWEEN THE CARRIER AND SINGLE TOUCH. WE DO NOT CONSIDER ANY
OF OUR CARRIER AGREEMENTS MATERIAL AS OTHER CARRIERS AND AGGREGATORS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT ANY OF OUR CARRIER AGREEMENTS ARE TERMINATED OR NOT RENEWED. 
 
 MATERIAL CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS 
 
 ON JUNE 19, 2006 WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE BMI AGREEMENT WITH BOULEVARD MEDIA INC., A U.S. SUBSIDIARY OF TELIGENCE BMI PURSUANT TO WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO BMI THROUGH OUR
ABBREVIATED DIALING CODE ADC PROGRAMS AND INTERACTIVE VOICE RECOGNITION IVR SYSTEM. WE LAUNCHED THREE ADC CODES, #CHAT, #TALK AND #MALE, FOR BMI ON AUGUST 1, 2006 AND ADDED 3 MORE CODES, #FONO, #REDHOT AND #TANGO ON
FEBRUARY 20, 2007. THESE ADC PROGRAMS ENABLE WIRELESS CHAT SERVICES BY PROVIDING COMMERCIAL BILLING, SERVICES PLATFORMS AND CONTENT DELIVERY. BMI DEVELOPS AND DELIVERS VOICE-ENABLED SERVICES FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING AND ENTERTAINMENT IN NORTH AMERICA
AND PROVIDES THE RELATED TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND CUSTOM SOFTWARE. PURSUANT TO THE BMI AGREEMENT, WE RECEIVE 40 OF END USER PURCHASES PLUS 0.225 PER TRANSACTION. PRICING FOR BMI PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE LESS THAN 2.95 OR MORE THAN
 19.95 PER TRANSACTION. THE BMI AGREEMENT HAD AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX MONTHS WHICH RENEWS AUTOMATICALLY FOR ADDITIONAL SIX MONTH TERMS. EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE BMI AGREEMENT AT THE END OF A RENEWAL PERIOD BY PROVIDING NOTICE TO THE OTHER
PARTY AT LEAST TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE RENEWAL PERIOD. SEE CUSTOMERS. ON DECEMBER 18, 2005 WE ENTERED INTO A THREE YEAR AGREEMENT (THE MOTRICITY AGREEMENT WITH MOTRICITY, INC. MOTRICITY ), ONE OF THE LARGEST U.S. MOBILE CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS FIRMS, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO MOTRICITY THROUGH OUR ADC PROGRAMS AND IVR SYSTEM. MOTRICITY OPERATES A MANAGED
SERVICES SOLUTION THAT ENABLES CUSTOMER AND CONTENT PROVIDERS TO DELIVER MOBILE CONTENT INCLUDING RINGTONES, GAMES, APPLICATIONS AND GRAPHICS DOWNLOADS. PURSUANT TO THE MOTRICITY AGREEMENT, WE SUBTRACTED CARRIER COSTS FROM END USER PURCHASES AND
RETAINED 0.175 PER TRANSACTION. MOTRICITY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEVELOPING SALES THROUGH ADVERTISING THE #BET AND #MTV PROGRAMS. SINCE SEPTEMBER 2007, MOTRICITY HAD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ITS ADVERTISING SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAMS WHICH RESULTED IN
REDUCED SALES. THE MOTRICITY AGREEMENT TERMINATED ON DECEMBER 17, 2008. SERVICE FUNCTIONALITY WAS TERMINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2008. SEE CUSTOMERS . 
 
 CUSTOMERS 
 
 BMI ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9 OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. THE LOSS OF BMI AS A CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE COULD DIRECTLY
REPLACE THE REVENUES LOST THEREBY SINCE BMI IS A DIRECT CUSTOMER SELLING CONTENT TO END USERS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO LOSE BMI AS A CUSTOMER WE WOULD NEED TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR SOURCES TO REPLACE THE LOST REVENUES. 

MOTRICITY, INC. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 56 OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. OUR AGREEMENT WITH MOTRICITY, INC. EXPIRED DECEMBER 17, 2008 AND SERVICE WAS TERMINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2008 WE HAVE
ESTABLISHED NEW RELATIONS FOR OUR ADC PROGRAM BY CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH BET AND AN AGREEMENT WITH PLAY PHONE TO PROMOTE THIS PROGRAM; THESE REVENUES ARE CURRENTLY NOMINAL BUT ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ONCE ADVERTISING DEVELOPS WHICH IS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF PLAY PHONE. 
 
 WE HAVE ESTABLISHED NEW RELATIONS FOR OUR ADC PROGRAM BY CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH MTV AND AN AGREEMENT WITH THUMB PLAY TO PROMOTE THIS PROGRAM; THESE REVENUES ARE CURRENTLY NOMINAL BUT ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ONCE
ADVERTISING DEVELOPS WHICH IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THUMB PLAY.

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
 DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 WE SPENT 536,778 AND 688,829, RESPECTIVELY, ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS CAPITALIZED. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AMORTIZED AND CHARGED TO
OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE 472,619 AND 610,704 RESPECTIVELY WHICH WERE EXPENSED. WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY 880,000 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE 2009 FISCAL YEAR. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES RELATE
PRIMARILY TO GENERAL CODING OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THESE ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF BOTH NEW PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT OR IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ARE DEDICATED TO IMPROVING OUR ADC
PROGRAMS WHILE OTHERS ARE DEDICATED TO REFINING OUR NEW MOBILE COUPONING PRODUCTS. 
 
 WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY NEED TO INCREASE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF DEDICATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES BY ADDING BOTH HARDWARE AND ENGINEERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY BE REQUIRED FOR OUR RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS TO KEEP UP WITH OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH, BASED ON OUR CURRENT COMMITMENTS AND PLANNED PRODUCT LAUNCHES. 
 
 MARKETS AND COMPETITION 
 
 MARKETING STRATEGY 
 
 SINGLE TOUCH PROVIDES PRODUCTS THAT ARE EASY TO USE. OUR CORE PRODUCTS INCLUDE FLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE PLATFORMS FOR PROGRAMS FOR BOTH CARRIERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS. SINGLE TOUCH PROGRAMS REACH CONSUMERS IN WAYS THAT ARE
INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THINGS FOR THE CONSUMER. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES SELL RINGTONES BY SENDING SPECIAL CODES TO ANOTHER CODE VIA TEXT MESSAGES, SINGLE TOUCH ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO GET RINGTONES BY MAKING A SIMPLE PHONE CALL TO AN
ADC. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE OUR PLATFORM EVOLUTION BY PROVIDING SOLUTIONS IN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS THAT PROVIDE CORE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR PARTNERS AND CONSUMERS AND ARE DIFFERENTIATED IN THE MARKET PLACE. 
 
 IN GENERAL WE PROVIDE COMPETITIVE PRICING BASED ON THE VALUE OUR PRODUCTS BRING TO THE MARKET WHILE ENSURING OUR COSTS ARE COVERED. WE ATTEMPT TO MATCH OUR REVENUE STREAMS WITH OUR PARTNERS, MAKING MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS
REVENUE SHARE BASED WITH NOMINAL SET-UP FEES. 
 
 SINGLE TOUCH HAS MINIMIZED THE COST OF ADVERTISING WHILE STILL ENJOYING STRONG SALES PIPELINES. WE EMPLOY SEVERAL COST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PROMOTING OUR PROGRAMS SUCH AS INCLUDING OUR BRAND ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS
 POWERED BY SINGLE TOUCH . WE PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL INDUSTRY GROUPS INCLUDING THE MOBILE MARKETING ASSOCIATION (MMA). ONE OF OUR MOST COMMON CHANNELS IS REFERRALS FROM OUR WIRELESS CARRIER PARTNERS. OUR EXISTING PARTNERS ALSO PROVIDE
WORD-OF-MOUTH PROMOTION AND REFERENCES FOR OUR PROGRAMS. 
 
 OUR PROGRAMS ARE DISTRIBUTED VIA OUR COMPANY OWNED SALES CHANNELS. PRESENTLY, WE ARE ALSO BRINGING ON TWO RESELLER PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL FORCE ADDRESSES ANY DIRECT INQUIRIES FROM PARTNER REFERRALS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH
EXISTING PARTNERS, REFERRALS FROM WEBSITES AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WE UNCOVER. OUR RESELLERS HAVE THOUSANDS OF SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL BE ADDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THEIR PORTFOLIO AND BRINGING THEM TO THEIR EXISTING CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION 
 
 PRESENTLY, THERE ARE VERY FEW COMPETITORS IN THE ABBREVIATED DIAL CODE ARENA. OVER THE LAST 6 YEARS, STI HAS WORKED ON CREATING THE ADC SPACE IN THE U.S. AND WITH ITS SUCCESS HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR COMPETITORS TO FOLLOW.
SOME NATURAL BARRIERS INCLUDE THE PROVEN CARRIER RELATIONSHIPS THAT STI HAS CULTIVATED. STI IS ONE OF A FEW WIRELESS COMPANIES THAT HAS DIRECT BILLING ACROSS THE CARRIERS.

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
 SINGLE TOUCH PROVIDES VALUE ADDED AND ENABLING PLATFORMS FOR CARRIER BASED DISTRIBUTION OF VARIOUS SOFTWARE AND MEDIA CONTENT. APPLICABLE REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY UNDER THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FCC AND RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. THE WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. GIVEN THE GROWING AND DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL WIRELESS
PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO CONSUMERS OVER A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK, REGULATORS COULD IMPOSE RULES, REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT ON THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS LIKE SINGLE TOUCH. MANAGEMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY
AWARE OF ANY PENDING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS. 
 
 EMPLOYEES 
 
 WE CURRENTLY HAVE 18 FULL TIME AND NO PART-TIME EMPLOYEES INCLUDING 2 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, 4 PERSONS SERVING AS PROGRAMMING AND TECHNICAL STAFF OPERATORS, 3 PERSONS IN SALES AND MARKETING, 3 PERSONS IN OUR RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, 1 IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTANT, 1 IN-HOUSE LEGAL COUNSEL AND 4 PERSONS IN PROGRAM AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT. WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR FUTURE EMPLOYEE LEVELS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EXPECTED GROWTH. NONE OF
OUR EMPLOYEES IS REPRESENTED BY A LABOR UNION AND WE CONSIDER OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS TO BE GOOD.

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT BEFORE PURCHASING OUR COMMON STOCK. THE RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING US. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE ARE UNAWARE OF, OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL, ALSO MAY BECOME IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT AFFECT US. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR,
OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN THAT CASE, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU MAY LOSE SOME OR ALL OF THE MONEY YOU PAID TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON
STOCK. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY 
 
 WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES WHICH MAY CONTINUE. 
 
 WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING AND NET LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE INCURRED NET LOSSES OF 11,123,003 AND 15,550,049 FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER
30, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, OUR ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS 87,643,509. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED PROFITABILITY ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH A LEVEL OF REVENUE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. OUR GROSS
REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 WERE 1,713,014 AND 2,490,330, RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR REVENUES GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN ANTICIPATED OR IF OPERATING EXPENSES EXCEED EXPECTATIONS, THEN WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN THE NEAR FUTURE OR AT ALL, WHICH MAY DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICE. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN THE EVOLVING WIRELESS MARKET, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 THE FUTURE REVENUE POTENTIAL OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE EMERGING WIRELESS MARKET IS UNCERTAIN. ANY EVALUATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ENCOUNTERED BY COMPANIES
IN SUCH MARKET. AS A COMPANY OPERATING IN THE EVOLVING MOBILE INDUSTRY, WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES. TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, WE MUST DO THE FOLLOWING: 

MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT, AND DEVELOP NEW, WIRELESS CARRIER RELATIONSHIPS, IN BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC MARKETS; 
 
 MAINTAIN AND EXPAND OUR CURRENT, AND DEVELOP NEW, RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD-PARTY BRANDED AND NON-BRANDED CONTENT OWNERS; 
 
 RETAIN OR IMPROVE OUR CURRENT REVENUE-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CARRIERS AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OWNERS; 
 
 CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET ACCEPTANCE; 
 
 CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY; 
 
 CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS; 
 
 EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES SUCCESSFULLY; 
 
 RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS; AND 
 
 ATTRACT, INTEGRATE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ONE OR MORE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO SUFFER. IN ADDITION, ACCOMPLISHING MANY OF THESE EFFORTS MIGHT BE VERY EXPENSIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING
RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY RELY ON ONLY A FEW CUSTOMERS FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES. 
 
 AS OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2007, BOULEVARD MEDIA INC., A U.S. SUBSIDIARY OF TELIGENCE, OR BMI, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9 OF OUR REVENUES. THE LOSS OF BMI AS A CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE COULD DIRECTLY REPLACE THE REVENUES LOST SINCE BMI IS A DIRECT CUSTOMER SELLING CONTENT TO END USERS.

12 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY RELY ON WIRELESS CARRIERS TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO GENERATE OUR REVENUES. THE LOSS OF OR A CHANGE IN ANY OF THESE SIGNIFICANT CARRIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE
ACCESS TO THEIR SUBSCRIBERS AND THUS MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. 
 
 OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ANTICIPATES MAINTAINING SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS AND OR AGGREGATORS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF CARRIERS. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL
CONTINUE TO GENERATE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES THROUGH DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF CARRIERS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE CARRIERS WOULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR
REVENUES AND THUS HARM OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 TYPICALLY, CARRIER AGREEMENTS HAVE A TERM OF ONE OR TWO YEARS WITH AUTOMATIC RENEWAL PROVISIONS UPON EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL TERM, ABSENT A CONTRARY NOTICE FROM EITHER PARTY. IN ADDITION, SOME CARRIER AGREEMENTS PROVIDE
THAT THE CARRIER CAN TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT EARLY AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, AT ANY TIME WITHOUT CAUSE, WHICH COULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO RENEGOTIATE ECONOMIC OR OTHER TERMS. THE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT OBLIGATE THE CARRIERS TO MARKET OR
DISTRIBUTE ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN MANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS, WE WARRANT THAT OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT VIOLATE COMMUNITY STANDARDS, DO NOT CONTAIN LIBELOUS CONTENT, DO NOT CONTAIN MATERIAL DEFECTS OR VIRUSES, AND DO NOT VIOLATE THIRD-PARTY
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WE INDEMNIFY THE CARRIER FOR ANY BREACH OF A THIRD PARTY S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 MANY OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH A GIVEN CARRIER, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

THE CARRIER S PREFERENCE FOR OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN OURS; 
 
 THE CARRIER S DECISION TO DISCONTINUE THE SALE OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; 
 
 THE CARRIER S DECISION TO OFFER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS SUBSCRIBERS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT REDUCED PRICES; 
 
 THE CARRIER S DECISION TO RESTRICT OR ALTER SUBSCRIPTION OR OTHER TERMS FOR DOWNLOADING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; 
 
 A FAILURE OF THE CARRIER S MERCHANDISING, PROVISIONING OR BILLING SYSTEMS; 
 
 THE CARRIER S DECISION TO OFFER ITS OWN COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; 
 
 THE CARRIER S DECISION TO TRANSITION TO DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AND REVENUE MODELS; AND 
 
 CONSOLIDATION AMONG CARRIERS. 

IF ANY OF OUR CARRIERS DECIDES NOT TO MARKET OR DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR DECIDES TO TERMINATE, NOT RENEW OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ITS AGREEMENT WITH US OR IF THERE IS CONSOLIDATION AMONG CARRIERS GENERALLY, WE
MAY BE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE AFFECTED AGREEMENT WITH ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES, CAUSING US TO LOSE ACCESS TO THAT CARRIER S SUBSCRIBERS AND THE REVENUES THEY AFFORD US, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION. 
 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY KEEP PACE WITH THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND E-COMMERCE ARENAS WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
 
 TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST CONTINUALLY MONITOR, ENHANCE AND IMPROVE THE RESPONSIVENESS, FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES OF OUR APPLICATIONS. WIRELESS NETWORK AND MOBILE PHONE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE E COMMERCE INDUSTRY IN
GENERAL ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, CHANGES IN USER AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES, FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INTRODUCTIONS REQUIRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO FACILITATE COMMERCIAL DELIVERY, AS WELL
AS THE EMERGENCE OF NEW INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES THAT COULD RENDER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, SYSTEMS AND/OR BUSINESS METHODS OBSOLETE IN FUTURE FISCAL PERIODS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON ITS ABILITY TO LICENSE OR INTERNALLY DEVELOP
LEADING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND VARIED NEEDS OF PROSPECTIVE CONSUMERS, AND RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND EMERGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES ON A TIMELY-COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS. PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY
DEVELOPMENT ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS RISKS, INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT COST AND TIME TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT, THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPLICATION ONCE DEVELOPED, AND TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH THE APPLICATION WILL BE USEFUL
PRIOR TO OBSOLESCENCE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL USE INTERNALLY DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES EFFECTIVELY OR ADAPT EXISTING OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS OR EMERGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE, FOR
TECHNICAL, LEGAL, FINANCIAL OR OTHER REASONS, TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS OR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD
BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 13 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO MEET OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE AND SUCH CAPITAL RAISING MAY BE COSTLY OR DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND COULD DILUTE CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS.

WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE RAISING OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY DILUTE OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. OUR PRESENT
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCINGS TO MEET VARIOUS OBJECTIVES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: 

PURSUING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING MORE RAPID EXPANSION; 
 
 ACQUIRING COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES; 
 
 MAKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE; 
 
 HIRING QUALIFIED MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEES; 
 
 DEVELOPING NEW SERVICES, PROGRAMMING OR PRODUCTS; 
 
 RESPONDING TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES; 
 
 COMPLYING WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS LICENSING AND REGISTRATION; AND 
 
 MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. 

ANY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RAISED THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY OR EQUITY BACKED SECURITIES MAY DILUTE CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES AND COULD ALSO RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR EQUITY
SECURITIES BECAUSE OUR ASSETS WOULD BE OWNED BY A LARGER POOL OF OUTSTANDING EQUITY. THE TERMS OF THOSE SECURITIES ISSUED BY US IN FUTURE CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE TO NEW INVESTORS, AND MAY INCLUDE PREFERENCES, SUPERIOR VOTING
RIGHTS AND THE ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS OR OTHER DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, WHICH MAY HAVE A FURTHER DILUTIVE EFFECT. 
 
 WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN PURSUING FUTURE CAPITAL FINANCING, INCLUDING INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, LEGAL FEES, ACCOUNTING FEES, SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE FEES, PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS. WE MAY
ALSO BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE NON-CASH EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SECURITIES WE ISSUE, SUCH AS CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND WARRANTS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 FURTHERMORE, ANY ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING THAT WE MAY NEED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OF OR
ELIMINATE MATERIAL PARTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. THIS LIMITATION COULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH. 
 
 OUR STRATEGY ENVISIONS GROWING OUR BUSINESS. IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. GROWTH MAY PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES. WE MUST
CONTINUE TO REFINE AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES, OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES AND OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING SOURCES. AS WE GROW, WE MUST CONTINUE TO HIRE, TRAIN, SUPERVISE AND MANAGE NEW EMPLOYEES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO: 

MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS; 
 
 EXPAND OUR SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY OR IN A TIMELY MANNER; 
 
 ALLOCATE OUR HUMAN RESOURCES OPTIMALLY; OR 
 
 IDENTIFY AND HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES OR RETAIN VALUED EMPLOYEES. 

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH AND OUR OPERATIONS OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 14 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED, EXPERIENCED, HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. 
 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE SKILLED AND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. IF WE FAIL TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF THESE QUALIFIED PEOPLE, OUR
PROSPECTS, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF ANTHONY MACALUSO AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM.
WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, EACH OF WHOM MAY VOLUNTARILY TERMINATE HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH US AT ANY TIME. FOLLOWING ANY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, THESE EMPLOYEES WOULD NOT BE
SUBJECT TO ANY NON-COMPETITION COVENANTS. THE LOSS OF ANY KEY EMPLOYEE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, AND OUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL WITH SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE IN OUR INDUSTRIES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT S LIMITED RECENT EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT S ATTENTION FROM OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS RELATIVELY LIMITED RECENT EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY AND COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH RECENTLY ADOPTED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON A TIMELY
BASIS. OUR MANAGEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES IN RESPONDING TO INCREASED LEGAL, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY FAILURE TO DO SO COULD LEAD TO THE IMPOSITION OF FINES AND
PENALTIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 APPLICABLE RULES, INCLUDING THOSE CONTAINED IN AND ISSUED UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT QUALIFIED OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THOSE QUALIFIED OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND MEMBERS OF BOARD COMMITTEES REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR OUR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN PUBLICLY HELD
COMPANIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CERTIFICATIONS BY PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. THE ENACTMENT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT HAS RESULTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF A SERIES OF RULES AND REGULATIONS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF EXISTING RULES AND
REGULATIONS BY THE SEC, AS WELL AS THE ADOPTION OF NEW AND MORE STRINGENT RULES BY THE STOCK EXCHANGES AND NASDAQ. THE PERCEIVED INCREASED PERSONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RECENT CHANGES MAY DETER QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS FROM ACCEPTING ROLES AS
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
 
 FURTHER, SOME OF THESE RECENT CHANGES HEIGHTEN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BOARD OR COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO AN INDIVIDUAL S INDEPENDENCE FROM THE CORPORATION AND LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE IN FINANCE AND
ACCOUNTING MATTERS. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING DIRECTORS WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN OR
RETAIN LISTING OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON ANY STOCK EXCHANGE OR NASDAQ (ASSUMING WE ELECT TO SEEK AND ARE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING SUCH LISTING) COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR DETECT FRAUD. CONSEQUENTLY, INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING
AND THIS MAY DECREASE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK. 
 
 WE MUST MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS TO PROVIDE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND DETECT FRAUD. WE WILL BE ASSESSING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT ANY REQUIRED
CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OR ANY OTHERS THAT WE IDENTIFY AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. ANY SUCH
LOSS OF CONFIDENCE WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK.

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 THE ACQUISITION OF OTHER COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES COULD RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES, DILUTION AND OTHER HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. 
 
 WE MAY SELECTIVELY PURSUE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT'S TIME AND FOCUS FROM OPERATING OUR
BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY, BUSINESS OR TECHNOLOGY IS RISKY AND MAY RESULT IN UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES FROM THE ACQUIRED COMPANY INTO OUR ORGANIZATION AND
INTEGRATING EACH COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS TO PERMIT EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS MIGHT INVOLVE UNIQUE RISKS RELATED TO INTEGRATION OF OPERATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT
CULTURES AND LANGUAGES, CURRENCY RISKS AND THE PARTICULAR ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND REGULATORY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC COUNTRIES. THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF OUR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS COULD
RESULT IN POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE ISSUANCES OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING OUR COMMON STOCK, THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, OR WRITE-OFFS OF GOODWILL, ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
FUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. 
 
 ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DISRUPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEREFORE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE BUSINESSES OR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN A DECREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD LIMIT OUR CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING OR CREDIT TO PURCHASE AND PAY FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, AND RESULT IN A DECREASE IN
SALES VOLUME THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY 
 
 IF WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS DO NOT CONTINUE TO USE THEIR MOBILE HANDSETS TO ACCESS MOBILE CONTENT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND FUTURE REVENUES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 WE OPERATE IN A DEVELOPING INDUSTRY. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS WHO USE THEIR HANDSETS TO ACCESS DATA SERVICES AND, IN PARTICULAR, APPLICATIONS OF THE TYPE WE DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE.
NEW OR DIFFERENT MOBILE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED BY OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS MAY BE PREFERRED BY SUBSCRIBERS TO OUR OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, OTHER MOBILE PLATFORMS MAY BECOME WIDESPREAD, AND END USERS MAY CHOOSE TO SWITCH TO THESE PLATFORMS.
IF THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DOES NOT CONTINUE TO GROW OR WE ARE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE NEW END USERS, OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND FUTURE REVENUES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF END USERS SWITCH THEIR SPENDING AWAY FROM THE KINDS OF OFFERINGS
THAT WE PUBLISH, OR SWITCH TO PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE COMPARATIVE STRENGTHS, OUR REVENUES WOULD LIKELY DECLINE AND OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD SUFFER. 
 
 SYSTEM OR NETWORK FAILURES COULD REDUCE OUR SALES, INCREASE COSTS OR RESULT IN A LOSS OF END USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 
 
 MOBILE CONTENT DELIVERY RELIES ON WIRELESS CARRIER NETWORKS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO END USERS. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MOBILE CONTENT DISTRIBUTORS MAY ALSO RELY ON THEIR OWN SERVERS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS ON
DEMAND TO END USERS THROUGH THEIR CARRIERS NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PRODUCTS REQUIRE ACCESS OVER THE MOBILE INTERNET TO OUR SERVERS IN ORDER TO ENABLE CERTAIN FEATURES. ANY FAILURE OF, OR TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH, CARRIERS , THIRD
PARTIES OR BILLING SYSTEMS, DELIVERY OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS COULD RESULT IN THE INABILITY OF END USERS TO DOWNLOAD OUR PRODUCTS, PREVENT THE COMPLETION OF A BILLING TRANSACTION, OR INTERFERE WITH ACCESS TO SOME
ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS FAILS OR IF THERE IS AN INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF POWER, AN EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, FLOOD OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTER, OR AN ACT OF WAR OR TERRORISM, END USERS MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS OUR OFFERINGS. FOR
EXAMPLE, FROM TIME TO TIME, OUR CARRIERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FAILURES WITH THEIR BILLING AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, INCLUDING GATEWAY FAILURES THAT REDUCED THE PROVISIONING CAPACITY OF THEIR BRANDED E-COMMERCE SYSTEM. ANY FAILURE
OF, OR TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH, THE CARRIERS , OTHER THIRD PARTIES OR OUR SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE END USERS OR REVENUES OR INCUR SUBSTANTIAL REPAIR COSTS AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD HARM
OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 16 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
 OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INCLUDES DEPLOYMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF RELIABLE NEXT-GENERATION
DIGITAL NETWORKS WITH THE SPEED, DATA CAPACITY AND SECURITY NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS PLACED ON IT IF THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS
CONTINUES TO INCREASE, OR IF EXISTING OR FUTURE SUBSCRIBERS INCREASE THEIR BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED A VARIETY OF OUTAGES AND OTHER DELAYS AS A RESULT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES, AND COULD FACE
OUTAGES AND DELAYS IN THE FUTURE. THESE OUTAGES AND DELAYS COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS USAGE AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SUCCESSFULLY. IN ADDITION, CHANGES BY A WIRELESS CARRIER TO NETWORK
INFRASTRUCTURE MAY INTERFERE WITH DOWNLOADS AND MAY CAUSE END USERS TO LOSE FUNCTIONALITY. THIS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN MOBILE HANDSETS OR WIRELESS NETWORKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES. 
 
 MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF MOBILE HANDSETS AND WIRELESS NETWORKS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR BUSINESS. THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS AND OTHER ILLICIT CODE OR MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS
THAT MAY ATTACK WIRELESS NETWORKS AND HANDSETS. SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE IDENTIFIED COMPUTER WORM PROGRAMS THAT TARGET HANDSETS RUNNING ON CERTAIN OPERATING SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH THESE WORMS HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY RELEASED AND DO NOT PRESENT AN
IMMEDIATE RISK TO OUR BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE FUTURE THREATS COULD LEAD SOME END USERS TO SEEK TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR REDUCE OR DELAY THE USE OF THEIR HANDSETS. WIRELESS CARRIERS AND HANDSET MANUFACTURERS MAY ALSO
INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR WIRELESS NETWORKS AND MOBILE PHONE PRODUCTS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW HANDSET MODELS. ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND THIS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS,
OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE MEDIA AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A NUMBER OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE THAT COULD RESTRICT THE MEDIA AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING CUSTOMER
PRIVACY, TAXATION, CONTENT SUITABILITY, COPYRIGHT, DISTRIBUTION AND ANTITRUST. FURTHERMORE, THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET FOR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MAY PROMPT CALLS FOR MORE STRINGENT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THAT MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL
BURDENS ON COMPANIES SUCH AS OURS CONDUCTING BUSINESS THROUGH WIRELESS CARRIERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REGULATION OF OUR INDUSTRY WILL INCREASE AND THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE LEGAL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS REGULATION. CHANGES IN
CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE IMPOSITION OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE REGARDING THE MEDIA AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES MAY LESSEN THE GROWTH OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND MAY MATERIALLY
REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 
 
 A DECLINE IN, OR LIMITATION ON, THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 A NUMBER OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES HAVE BEGUN TO RESTRICT THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES ON THEIR PREMISES. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY PLACES OF WORSHIP, RESTAURANTS, HOSPITALS, MEDICAL OFFICES, LIBRARIES, MUSEUMS, CONCERT HALLS AND
OTHER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC BUSINESSES RESTRICT THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES DUE TO PRIVACY CONCERNS, THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY MOBILE PHONE USERS TO OTHER PATRONS AND THE DISRUPTION MOBILE PHONES MAY CAUSE TO OTHER ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AT THESE
LOCATIONS. 
 
 LEGISLATION HAS ALSO BEEN PROPOSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS AND BY MANY STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES TO RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES WHILE DRIVING MOTOR VEHICLES. SOME STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE UNITED
STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS RESTRICTING THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES WHILE DRIVING, AND SIMILAR LAWS HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE LAWS AND OTHER POTENTIAL LAWS PROHIBITING OR RESTRICTING THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES COULD REDUCE DEMAND
FOR MOBILE PHONES GENERALLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE DEMAND FOR OUR APPLICATIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN SALES OF OUR APPLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF MOBILE PHONE USE AND THE RESULTS
OF SOME OF THE STUDIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE THAT MOBILE PHONE USE CAUSES ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LINK BETWEEN THE USE OF MOBILE PHONE SERVICES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND ANY MEDIA REPORTS SUGGESTING SUCH A LINK,
COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR MOBILE PHONES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE DEMAND FOR OUR APPLICATIONS. 
 
 17 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 OUR INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE KEYS TO OUR PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENT, TRADEMARK, COPYRIGHT AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS. WE ALSO USE TECHNICAL MEASURES, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. 
 
 WE RELY ON COPYRIGHT LAWS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO PROTECT THE SOURCE CODE FOR OUR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS AND LIMIT
ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. THE STEPS WE TAKE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND THE AGREEMENTS WE ENTER INTO FOR THAT
PURPOSE MIGHT NOT BE ENFORCEABLE. A THIRD PARTY MIGHT OBTAIN AND USE OUR SOFTWARE OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR DEVELOP SIMILAR SOFTWARE INDEPENDENTLY. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO POLICE THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR
TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE GLOBAL NATURE OF THE INTERNET MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE ULTIMATE DESTINATION OR SECURITY OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER TRANSMITTED DATA. THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROVIDE US WITH ADEQUATE OR EFFECTIVE
PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION FOR INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 
 
 OTHERS MAY INITIATE CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR INFRINGING ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO COSTLY LITIGATION RELATING TO SUCH INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE
DAMAGES OR LICENSE FEES IF WE SETTLE OR ARE FOUND CULPABLE IN SUCH LITIGATION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM OFFERING PRODUCTS THAT RELY ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS FOUND TO
HAVE BEEN INFRINGED BY US. WE ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE OFFERING THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS WHILE A DETERMINATION AS TO INFRINGEMENT IS CONSIDERED. THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD CAUSE A DECREASE IN OUR OPERATING INCOME AND REDUCE OUR AVAILABLE CASH FLOW,
WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. 
 
 WE MAY EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR DELAYS IN SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LICENSE THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. 
 
 WE RELY ON TECHNOLOGY THAT WE LICENSE FROM THIRD PARTIES. THESE THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LICENSES MIGHT NOT CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN
THESE LICENSES ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, WE COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN COMPLETING AND DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 
 YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY TRADING AND OBTAINING QUOTATIONS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 OUR COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY QUOTED ON THE OVER THE COUNTER BULLETIN BOARD, OR OTCBB, UNDER THE SYMBOL SITO.OB AND IS NOT ACTIVELY TRADED. AS A RESULT, A STOCKHOLDER MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DISPOSE OF, OR TO
OBTAIN ACCURATE QUOTATIONS OF THE PRICE OF, THE COMMON STOCK. THIS SEVERELY LIMITS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMMON STOCK, AND WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK AND ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL
CAPITAL. 
 
 THE TRADING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OTCBB AND THE POTENTIAL DESIGNATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS A PENNY STOCK COULD IMPACT THE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
 OUR SECURITIES, AS TRADED ON THE OTCBB, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SEC RULES THAT IMPOSE SPECIAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS WHO SELL THESE SECURITIES TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS OR ACCREDITED
INVESTORS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RULE, THE PHRASE ACCREDITED INVESTORS MEANS, IN GENERAL TERMS, INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF 5,000,000, OR INDIVIDUALS HAVING A NET WORTH IN EXCESS OF 1,000,000 OR HAVING AN ANNUAL
INCOME THAT EXCEEDS 200,000 (OR THAT, WHEN COMBINED WITH A SPOUSE S INCOME, EXCEEDS 300,000). FOR TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THE RULE, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL SUITABILITY DETERMINATION FOR THE PURCHASER AND RECEIVE THE
PURCHASER S WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION BEFORE THE SALE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE RULE MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PURCHASERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN ANY MARKET THAT
MIGHT DEVELOP THEREFORE. 
 
 18 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 IN ADDITION, THE SEC HAS ADOPTED A NUMBER OF RULES TO REGULATE PENNY STOCK THAT RESTRICT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE SECURITIES. SUCH RULES INCLUDE RULES 3A51-1, 15G-1, 15G-2, 15G-3, 15G-4, 15G-5, 15G-6, 15G-7,
AND 15G-9 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. THESE RULES MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LIQUIDITY OF PENNY STOCKS. PENNY STOCKS GENERALLY ARE EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A PRICE OF LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE (OTHER
THAN SECURITIES REGISTERED ON CERTAIN NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES OR QUOTED ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET IF CURRENT PRICE AND VOLUME INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS IN SUCH SECURITIES IS PROVIDED BY THE EXCHANGE OR SYSTEM). BECAUSE OUR
SECURITIES MAY CONSTITUTE PENNY STOCK WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE RULES, THE RULES WOULD APPLY TO US AND TO OUR SECURITIES. 
 
 STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ACCORDING TO THE SEC, THE MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS FROM PATTERNS OF FRAUD AND ABUSE. SUCH PATTERNS INCLUDE (I) CONTROL OF THE MARKET FOR THE SECURITY BY ONE OR
A FEW BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE OFTEN RELATED TO THE PROMOTER OR ISSUER; (II) MANIPULATION OF PRICES THROUGH PREARRANGED MATCHING OF PURCHASES AND SALES AND FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES; (III) BOILER ROOM PRACTICES INVOLVING
HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND UNREALISTIC PRICE PROJECTIONS BY INEXPERIENCED SALES PERSONS; (IV) EXCESSIVE AND UNDISCLOSED BID-ASK DIFFERENTIALS AND MARKUPS BY SELLING BROKER-DEALERS; AND (V) THE WHOLESALE DUMPING OF THE SAME SECURITIES BY
PROMOTERS AND BROKER-DEALERS AFTER PRICES HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED TO A DESIRED LEVEL, RESULTING IN INVESTOR LOSSES. OUR MANAGEMENT IS AWARE OF THE ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HISTORICALLY IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN A
POSITION TO DICTATE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MARKET OR OF BROKER-DEALERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET, MANAGEMENT WILL STRIVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS TO PREVENT THE DESCRIBED PATTERNS FROM BEING ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO OUR
SECURITIES. 
 
 THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BECOME VOLATILE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOSSES BY INVESTORS AND COSTLY SECURITIES LITIGATION. 
 
 THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO FACTORS SUCH AS: 

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS; 
 
 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 
 
 ANNOUNCEMENTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS; 
 
 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY; 
 
 ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL; 
 
 INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; 
 
 SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES IN THE OPEN MARKET; AND 
 
 OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 

THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS, AND THE MARKET PRICES OF STOCK IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE. IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE
OF A COMPANY S SECURITIES, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS OFTEN BEEN INITIATED AGAINST THE COMPANY. LITIGATION INITIATED AGAINST US, WHETHER OR NOT SUCCESSFUL, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENT S
ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO POTENTIAL FUTURE APPRECIATION ON THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO RETAIN ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR PAYMENT OF ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE
AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS, CASH NEEDS, GROWTH PLANS AND THE TERMS OF ANY CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT WE MAY BE A PARTY
TO AT THE TIME. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT PAY DIVIDENDS, OUR STOCK MAY BE LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT WILL ONLY OCCUR IF AND TO THE EXTENT OUR STOCK PRICE APPRECIATES, WHICH MAY NEVER OCCUR. IN ADDITION, INVESTORS MUST RELY ON SALES
OF THEIR COMMON STOCK AFTER PRICE APPRECIATION AS THE ONLY WAY TO REALIZE THEIR INVESTMENT, AND IF THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK DOES NOT APPRECIATE, THEN THERE WILL BE NO RETURN ON INVESTMENT. INVESTORS SEEKING CASH DIVIDENDS SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OUR
COMMON STOCK. 
 
 19 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 SECURITIES ANALYSTS MAY NOT INITIATE COVERAGE OR CONTINUE TO COVER OUR COMMON STOCK AND THIS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS MARKET PRICE. 
 
 THE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK WILL DEPEND ON THE RESEARCH AND REPORTS THAT SECURITIES ANALYSTS PUBLISH ABOUT US AND OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THESE ANALYSTS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT
SECURITIES ANALYSTS WILL COVER OUR COMMON STOCK. IF SECURITIES ANALYSTS DO NOT COVER OUR COMMON STOCK, THE LACK OF RESEARCH COVERAGE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS MARKET PRICE. IF WE ARE COVERED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND OUR STOCK IS DOWNGRADED, OUR
STOCK PRICE WOULD LIKELY DECLINE. IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE ANALYSTS CEASES TO COVER US OR FAILS TO PUBLISH REGULAR REPORTS ON US, WE COULD LOSE VISIBILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE OR TRADING VOLUME TO DECLINE.

YOU MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF YOUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS BECAUSE OF THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR PREFERRED STOCK. 
 
 IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ISSUE OUR AUTHORIZED BUT PREVIOUSLY UNISSUED EQUITY SECURITIES, RESULTING IN THE DILUTION OF THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR PRESENT STOCKHOLDERS. WE ARE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE AN AGGREGATE OF
205,000,000 SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK CONSISTING OF 200,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND 5,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WITH PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS TO BE DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, THERE WERE 59,505,504
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AND 54,962,958 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE ON CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES. WE MAY ALSO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE
CONVERTIBLE INTO OR EXERCISABLE FOR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH HIRING OR RETAINING EMPLOYEES, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE SALES OF OUR SECURITIES FOR CAPITAL RAISING PURPOSES, OR FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ANY SUCH
ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CREATE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, WARRANTS OR OTHER CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES IN THE FUTURE IN
CONJUNCTION WITH ANY CAPITAL RAISING EFFORTS, INCLUDING AT A PRICE (OR EXERCISE PRICES) BELOW THE PRICE AT WHICH SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE CURRENTLY QUOTED ON THE OTCBB. 
 
 SUBSTANTIAL FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO FALL. 
 
 UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT WE MAY FILE WITH RESPECT TO THE RESALE OF SHARES HELD BY CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MAY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR SALE. SALES
OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET COULD HARM THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. A REDUCED MARKET PRICE FOR OUR SHARES COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH FUTURE OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK.

MOREOVER, AS ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK BECOME AVAILABLE FOR RESALE IN THE OPEN MARKET (INCLUDING SHARES ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS), THE SUPPLY OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED SHARES WILL
INCREASE, WHICH COULD DECREASE ITS PRICE. 
 
 SOME OF OUR SHARES MAY ALSO BE OFFERED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET PURSUANT TO RULE 144, AND THESE SALES MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE MARKET FOR OUR SHARES. IN GENERAL, A PERSON WHO HAS HELD RESTRICTED
SHARES FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS MAY, UPON FILING WITH THE SEC A NOTIFICATION ON FORM 144, SELL INTO THE MARKET SHARES UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 1 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES. 
 
 OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONTROLLED BY INSIDERS. 
 
 OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THREE OTHER STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY BENEFICIALLY OWN APPROXIMATELY 99 OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2008; BASED ON 59,505,540 SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, THESE INSIDERS BENEFICIALLY OWN 76 OF THE COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. SUCH CONCENTRATED CONTROL OF THE COMPANY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
OUR PRINCIPAL SECURITY HOLDERS MAY BE ABLE TO CONTROL MATTERS REQUIRING APPROVAL BY OUR SECURITY HOLDERS, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. SUCH CONCENTRATED CONTROL MAY ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR
SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE EVENT WE MERGE WITH A THIRD PARTY OR ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS WHICH REQUIRE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. ACCORDINGLY, THESE CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL THE ELECTION OF ALL OF OUR
DIRECTORS AND THE APPROVAL OF ACTIONS FOR WHICH THE APPROVAL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS IS REQUIRED. IF YOU ACQUIRE OUR COMMON STOCK, YOU MAY HAVE NO EFFECTIVE VOICE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. 
 
 20 

SINGLE TOUCH SYSTEMS, INC. 
 
 EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION, OUR COMMON STOCK COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF KEY PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL CORPORATION LAW. 
 
 UNDER SECTION 2115 OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL CORPORATION LAW (THE CGCL ), CORPORATIONS NOT ORGANIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF KEY PROVISIONS OF THE CGCL. THIS DETERMINATION IS
BASED ON WHETHER THE CORPORATION HAS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH CALIFORNIA AND IF MORE THAN 50 OF ITS VOTING SECURITIES ARE HELD OF RECORD BY PERSONS HAVING ADDRESSES IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, WE WILL CONTINUE THE BUSINESS AND
OPERATIONS OF SINGLE TOUCH AND A MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, REVENUE AND PAYROLL WILL BE CONDUCTED IN, DERIVED FROM, AND PAID TO RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY S OWNERSHIP, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF THE CGCL. AMONG THE MORE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS ARE THOSE RELATING TO THE ELECTION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS, CUMULATIVE VOTING, STANDARDS OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, DISTRIBUTIONS, DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF SHARES,
STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS, APPROVAL OF CERTAIN CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, DISSENTERS' AND APPRAISAL RIGHTS, AND INSPECTION OF CORPORATE RECORDS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW ARE THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THE PARTNERSHIP BELIEVES ARE MATERIAL TO
THE LIMITED PARTNERS. THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OPERATE
IN A CONTINUALLY CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND, THEREFORE, NEW RISKS EMERGE
FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS SECTION CONTAINS SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FOR AN
EXPLANATION OF THE QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,
SEE ITEM 7.

(A) RISKS ARISING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE RULES GOVERNING LOW INCOME
 HOUSING TAX CREDITS

 LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE. IF A HOUSING
COMPLEX DOES NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42,
THEN THE HOUSING COMPLEX WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS.

 LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS MIGHT BE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED. THE LOCAL
GENERAL PARTNERS WILL CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS. NO OPINION OF COUNSEL WILL COVER THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF LOW
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THE IRS COULD CHALLENGE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME
HOUSING TAX CREDITS CLAIMED FOR ANY HOUSING COMPLEX UNDER ANY OF A NUMBER OF
PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42. A SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE
BY THE IRS WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS FROM
THE AMOUNT PAID FOR BY THE PARTNERSHIP.

 UNLESS A BOND IS POSTED OR A TREASURY DIRECT ACCOUNT IS ESTABLISHED, LOW
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS MAY BE RECAPTURED IF HOUSING COMPLEXES ARE NOT OWNED
AND OPERATED FOR 15 YEARS. HOUSING COMPLEXES MUST COMPLY WITH INTERNAL REVENUE
CODE SECTION 42 FOR THE 15-YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS WILL BE RECAPTURED WITH INTEREST TO THE EXTENT THAT A HOUSING COMPLEX IS
NOT RENTED AS LOW INCOME HOUSING OR IN SOME OTHER WAY DOES NOT SATISFY THE
REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 42 DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
FOR EXAMPLE, UNLESS A BOND IS POSTED OR A TREASURY DIRECT ACCOUNT IS
ESTABLISHED, RECAPTURE WITH INTEREST WOULD OCCUR IF:

 O A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP DISPOSED OF ITS INTEREST IN A HOUSING COMPLEX
 DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD, OR
 O THE PARTNERSHIP DISPOSED OF ITS INTEREST IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
 DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD.

FOR THESE PURPOSES, DISPOSITION INCLUDES TRANSFER BY WAY OF FORECLOSURE.

IT WILL BE UP TO THE PARTNERSHIP TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO POST A BOND. THERE IS
NO OBLIGATION UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT THE
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS MUST DO SO.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT RECAPTURE WILL NOT OCCUR. IF IT DOES, RECAPTURE
WILL BE OF A PORTION OF ALL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TAKEN IN PRIOR YEARS
FOR THAT HOUSING COMPLEX, PLUS INTEREST. DURING THE FIRST 11 YEARS OF THE
COMPLIANCE PERIOD, NON-COMPLIANCE RESULTS IN ONE-THIRD OF THE CREDITS UP TO THAT
POINT FOR THE PARTICULAR HOUSING COMPLEX BEING RECAPTURED, PLUS INTEREST.
BETWEEN YEARS 12 AND 15, THE RECAPTURE IS PHASED OUT RATABLY.

 SALES OF HOUSING COMPLEXES AFTER 15 YEARS ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS WHICH
MAY IMPACT A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP'S ABILITY TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX.
EACH LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP EXECUTES AN EXTENDED LOW INCOME HOUSING
COMMITMENT WITH THE STATE IN WHICH THE HOUSING COMPLEX IS LOCATED. THE EXTENDED
LOW INCOME HOUSING COMMITMENT STATES THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNERS MUST RENT THE HOUSING COMPLEX AS LOW
INCOME HOUSING. UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE COMMITMENT MUST BE FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS.

5

THE COMMITMENT ACTUALLY AGREED TO MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN 30 YEARS. IN
PRIORITIZING APPLICANTS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, MOST STATES GIVE
ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR COMMITMENT PERIODS IN EXCESS OF 30 YEARS. ON ANY SALE OF
THE HOUSING COMPLEX DURING THE COMMITMENT PERIOD, THE PURCHASER WOULD HAVE TO
AGREE TO CONTINUE TO RENT THE HOUSING COMPLEX AS LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR THE
DURATION OF THE COMMITMENT PERIOD. THIS REQUIREMENT REDUCES THE POTENTIAL
MARKET, AND POSSIBLY THE SALES PRICE, FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. THE SALE OF A
HOUSING COMPLEX MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL
LENDERS OR SUBSIDIZERS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE A PURCHASE OF
A HOUSING COMPLEX. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP WILL BE ABLE TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX. EVEN IF IT DOES SO, THERE
CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO
THE LIMITED PARTNERS. AS A RESULT, A MATERIAL PORTION OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING
TAX CREDITS MAY REPRESENT A RETURN OF THE MONEY ORIGINALLY INVESTED IN THE
PARTNERSHIP.

 LIMITED PARTNERS CAN ONLY USE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS IN LIMITED
AMOUNTS. THE ABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER NON-CORPORATE LIMITED PARTNER TO
CLAIM LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ON HIS INDIVIDUAL TAX RETURN IS LIMITED.
FOR EXAMPLE, AN INDIVIDUAL LIMITED PARTNER CAN USE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS TO REDUCE HIS TAX LIABILITY ON:

 O AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF PASSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS INCOME FROM ENTITIES SUCH
 AS THE PARTNERSHIP, AND
 O 25,000 IN INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES.

HOWEVER, THE USE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS BY AN INDIVIDUAL AGAINST
THESE TYPES OF INCOME IS SUBJECT TO ORDERING RULES, WHICH MAY FURTHER LIMIT THE
USE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. SOME CORPORATE LIMITED PARTNERS ARE
SUBJECT TO SIMILAR AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. THEY INCLUDE CORPORATIONS WHICH
PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICES, AND CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE OWNED BY FIVE OR FEWER
SHAREHOLDERS.

ANY PORTION OF A LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT WHICH IS ALLOWED TO A LIMITED
PARTNER UNDER SUCH RULES IS THEN AGGREGATED WITH ALL OF THE LIMITED PARTNER'S
OTHER BUSINESS CREDITS. THE AGGREGATE IS THEN SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL LIMITATION
ON ALL BUSINESS CREDITS. THAT LIMITATION PROVIDES THAT A LIMITED PARTNER CAN USE
BUSINESS CREDITS TO OFFSET THE LIMITED PARTNER'S ANNUAL TAX LIABILITY EQUAL TO
 25,000 PLUS 75 OF THE LIMITED PARTNER'S TAX LIABILITY IN EXCESS OF 25,000.
HOWEVER, BUSINESS CREDITS MAY NOT BE USED TO OFFSET ANY ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.
ALL OF THESE CONCEPTS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED.

(B) RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND HOUSING
 COMPLEXES

 BECAUSE THE PARTNERSHIP HAS FEW INVESTMENTS, EACH INVESTMENT WILL HAVE A
GREAT IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIP'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ANY SINGLE HOUSING
COMPLEX EXPERIENCING POOR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, IMPAIRMENT OF VALUE OR
RECAPTURE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON
THE PARTNERSHIP AS A WHOLE.

 THE FAILURE TO PAY MORTGAGE DEBT COULD RESULT IN A FORCED SALE OF A
HOUSING COMPLEX. EACH LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP LEVERAGES THE PARTNERSHIP'S
INVESTMENT THEREIN BY INCURRING MORTGAGE DEBT. A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP'S
REVENUES COULD BE LESS THAN ITS DEBT PAYMENTS AND TAXES AND OTHER OPERATING
COSTS. IF SO, THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE TO USE WORKING CAPITAL
RESERVES, SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDS, OR SUFFER A FORCED SALE OF ITS HOUSING COMPLEX,
WHICH COULD INCLUDE A FORECLOSURE. THE SAME RESULTS COULD OCCUR IF GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDIES CEASED. FORECLOSURE WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF THE PARTNERSHIP'S
CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE HOUSING COMPLEX. FORECLOSURE COULD ALSO RESULT IN A
RECAPTURE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, AND A LOSS OF LOW INCOME HOUSING
TAX CREDITS FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FORECLOSURE OCCURS. IF THE HOUSING COMPLEX
IS HIGHLY-LEVERAGED, A RELATIVELY SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE RENTAL REVENUES COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP'S ABILITY TO PAY ITS DEBT SERVICE
REQUIREMENTS. MORTGAGE DEBT MAY BE REPAYABLE IN A SELF-AMORTIZING SERIES OF
EQUAL INSTALLMENTS OR WITH A LARGE BALLOON FINAL PAYMENT. BALLOON PAYMENTS
MATURING PRIOR TO THE END OF THE ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE HOUSING
COMPLEX CREATE THE RISK OF A FORCED SALE IF THE DEBT CANNOT BE REFINANCED. THERE
CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP IF NEEDED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

 THE PARTNERSHIP DOES NOT CONTROL THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND MUST
RELY ON THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS. THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS WILL MAKE ALL
MANAGEMENT DECISIONS FOR THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND THE HOUSING
COMPLEXES. THE PARTNERSHIP HAS VERY LIMITED RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT OF
THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE ANY
CONTROL WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP BUSINESS DECISIONS AND
OPERATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SUCCESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP WILL DEPEND ON THE
ABILITIES OF THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS.

6

HOUSING COMPLEXES SUBSIDIZED BY OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL RULES WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AND SELL HOUSING
COMPLEXES. SOME OR ALL OF THE HOUSING COMPLEXES RECEIVE OR MAY RECEIVE
GOVERNMENT FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES IN ADDITION TO LOW INCOME HOUSING
TAX CREDITS. THE FOLLOWING ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME SUCH SUBSIDY PROGRAMS:

 O OBTAINING TENANTS FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS LIMIT
 THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO CAN RENT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THESE REGULATIONS MAY
 MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RENT THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS IN THE HOUSING
 COMPLEXES.
 O OBTAINING RENT INCREASES. IN MANY CASES RENTS CAN ONLY BE INCREASED WITH
 THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE SUBSIDIZING AGENCY.
 O LIMITATIONS ON CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT MAY BE
 DISTRIBUTED TO OWNERS OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES IS LESS THAN THE
 AMOUNT THAT COULD BE EARNED BY THE OWNERS OF NON-SUBSIDIZED HOUSING
 COMPLEXES.
 O LIMITATIONS ON SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE HOUSING COMPLEXES. A LOCAL
 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ITS HOUSING COMPLEX OR TO
 REFINANCE ITS MORTGAGE LOAN WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE SUBSIDIZER.
 THE SUBSIDIZER MAY WITHHOLD SUCH APPROVAL IN THE DISCRETION OF THE
 SUBSIDIZER. APPROVAL MAY BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION
 THAT THE PURCHASER CONTINUES TO OPERATE THE PROPERTY AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING
 FOR TERMS WHICH COULD BE AS LONG AS 30 YEARS OR MORE. IN ADDITION, ANY
 PREPAYMENT OF A MORTGAGE MAY RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF A PREPAYMENT
 PENALTY.
 O LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE
 PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ITS INTEREST IN A LOCAL LIMITED
 PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE SUBSIDIZER. THE SUBSIDIZER
 MAY WITHHOLD SUCH APPROVAL IN THE DISCRETION OF THE SUBSIDIZER. APPROVAL
 MAY BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS.
 O LIMITATIONS ON REMOVAL AND ADMISSION OF LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS. THE
 PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO REMOVE A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER FROM A LOCAL
 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP EXCEPT FOR CAUSE, SUCH AS THE VIOLATION OF THE RULES
 OF THE SUBSIDIZER. REGULATIONS MAY PROHIBIT THE REMOVAL OF A LOCAL GENERAL
 PARTNER OR PERMIT REMOVAL ONLY WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE SUBSIDIZER.
 REGULATIONS MAY ALSO REQUIRE APPROVAL OF THE ADMISSION OF A SUCCESSOR
 LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER EVEN UPON THE DEATH OR OTHER DISABILITY OF A LOCAL
 GENERAL PARTNER.
 O LIMITATIONS ON SUBSIDY PAYMENTS. SUBSIDY PAYMENTS MAY BE FIXED IN AMOUNT
 AND SUBJECT TO ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS. THE RENTAL REVENUES OF A
 HOUSING COMPLEX, WHEN COMBINED WITH THE MAXIMUM COMMITTED SUBSIDY, MAY BE
 INSUFFICIENT TO MEET OBLIGATIONS. CONGRESS OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE, AS
 THE CASE MAY BE, MAY FAIL TO APPROPRIATE OR INCREASE THE NECESSARY
 SUBSIDY. IN THOSE EVENTS, THE MORTGAGE LENDER COULD FORECLOSE ON THE
 HOUSING COMPLEX UNLESS A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT COULD BE NEGOTIATED.
 O POSSIBLE CHANGES IN APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED
 WHICH ADVERSELY REVISES PROVISIONS OF OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE LOANS. SUCH
 LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ENACTED IN THE PAST.
 O LIMITED PARTNERS MAY NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS IF HOUSING COMPLEXES ARE
 SOLD. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT LIMITED PARTNERS WILL RECEIVE ANY CASH
 DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF A HOUSING COMPLEX. THE PRICE
 AT WHICH A HOUSING COMPLEX IS SOLD MAY NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH TO PAY THE
 MORTGAGE AND OTHER EXPENSES WHICH MUST BE PAID AT SUCH TIME. IF THAT
 HAPPENS, A LIMITED PARTNER'S RETURN MAY BE DERIVED ONLY FROM THE LOW
 INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES.

 UNINSURED CASUALTIES COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND RECAPTURE. THERE ARE
CASUALTIES WHICH ARE EITHER UNINSURABLE OR NOT ECONOMICALLY INSURABLE. THESE
INCLUDE EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, WARS AND LOSSES RELATING TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. IF A HOUSING COMPLEX EXPERIENCED AN UNINSURED CASUALTY,
THE PARTNERSHIP COULD LOSE BOTH ITS INVESTED CAPITAL AND ANTICIPATED PROFITS IN
SUCH PROPERTY. EVEN IF THE CASUALTY WERE AN INSURED LOSS, THE LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE UNABLE TO REBUILD THE DESTROYED PROPERTY. A PORTION OF
PRIOR TAX CREDITS COULD BE RECAPTURED AND FUTURE TAX CREDITS COULD BE LOST IF
THE HOUSING COMPLEX WERE NOT RESTORED WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. AND
LIABILITY JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP COULD EXCEED AVAILABLE
INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR OTHERWISE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. THE COST OF LIABILITY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE HAS INCREASED
IN RECENT YEARS. CASUALTY INSURANCE HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND MAY
REQUIRE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS.

7

HOUSING COMPLEXES WITHOUT FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES MAY BE UNABLE
TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES. IF A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WERE UNABLE TO PAY
OPERATING EXPENSES, ONE RESULT COULD BE A FORCED SALE OF ITS HOUSING COMPLEX. IF
A FORCED SALE OCCURS DURING THE FIRST 15 YEARS OF A HOUSING COMPLEX, A PARTIAL
RECAPTURE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS COULD OCCUR. IN THIS REGARD, SOME OF
THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS MAY OWN HOUSING COMPLEXES WHICH HAVE NO SUBSIDIES
OTHER THAN LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THOSE HOUSING COMPLEXES DO NOT HAVE
THE BENEFIT OF BELOW-MARKET-INTEREST-RATE FINANCING OR OPERATING SUBSIDIES WHICH
OFTEN ARE IMPORTANT TO THE FEASIBILITY OF LOW INCOME HOUSING. THOSE HOUSING
COMPLEXES RELY SOLELY ON RENTS TO PAY EXPENSES. HOWEVER, IN ORDER FOR ANY
HOUSING COMPLEX TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, IT MUST
RESTRICT THE RENT WHICH MAY BE CHARGED TO TENANTS. OVER TIME, THE EXPENSES OF A
HOUSING COMPLEX WILL INCREASE. IF A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP CANNOT INCREASE
ITS RENTS, IT MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES.

 THE PARTNERSHIP'S INVESTMENT PROTECTION POLICIES WILL BE WORTHLESS IF THE
NET WORTH OF THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THEIR
OBLIGATIONS. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS WILL BE UNABLE TO
PERFORM THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARTNERSHIP. THE GENERAL PARTNER HAS
NOT ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM NET WORTH REQUIREMENT FOR THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS.
RATHER, EACH LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER DEMONSTRATES A NET WORTH WHICH THE GENERAL
PARTNER BELIEVES IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE ASSETS OF THE LOCAL
GENERAL PARTNERS ARE LIKELY TO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS AND
SIMILAR ASSETS. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE TYPES OF ASSETS IS DIFFICULT TO
ESTIMATE. THESE TYPES OF ASSETS CANNOT BE READILY LIQUIDATED TO SATISFY THE
FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS WHICH THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNERS MAKE TO
THE PARTNERSHIP. MOREOVER, OTHER CREDITORS MAY HAVE CLAIMS ON THESE ASSETS. NO
ESCROW ACCOUNTS OR OTHER SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE
PERFORMANCE OF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER'S OBLIGATIONS. THE COST TO ENFORCE A
LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER'S OBLIGATIONS MAY BE HIGH. IF A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER DOES
NOT SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS THE PARTNERSHIP MAY HAVE NO REMEDY, OR THE REMEDY
MAY BE LIMITED TO REMOVING THE LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER AS GENERAL PARTNER OF THE
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.

 FLUCTUATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN REDUCE THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE. ANY
INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM FLUCTUATING ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY TO REALIZE A
PROFIT OR EVEN TO RECOVER INVESTED CAPITAL. AMONG THESE CONDITIONS ARE:

 O THE GENERAL AND LOCAL JOB MARKET,
 O THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF MORTGAGE FINANCING,
 O MONETARY INFLATION,
 O TAX, ENVIRONMENTAL, LAND USE AND ZONING POLICIES,
 O THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR SIMILAR PROPERTIES,
 O NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS,
 O THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF UTILITIES AND WATER.

(C) TAX RISKS OTHER THAN THOSE RELATING TO TAX CREDITS

IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY TO LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS, THERE ARE OTHER FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS AND THE OPERATIONS OF
THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED
TO, THE FOLLOWING:

 NO OPINION OF COUNSEL AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS. NO LEGAL OPINION IS OBTAINED
REGARDING MATTERS:

 O THE DETERMINATION OF WHICH DEPENDS ON FUTURE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
 O WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO INDIVIDUAL LIMITED PARTNERS, OR
 O WHICH ARE NOT CUSTOMARILY THE SUBJECT OF AN OPINION.

THE MORE SIGNIFICANT OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE:

 O ALLOCATING PURCHASE PRICE AMONG COMPONENTS OF A PROPERTY, PARTICULARLY AS
 BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND FIXTURES, THE COST OF WHICH IS DEPRECIABLE, AND THE
 UNDERLYING LAND, THE COST OF WHICH IS NOT DEPRECIABLE,
 O CHARACTERIZING EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS MADE TO OR BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR A
 LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,

8

O IDENTIFYING THE PORTION OF THE COSTS OF ANY HOUSING COMPLEX WHICH QUALIFY
 FOR HISTORIC AND OTHER TAX CREDITS,
 O APPLYING TO ANY SPECIFIC LIMITED PARTNER THE LIMITATION ON THE USE OF TAX
 CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES. LIMITED PARTNERS MUST DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES THE
 EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN USE TAX CREDITS AND TAX LOSSES, AND
 O THE APPLICATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX TO ANY SPECIFIC LIMITED
 PARTNER, OR THE CALCULATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX BY ANY LIMITED
 PARTNER. THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX COULD REDUCE THE TAX BENEFITS FROM AN
 INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, THEREFORE, THAT THE IRS WILL NOT CHALLENGE SOME OF
THE TAX POSITIONS ADOPTED BY THE PARTNERSHIP. THE COURTS COULD SUSTAIN AN IRS
CHALLENGE. AN IRS CHALLENGE, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON
THE PARTNERSHIP'S ABILITY TO REALIZE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.

 PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES WILL LIMIT DEDUCTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP'S LOSSES
AND IMPOSE TAX ON INTEREST INCOME. THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IMPOSES LIMITS ON
THE ABILITY OF MOST INVESTORS TO CLAIM LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE.
AN INDIVIDUAL MAY CLAIM THESE SO-CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES ONLY AS AN OFFSET TO
INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE OR RENTAL ACTIVITIES. AN INDIVIDUAL MAY
NOT CLAIM PASSIVE LOSSES AS AN OFFSET AGAINST OTHER TYPES OF INCOME, SUCH AS
SALARIES, WAGES, DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST. THESE PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES WILL
RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF MOST LIMITED PARTNERS TO USE LOSSES FROM THE PARTNERSHIP
AS AN OFFSET OF NON-PASSIVE INCOME.

 THE PARTNERSHIP MAY EARN INTEREST INCOME ON ITS RESERVES AND LOANS. THE
PASSIVE ACTIVITY RULES GENERALLY WILL CATEGORIZE INTEREST AS PORTFOLIO INCOME,
AND NOT PASSIVE INCOME. PASSIVE LOSSES CANNOT BE USED AS AN OFFSET TO PORTFOLIO
INCOME. CONSEQUENTLY, A LIMITED PARTNER COULD PAY TAX LIABILITY ON PORTFOLIO
INCOME FROM THE PARTNERSHIP.

 AT RISK RULES MIGHT LIMIT DEDUCTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP'S LOSSES. IF A
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FINANCING USED TO PURCHASE HOUSING COMPLEXES DOES NOT
CONSIST OF QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE FINANCING, THE "AT RISK" RULES WILL LIMIT A
LIMITED PARTNER'S ABILITY TO CLAIM PARTNERSHIP LOSSES TO THE AMOUNT THE LIMITED
PARTNER INVESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THE "AT RISK" RULES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE
CODE GENERALLY LIMIT A LIMITED PARTNER'S ABILITY TO DEDUCT PARTNERSHIP LOSSES TO
THE SUM OF:

 O THE AMOUNT OF CASH THE LIMITED PARTNER INVESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP, AND
 O THE LIMITED PARTNER'S SHARE OF PARTNERSHIP QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE
 FINANCING.

QUALIFIED NONRECOURSE FINANCING IS NON-CONVERTIBLE, NONRECOURSE DEBT WHICH IS
BORROWED FROM A GOVERNMENT, OR WITH EXCEPTIONS, ANY PERSON ACTIVELY AND
REGULARLY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF LENDING MONEY.

 TAX LIABILITY ON SALE OF A HOUSING COMPLEX OR LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
INTEREST MAY EXCEED THE CASH AVAILABLE FROM THE SALE. WHEN A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP SELLS A HOUSING COMPLEX IT WILL RECOGNIZE GAIN. SUCH GAIN IS EQUAL
TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN:

 O THE SALES PROCEEDS PLUS THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS SECURED BY THE HOUSING
 COMPLEX, AND
 O THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEX. THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR A
 HOUSING COMPLEX IS ITS ORIGINAL COST, PLUS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, MINUS
 DEPRECIATION.

SIMILARLY, WHEN THE PARTNERSHIP SELLS AN INTEREST IN A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
THE PARTNERSHIP WILL RECOGNIZE GAIN. SUCH GAIN IS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN:

 O THE SALES PROCEEDS PLUS THE PARTNERSHIP'S SHARE OF THE AMOUNT OF
 INDEBTEDNESS SECURED BY THE HOUSING COMPLEX, AND
 O THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR THE INTEREST. THE ADJUSTED BASIS FOR AN INTEREST IN
 A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IS THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE INTEREST, PLUS
 INCOME ALLOCATIONS AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS, LESS LOSS ALLOCATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, GAIN WILL BE INCREASED BY THE DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS TAKEN DURING
THE HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE HOUSING COMPLEX. IN SOME CASES, A LIMITED PARTNER
COULD HAVE A TAX LIABILITY FROM A SALE GREATER THAN THE CASH DISTRIBUTED TO THE
LIMITED PARTNER FROM THE SALE.

9

ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX LIABILITY COULD REDUCE A LIMITED PARTNER'S TAX
BENEFITS. IF A LIMITED PARTNER PAYS ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX, THE LIMITED PARTNER
COULD SUFFER A REDUCTION IN BENEFITS FROM AN INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THE
APPLICATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IS PERSONAL TO EACH LIMITED PARTNER.
TAX CREDITS MAY NOT BE UTILIZED TO REDUCE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX LIABILITY.

 IRS COULD AUDIT THE RETURNS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, THE LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS OR THE LIMITED PARTNERS. THE IRS CAN AUDIT THE PARTNERSHIP OR A
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AT THE ENTITY LEVEL WITH REGARD TO ISSUES AFFECTING
THE ENTITY. THE IRS DOES NOT HAVE TO AUDIT EACH LIMITED PARTNER IN ORDER TO
CHALLENGE A POSITION TAKEN BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.
SIMILARLY, ONLY ONE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING CAN BE FILED TO CONTEST AN IRS
DETERMINATION. A CONTEST BY THE PARTNERSHIP OF ANY IRS DETERMINATION MIGHT
RESULT IN HIGH LEGAL FEES.

 AN AUDIT OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ALSO COULD
RESULT IN AN AUDIT OF A LIMITED PARTNER. AN AUDIT OF A LIMITED PARTNER'S TAX
RETURNS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS BOTH TO ITEMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE
PARTNERSHIP AND TO UNRELATED ITEMS. THE LIMITED PARTNER COULD THEN BE REQUIRED
TO FILE AMENDED TAX RETURNS AND PAY ADDITIONAL TAX PLUS INTEREST AND PENALTIES.

 A SUCCESSFUL IRS CHALLENGE TO TAX ALLOCATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR A
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WOULD REDUCE THE TAX BENEFITS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE
PARTNERSHIP. UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, A PARTNERSHIP'S ALLOCATION OF
INCOME, GAINS, DEDUCTIONS, LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS MUST HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC
EFFECT. SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT IS A HIGHLY-TECHNICAL CONCEPT. THE
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IS TWO-FOLD. IF A PARTNER WILL BENEFIT ECONOMICALLY FROM
AN ITEM OF PARTNERSHIP INCOME OR GAIN, THAT ITEM MUST BE ALLOCATED TO HIM SO
THAT HE BEARS THE CORRELATIVE TAX BURDEN. CONVERSELY, IF A PARTNER WILL SUFFER
ECONOMICALLY FROM AN ITEM OF PARTNERSHIP DEDUCTION OR LOSS, THAT ITEM MUST BE
ALLOCATED TO HIM SO THAT HE BEARS THE CORRELATIVE TAX BENEFIT. IF A
PARTNERSHIP'S ALLOCATIONS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT, THEN THE
PARTNERSHIP'S TAX ITEMS ARE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH PARTNER'S INTEREST
IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THE IRS MIGHT CHALLENGE THE ALLOCATIONS MADE BY THE
PARTNERSHIP:

 O BETWEEN THE LIMITED PARTNERS AND THE GENERAL PARTNER,
 O AMONG THE LIMITED PARTNERS, OR
 O BETWEEN THE PARTNERSHIP AND A LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER.

IF ANY ALLOCATIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED, A GREATER SHARE OF THE INCOME
OR GAIN OR A LESSER SHARE OF THE LOSSES OR TAX CREDITS MIGHT BE ALLOCATED TO THE
LIMITED PARTNERS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE TAX LIABILITY OR REDUCE THE TAX
BENEFITS TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS.

 TAX LIABILITIES COULD ARISE IN LATER YEARS OF THE PARTNERSHIP. AFTER A
PERIOD OF YEARS FOLLOWING COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS BY A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP, THE LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MAY GENERATE PROFITS RATHER THAN
LOSSES. A LIMITED PARTNER WOULD HAVE TAX LIABILITY ON HIS SHARE OF SUCH PROFITS
UNLESS HE COULD OFFSET THE INCOME WITH:

 O UNUSED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THE PARTNERSHIP OR OTHER INVESTMENTS, OR
 O CURRENT PASSIVE LOSSES FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS.

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIMITED PARTNER WOULD NOT RECEIVE A CASH DISTRIBUTION
FROM THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WHICH TO PAY ANY TAX LIABILITY.

 IRS CHALLENGE TO TAX TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURES COULD REDUCE LOSSES. THE
IRS MAY CONTEND THAT FEES AND PAYMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP:

 O SHOULD BE DEDUCTIBLE OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OR IN A LATER YEAR,
 O ARE EXCESSIVE AND MAY NOT BE CAPITALIZED OR DEDUCTED IN FULL,
 O SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED AND NOT DEDUCTED, OR
 O MAY NOT BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE BASIS FOR COMPUTING TAX CREDITS.

10

ANY SUCH CONTENTION BY THE IRS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS:

 O THE ELIGIBLE BASIS OF A HOUSING COMPLEX USED TO COMPUTE LOW INCOME HOUSING
 TAX CREDITS,
 O THE ADJUSTED BASIS OF A HOUSING COMPLEX USED TO COMPUTE DEPRECIATION,
 O THE CORRECT DEDUCTION OF FEES,
 O THE AMORTIZATION OF ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING EXPENSES AND START-UP
 EXPENDITURES.

IF THE IRS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY SUCH CONTENTION, THE ANTICIPATED LOW INCOME
HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES OF THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE REDUCED, PERHAPS
SUBSTANTIALLY.

 CHANGES IN TAX LAW MIGHT REDUCE THE VALUE OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX
CREDITS. ALTHOUGH ALL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED TO A HOUSING
COMPLEX AT COMMENCEMENT OF THE 10-YEAR CREDIT PERIOD, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE
THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION MAY NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT AN INVESTMENT IN THE
PARTNERSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, LEGISLATION COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE VALUE OF LOW
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. IN THIS REGARD, BEFORE 1986, THE PRINCIPAL TAX
BENEFIT OF AN INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME HOUSING WAS TAX LOSSES. THESE TAX LOSSES
GENERALLY WERE USED TO REDUCE AN INVESTOR'S INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES ON A
DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN LOW INCOME HOUSING WERE MADE IN RELIANCE
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH TAX BENEFITS. HOWEVER, TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED IN
1986 SEVERELY CURTAILED DEDUCTION OF SUCH LOSSES.

 NEW ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW MIGHT REDUCE THE
VALUE OF TAX CREDITS. MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
RELATED TO LOW INCOME HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN
INTERPRETED BY THE IRS IN REGULATIONS, RULINGS OR PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS, OR BY
THE COURTS. IN THE FUTURE, THESE PROVISIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED OR CLARIFIED BY
THE IRS OR THE COURTS IN A MANNER ADVERSE TO THE PARTNERSHIP OR THE LOCAL
LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE IRS CONSTANTLY REVIEWS THE FEDERAL TAX RULES, AND CAN
REVISE ITS INTERPRETATIONS OF ESTABLISHED CONCEPTS. ANY SUCH REVISIONS COULD
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE
PARTNERSHIP.

 STATE INCOME TAX LAWS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LIMITED PARTNERS. A LIMITED
PARTNER MAY BE REQUIRED TO FILE INCOME TAX RETURNS AND BE SUBJECT TO TAX AND
WITHHOLDING IN EACH STATE OR LOCAL TAXING JURISDICTION IN WHICH: A HOUSING
COMPLEX IS LOCATED, THE PARTNERSHIP OR A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ENGAGES IN
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, OR THE LIMITED PARTNER IS A RESIDENT. CORPORATE LIMITED
PARTNERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY STATE FRANCHISE TAXES.

 THE TAX TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR ITEMS UNDER STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX LAWS
MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF SUCH ITEMS.
NONETHELESS, MANY OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT
IN THE PARTNERSHIP MAY ALSO APPLY UNDER STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX LAW. THE
PARTNERSHIP MAY BE REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD STATE TAXES FROM DISTRIBUTIONS OR INCOME
ALLOCATIONS TO LIMITED PARTNERS IN SOME INSTANCES.

(D) RISKS RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

 THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BE UNABLE TO TIMELY PROVIDE FINANCIAL REPORTS TO THE
LIMITED PARTNERS WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MONITOR
PARTNERSHIP OPERATIONS. EACH LOCAL GENERAL PARTNER IS REQUIRED TO RETAIN
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS AND TO REPORT FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE
PARTNERSHIP IN A TIMELY MANNER. THERE CANNOT BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE LOCAL
GENERAL PARTNERS WILL SATISFY THESE OBLIGATIONS. IF NOT, THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD
BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS IN A TIMELY MANNER ITS FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS. THAT WOULD IMPACT THE LIMITED PARTNERS' ABILITY TO
MONITOR PARTNERSHIP OPERATIONS. THE PARTNERSHIP'S FAILURE TO MEET ITS FILING
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 COULD REDUCE THE
LIQUIDITY FOR THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTNERSHIP. THE FAILURE TO FILE COULD ALSO RESULT IN
SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE SEC. ANY DEFENSE MOUNTED BY THE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FACE
OF SUCH SANCTIONS COULD ENTAIL LEGAL AND OTHER FEES, WHICH WOULD DIMINISH CASH
RESERVES.

 LACK OF LIQUIDITY OF INVESTMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A PUBLIC MARKET WILL
DEVELOP FOR THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS. ACCORDINGLY, LIMITED
PARTNERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR PARTNERSHIP UNITS PROMPTLY OR AT A
REASONABLE PRICE. PARTNERSHIP UNITS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A LONG-TERM
INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE PARTNERSHIP IS UNLIKELY TO SELL ANY LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS FOR AT LEAST 15 YEARS. PARTNERSHIP UNITS CANNOT BE
TRANSFERRED TO TAX-EXEMPT OR FOREIGN ENTITIES, OR THROUGH A SECONDARY MARKET.
THE GENERAL PARTNER CAN DENY EFFECTIVENESS OF A TRANSFER IF NECESSARY TO AVOID
ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES FROM THE TRANSFER. THE GENERAL PARTNER DOES NOT
ANTICIPATE THAT ANY PARTNERSHIP UNITS WILL BE REDEEMED BY THE PARTNERSHIP.

11

THE LIMITED PARTNERS WILL NOT CONTROL THE PARTNERSHIP AND MUST RELY
TOTALLY ON THE GENERAL PARTNER. THE GENERAL PARTNER WILL MAKE ALL MANAGEMENT
DECISIONS FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. MANAGEMENT DECISIONS INCLUDE EXERCISING POWERS
GRANTED TO THE PARTNERSHIP BY A LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. LIMITED PARTNERS HAVE
NO RIGHT OR POWER TO TAKE PART IN PARTNERSHIP MANAGEMENT.

INDIVIDUAL LIMITED PARTNERS WILL HAVE NO RECOURSE IF THEY DISAGREE WITH ACTIONS
AUTHORIZED BY A VOTE OF THE MAJORITY. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT GRANTS TO
LIMITED PARTNERS OWNING MORE THAN 50 OF THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS THE RIGHT TO:

 O REMOVE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ELECT A REPLACEMENT GENERAL PARTNER,
 O AMEND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT,
 O TERMINATE THE PARTNERSHIP.

ACCORDINGLY, A MAJORITY-IN-INTEREST OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS COULD CAUSE ANY SUCH
EVENTS TO OCCUR, EVEN IF LIMITED PARTNERS OWNING 49 OF THE PARTNERSHIP UNITS
OPPOSED SUCH ACTION.

 LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO THE PARTNERSHIP. THE
ABILITY OF LIMITED PARTNERS TO SUE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES IS
SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF THE
GENERAL PARTNER AND IT AFFILIATES TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS. THE GENERAL PARTNER
AND IT AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS FOR ACTS AND
OMISSIONS: PERFORMED OR OMITTED IN GOOD FAITH, AND PERFORMED OR OMITTED IN A
MANNER WHICH THE GENERAL PARTNER REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
ITS AUTHORITY AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS, PROVIDED SUCH
CONDUCT DID NOT CONSTITUTE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT.

THEREFORE, LIMITED PARTNERS MAY BE LESS ABLE TO SUE THE GENERAL PARTNER AND IT
AFFILIATES THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF SUCH PROVISIONS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.

 PAYMENT OF FEES TO THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS AFFILIATES REDUCES CASH
AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE GENERAL PARTNER AND
IT AFFILIATES PERFORM MANY SERVICES FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. THEY ARE PAID FEES FOR
THESE SERVICES, WHICH REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN
LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. ACCORDINGLY, AN INVESTOR INVESTING DIRECTLY IN A LOW
INCOME HOUSING APARTMENT COMPLEX WOULD HAVE A GREATER AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR
INVESTMENT THAN AN INVESTOR INVESTING IN LOW INCOME HOUSING THROUGH THE
PARTNERSHIP.

 ASSOCIATES AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE SERVING AS THE GENERAL PARTNERS OF MANY
OTHER PARTNERSHIPS. DEPENDING ON THEIR CORPORATE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THE
OFFICERS OF ASSOCIATES INITIALLY DEVOTE APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 50 OF THEIR TIME TO
THE PARTNERSHIP. THESE INDIVIDUALS SPEND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TIME DEVOTED TO THE
PARTNERSHIP AFTER THE INVESTMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP`S CAPITAL IN LOCAL LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS.

 THE INTERESTS OF LIMITED PARTNERS MAY CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE
GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE
COMMITTED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF MORE THAN 100 OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT
HAVE INVESTMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE GENERAL PARTNER AND
ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIP.

 ANTICIPATED FUTURE AND EXISTING CASH RESOURCES OF THE PARTNERSHIP ARE NOT
SUFFICIENT TO PAY EXISTING LIABILITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. HOWEVER,
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE EXISTING LIABILITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP ARE PAYABLE TO
THE GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES. THOUGH THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE
GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES ARE CONTRACTUALLY CURRENTLY PAYABLE, THE
PARTNERSHIP ANTICIPATES THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT
REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL CAPITAL RESERVES ARE
IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THEN EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND THEN
ANTICIPATED FUTURE FORESEEABLE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIP
WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SHOULD THE GENERAL PARTNER AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES
DEMAND CURRENT PAYMENT OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OR SUSPEND
SERVICES FOR THIS OR ANY OTHER REASON.

ANNUAL REPORT). EEF, THROUGH ITS PARENT COMPANIES PRIOR TO THE EEF ACQUISITION, WAS PREVIOUSLY CONTROLLED BY AN AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL. WE SUBSEQUENTLY RENAMED THE ACQUIRED EEF BUSINESS EXOPACK ADVANCED COATINGS EAC ). EAC IS ENGAGED IN RESEARCHING, DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING
PRECISION COATED FILMS AND SPECIALTY SUBSTRATES FOR IMAGING, ELECTRONICS, MEDICAL AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES. EAC CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS FROM OUR LOCATIONS IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND IN NORTH WALES, UNITED KINGDOM. ON NOVEMBER 28, 2007, WE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF DUPONT LIQUID PACKAGING SYSTEM S
PERFORMANCE FILMS BUSINESS SEGMENT LIQUI-BOX ), INCLUDING ITS WHITBY, ONTARIO, CANADA OPERATING FACILITY (THE EPF ACQUISITION ). THERE WAS NO MATERIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COMPANY AND LIQUI-BOX PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF
MATTERS RELATING TO THE EPF ACQUISITION. WE SUBSEQUENTLY RENAMED THE ACQUIRED LIQUI-BOX BUSINESS EXOPACK
PERFORMANCE FILMS EPF ). EPF IS ENGAGED IN RESEARCHING, DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING VALUE-ADDED FILMS USED PRIMARILY IN THE FOOD AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE CPG FINANCE, INC. IS

 OUR STRATEGY WE HAVE DEVELOPED A BUSINESS STRATEGY TARGETED AT INCREASING FUTURE REVENUE, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE. THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THIS STRATEGY ARE: LEVERAGING OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS . WE
ENJOY LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES HAS BEEN TO INTEGRATE OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO OUR CUSTOMERS OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE TAILORED TO OUR
CUSTOMERS SPECIFIC NEEDS. WE SEEK TO OFFER ENHANCED SERVICE AND SUPPORT, ANTICIPATING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDING VALUE-ADDED SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMER PROBLEMS. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN JOINT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS,
ALLOWING US TO MANAGE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES AND INCREASE INCENTIVES FOR CUSTOMERS TO REMAIN LOYAL TO US OVER THE LONG TERM. THE CONSOLIDATION AND SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS HAVE PROVIDED US WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CROSS-SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE. WE OFFER OUR DIVERSE ARRAY OF PAPER AND PLASTIC
PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MULTI-WALL BAGS, PRINTED AND LAMINATED ROLL STOCK, STAND-UP POUCHES AND COATED FILMS, IN THE FOLLOWING END MARKETS, AMONG OTHERS: FOOD MEDICAL PET FOOD PERSONAL CARE AND HYGIENE CHEMICALS BEVERAGES LAWN GARDEN PRODUCTS BUILDING MATERIALS ELECTRONICS EFFICIENTLY MANAGING OUR RAW MATERIAL SUPPLY. WE HAVE MULTIPLE SUPPLY SOURCES FOR PAPER, PLASTICS AND FILMS AND HAVE MAINTAINED THE MAJORITY OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR OVER A DECADE. AS ONE OF THE LARGEST FLEXIBLE PACKAGING CONVERTERS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE BELIEVE WE ARE OFTEN ABLE TO
USE OUR INCREASED SIZE TO SECURE VOLUME PRICING FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND EXPAND OUR PROCUREMENT REACH. WE ARE
CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE COSTS OF RAW MATERIALS, PACKAGING AND FREIGHT. TO FURTHER THESE OBJECTIVES, WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP BEST-IN-CLASS PROCUREMENT FUNCTIONS AND INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO RAW MATERIALS SOURCING, SUCH AS
INTERNAL AND GLOBAL SOURCING ARRANGEMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION AND STANDARDIZE THE USE OF RAW MATERIALS ACROSS FACILITIES. CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR PRODUCT MIX THROUGH STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY. OUR PRODUCTION
FACILITIES HAVE ALLOWED US TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTION FLEXIBILITY AND DEPENDABILITY. WE USE HIGH-PERFORMANCE MACHINERY AND A BROAD RANGE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES. RECENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE PRINTING PRESSES THAT CAN PRINT UP TO TEN COLORS,
HIGH EFFICIENCY PASTED VALVE MACHINES, CO-EXTRUDED BLOWN FILM EXTRUDERS, HEAT SEALABLE PAPER BAG LINE AND STAND-UP RE-SEALABLE POUCH MACHINES. WE BELIEVE THAT A KEY FACTOR THAT DIFFERENTIATES OUR SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS IS THE
STATE-OF-THE-ART GRAPHICS AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES OF OUR CUSTOMER RESOURCE CENTER, LOCATED AT OUR SPARTANBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA HEADQUARTERS. IN ADDITION, TO ENHANCE THE CONVENIENCE THAT WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO
ADD FEATURES SUCH AS HANDLES AND SOPHISTICATED PACKAGE RE-CLOSURE SYSTEMS. WE VIEW OUR ARRAY OF FACILITIES AND
ONGOING COMMITMENT TO STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY AS KEY DRIVERS IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN EXCEPTIONAL COMBINATION OF SERVICE, PERFORMANCE AND VALUE. STRATEGICALLY, WE PLAN TO GROW OUR REVENUE BASE BY PROVIDING CUSTOMIZED PACKAGING SOLUTIONS AND
BENEFITING FROM AN OVERALL TREND TOWARD FLEXIBLE, RATHER THAN RIGID, PACKAGING. REALIZING OPERATIONAL
EFFICIENCIES AND SYNERGIES. WE STRIVE TO CULTIVATE SAFE, EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING BY FOCUSING ON QUALITY AND OPERATIONAL PRACTICES. OUR EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES INCLUDE
ESTABLISHING COMMON OPERATING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES, STREAMLINING PRODUCTION, OPTIMIZING ASSET UTILIZATION, RATIONALIZING PRODUCT MIX AND MAKING STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR STRENGTHS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMPETITIVE
STRENGTHS: ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH BLUE CHIP CUSTOMERS. WE MAINTAIN STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH A DIVERSE BASE OF CUSTOMERS IN A WIDE ARRAY OF BUSINESSES. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 1,300 CUSTOMERS, AND EVEN WITH RECENT MARKET CONSOLIDATIONS, MOST OF
OUR CUSTOMERS INDIVIDUALLY REPRESENT LESS THAN 5 OF OUR NET SALES. ONLY ONE CUSTOMER EXCEEDED 10 OF OUR NET SALES FOR 2009. 3 
 COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES. PART OF OUR STRATEGY CONSISTS OF COMBINING THE FUNCTIONS SHARED BY OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND EXTRACTING SYNERGIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS BY IN-SOURCING
MANUFACTURING, IMPROVING PROCUREMENT (THROUGH INCREASED PURCHASING VOLUME AND EFFICIENCIES OF SCALE IN FREIGHT) AND ELIMINATING OPERATIONAL REDUNDANCIES (THROUGH REDUCING HEADCOUNT, RESTRUCTURING CERTAIN FACILITIES AND CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS). FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2008, WE COMPLETED THE MOVEMENT OF THE EAC BUSINESS OUT OF INTELICOAT S SOUTH HADLEY, MASSACHUSETTS FACILITY AND INTO THE EAC FACILITY WE ACQUIRED IN MATTHEWS, NORTH CAROLINA, AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE
WHITBY, CANADA PLANT PURCHASED FROM DUPONT INTO THE EXOPACK BUSINESS. THE INTEGRATION OF THE WHITBY FACILITY
RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE RELIED ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS OF CERTAIN FILMS FOR FLEXIBLE PACKAGING OPERATIONS WHICH ARE NOW BEING PROVIDED BY THE WHITBY FACILITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE EPF BUSINESS HISTORICALLY RELIED
ON THIRD PARTY CAPABILITIES FOR CERTAIN PRINT JOBS THAT ARE NOW BEING PRINTED BY ANOTHER EXOPACK FACILITY. ATTRACTIVE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS. ACCORDING TO THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ASSOCIATION FPA ), THE SIZE OF THE DOMESTIC FLEXIBLE PACKAGING INDUSTRY WAS ESTIMATED
TO BE APPROXIMATELY 25.7 BILLION IN ANNUAL SALES IN 2009, OF WHICH VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR AN ESTIMATED 20.0 BILLION IN SALES. THE VALUE-ADDED SEGMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE RETAIL SHOPPING BAGS, CONSUMER STORAGE BAGS
AND WRAPS, OR TRASH BAGS. THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING MARKET IS FRAGMENTED, WITH AN ESTIMATED 414 MANUFACTURERS
OPERATING IN NORTH AMERICA. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE MANUFACTURERS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL, WITH THE AVERAGE CONVERTER GENERATING ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 60.0 MILLION TO 65.0 MILLION, ACCORDING TO THE FPA. WE BELIEVE THAT AS A RESULT OF
CUSTOMER CONSOLIDATION, CERTAIN SECTORS REMAIN UNDERSERVED BY MID-SIZED COMPANIES AND THAT OUR COMPANY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MARKET OPPORTUNITY IN THESE GROWTH SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE KEY DRIVERS IN THE INDUSTRY INCLUDE THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF CONVENIENCE, FUNCTIONALITY AND SHELF-APPEAL, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, A TREND TOWARD FLEXIBLE RATHER THAN RIGID
PACKAGING, GLOBALIZATION, RAW MATERIAL COST VOLATILITY, IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING, AND PRESSURES TO CONSOLIDATE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROAD PRODUCT MIX, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AWARD WINNING PRINTING TECHNOLOGY, GLOBAL PRESENCE SUPPORTED BY GLOBAL
PACKAGING LINX AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES WILL ALLOW US TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE FAVORABLE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS. GLOBAL PACKAGING LINX GPL IS A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE WE DEVELOPED TO LEVERAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH
GLOBAL PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE GPL IS A UNIQUE INITIATIVE IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE GOAL OF GPL IS TO PROCURE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING SOLUTIONS FROM A SELECT NETWORK OF GLOBAL PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS WHEN IT PROVIDES VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. WE AIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GPL WHILE MAINTAINING EXOPACK'S VALUE COMMITMENTS FOR QUALITY, SERVICE, AND INNOVATION. THROUGH GPL, WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR MULTINATIONAL CUSTOMER BASE THAT
WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE VALUE THROUGH OUR OWN MIX OF DOMESTIC CONVERTED PACKAGING SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OFFSHORE PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDED BY OUR GLOBAL ALLIANCE PARTNERS. TO FURTHER THIS GOAL, EXOPACK SIGNED A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH LEBANON-BASED PACKAGING MANUFACTURER INDEVCO GROUP (INDEVCO)
TO MANUFACTURE CO-EXTRUDED POLYETHYLENE FILM IN THE MIDDLE EAST UNDER THE NAME CEDEX PLASTICS FLEXIBLE PACKAGING. EXOPACK AND INDEVCO HAVE SHARED A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP THROUGH GPL AND THE TWO COMPANIES SHARE COMMON COMPETENCIES IN
FILM PRODUCTION AND FLEXIBLE PACKAGING MANUFACTURE TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS FROM A GLOBAL SOURCING AND INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE. THIS JOINT VENTURE REPRESENTS THE STRENGTHENING OF THIS RELATIONSHIP AND WILL BRING THE FIRST COST-EFFECTIVE FILMS FROM
THE MIDDLE EAST TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA. THIS JOINT VENTURE IS THE INITIAL PHASE OF A LONGER-TERM STRATEGY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD MULTIPLE FILM PRODUCTION SITES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS WILL ALLOW EXOPACK AND INDEVCO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW
POLYMER MANUFACTURING CAPACITY COMING ON LINE IN THE MIDDLE EAST DUE TO THE INCREASED ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OF ETHYLENE PRODUCTION IN THIS REGION OF THE WORLD. THE CEDEX FILM WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY EXOPACK AS PART OF THE COMPANY S FAMILY OF FILM
PRODUCTS. HIGHLY EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JACK KNOTT, HAS OVER 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN
THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY, DURING WHICH HE SERVED AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF PLIANT CORPORATION, CHAIRMAN OF THE FPA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF HUNTSMAN PACKAGING CORPORATION (THE PREDECESSOR TO PLIANT CORPORATION) AND PRESIDENT OF
REXENE PRODUCTS (A PETROCHEMICAL AND POLYMER MANUFACTURER). WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM HIGHLY-MOTIVATED AND EXPERIENCED MANAGERS IN KEY FUNCTIONAL AREAS, INCLUDING SALES AND MARKETING, OPERATIONS, PROCUREMENT AND ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE. EACH OF OUR KEY
BUSINESS UNIT MANAGERS HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN THE PACKAGING AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. ABILITY TO
PASS THROUGH RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE CONTRACTS THAT PREVENT US FROM PASSING THROUGH RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES IMMEDIATELY,
HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS THROUGH RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, MAINTAINING A RELATIVELY STABLE SPREAD BETWEEN SELLING PRICE AND RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICE. MORE THAN 75 OF
OUR SALES VOLUME GENERATED IS UNDER CONTRACTS THAT TYPICALLY ALLOW US TO PASS THROUGH RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES/DECREASES EVERY 30 TO 90 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE PLASTIC BASED PACKAGING PRODUCTS AND EVERY 90 TO 180 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS THAT
PURCHASE PAPER BASED PACKAGING PRODUCTS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR BUSINESS IS TRANSACTIONAL, WHICH PERMITS US TO PASS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES/DECREASES TO CUSTOMERS ON AN ORDER-BY-ORDER BASIS. DIVERSIFIED RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIER BASE. WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MULTIPLE VENDORS IN OUR PAPER PACKAGING, PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS AND COATED PRODUCTS SE CTORS . WE CURRENTLY PURCHASE OUR RAW MATERIALS FROM MORE THAN TEN PAPER
SUPPLIERS, MORE THAN TWELVE PLASTICS SUPPLIERS, AND MORE THAN FIFTEEN COATED PRODUCTS SUPPLIERS . SINCE WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO SWITCH SUPPLIERS WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE DO NOT DEPEND
ON ANY SINGLE SUPPLIER TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND PROFITABLY. 4 
 BALANCE BETWEEN PAPER PACKAGING, PLASTIC PACKAGING AND COATED PRODUCTS.
 WE OFFER A DIVERSE ARRAY OF PAPER PACKAGING, PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS AND COATED PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS IN THESE THREE
PRINCIPAL SECTORS. WE BELIEVE WE OFFER A HIGH QUALITY AND DIVERSIFIED PRODUCT LINE. TYPICALLY, OUR FLEXIBLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS ARE CUSTOMIZED TO FIT PARTICULAR CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE MULTI-WALL CONSTRUCTION CAPABILITIES OF OUR PAPER
PACKAGING PRODUCTS ARE AMONG THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY. OUR PAPER PACKAGING PRODUCTS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHTS, RUN VOLUMES AND END-USE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS PINCH BAGS, TWO- AND THREE-PLY PASTED
VALVE BAGS, SEWN-OPEN-MOUTH BAGS, SELF-OPENING SACKS AND SPECIALTY BAGS, AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS. OUR PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS PRODUCTS CONSIST OF A VARIETY OF FILM STRUCTURES, PRINTING, EB TREATMENTS AND A NUMBER OF CONVERTING STYLES. OUR PLASTIC
PACKAGING AND FILMS PRODUCTS INCLUDE HIGH-CLARITY PRINTED SHRINK FILMS, SHIPPING SACKS, SIDE WELD BAGS, STAND-UP POUCHES AND LAMINATED ROLL STOCK WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF PRINTING OPTIONS. OUR COATED PRODUCTS CONSIST OF A VARIETY OF LAMINATIONS,
COATINGS AND OTHER TREATMENTS. OUR COATED PRODUCTS INCLUDE OPTICAL FILMS, MICROFILM, MEDICAL PRODUCTS, CONDUCTIVE FILMS AND FOILS, INK JET RECEPTIVE PRODUCTS AND PHOTOTOOL PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A REPUTATION FOR DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, IMPROVING THE SHELF-APPEAL OF OUR
CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS AND ENHANCING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUR RAVE BRAND OF PLASTIC-LAMINATED AND CONVERTED PLASTIC BAGS WITH EASY TO OPEN AND RECLOSE FEATURES FOR THE PET FOOD AND LAWN AND GARDEN MARKETS,
SPECIALTY PACKAGING FOR FEMININE CARE PRODUCTS, EXPRESS PV TWO-PLY CEMENT BAGS FOR OUR
CEMENT AND PACKAGED CONCRETE CUSTOMERS AND PAPER BAGS WITH RECLOSABLE ZIPPERS FOR POPULAR PET FOOD BRANDS. WE ALSO HOLD NUMEROUS PATENTS, HAVE OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING, AND POSSESS A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY CONSTRUCTIONS, COMPOSITIONS AND
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. IN ADDITION TO OUR EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, OUR IN-HOUSE GRAPHICS CENTER HAS EARNED SEVERAL INDUSTRY AWARDS FOR PRINT QUALITY AND INNOVATION. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW GENERAL.
 THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING AND COATING INDUSTRY MANUFACTURES A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING FOR USE IN DIVERSE END MARKETS. MULTI-LAYER FLEXIBLE
POLYMER/PAPER STRUCTURES AND BARRIER LAMINATES ARE USED FOR FOOD, MEDICAL, AGRICULTURAL AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS OTHER CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL USES, AND ARE USED IN A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT GENERALLY INCLUDE PLASTIC FILM, PAPER OR A
COMBINATION OF THE TWO. PLASTIC FILMS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF MARKET DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY, HAVE
BEEN INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS AND OFFER STRONG BARRIER PERFORMANCE, RE-CLOSEABILITY AND OUTSTANDING PRINT CHARACTERISTICS. PAPER PRODUCTS ARE VERSATILE AND SUPPORT VIBRANT GRAPHICS AND COLOR SCHEMES, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OFFERING
DURABILITY AND FRESHNESS RETENTION AS NECESSARY. MOREOVER, PAPER PRODUCTS ARE INCREASINGLY APPEALING TO CONSUMERS WHO PLACE EMPHASIS ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND VALUE THE ABILITY TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND THE OPTION TO RECYCLE SUCH PRODUCTS.
 ACCORDING TO THE FPA, THE DOMESTIC FLEXIBLE PACKAGING MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR AN ESTIMATED 25.7 BILLION IN SALES IN
2009, WITH INDUSTRY GROWTH RATES OF BETWEEN 2 AND 3 PROJECTED ANNUALLY. THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE ESTIMATED 414 FLEXIBLE PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS IN NORTH AMERICA. END MARKETS. WITH ITS VERSATILITY,
FAVORABLE COST PROFILE AND CONSIDERABLE SHELF-APPEAL COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL PACKAGING CONFIGURATIONS, FLEXIBLE PACKAGING HAS MADE, AND CONTINUES TO MAKE, INROADS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. THE FOCUS ON SUSTAINABLE
PACKAGING ALSO FAVORS THE REDUCED PACKAGING MATERIAL WEIGHT OF FLEXIBLE PACKAGING. APPROXIMATELY 85 OF END MARKET APPLICATIONS FOR DOMESTIC FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ARE CONSUMER AND INSTITUTION ORIENTED, WHILE APPROXIMATELY 8 OF THE OVERALL FLEXIBLE
PACKAGING MARKET STEMS FROM INDUSTRIAL USES FOR FLEXIBLE PACKAGING, PARTICULARLY IN THE AGRICULTURAL, BUILDING AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL FOOD AND BEVERAGE MARKETS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 56 OF ALL FLEXIBLE PACKAGING
APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 OF FLEXIBLE PACKAGING APPLICATIONS. VARIOUS OTHER APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL NON-FOOD PRODUCTS, ACCOUNT FOR
APPROXIMATELY 29 OF THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY FORECAST. GROWTH IN THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF TRENDS, INCLUDING: INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF CONVENIENCE, PORTABILITY, FUNCTIONALITY AND SHELF-APPEAL; TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO ENHANCEMENTS IN PACKAGING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES; ONGOING INDUSTRY CONVERSION FROM RIGID TO
FLEXIBLE PACKAGING; IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING; AND GLOBALIZATION. WE BELIEVE THAT LARGER PRODUCERS ARE PARTICULARLY WELL SITUATED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF SUCH TRENDS, GIVEN THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY SERVICE LARGER, NATIONAL CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION CAPACITY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES, BROAD PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND COMPETITIVE
PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, LARGER PRODUCERS HAVE RELATIVELY GREATER PURCHASING LEVERAGE THAN SMALLER PRODUCERS AND CAN MORE EASILY MARSHAL RESOURCES TO PURSUE SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION STRATEGIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONSOLIDATION IN 2005 AND ACQUISITIONS
IN 2007 PROVIDE US WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FROM SUCH SIZE-RELATED ADVANTAGES. 5 
 COMPETITION THE BUSINESS OF SUPPLYING FLEXIBLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT SELL SIMILAR AND SUBSTITUTE PACKAGING PRODUCTS. WE COMPETE
PRINCIPALLY WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS OF FLEXIBLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS WHO OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND MAINTAIN PRODUCTION AND MARKETING FACILITIES DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. OUR MAJOR DOMESTIC COMPETITION INCLUDES BEMIS
COMPANY, INC., PRINTPACK, INC., HOOD PACKAGING GROUP, GRAPHIC PACKAGING CORP., SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY AND COATING EXCELLENCE INTERNATIONAL. OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE NORDENIA INTERNATIONAL AG, PEEL PLASTIC PRODUCTS LTD., MONDI GROUP,
BISCHOF AND KLEIN AND UFLEX. SEGMENTS OUR BUSINESS IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR PRIMARY PRODUCT SEGMENTS: PET FOOD AND SPECIALTY PACKAGING, FOOD AND SPECIALTY PACKAGING, PERFORMANCE PACKAGING AND COATED PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF THESE SEGMENTS ALLOW US TO SERVE AS A FULL-SERVICE PACKAGING PROVIDER TO OUR CUSTOMERS. PET FOOD AND SPECIALTY SEGMENT. THIS MARKET SEGMENT INCLUDES PACKAGING PRODUCTS WE SELL TO PRODUCERS OF
PRODUCTS SUCH AS PET FOOD, LAWN AND GARDEN, CHARCOAL, MICROWAVE POPCORN AND PET CARE PRODUCTS. WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PACKAGING STYLES, GRAPHICS, SPECIAL FEATURES AND COATINGS THAT HELP OUR CUSTOMERS MAXIMIZE PRODUCT APPEAL TO THEIR TARGET
MARKETS. WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS CUSTOM-ENGINEERED PAPER FOR GRAPHICS AND PROPRIETARY COATINGS FOR ADDITIONAL BARRIER PROTECTION, DEPENDING ON EACH CUSTOMER S PARTICULAR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND CONVENIENCE CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, OUR PLASTIC
OFFERING SUPPORTS BOTH HIGH FIDELITY GRAPHICS FOR LARGE FORMAT PACKAGING AS WELL AS BARRIER MATERIALS FOR MORE SENSITIVE PRODUCT NEEDS. FOOD AND SPECIALTY SEGMENT. THE FOOD AND SPECIALTY SEGMENT INCLUDES PACKAGING AND FILMS PRODUCTS WE SELL
TO PRODUCERS OF FOOD AND FROZEN FOOD, BEVERAGES, COFFEE, CANDY, PAPER TOWELS AND TISSUE, HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CONSUMER GOODS. WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PACKAGING STYLES, GRAPHICS, SPECIAL FEATURES AND COATINGS TO SUIT PARTICULAR CUSTOMER

FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING CUSTOMER DEMANDS. PRODUCT CONFORMANCE IS CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND MAINTAINED BY OUR
SUPERVISORS AND OUR KEY EQUIPMENT AND CRITICAL OPERATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY TRAINED, EXPERIENCED OPERATORS. INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT ARE DRIVEN BY INDUSTRY TRENDS, DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES, CUSTOMER NEEDS AND COST CONTAINMENT. GIVEN OUR DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE OUR BUSINESS DOES NOT TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL VARIATION. DUE TO THE HIGH DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION AT EACH OF OUR FACILITIES AND THE FACT THAT OUR PRODUCTION IS OFTEN CUSTOMER-DRIVEN, WE
PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE SHIP ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS BASED ON AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS, TYPICALLY USING THIRD-PARTY SHIPPING SOURCES TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS. WE PRODUCE OUR PAPER PACKAGING, PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS AND COATED PRODUCTS THROUGH THREE DISTINCT BUT SIMILAR MANUFACTURING
PROCESSES. IN SOME CASES WE MAY CROSS BETWEEN MANUFACTURING PLATFORMS TO PRODUCE COMPOSITE PRODUCTS WHICH CONTAIN BOTH PAPER AND FILM TECHNOLOGIES. EACH OF THE BUSINESS UNIT MARKET SEGMENTS CONTROLS OR HAS ACCESS TO THE FOLLOWING MANUFACTURING
PLATFORMS. PAPER PACKAGING . THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER
PACKAGING INVOLVES SEVERAL PROCESSES, INCLUDING PRINTING, TUBING AND BOTTOMING. PRINTING . FLAT FORM PAPER PRODUCTS ARE PRINTED USING EITHER ROTOGRAVURE OR FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINT METHODS. THE ROTOGRAVURE METHOD CONSISTS OF PRESSING ETCHED STEEL PLATES AGAINST FLAT FORM PAPER, USING A ROTARY PRESS TO TRANSFER THE PRINTS OR GRAPHICS FROM THE STEEL PLATES TO THE PAPER.
DURING THIS PROCESS, THE DESIRED IMAGE IS ETCHED ONTO A STEEL CYLINDER CREATING SMALL RECESSES, KNOWN AS CELLS, WHICH CARRY INK. THE ETCHED SURFACE OF THE ROTATING CYLINDER IS
THEN DIPPED INTO AN INK PAN WHICH FILLS THE CELLS WITH INK. SURPLUS INK IS WIPED OFF THE CYLINDER SURFACE, LEAVING INK ONLY IN THE CELLS. A SECOND ROTATING CYLINDER THEN PRESSES PAPER ONTO THE CYLINDER, AND THE INK IS TRANSFERRED ONTO THE PAPER. THE FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINT METHOD IS SIMILAR TO THE ROTOGRAVURE METHOD DESCRIBED ABOVE BUT UTILIZES FLEXIBLE PLATES THAT ARE DRAWN THROUGH A ROLLER TO APPLY INK AND GRAPHICS TO PAPER. ONCE PRINTED, THE
PAPER THEN UNDERGOES TUBING AND BOTTOMING PROCESSES. TUBING .
PRINTED PAPER IS CONVERTED TO TUBE FORM BY ROLLING AND SEAMING THE PAPER ALONG ONE SIDE. TUBING IS CRITICAL TO THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, AS MANY VALUE-ADDED FEATURES ARE ADDED TO
THE PRODUCT AT THIS STAGE, INCLUDING THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE FILM LAYERS, BARRIERS AND LAMINATIONS. FILM LAYERS HELP PROVIDE TUBED PAPER PACKAGING WITH GRAPHICS AND
SPECIFIC END-USE FEATURES. THE TUBING PROCESS IS FINALIZED WHEN THE SEAMED PAPER IS CUT BY MACHINE INTO INDIVIDUAL BAGS. BOTTOMING . BOTTOMING OF THE PAPER PACKAGING COMPLETES THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AT THIS STAGE, A PAPER
TUBE IS SEALED AT ONE END WITH HEAT OR PRESSURE-APPLIED ADHESIVES. SEWN-OPEN MOUTH BAGS ARE CUSTOMARILY SEALED WITH HEAVY-GAUGE FILAMENT THAT IS SEWN THROUGH THE PACKAGING. PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS . THE MANUFACTURE OF PLASTIC PACKAGING AND FILMS ALSO INVOLVES SEVERAL
PROCESSES, INCLUDING EXTRUSION, PRINTING, LAMINATION, SLITTING AND POUCHING. EXTRUSION . EXTRUSION RESULTS IN THE CREATION OF PLASTIC FILM, THE BASIS OF FLEXIBLE PLASTIC PACKAGING PRODUCTS. APPROPRIATE MACHINERY AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE A CONSISTENTLY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT. TO BEGIN, PLASTIC RESINS WITH VARIOUS PROPERTIES ARE BLENDED WITH ADDITIVES
TO CREATE A SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE COMPOUND, THE NATURE OF WHICH IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON END-MARKET USE AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCE. BLENDED RESIN COMPOUNDS ARE THEN SHAPED UNDER
HEAT AND PRESSURE TO CREATE A THIN PLASTIC FILM. MANY MANUFACTURING DYNAMICS, INCLUDING THE COMBINATION OF RESIN AND EXTRUSION METHODS, PRODUCE VARIATIONS IN COLOR, CLARITY, TENSILE STRENGTH, TOUGHNESS, THICKNESS, SHRINKABILITY, SURFACE FRICTION, TRANSPARENCY, SEALABILITY AND PERMEABILITY. EXTRUDED PLASTIC FILM CAN BE USED IN A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS. WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, EXTRUDE ALL OF OUR PLASTIC FILMS, SUCH AS PET AND OPP FILMS. EXTRUDED PRODUCT MAY RESULT IN SHEET OR TUBULAR FORM. 8 
 PRINTING . EXTRUDED PLASTIC
FILM CAN BE PRINTED. EXOPACK UTILIZES EITHER A ROTOGRAVURE OR FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTING PROCESS, SIMILAR TO THE ONES USED TO PRINT PAPER PACKAGING. LAMINATION. IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES, A PRODUCT NEEDS THE PROTECTION OF MORE THAN A
SINGLE PLASTIC FILM. IN THESE INSTANCES, ADDITIONAL LAYERS ARE BONDED TO THE PLASTIC FILM, WITH THE ADDED LAYERS CONSISTING OF MATERIALS, SUCH AS ORIENTED POLYESTER OR 
 ORIENTED POLYPROPYLENE, WHICH ARE STIFFER AND HARDER TO TEAR. THE FILM LAYERS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY APPLYING AN ADHESIVE TO ONE AND BRINGING IT INTO CONTACT WITH THE OTHER, BINDING THE TWO FILM LAYERS INTO ONE. THE LAMINATION PROCESS ALLOWS US TO MEET THE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT END USES. SLITTING
 . FINISHED PLASTIC FILM CAN BE PLACED IN RAZOR AND SHEAR-CUT SLITTING MACHINES THAT TAILOR THE FILM TO SIZES AND WIDTHS SPECIFIED BY THE CUSTOMER. SEVERAL OF OUR MACHINES ARE ABLE TO STORE KEY MACHINE SETTINGS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTS IN A HIGH LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY AND MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY. POUCH/BAG CONVERTING. PRINTED AND/OR LAMINATED FILMS CAN BE CONVERTED INTO A VARIETY OF STYLES WITH RE-CLOSABLE FEATURES, HANDLES OR OTHER
REQUIRED PACKAGE ELEMENT. COATED PRODUCTS . THE
MANUFACTURE OF COATED PRODUCTS ALSO INVOLVES SEVERAL PROCESSES, INCLUDING COATING AND LAMINATION. COATING. EXTRUDED PLASTIC FILM, FOIL, AND PAPER CAN BE COATED USING SLOT DIE, DIRECT GRAVURE, REVERSE GRAVURE AND PROPRIETARY COATING METHODS, USING LIQUID CRYSTAL, EXOTIC FILLED CERAMICS AND POLYAMIDES. ENERGY CURED COATINGS CAN BE USED OVER PRINTED PRODUCTS FOR GLOSS, PRINT PROTECTION OR
SURFACE DYNAMIC CONTROL. IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THESE PROCESSES AND INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, WE SHARE
PRODUCTION-RELATED BEST PRACTICES AMONG OUR FACILITIES AND CLOSELY MONITOR NUMEROUS QUALITY CONTROL AND PRODUCTION ANALYSIS METRICS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRACTICES, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED OUR EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. NUMEROUS
OTHER EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES ARE UNDERWAY IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE PROCESSES AND PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING: ESTABLISHING
COMPANY-WIDE OPERATING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES; FURTHER STREAMLINING PRODUCTION TO FOCUS EACH FACILITY S CORE EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURING
STRENGTHS; OPTIMIZING ASSET UTILIZATION AT EACH PLANT; AND STRATEGICALLY MAKING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE INITIATIVES SHOULD ENABLE US
TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE PROFITABILITY. MATERIALS WE USE POLYETHYLENE RESIN AND BARRIER FILMS, PAPER, INKS, ADHESIVES AND CHEMICALS, INCLUDING COATED AND UN-COATED WOVEN
POLYPROPYLENE, POLYESTER AND NYLON FILMS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE PURCHASE OUR RAW MATERIALS FROM A VARIETY OF SUPPLIERS AND DO NOT DEPEND ON ANY ONE SUPPLIER FOR OUR RAW MATERIAL NEEDS. WE ALSO PURCHASE FINISHED GOODS THROUGH GPL.
 WE NEGOTIATE PRICING AND CONTRACT TERMS WITH EACH SUPPLIER. WE ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS WITH THE BEST
POSSIBLE TERMS AND PRICING, AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OF OUR SUPPLIERS, SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE SUPPLIED RAW MATERIALS TO US FOR DECADES. WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR RAW MATERIALS PROCUREMENT PROCESS. TO THIS END, WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP BEST-IN-CLASS PROCUREMENT METHODS AND HAVE ADOPTED
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO RAW MATERIALS SOURCING, SUCH AS DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL GLOBAL AND INTERNAL SOURCING ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO LEVERAGE RAW MATERIALS PROCUREMENT AND STANDARDIZE RAW MATERIAL USAGE ACROSS OUR
COMPANY. TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OUR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING PAPER, PLASTIC AND COATINGS EXPERTISE TO SUIT OUR CUSTOMERS DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE ABLE TO USE OUR BROAD PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFER TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS FROM ONE
MARKET TO ANOTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR EXPERTISE IN PRODUCING ZIPPERED STAND-UP POUCHES FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY HAS HELPED US TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A NEW PATENTED RE-CLOSEABLE FEATURE ON MULTI-WALL BAGS FOR PET FOOD. WE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY
DEVELOPED OUR RAVE TM COMPOSITE LINE OF PREMADE BAGS. THROUGH UNIQUE SUBSTRATE COMBINATIONS
THESE ROBUST BAGS OFFER LESS DAMAGE TO THE RETAILER AND LOWER OVERALL COST FOR THE PACKAGED GOODS COMPANY. MANY OF
OUR CUSTOMERS WORK WITH OUR TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVES TO DELIVER MORE COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. WE HAVE ENHANCED OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL SERVICE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND BY
 HELPING SUCH CUSTOMERS IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF THEIR PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE PRODUCT QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY FOR THEIR OWN
CUSTOMERS, OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT CHANGE SUPPLIERS OFTEN, AS SUPPLIER CHANGES CAN BE RISKY, EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. 9

ITEM 1A. 

RISK FACTORS OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY ONE OR MORE
OF THE RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND DISCUSSED BELOW THE KEY RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS, THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN OR THAT ARE
NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, INDUSTRY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS WELL AS OTHER VARIABLES AFFECTING
OUR OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO AND THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT SHOULD BE READ IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW. INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. THE BUSINESS OF SUPPLYING FLEXIBLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM MANY DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE EXTENSIVE
PRODUCTION FACILITIES, WELL DEVELOPED SALES AND MARKETING STAFFS AND GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FROM A NUMBER OF LOCAL MANUFACTURERS SPECIALIZING IN THE PRODUCTION OF A LIMITED GROUP OF
PRODUCTS, WHICH THEY MARKET NATIONALLY. THIS RESULTS IN COMPETITION THAT IS EXTREMELY PRICE SENSITIVE. WE ALSO COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF QUALITY, SERVICE, TIMELY DELIVERY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF OUR PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL
PRICING PRESSURES, REDUCED SALES AND LOWER MARGINS. AN INCREASE IN COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL SELLING PRICE REDUCTIONS OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF POLYETHYLENE RESIN AND PAPER, TWO OF OUR PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIALS, AND OUR
ABILITY TO PASS ON POLYETHYLENE RESIN AND PAPER PRICE INCREASES TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIALS THAT
WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE POLYETHYLENE RESIN AND PAPER. OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY DEPENDS, IN LARGE PART, ON THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS. THE PRICE FOR POLYETHYLENE RESIN FLUCTUATES SUBSTANTIALLY AS
A RESULT OF CHANGES IN PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, DEMAND AND THE CAPACITIES OF THE COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE POLYETHYLENE RESIN TO MEET MARKET NEEDS. PRICES FOR PAPER DEPEND ON THE INDUSTRY S CAPACITY UTILIZATION AND THE COSTS OF RAW
MATERIALS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RELATIVELY QUICKLY PASS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL
INCREASES AND DECREASES IN THE COST OF POLYETHYLENE RESIN AND PAPER THROUGH CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROMPTLY PASS COST INCREASES THROUGH IN THE FUTURE AND THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN
POLYETHYLENE RESIN OR PAPER PRICES, OUR OPERATING MARGINS COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY. FURTHERMORE, NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS HURRICANES, IN ADDITION TO TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS, OR A SUBSTANTIAL
INCREASE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY CAPACITY OF OUR RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIERS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PAPER INDUSTRIES. THIS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS OR SUPPLY SHORTAGES, WHICH MAY
HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PASS ALONG THE INCREASED COSTS IN OUR SELLING PRICES OR, IN THE CASE OF A SHORTAGE, SECURE RAW MATERIALS FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES. OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A RECESSION AND OUR CUSTOMERS' ACCESS TO CREDIT. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GLOBALLY AND IN THE LOCATIONS WHERE WE DO
BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA. A RECESSION IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS OR GLOBALLY OR PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS THAT RESULT IN DECLINING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR OUR
PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. INDEED, AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT COMMENCED IN LATE 2008 AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE DATE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DECREASED DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, MANY
OF OUR CUSTOMERS RELY ON ACCESS TO CREDIT TO FUND THEIR OPERATIONS. THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY REDUCING OUR
SALES, INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BAD DEBTS AND REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY. 12 
 THE CURRENT NEGATIVE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MARKET INSTABILITY ALSO MAKES
IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR US, OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR SUPPLIERS TO FORECAST DEMAND TRENDS. A CONTINUED DECLINE IN DEMAND COULD PLACE FURTHER FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF ANY CHANGES TO CURRENTLY
PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS IS UNCERTAIN AND SUPPLY AND DEMAND MAY BE UNBALANCED AT ANY TIME. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF BUSINESS CYCLES OR THEIR EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, AND CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES AS TO THE TIMING, EXTENT OR DURATION OF THE CURRENT OR FUTURE BUSINESS CYCLES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO
THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM NONPAYMENT OR NONPERFORMANCE BY OUR CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE UNABLE TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US WHEN THEY BECOME DUE AND MAY INITIATE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. OUR CREDIT PROCEDURES AND POLICIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO ELIMINATE CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK. OUR
CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND LIQUIDATIONS. THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE EXPERIENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INDUSTRY AND IN THE
ECONOMY GENERALLY MAY INCREASE OUR RISK IN EXTENDING TRADE CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS. A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP OR IN A CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL POSITION COULD CAUSE US TO LIMIT OR DISCONTINUE BUSINESS WITH THAT CUSTOMER, REQUIRE
US TO ASSUME MORE CREDIT RISK RELATING TO THAT CUSTOMER'S RECEIVABLES OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM THAT CUSTOMER, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND RELATED PROBLEMS AT OUR VENDORS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD RESULT
IN A DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE RELY ON NUMEROUS
VENDORS AND SUPPLIERS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO PROVIDE US WITH POLYETHYLENE RESIN, PAPER, PACKAGING MATERIALS AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ALONG WITH ENERGY SOURCES AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, FACILITIES, THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE
OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING OR MAY EXPERIENCE CASH FLOW PROBLEMS, WHICH COULD BE FURTHER AGGRAVATED BY RECESSIONARY INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, SOME OF THESE
COMPANIES MAY BE FORCED TO REDUCE THEIR OUTPUT, SHUT DOWN THEIR OPERATIONS OR FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR SOLVENCY PROBLEMS AT COMPANIES ON WHICH WE RELY COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE US
WITH THE RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY SOURCES OR FACILITIES THAT WE NEED, WHICH COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, IT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND REPLACEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS
WITHOUT INCURRING SIGNIFICANT DELAYS OR COST INCREASES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EQUITY MARKET WILL LIKELY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PENSION PLAN
ASSETS AND OUR FUTURE CASH FLOWS . IN
CONNECTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATION, WE ASSUMED CERTAIN PENSION ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS OF PENSION PLANS OF EXOPACK, LLC, REFERRED TO IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT AS THE PENSION PLANS, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE DISRUPTION IN GLOBAL CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR PENSION COSTS AND CAUSE A
CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN OUR CASH FLOW. OUR PENSION COSTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS RESULTING FROM ACTUAL PLAN EXPERIENCE AND ASSUMPTIONS OF FUTURE EXPERIENCE. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY MADE UP OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME
INVESTMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN ACTUAL EQUITY MARKET RETURNS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN GENERAL INTEREST RATES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OR DECREASED PENSION COSTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CURRENT DISCOUNT
RATES AND EXPECTED RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COULD ALSO INCREASE OR DECREASE PENSION COSTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY 1.4 MILLION TO ONE OF OUR PENSION PLANS IN 2010. HOWEVER, A DECLINE IN OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS AS A
RESULT OF VOLATILE EQUITY MARKET RETURNS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE FUTURE MINIMUM REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2011 AND FUTURE YEARS WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND OUR AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY.
 ENERGY PRICE INCREASES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE USE OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. ENERGY PRICES, IN PARTICULAR
PRICES RELATING TO OIL AND NATURAL GAS, HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY VOLATILE IN RECENT YEARS. INCREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES HAVE A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR PRODUCTION COSTS. HIGHER ENERGY COSTS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF OPERATION
BY INCREASING OUR COSTS FOR THE RAW MATERIALS THAT WE USE TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE
PACKAGING INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT REQUIRES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER STATE-OF-THE-ART
SPECIALTY PACKAGING AND COATING SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS WHOSE PACKAGING NEEDS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING. OUR SUCCESS MAY DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, TIMELY
DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, OR ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS OR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS OR DEMANDS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGIES, REPLACE THEM AS QUICKLY AS OUR COMPETITORS OR DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW AND BETTER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. 13 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY FROM INFRINGEMENT. WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND UNPATENTED PROPRIETARY KNOW-HOW AND TRADE SECRETS
TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR KNOW-HOW, TRADE SECRETS
AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES AND OUR PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS MAY NOT AFFORD COMPLETE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIRD PARTIES MAY COPY OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN AND USE OUR PROPRIETARY
INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR OTHERWISE INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP EQUIVALENT OR SUPERIOR KNOW-HOW, TRADE SECRETS OR PRODUCTION METHODS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
MAINTAIN THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES, OUR PROFIT MARGINS COULD BE REDUCED AS COMPETITORS IMITATING OUR PRODUCTS COULD COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY AGAINST US IN THE PRICING OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE
ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND THIRD PARTIES FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INITIATE LITIGATION AGAINST US ASSERTING THAT OUR BUSINESS INFRINGES OR VIOLATES THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT HAVE THE VALUE THAT WE BELIEVE THEM TO HAVE AND OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHER, WE MAY NOT PREVAIL IN ANY SUCH LITIGATION AND THE RESULTS OR COSTS
OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY LITIGATION CONCERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, COULD BE PROTRACTED AND COSTLY AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REGARDLESS OF ITS OUTCOME. OUR OPERATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES.
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE, FOREIGN, PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE
LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS ON THE DISCHARGE AND EMISSION OF, AND ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR THE USE, DISPOSAL AND MANAGEMENT OF, REGULATED MATERIALS AND WASTE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP
OF, AND DAMAGE RESULTING FROM, PRESENT AND PAST SPILLS, DISPOSALS OR OTHER RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR MATERIALS. THESE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CAN BE COMPLEX AND MAY CHANGE OFTEN. THE COMPLIANCE EXPENSES CAN BE
SIGNIFICANT, AND VIOLATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, SUCH AS THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, ALSO KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, IN
THE UNITED STATES, IMPOSE STRICT, AND IN SOME CASES JOINT AND SEVERAL, LIABILITY ON SPECIFIED RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED SOIL, GROUNDWATER AND BUILDINGS, AND LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES AT A
WIDE RANGE OF PROPERTIES, SOMETIMES WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR CONTAMINATION AT PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN OR OPERATE, AS WELL AS AT OUR FORMER PROPERTIES OR OFF-SITE PROPERTIES WHERE WE MAY HAVE SENT HAZARDOUS
SUBSTANCES. AS A MANUFACTURER THAT USES AND HAS USED AND GENERATED LARGE QUANTITIES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, WE HAVE AN INHERENT RISK OF LIABILITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WITH RESPECT TO KNOWN AND
POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES OR AS A RESULT OF OUR OPERATIONS. WE COULD, IN THE FUTURE, INCUR A MATERIAL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS OR ANY CLAIMS CONCERNING
NONCOMPLIANCE, OR LIABILITY FROM CONTAMINATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS
WILL BE ENACTED IN THE FUTURE, HOW EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS WILL BE ADMINISTERED OR INTERPRETED OR WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS MAY BE FOUND TO EXIST AT OUR FACILITIES OR AT THIRD-PARTY SITES FOR WHICH WE ARE LIABLE. ENACTMENT OF
STRICTER LAWS OR REGULATIONS, STRICTER INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE REQUIREMENT TO UNDERTAKE THE INVESTIGATION OR REMEDIATION OF CURRENTLY UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT OUR OWN OR THIRD-PARTY SITES MAY REQUIRE US
TO MAKE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, HAVE CONSIDERED, OR ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER, LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTES. PROGRAMS HAVE INCLUDED, FOR EXAMPLE, MANDATING CERTAIN RATES OF RECYCLING AND/OR THE USE OF
RECYCLED MATERIALS, IMPOSING DEPOSITS OR TAXES ON PLASTIC PACKAGING MATERIAL AND REQUIRING RETAILERS OR MANUFACTURERS TO TAKE BACK PACKAGING USED FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES SIMILARLY AIMED AT REDUCING THE LEVEL
OF PLASTIC WASTES, COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN PLASTIC PACKAGING, RESULT IN GREATER COSTS FOR PLASTIC PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HAVE RESPONDED
TO THESE GOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES AND TO PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OF CONSUMERS BY USING CONTAINERS MADE IN WHOLE OR IN PART OF RECYCLED PLASTIC. FUTURE LEGISLATION AND INITIATIVES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE MATERIAL.
 ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING IF NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE DETERIORATION
OF THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS. GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO
BE, DISRUPTED AND VOLATILE, WHICH HAS CAUSED A SUBSTANTIAL DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS. IN PARTICULAR, THE COST OF RAISING MONEY IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WHILE THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FROM THOSE MARKETS GENERALLY HAS DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE STABILITY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY AND THE SOLVENCY OF COUNTERPARTIES
SPECIFICALLY, THE COST OF OBTAINING MONEY FROM THE CREDIT MARKETS GENERALLY HAS INCREASED AS MANY LENDERS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE INCREASED INTEREST RATES, ENACTED TIGHTER LENDING STANDARDS, REFUSED TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT AT MATURITY ON
TERMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO EXISTING DEBT, AND REDUCED, OR IN SOME CASES CEASED, TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO BORROWERS. 14 
 WE DO NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING
BEYOND OUR CURRENT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND
 CAPITAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, OUR NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED ON UNEXPECTED MARKET CONDITIONS, UNEXPECTED ACTIONS BY THE LENDERS UNDER OUR
SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, CHANGES TO OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, OR OTHER FACTORS. IF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS REMAINS LIMITED, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON
FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, COULD BE SEVERELY LIMITED. OUR INABILITY TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS TO US, OR AT ALL, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO SEEK SUCH FINANCING WOULD CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OR GROW OUR BUSINESS AND
COULD REQUIRE US TO PURSUE ACTIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE
SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. WE HAVE MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN
CANADA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND A JOINT VENTURE OPERATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THOSE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EXPOSURE TO LOCAL
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL AND, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND FOREIGN LAWS, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR LAWS. WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS IN OUR LABOR RELATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, UNIONS REPRESENTED 322 OF OUR EMPLOYEES, OR APPROXIMATELY 13 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED WORKFORCE. AT OUR BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN FACILITY, 139 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING
PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES, QUALITY CONTROL INSPECTORS AND DRIVERS, ARE COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON FEBRUARY 1, 2011. IN OUR TOMAH, WISCONSIN FACILITY, 113 EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON FEBRUARY 28, 2012. IN OUR MATTHEWS, NORTH CAROLINA FACILITY, 70 EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE 27, 2012. OUR FAILURE TO RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS COULD
RESULT IN LABOR DISRUPTIONS AND INCREASED LABOR COSTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE STRIKES, WORK STOPPAGES OR SLOWDOWNS IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUCH
EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. LOSS OF THIRD-PARTY
TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS UPON WHOM WE DEPEND OR INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR CAUSE A DISRUPTION IN OUR OPERATIONS. WE DEPEND UPON THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. STRIKES, SLOWDOWNS, TRANSPORTATION DISRUPTIONS OR OTHER CONDITIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION
INDUSTRY, SUCH AS INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS TIMING REQUIREMENTS. UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS. OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES DEPEND ON CRITICAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT, WHICH MAY, ON OCCASION, BE OUT OF SERVICE AS A RESULT OF UNANTICIPATED FAILURES. INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR PRODUCTION
CAPABILITIES WILL INEVITABLY INCREASE OUR PRODUCTION COSTS AND REDUCE OUR SALES AND EARNINGS FOR THE AFFECTED PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO EQUIPMENT FAILURES, OUR FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC LOSS DUE TO UNANTICIPATED EVENTS, SUCH AS
FIRES, EXPLOSIONS OR VIOLENT WEATHER CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, ANY INTERRUPTION IN PRODUCTION CAPABILITY MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS. WE MAY ALSO SUSTAIN
REVENUE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF ANY RECOVERIES WE MAKE UNDER ANY APPLICABLE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAY HAVE. IN ADDITION TO SUCH REVENUE LOSSES, LONGER-TERM BUSINESS DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. AN AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL CONTROLS US AND
MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH US IN THE FUTURE. AN AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL INDIRECTLY CONTROLS OUR SOLE
STOCKHOLDER. SUCH AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL, THEREFORE, HAS THE POWER TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT AFFECT US, INCLUDING APPOINTING MANAGEMENT AND APPROVING MERGERS, A SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND OTHER EXTRAORDINARY TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
SUCH AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL COULD CAUSE US TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO SELL REVENUE-GENERATING ASSETS, IMPAIRING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. SUCH AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL
COULD ALSO RECEIVE CERTAIN FEES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS UNDER A MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH US. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL IS IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AND MAY,
FROM TIME TO TIME, ACQUIRE AND HOLD INTERESTS IN BUSINESSES THAT COMPETE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH US. SUCH AFFILIATE OF SUN CAPITAL MAY ALSO PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, THOSE
ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US. 15 
 WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT
WE WILL BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND APPLY EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING UNDER APPLICABLE SEC RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 404 WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. IN ADDITION, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT WE WILL HAVE TO OBTAIN AN ANNUAL
ATTESTATION FROM OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM REGARDING OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 404 WILL REQUIRE THAT WE INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ACCOUNTING EXPENSE, WHICH MAY BE HIGHER THAN WE
EXPECT, AND THAT WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY IN THE FUTURE BE LIMITED BY A
VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: FAULTY HUMAN JUDGMENT AND SIMPLE ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR MISTAKES; FRAUDULENT ACTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE; INAPPROPRIATE
MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF PROCEDURES; AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY ENHANCEMENTS TO CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY STILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO ASSURE TIMELY AND
ACCURATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR IF WE OR OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE
MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, WE MAY FACE RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS. LOSS OF KEY INDIVIDUALS COULD
DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE EFFORTS OF CERTAIN KEY
INDIVIDUALS AND MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, INCLUDING JACK KNOTT, OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR KEY EMPLOYEES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE DO NOT CARRY KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WE
MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES. OUR FINANCIAL POSITION IS AFFECTED, IN PART, BY
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUBJECT TO VARIABLE INTEREST RATES. INCREASED INTEREST RATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE THAT WE ARE
OBLIGATED TO PAY ON BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MANY
FACTORS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH WE MAY HAVE LIMITED OR NO CONTROL MAY AFFECT OUR
PERFORMANCE AND PROFITABILITY. OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE OUR EARNINGS INCLUDE: LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
CASES AND PROCEEDINGS (WHETHER CIVIL, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL OR PRODUCT RELATED, OR CRIMINAL), SETTLEMENTS, JUDGMENTS, AND INVESTIGATIONS; DEVELOPMENTS OR ASSERTIONS BY OR AGAINST US RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
LICENSES; ADOPTION OF NEW, OR CHANGES IN, ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR PRACTICES AND THE APPLICATION OF SUCH POLICIES AND PRACTICES; CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX; CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER BUSINESS REORGANIZATIONS OR COMBINATIONS; INCREASE IN COST OF DEBT; ABILITY
TO RETAIN ADEQUATE LEVELS OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AT ACCEPTABLE RATES; FLUCTUATIONS IN PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS; LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS; RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND NEW FACILITIES;
TIMELY DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESSFUL MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS; PRICING OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; DISRUPTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN POTENTIALLY LESS STABLE EMERGING MARKETS; RELIABILITY OF UTILITY SERVICES;
IMPACT OF COMPUTER VIRUSES; GENERAL OR SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF PURCHASERS TO SUBSTITUTE OTHER PRODUCTS FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND INVENTORY STRATEGIES OF CUSTOMERS AND
SUPPLIERS; CREDIT RISKS; CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS; EMPLOYEE WORK STOPPAGES AT PLANTS; INCREASED COMPETITION; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE WORLD POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ESTIMATE
THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON FINANCIAL RESULTS; THE IMPACT OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVENTS ON THE ECONOMY AND ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS; AND ACTS OF WAR, TERRORISM, WEATHER, AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS. OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES.
 WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS OF
 288.6 MILLION, 220.0 MILLION OF WHICH CONSISTED OF OUR OUTSTANDING 11.25 SENIOR NOTES DUE 2014 (THE NOTES ), 68.6 MILLION OF WHICH CONSISTED OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, AND LESS THAN 0.1 MILLION OF WHICH CONSISTED
OF BORROWINGS UNDER A SUBORDINATED TERM LOAN. AFTER CONSIDERATION OF 68.6 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT OF 3.2 MILLION UNDER OUR 110.0 MILLION SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL 25.1 MILLION
AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. 16 
 OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES. FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD:
 LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, AND REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND IN OUR INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD MAKE US MORE VULNERABLE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE
NOTES; MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MEET ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS, WHO COULD THEN REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO RESTRUCTURE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, SELL ASSETS OR RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL; REQUIRE US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH WILL REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH FLOWS TO
FUND ACQUISITIONS, WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES; LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, EXECUTION OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES; PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS THAT HAVE
LESS DEBT; AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. ONE OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES. DESPITE CURRENT INDEBTEDNESS LEVELS, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY STILL BE ABLE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DEBT. THIS COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE
RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE ABLE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS IN THE
FUTURE. THE TERMS OF THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES DO NOT FULLY PROHIBIT US OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES FROM DOING SO. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD 25.1 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. IF NEW DEBT IS ADDED TO OUR
AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CURRENT DEBT LEVELS, THE RELATED RISKS THAT WE NOW FACE COULD INTENSIFY. SEE MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES CAPITAL RESOURCES. TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WE WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH. OUR ABILITY TO
GENERATE CASH DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON AND TO REFINANCE OUR
INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES, AND TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH. A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.
THESE FACTORS INCLUDE ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE, LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN PACKAGING DESIGNS, ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND ACTS OF GOD, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
MAY PRESENT PARTICULAR CHALLENGES IN OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH DUE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO ENABLE US TO PAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES, OR TO FUND OUR
OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IF OUR FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY OUR OBLIGATIONS AS THEY MATURE OR TO FUND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO REDUCE OR DELAY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,
SELL ASSETS, OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL OR RESTRUCTURE OR REFINANCE ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR DEBT, INCLUDING THE NOTES, ON OR BEFORE MATURITY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR ON
SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL. IN ADDITION, THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE NOTES, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICTS OUR OPERATIONS. THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND ISSUE CAPITAL STOCK OF RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES; INCUR
ADDITIONAL DEBT, INCUR LIENS OR ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK; PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS OR REPURCHASE OR REDEEM OUR STOCK OR SUBORDINATED
INDEBTEDNESS; MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS; ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RESTRICTING OUR SUBSIDIARIES ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS; AND ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH SUBSIDIARIES AND
AFFILIATES. THE INDENTURE AND OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN
COVENANTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND MAY INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN OTHER NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. 17 
 IF WE CANNOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR INDENTURE OR OUR SENIOR CREDIT
FACILITY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY IMMEDIATELY ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THEM. IF OUR DEBT PAYMENTS ARE ACCELERATED, OUR ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY REPAY OUR DEBT. OUR LENDERS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH
TO REPAY OUR DEBT, FORECLOSE UPON THEIR COLLATERAL OR PREVENT US FROM MAKING PAYMENTS TO OTHER CREDITORS ON CERTAIN PORTIONS OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER OF THESE PROVISIONS OR REFINANCE OUR DEBT, IF NEEDED. IN SUCH A CASE, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD
SUFFER.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

WE ARE A NEW ENTERPRISE ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING, DEVELOPING AND INTEGRATING SMALL PRIVATE COMPANIES AND PRODUCTS RELATED TO HEALTHCARE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND VARIED RISKS, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING OUR GOALS. IF ANY OF THESE RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASE, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AND INVESTORS COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

WE ARE AN EARLY STAGE COMPANY WITH NO OPERATING HISTORY. ACCORDINGLY, YOU WILL HAVE NO BASIS UPON WHICH TO EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. 

WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR POTENTIAL INVESTORS TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS OR PROSPECTIVE OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS PLAN INVOLVES THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATING COMPANIES PREDOMINATELY IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET AND IS SUBJECT TO ALL THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE INITIAL ORGANIZATION, FINANCING, EXPENDITURES, COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS INHERENT IN A NEW BUSINESS. INVESTORS SHOULD EVALUATE AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY COMPANIES DEVELOPING MARKETS FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN WHICH WE EXPECT TO INVEST. WE MAY NEVER OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES. 

IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS IS SPECULATIVE AND DEPENDS UPON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES ON BEHALF OF OUR AFFILIATE COMPANIES ON TERMS THAT WILL BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FOR US. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY. 

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THIS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE FUNDS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LENDERS, INVESTORS AND SUPPLIERS. 

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS EXPRESSED DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THIS INDICATES THAT OUR AUDITORS BELIEVE THAT SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT EXISTS REGARDING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL IN FACT OPERATE OUR BUSINESS PROFITABLY OR OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FINANCING TO SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS IN THE EVENT WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW. THE EXPRESSION OF SUCH DOUBT BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, OR OUR INABILITY TO OVERCOME THE FACTORS LEADING TO SUCH DOUBT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, LENDERS, INVESTORS AND SUPPLIERS, AND THEREFORE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND FUND OPERATIONS, WHICH ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. 

WE HAVE VERY LIMITED FUNDS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND FUND BUSINESS OPERATIONS LONG ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. OUR ULTIMATE SUCCESS MAY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED FROM ANY SOURCE OR, IF AVAILABLE, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US. 

WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURSUE SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS AND DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCINGS. FUTURE FINANCINGS THROUGH EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DILUTIVE TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. ALSO, THE TERMS OF SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE IN FUTURE CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR OUR NEW INVESTORS. NEWLY ISSUED SECURITIES MAY INCLUDE PREFERENCES, SUPERIOR VOTING RIGHTS, THE ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS OR OTHER DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, AND THE ISSUANCES OF INCENTIVE AWARDS UNDER EQUITY EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL DILUTIVE EFFECTS. FURTHER, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN PURSUING FUTURE CAPITAL AND/OR FINANCING, INCLUDING INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, LEGAL FEES, ACCOUNTING FEES, PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE NON-CASH EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE, SUCH AS CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND WARRANTS, WHICH WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN NEEDED FINANCING MAY BE IMPAIRED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, BOTH GENERALLY AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT PROFITABLE, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUTURE FINANCINGS. IF THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE ARE ABLE TO RAISE FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, TOGETHER WITH OUR REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS, IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS, EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REDUCE OUR OPERATIONS ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CEASE OPERATIONS. 

WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY WITH NO BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF OUR OWN AND MUST RELY ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR CREDITORS TO PAY CERTAIN EXPENSES. 

SPRING CREEK IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH NO BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF ITS OWN. OUR ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES. OUR COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE EARNINGS, CASH FLOW, DIVIDENDS, OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES WHICH IN ONE INSTANCE IS A MINORITY HOLDING, OR LOANS FROM CREDITORS. 

NO GUARANTEE OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE. 

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICE THAT WE ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP FOR OUR SELECTED INDUSTRY. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT HEALTHCARE MARKET PROFESSIONALS WILL CONCLUDE THAT OUR TECHNOLOGIES ARE USEFUL OR SAFE. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT MARKET ACCEPTANCE AMONG DISTRIBUTORS, PATIENTS, PHYSICIANS, OR HEALTHCARE PAYERS IN GENERAL, OR EVEN THAT ANY AND ALL NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS WILL BE OBTAINED. 

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS UPON WHICH WE MAY RELY ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, WHICH MAY DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS. 

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES AND TO IDENTIFY AND ENTER INTO COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO SELECT AND EVALUATE SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSUMMATE TRANSACTIONS IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THESE REALITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GROW. 

TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO USE THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TO ENTER INTO STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH MAY TAKE THE FORM OF JOINT VENTURES WITH PRIVATE PARTIES AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER RESOURCE COMPANIES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THESE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, OR IF ESTABLISHED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEM. IN ADDITION, THE DYNAMICS OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR EXPENSES OR UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES WE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE INCLINED TO IN ORDER TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THESE PARTNERS OR MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS. IF OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT ESTABLISHED OR MAINTAINED, OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH, WHICH MAY HARM OUR PROFITABILITY. 

OUR STRATEGY ENVISIONS EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING PROPRIETARY SOLUTIONS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. IF WE FAIL TO DO SO, AND THEREAFTER TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. GROWTH MAY PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES. WE MUST CONTINUE TO REFINE AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES, OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES AND OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING SOURCES. AS WE GROW, WE MUST HIRE, TRAIN, SUPERVISE AND MANAGE NEW EMPLOYEES. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO: 

MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS; 

EXPAND OUR SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY OR EFFICIENTLY OR IN A TIMELY MANNER; 

ALLOCATE OUR HUMAN RESOURCES OPTIMALLY; 

IDENTIFY AND HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES OR RETAIN VALUED EMPLOYEES; OR 

INCORPORATE EFFECTIVELY THE COMPONENTS OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR BUSINESSES THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE IN OUR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE GROWTH. 

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INEFFICIENCY, WHICH COULD DIMINISH OUR PROFITABILITY. 

OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF WE DO NOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED PERSONNEL. 

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE ABILITIES, EXPERTISE, JUDGMENT, DISCRETION, INTEGRITY AND GOOD FAITH OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL IN CONDUCTING OUR INTENDED BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE DEPEND ON MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES TO INTERPRET MARKET DATA CORRECTLY AND TO INTERPRET AND RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS TO LOCATE AND ADOPT APPROPRIATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. WE PRESENTLY HAVE A SMALL MANAGEMENT TEAM WHICH WE INTEND TO EXPAND IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR PLANNED OPERATIONS AND GROWTH. WE WILL HAVE TO ENSURE THAT MANAGEMENT AND ANY KEY EMPLOYEES ARE APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED; HOWEVER, THEIR SERVICES CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

7 

UNCERTAIN OUTCOMES DURING CLINICAL TESTING. 

OUTCOMES OF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR NEW PRODUCTS, IF REQUIRED, MAY PRODUCE UNEXPECTED OR UNDESIRED RESULTS THAT MAY EITHER DELAY OR ENTIRELY HALT A PRODUCT FROM REACHING THE MARKET. THIS WOULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IF A PRODUCT DOES NOT SURVIVE THE CLINICAL TESTING PHASE, OUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN THAT PRODUCT WOULD BE INVALIDATED AND ENTIRELY NEGATED. IN ADDITION, DELAYS IN CLINICAL TRIALS WOULD MEAN OUR PRODUCTS WOULD NOT REACH OUR END USERS FOR AN INDETERMINATE PERIOD, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. 

CLINICAL TRIALS MAY BE DELAYED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DELAYS IN OBTAINING A POTENTIAL TEST SITE TO COMMENCE OR CONTINUE A STUDY, DELAYS IN REACHING AGREEMENT ON ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL STUDY TERMS WITH PROSPECTIVE SITES, AND DELAYS IN RECRUITING PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A STUDY. 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGIES OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 

OUR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING PATENT PROTECTION AND TRADE SECRET PROTECTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES AS WELL AS SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING THESE PATENTS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY CHALLENGES. WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE BY THIRD PARTIES TO THE EXTENT THAT VALID AND ENFORCEABLE PATENTS OR TRADE SECRETS COVER THEM. FURTHERMORE, THE DEGREE OF FUTURE PROTECTION OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE LEGAL MEANS AFFORD ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION AND MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR PERMIT US TO GAIN OR KEEP OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY 

THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION, WHICH CAN RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, DELAYS, LIMITS ON ITS OPERATING FLEXIBILITY AND COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES. 

WHILE WE INTEND TO CONCENTRATE ON OVER-THE-COUNTER AND NONPRESCRIPTION TYPE HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PASS THOSE COSTS ON, IT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGIN. 

RECENTLY ENACTED HEALTHCARE INSURANCE LEGISLATION MAY LEAD TO UNINTENDED ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN OUR INDUSTRY. MASSIVE NEW LEGISLATION THAT GIVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GREATER REGULATORY POWERS MAY LEAD TO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. THE FULL SCOPE OF THE RECENTLY PASSED HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION MAY NOT BE FELT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IT IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT ANY FUTURE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGES TO OUR COMPANY, OR IF WE CAN OVERCOME THEM. 

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES. 

CERTAIN GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNOLOGIES IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET MAY REQUIRE LICENSURE OR MANDATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS RELATING TO THE PROVISION OF SERVICES. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND INTO NEW OR EXISTING MARKETS. FUTURE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS MAY ALSO CAUSE DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS. 

COMPETITION IN HEALTH AND BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

THE HEALTH AND BEAUTY CARE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN THIS INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE AGAINST A HEALTHY NUMBER OF LARGE AND ESTABLISHED BRANDS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE GREATER SOURCES OF CAPITAL AND CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THESE WELL-KNOWN COMPETITIVE BRANDS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER MARKETING BUDGETS TO PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS, AND HAVE FAR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAN WE DO. 

THERE IS FURTHER RISK IN THAT OUR RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS, ONCE ESTABLISHED, FREQUENTLY REASSESS THE ALLOCATION OF DISPLAY SPACE AND COULD ELECT TO REDUCE THE DISPLAY SPACE ALLOCATED TO OUR PRODUCTS, IF OUR MARKETING STRATEGIES ARE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN PLANNED, OR IF OUR PRODUCTS FAIL TO CONNECT WITH OUR TARGET CONSUMER. ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF DISPLAY SPACE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR ORGANIZATION 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WHICH CAN BE EXPENSIVE. 

WE ARE A PUBLIC REPORTING COMPANY AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUBJECT TO THE INFORMATION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. THE COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION WITH THE SEC AND FURNISHING AUDITED REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. 

IT IS TIME CONSUMING, DIFFICULT AND COSTLY FOR US TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES REQUIRED BY THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. WE MAY NEED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND OTHER FINANCE PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE INTERNAL CONTROLS REQUIREMENTS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT CERTIFICATIONS REQUIRED BY THAT ACT. 

8 

FAILURE TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TIMELY AND ACCURATELY. 

AS RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS OF OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS AND ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS. THIS IS MORE SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED IN ITEM 9A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFICIENCY, WE MUST PERFORM ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AND OTHER POST-CLOSING PROCEDURES TO INSURE THAT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. AS A RESULT, WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES AND DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. FURTHERMORE, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED. 

PUBLIC COMPANY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. 

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT AND RULES SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE SEC HAVE REQUIRED CHANGES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS INCREASES OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAKES CERTAIN ACTIVITIES MORE TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY THAN IF WE WERE NOT A PUBLIC COMPANY. AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, THESE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE FOR US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 

THERE EXIST RISKS TO STOCKHOLDERS RELATING TO DILUTION: AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES AND REDUCTION OF PERCENTAGE SHARE OWNERSHIP FOLLOWING INVESTMENT. 

TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE ISSUED, THE STOCKHOLDERS WOULD EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE COMPANY ISSUES A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OR FOLLOWING AN INVESTMENT, A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY MAY OCCUR WHICH MAY AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS, IF ANY. FURTHERMORE, THE ISSUANCE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES, IF ANY, FOR THE COMMON STOCK AND COULD IMPAIR THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS EQUITY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY USE CONSULTANTS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES OR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL . THESE CONSULTANTS OR THIRD PARTIES MAY BE PAID IN CASH, STOCK, OPTIONS OR OTHER SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, AND THE CONSULTANTS OR THIRD PARTIES MAY BE PLACEMENT AGENTS OR THEIR AFFILIATES. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE. 

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD FLUCTUATE WIDELY IN PRICE IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 

CHANGES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY; 

COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES; 

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN WORKING CAPITAL FINANCING; 

ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL; 

LIMITED PUBLIC FLOAT , IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOSE SALES OR LACK OF SALES, COULD RESULT IN POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE PRICING PRESSURE ON THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK; 

OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN; 

OPERATING RESULTS THAT FALL BELOW EXPECTATIONS; 

LOSS OF ANY STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP; 

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS; 

ECONOMIC AND OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS; AND 

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. 

IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES MARKETS HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR COMPANIES. THESE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS MAY ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 

WE HAVE NEVER PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE DOING SO IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WILL DEPEND ON EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING US AT SUCH TIME AS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY CONSIDER RELEVANT. IF WE DO NOT PAY DIVIDENDS, OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT WILL ONLY OCCUR IF OUR STOCK PRICE APPRECIATES. 

9 

THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND WE CANNOT ENSURE THAT ONE WILL EVER DEVELOP OR BE SUSTAINED. 

TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN AN ILLIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OTC BB FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE CURRENT IN THEIR REPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO THE SEC. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW LIQUID THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MIGHT BECOME. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY ELIGIBLE, WE INTEND TO APPLY FOR LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON EITHER THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET OR OTHER NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES IF AND WHEN WE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LISTING. WE CANNOT ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY SUCH LISTING STANDARDS OR THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR LISTING ON ANY OF THESE EXCHANGES. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO SATISFY THE INITIAL LISTING STANDARDS OF THE EXCHANGES, OR OUR COMMON STOCK IS OTHERWISE REJECTED FOR LISTING AND REMAIN LISTED ON THE OTC BB OR SUSPENDED FROM THE OTC BB, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD SUFFER AND THE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE LESS LIQUID AND OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED VOLATILITY. 

OUR COMMON STOCK IS DEEMED A PENNY STOCK , WHICH MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES. 

OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES ADOPTED UNDER SECTION 15(G) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE PENNY STOCK RULES APPLY TO COMPANIES WHOSE COMMON STOCK IS NOT LISTED ON A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE AND TRADES AT LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE OR THAT HAVE TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF LESS THAN 5,000,000 2,000,000 IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS). THESE RULES REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT BROKERS WHO TRADE PENNY STOCK TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS COMPLETE CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION, MAKE SUITABILITY INQUIRIES OF INVESTORS AND PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING TRADING IN THE SECURITY, INCLUDING A RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND QUOTE INFORMATION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. MANY BROKERS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TRADE PENNY STOCKS BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENNY STOCK RULES AND, AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF BROKER-DEALERS WILLING TO ACT AS MARKET MAKERS IN SUCH SECURITIES IS LIMITED. IF WE REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET, IF ANY, FOR OUR SECURITIES. IN AS MUCH AS OUR SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES, INVESTORS WILL FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DISPOSE OF OUR SECURITIES. 

OFFERS OR AVAILABILITY FOR SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. 

IF OUR STOCKHOLDERS SELL SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET, OR UPON THE EXPIRATION OF ANY HOLDING PERIOD UNDER RULE 144, OR EXPIRATION OF LOCK-UP PERIODS APPLICABLE TO OUTSTANDING SHARES, OR ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS OR WARRANTS, IT COULD CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS AN OVERHANG AND IN ANTICIPATION OF WHICH THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD FALL. THE EXISTENCE OF AN OVERHANG, WHETHER OR NOT SALES HAVE OCCURRED OR ARE OCCURRING, ALSO COULD MAKE MORE DIFFICULT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY OR EQUITY-RELATED SECURITIES IN THE FUTURE AT A TIME AND PRICE THAT WE DEEM REASONABLE OR APPROPRIATE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 OUR COMMON SHARES ARE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. PROSPECTIVE
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT BELOW. 
 WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY IMPLEMENTING A NEW
BUSINESS PLAN. 
 WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY WITH ONLY A LIMITED
OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH TO BASE AN EVALUATION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND
FUTURE PROSPECTS, AND WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. IF WE
DO DISCOVER OIL OR GAS RESOURCES IN COMMERCIALLY EXPLOITABLE QUANTITIES ON ANY
OF OUR PROPERTIES, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY TO
ESTABLISH THE EXTENT OF THE RESOURCE, DEVELOP PROCESSES TO EXTRACT IT AND
DEVELOP EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IF WE DISCOVER
A MAJOR RESERVE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH A RESERVE WILL BE LARGE
ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE
WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT ON A TIMELY BASIS. IF
WE CANNOT RAISE THE NECESSARY CAPITAL OR COMPLETE THE NECESSARY FACILITIES AND
INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO DRILL AN INITIAL TEST WELL ON THE PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THE FARMOUT
AGREEMENT WITHIN THE TIMELINE SET OUT IN THE AGREEMENT OR AT ALL. FAILURE TO DO
SO WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ALL OUR INTEREST IN THE FARMOUT AGREEMENT WITH
SEPL. 
 WE HAVE HAD NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND IF WE
ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FINANCING, OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS MAY FAIL.
 
 WE HAD A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF 833,727 AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2009. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO GENERATE ANY REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, EITHER FROM EQUITY OR DEBT
FINANCING, TO MAINTAIN OUR DAILY OPERATIONS AND TO DEVELOP ANY WELLS UNDER THE
FARMOUT AGREEMENT. OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF
FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS, INVESTOR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR
INTEREST PURSUANT TO THE FARMOUT AGREEMENT, AND INVESTOR SENTIMENT. FINANCING,
THEREFORE, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE MOST LIKELY
SOURCE OF FUTURE FUNDS PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US IS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY
CAPITAL. ANY SALE OF SHARE CAPITAL, HOWEVER, WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING
SHAREHOLDERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN REQUIRED, WE MAY
BE FORCED TO DELAY OUR PLAN OF OPERATION AND OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS MAY FAIL. 
 -6- 

WE CURRENTLY DO NOT GENERATE REVENUES, AND AS A RESULT, WE
FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE. 
 THE ONLY INTEREST IN PROPERTY WE HAVE IS PURSUANT TO THE
FARMOUT AGREEMENT. FROM THE DATE OF OUR INCORPORATION, WE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED
ON THE LOCATION AND ACQUISITION OF MINERAL AND OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. WE HAVE
NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES TO DATE. IN ORDER TO GENERATE REVENUES, WE WILL INCUR
SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES IN THE EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE INITIAL WELL. WE
THEREFORE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE
RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR
ACTIVITIES, OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS MAY FAIL. THERE IS NO HISTORY UPON WHICH TO BASE
ANY ASSUMPTION AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR PLAN OF
OPERATION, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE TO INVESTORS THAT WE WILL GENERATE
ANY OPERATING REVENUES OR ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. 
 OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT
ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY
TO OBTAIN FUTURE FINANCING. 
 WE INCURRED NET LOSS OF 3,433,469 AND A NET INCOME OF 109,951
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31,
2009, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF 5,236,087 AND A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL
OF 833,727. 
 THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY
TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, AS DESCRIBED IN THE EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH TO OUR
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. ALTHOUGH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, THEY
DO NOT REFLECT ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE
OUR BUSINESS. 
 IF WE ARE REQUIRED FOR ANY REASON TO REPAY OUR OUTSTANDING
SECURED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES OR ANY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED
TO DEPLETE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, IF AVAILABLE, OR RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS.
 
 IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY THE SECURED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
OR ANY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS FOR ANY REASON, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE OUR
LIMITED WORKING CAPITAL AND RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REPAY
THE SECURED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES OR ANY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS WHEN REQUIRED, WE
MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE
LENDERS COULD COMMENCE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST OUR COMPANY AND FORECLOSE ON ALL OF
OUR ASSETS TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS DUE. ANY SUCH SALE OR LEGAL ACTION WOULD
REQUIRE OUR COMPANY TO CURTAIL OR POSSIBLY CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. 
 MARKET CONDITIONS OR OPERATION IMPEDIMENTS MAY HINDER OUR
ACCESS TO OIL AND GAS MARKETS OR DELAY OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTION. 
 OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP THE FARMOUT ACREAGE DEPENDS IN PART UPON
THE AVAILABILITY, PROXIMITY AND CAPACITY OF PIPELINES, NATURAL GAS GATHERING
SYSTEMS AND PROCESSING FACILITIES. THIS DEPENDENCE IS HEIGHTENED WHERE THIS
INFRASTRUCTURE IS LESS DEVELOPED. THEREFORE, EVEN IF DRILLING RESULTS ARE
POSITIVE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, A NEW GATHERING SYSTEM
MAY NEED TO BE BUILT TO HANDLE THE POTENTIAL VOLUME OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED. WE
MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO SHUT IN WELLS, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY, FOR LACK OF A MARKET
OR BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUACY OR UNAVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. IF
THAT WERE TO OCCUR, WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO REALIZE REVENUE FROM THOSE WELLS UNTIL
ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO DELIVER PRODUCTION TO MARKET. 
 EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY OIL OR GAS RESERVES ON THE
FARMOUT ACREAGE, OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET OIL AND GAS IS AFFECTED AND
ALSO MAY BE HARMED BY: 

INADEQUATE PIPELINE TRANSMISSION FACILITIES OR CARRYING CAPACITY; 
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF NATURAL GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION; 
 
 GOVERNMENT TRANSPORTATION, TAX AND ENERGY POLICIES; 
 
 CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND; AND 
 -7- 

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 
 THE POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY OF OIL AND GAS VENTURES DEPENDS
UPON FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY. 
 THE POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES IS
DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. FOR INSTANCE, WORLD PRICES AND
MARKETS FOR OIL AND GAS ARE UNPREDICTABLE, HIGHLY VOLATILE, POTENTIALLY SUBJECT
TO GOVERNMENTAL FIXING, PEGGING, CONTROLS, OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE AND OTHER
FACTORS, AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN DOMESTIC, INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL, SOCIAL,
AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY,
THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUNDS FOR PRODUCTION AND OTHER EXPENSES HAVE BECOME
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO PROJECT. THESE CHANGES AND EVENTS
MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. 
 ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS CAN ALSO HINDER DRILLING OPERATIONS.
A PRODUCTIVE WELL MAY BECOME UNECONOMIC IN THE EVENT WATER OR OTHER DELETERIOUS
SUBSTANCES ARE ENCOUNTERED WHICH IMPAIR OR PREVENT THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND/OR
GAS FROM THE WELL. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION FROM ANY WELL MAY BE UNMARKETABLE IF
IT IS IMPREGNATED WITH WATER OR OTHER DELETERIOUS SUBSTANCES. THE MARKETABILITY
OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH MAY BE ACQUIRED OR DISCOVERED, WILL BE AFFECTED BY
NUMEROUS FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE PROXIMITY AND
CAPACITY OF OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, MARKET FLUCTUATIONS
OF PRICES, TAXES, ROYALTIES, LAND TENURE, ALLOWABLE PRODUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION. THESE FACTORS CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED AND THE COMBINATION OF
THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT IN OUR COMPANY NOT RECEIVING AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON
INVESTED CAPITAL. 
 OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE
REGULATION, WHICH MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS OR REQUIRE CAPITAL OUTLAYS IN
EXCESS OF THOSE ANTICIPATED CAUSING AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPANY. 
 OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL
LAWS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING LAWS REGULATING
REMOVAL OF NATURAL RESOURCES FROM THE GROUND AND THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO
THE ENVIRONMENT. OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND
LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH SEEK TO MAINTAIN HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS
BY REGULATING THE DESIGN AND USE OF DRILLING METHODS AND EQUIPMENT. VARIOUS
PERMITS FROM GOVERNMENT BODIES ARE REQUIRED FOR DRILLING OPERATIONS TO BE
CONDUCTED; NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH PERMITS WILL BE RECEIVED.
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL, PROVINCIAL, OR LOCAL AUTHORITIES MAY
BE CHANGED AND ANY SUCH CHANGES MAY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR
ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS OR
REQUIRE CAPITAL OUTLAYS IN EXCESS OF THOSE ANTICIPATED, THUS CAUSING AN ADVERSE
EFFECT ON US. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR POLLUTION OR
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES, WHICH IT MAY ELECT NOT TO INSURE AGAINST DUE TO
PROHIBITIVE PREMIUM COSTS AND OTHER REASONS. TO DATE WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED
TO SPEND ANY MATERIAL AMOUNT ON COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.
HOWEVER, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DO SO IN FUTURE AND THIS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY
TO EXPAND OR MAINTAIN OUR OPERATIONS. 
 EXPLORATORY DRILLING INVOLVES MANY RISKS AND WE MAY BECOME
LIABLE FOR POLLUTION OR OTHER LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. 
 DRILLING OPERATIONS GENERALLY INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.
HAZARDS SUCH AS UNUSUAL OR UNEXPECTED GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS, POWER OUTAGES,
LABOR DISRUPTIONS, BLOW-OUTS, SOUR GAS LEAKAGE, FIRE, INABILITY TO OBTAIN
SUITABLE OR ADEQUATE MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT OR LABOUR, AND OTHER RISKS ARE
INVOLVED. WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR POLLUTION OR HAZARDS AGAINST
WHICH WE CANNOT ADEQUATELY INSURE OR WHICH WE MAY ELECT NOT TO INSURE. INCURRING
ANY SUCH LIABILITY MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION
AND OPERATIONS. 
 SHORTAGES OF RIGS, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND PERSONNEL COULD
DELAY OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF OPERATIONS OR OUR ABILITY TO
OPERATE ACCORDING TO OUR BUSINESS PLANS. 
 IF DRILLING ACTIVITY INCREASES WORLDWIDE, A SHORTAGE OF
DRILLING AND COMPLETION RIGS, FIELD EQUIPMENT AND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD
DEVELOP. THESE COSTS HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED SHARPLY AND COULD CONTINUE TO DO
SO. THE DEMAND FOR AND WAGE RATES OF QUALIFIED DRILLING RIG CREWS GENERALLY RISE
IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF ACTIVE RIGS IN SERVICE AND COULD
INCREASE SHARPLY IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTAGE. SHORTAGES OF DRILLING AND
COMPLETION RIGS, FIELD EQUIPMENT OR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD DELAY, RESTRICT OR
CURTAIL OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IN TURN HARM OUR
OPERATING RESULTS. 
 -8- 

THE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES IN
TEXAS SUBJECTS US TO AN INCREASED RISK OF LOSS OF REVENUE OR CURTAILMENT OF
PRODUCTION FROM FACTORS AFFECTING THOSE AREAS. 
 THE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF ALL OF OUR LEASEHOLD INTERESTS
IN TEXAS MEANS THAT OUR PROPERTIES COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE SAME EVENT SHOULD
THE REGIONS EXPERIENCE: 

SEVERE WEATHER; 
 
 DELAYS OR DECREASES IN PRODUCTION, THE AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT,
 FACILITIES OR SERVICES; 
 
 DELAYS OR DECREASES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPACITY TO TRANSPORT, GATHER OR
 PROCESS PRODUCTION; OR 
 
 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. 
 THE OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION INDUSTRY IS
HISTORICALLY A CYCLICAL INDUSTRY AND MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF OIL
AND GAS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. 
 PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TEND TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN
RESPONSE TO FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE: 

WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WHEREVER OUR PROPERTY INTERESTS
 ARE LOCATED; 
 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR PETROLEUM-BASED PRODUCTS, IN THE
 UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD; 
 
 ACTIONS BY OPEC, THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES; 
 
 POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER MAJOR OIL AND GAS
 PRODUCING REGIONS; 
 
 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN; 
 
 DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX POLICY; 
 
 THE PACE ADOPTED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT,
 AND PRODUCTION OF THEIR NATIONAL RESERVES; 
 
 THE PRICE OF FOREIGN IMPORTS OF OIL AND GAS; 
 
 THE COST OF EXPLORING FOR, PRODUCING AND DELIVERING OIL AND GAS; 
 
 THE DISCOVERY RATE OF NEW OIL AND GAS RESERVES; 
 
 THE RATE OF DECLINE OF EXISTING AND NEW OIL AND GAS RESERVES; 
 
 AVAILABLE PIPELINE AND OTHER OIL AND GAS TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY; 
 
 THE ABILITY OF OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO RAISE CAPITAL; 
 
 THE OVERALL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR OIL AND GAS; AND 
 
 THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATE FUEL SOURCES. 
 CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR
CAPITAL RESOURCES, LIQUIDITY AND EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS. PRICE CHANGES WILL
DIRECTLY AFFECT REVENUES AND CAN INDIRECTLY IMPACT EXPECTED PRODUCTION BY
CHANGING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO REINVEST IN EXPLORATION AND
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. REDUCTIONS IN OIL AND GAS PRICES NOT ONLY 
 -9- 

REDUCE REVENUES AND PROFITS, BUT COULD ALSO REDUCE THE
QUANTITIES OF RESERVES THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY RECOVERABLE. SIGNIFICANT DECLINES
IN PRICES COULD RESULT IN NON-CASH CHARGES TO EARNINGS DUE TO IMPAIRMENT. 
 CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR
ABILITY TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES FOR ACQUISITION AND
DIVESTITURE AND OFTEN CAUSE DISRUPTION IN THE MARKET FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING
PROPERTIES, AS BUYERS AND SELLERS HAVE DIFFICULTY AGREEING ON THE VALUE OF THE
PROPERTIES. PRICE VOLATILITY ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BUDGET FOR AND PROJECT
THE RETURN ON ACQUISITIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF PROJECTS. WE
EXPECT THAT COMMODITY PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE
FUTURE. 
 OUR INTERESTS ARE HELD IN THE FORM OF LEASES THAT WE MAY BE
UNABLE TO RETAIN. 
 THE INTEREST IN OUR PROPERTY ARE HELD UNDER LEASES AND WORKING
INTERESTS IN LEASES. IF WE OR THE HOLDER OF A LEASE FAILS TO MEET THE SPECIFIC
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEASE REGARDING DELAY OR NON-PAYMENT OF RENTAL PAYMENTS OR
WE OR THE HOLDER OF THE LEASE FAIL TO MEET THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF EVALUATION SOME
OR ALL OF OUR LEASES MAY TERMINATE OR EXPIRE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY
OF THE OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN EACH LEASE WILL BE MET. THE TERMINATION
OR EXPIRATION OF OUR LEASES OR THE WORKING INTERESTS RELATING TO LEASES MAY
REDUCE OUR OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOIT A GIVEN PROSPECT FOR OIL PRODUCTION AND THUS
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATION AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 ANY CHANGE TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION/ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES
MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND OUR PROFITABILITY.
 
 THE LAWS, REGULATIONS, POLICIES OR CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE
PRACTICES OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY, ORGANIZATION OR REGULATORY AGENCY IN THE
UNITED STATES, CANADA, OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, MAY BE CHANGED, APPLIED OR
INTERPRETED IN A MANNER WHICH WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE ABILITY OF OUR
COMPANY TO CARRY ON OUR BUSINESS. THE ACTIONS, POLICIES OR REGULATIONS, OR
CHANGES THERETO, OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY OR REGULATORY AGENCY, OR OTHER SPECIAL
INTEREST GROUPS, MAY HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON US. ANY OR ALL OF THESE
SITUATIONS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND/OR OUR
PROFITABILITY. 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL, WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLAN OF OPERATION AND OUR BUSINESS MAY
FAIL. 
 OUR SUCCESS WILL BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO HIRE
AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE HIGHLY
TECHNICAL BUSINESSES OF MINERAL AND OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION. THESE INDIVIDUALS
MAY BE IN HIGH DEMAND AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THE STAFF WE NEED. IN
ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE HIGH SALARIES AND FEES DEMANDED BY
QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, OR WE MAY FAIL TO RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES AFTER THEY ARE
HIRED. AT PRESENT, WE HAVE NOT HIRED ANY KEY PERSONNEL. OUR FAILURE TO HIRE KEY
PERSONNEL WHEN NEEDED WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR
BUSINESS. 
 BECAUSE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE FORMAL TRAINING
SPECIFIC TO OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION, THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OUR BUSINESS WILL
FAIL. 
 WHILE ROBERT KINLOCH, OUR DIRECTOR AND ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, HAS EXPERIENCE MANAGING A MINERAL EXPLORATION COMPANY, HE DOES NOT HAVE
FORMAL TRAINING AS A GEOLOGIST. DONALD KINLOCH DOES NOT HAVE FORMAL TRAINING
SPECIFIC TO MINERAL AND GAS EXPLORATION. ACCORDINGLY, OUR MANAGEMENT MAY NOT
FULLY APPRECIATE MANY OF THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO WORKING WITHIN THE
MINING AND OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. OUR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS MAY NOT TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT STANDARD ENGINEERING OR MANAGERIAL APPROACHES COMMONLY USED BY SUCH
COMPANIES. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR OPERATIONS, EARNINGS, AND ULTIMATE FINANCIAL
SUCCESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DUE TO OUR MANAGEMENT S LACK OF EXPERIENCE
IN THE INDUSTRY. 
 OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, AND AS
A RESULT, THEY MAY NOT BE WILLING OR ABLE TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME
TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY LIMITING THE SUCCESS OF OUR COMPANY.
 
 ROBERT KINLOCH PRESENTLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY 60 OF HIS
BUSINESS TIME AND DONALD KINLOCH PRESENTLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY 20 OF HIS
BUSINESS TIME ON BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR OUR COMPANY. AT PRESENT, BOTH
ROBERT 
 -10- 

AND DONALD KINLOCH SPEND A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN PURSUIT
OF OUR COMPANY S INTERESTS. DUE TO THE TIME COMMITMENTS FROM ROBERT AND DONALD
KINLOCH S OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, HOWEVER, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
SUFFICIENT TIME TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE AND OUR BUSINESS
MAY BE PERIODICALLY INTERRUPTED OR DELAYED AS A RESULT OF THEIR OTHER BUSINESS
INTERESTS. 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 IF WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL RESULT
IN THE DILUTION OF OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. 
 OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO
850,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITH A PAR VALUE OF 0.001 PER SHARE. OUR
BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY CHOOSE TO ISSUE SOME OR ALL OF SUCH SHARES TO ACQUIRE ONE
OR MORE BUSINESSES OR TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE. THE
ISSUANCE OF ANY SUCH SHARES WILL REDUCE THE BOOK VALUE AND MARKET PRICE OF THE
OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IF WE ISSUE ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL SHARES,
SUCH ISSUANCE WILL REDUCE THE PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING POWER OF ALL
CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS. FURTHER, SUCH ISSUANCE MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE OF CONTROL
OF OUR CORPORATION. 
 OUR COMMON STOCK IS ILLIQUID AND SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE UNABLE
TO SELL THEIR SHARES. 
 THERE IS CURRENTLY A LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND WE
CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE TO INVESTORS THAT A MARKET WILL DEVELOP. IF A MARKET
FOR OUR COMMON STOCK DOES NOT DEVELOP, OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
RE-SELL THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT THEY HAVE PURCHASED AND THEY MAY
LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING OUR COMPANY,
CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKET SEGMENT OR CHANGES
IN EARNINGS ESTIMATES BY ANALYSTS MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES TO
FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY. IN ADDITION, STOCK PRICES FOR JUNIOR OIL AND GAS
COMPANIES FLUCTUATE WIDELY FOR REASONS THAT MAY BE UNRELATED TO THEIR OPERATING
RESULTS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON
SHARES. 
 PENNY STOCK RULES WILL LIMIT THE ABILITY OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS
TO SELL THEIR STOCK. 
 THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS
WHICH GENERALLY DEFINE PENNY STOCK TO BE ANY EQUITY SECURITY THAT HAS A MARKET
PRICE (AS DEFINED) LESS THAN 5.00 PER SHARE OR AN EXERCISE PRICE OF LESS THAN
 5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. OUR SECURITIES ARE COVERED BY
THE PENNY STOCK RULES, WHICH IMPOSE ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON
BROKER-DEALERS WHO SELL TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS AND
 ACCREDITED INVESTORS . THE TERM ACCREDITED INVESTOR REFERS GENERALLY TO
INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF 5,000,000 OR INDIVIDUALS WITH A NET WORTH
IN EXCESS OF 1,000,000 OR ANNUAL INCOME EXCEEDING 200,000 OR 300,000 JOINTLY
WITH THEIR SPOUSE. THE PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE A BROKER-DEALER, PRIOR TO A
TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THE RULES, TO DELIVER A
STANDARDIZED RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT IN A FORM PREPARED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT PENNY STOCKS AND THE NATURE
AND LEVEL OF RISKS IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. THE BROKER-DEALER ALSO MUST
PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH CURRENT BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS FOR THE PENNY STOCK,
THE COMPENSATION OF THE BROKER-DEALER AND ITS SALESPERSON IN THE TRANSACTION AND
MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS SHOWING THE MARKET VALUE OF EACH PENNY STOCK HELD IN
THE CUSTOMER S ACCOUNT. THE BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS, AND THE BROKER-DEALER AND
SALESPERSON COMPENSATION INFORMATION, MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER ORALLY OR IN
WRITING PRIOR TO EFFECTING THE TRANSACTION AND MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER IN
WRITING BEFORE OR WITH THE CUSTOMER S CONFIRMATION. IN ADDITION, THE PENNY STOCK
RULES REQUIRE THAT PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT
FROM THESE RULES, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL WRITTEN DETERMINATION
THAT THE PENNY STOCK IS A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE PURCHASER AND RECEIVE THE
PURCHASER S WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION. THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SECONDARY
MARKET FOR THE STOCK THAT IS SUBJECT TO THESE PENNY STOCK RULES. CONSEQUENTLY,
THESE PENNY STOCK RULES MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO TRADE OUR
SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PENNY STOCK RULES DISCOURAGE INVESTOR INTEREST
IN AND LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR FINRA, HAS
ADOPTED SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY ALSO LIMIT A SHAREHOLDER S ABILITY
TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. 
 IN ADDITION TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE, FINRA
HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT REQUIRE THAT IN RECOMMENDING AN INVESTMENT TO A CUSTOMER,
A BROKER-DEALER MUST HAVE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE INVESTMENT
IS 
 -11- 

SUITABLE FOR THAT CUSTOMER. PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING SPECULATIVE
LOW PRICED SECURITIES TO THEIR NON-INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, BROKER-DEALERS MUST
MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMER S FINANCIAL
STATUS, TAX STATUS, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND OTHER INFORMATION. UNDER
INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE RULES, FINRA BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY
THAT SPECULATIVE LOW PRICED SECURITIES WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR AT LEAST SOME
CUSTOMERS. FINRA REQUIREMENTS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BROKER-DEALERS TO
 RECOMMEND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BUY OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY LIMIT YOUR
ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET FOR
ITS SHARES. 
 BECAUSE OF THE EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE NATURE OF
OUR BUSINESS, OUR SECURITIES ARE CONSIDERED HIGHLY SPECULATIVE. 
 OUR SECURITIES MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, GENERALLY
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE EARLY STAGE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT. WE
ARE ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF IDENTIFYING, ACQUIRING, EXPLORING AND DEVELOPING
COMMERCIAL RESERVES OF OIL AND GAS. OUR PROPERTIES ARE IN THE EXPLORATION STAGE
ONLY AND ARE WITHOUT KNOWN RESERVES OF OIL AND GAS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT
GENERATED ANY REVENUES NOR HAVE WE REALIZED A PROFIT FROM OUR OPERATIONS TO DATE
AND THERE IS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL GENERATE ANY REVENUES OR REALIZE ANY
PROFITS IN THE SHORT TERM. ANY PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE FROM OUR BUSINESS
WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON LOCATING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIC RESERVES OF OIL AND GAS,
WHICH ITSELF IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISK FACTORS AS SET FORTH HEREIN. SINCE WE
HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES, WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL MONIES THROUGH
THE SALE OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES OR DEBT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS
OPERATIONS. 
 WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ANY INVESTMENT IN THE
SHARES OF STOCK OF OUR COMPANY. 
 WE HAVE NEVER PAID ANY CASH DIVIDENDS AND CURRENTLY DO NOT
INTEND TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING CURRENTLY NOT PROVIDED FOR IN OUR FINANCING PLAN, OUR
FUNDING SOURCES MAY PROHIBIT THE PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND. BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND
TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS, ANY GAIN ON AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY WILL NEED TO COME
THROUGH AN INCREASE IN THE STOCK S PRICE. THIS MAY NEVER HAPPEN AND INVESTORS
MAY LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY 
 OUR BY-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS INDEMNIFYING OUR OFFICERS AND
DIRECTORS. 
 OUR BY-LAWS PROVIDE THE INDEMNIFICATION OF OUR DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE NEVADA CORPORATE
LAW AGAINST ALL EXPENSES, LIABILITY AND LOSS REASONABLY INCURRED OR SUFFERED BY
HIM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING. FURTHERMORE, OUR BY-LAWS
PROVIDE THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY CAUSE OUR COMPANY TO PURCHASE AND
MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED
DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE COVERAGE. 
 OUR BY-LAWS DO NOT CONTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND THUS
OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS MAY CHANGE IF THERE IS A TAKE-OVER OF OUR COMPANY.
 
 WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN OR ANY
ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR BY-LAWS. WITHOUT ANY ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS,
THERE IS NO DETERRENT FOR A TAKE-OVER OF OUR COMPANY. IF THERE IS A TAKE-OVER OF
OUR COMPANY, OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS MAY CHANGE. 
 BECAUSE MOST OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE RESIDENTS OF
OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, INVESTORS MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO
ENFORCE, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS
AND OFFICERS. 
 MOST OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE NATIONALS AND/OR
RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, AND ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL
PORTION OF SUCH PERSONS ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A
RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO ENFORCE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST OUR OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS, INCLUDING JUDGMENTS
PREDICATED UPON THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE
UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE THEREOF.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS" IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR SL GREEN
REALTY CORP., OUR 100 INDIRECT PARENT COMPANY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. 

 DECLINES IN THE DEMAND FOR OFFICE SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY, AND IN PARTICULAR, IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN AS WELL AS OUR SUBURBAN MARKETS, INCLUDING WESTCHESTER COUNTY, CONNECTICUT,
AND LONG ISLAND CITY, RESULTING FROM GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE
CURRENT DEBT AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SL GREEN. 

 MOST OF OUR COMMERCIAL OFFICE PROPERTIES, BASED ON SQUARE FEET, ARE LOCATED IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS IS
DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITION OF THE NEW YORK CITY ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE MARKET FOR OFFICE SPACE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, IN PARTICULAR. WEAKNESS IN THE NEW YORK CITY ECONOMY COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE
THE VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AND OUR RENTAL REVENUES, AND THUS ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE CURRENT DEBT AND TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SL GREEN. THE MANHATTAN VACANCY RATE ENDED
2009 AT 12 AFTER REACHING A HIGH OF 13.4 IN OCTOBER 2009. WE COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY WEAKNESS IN OUR SUBURBAN MARKETS, INCLUDING WESTCHESTER COUNTY, CONNECTICUT AND LONG ISLAND CITY. 

 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW LEASES OR RELET SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE. 

 WHEN OUR TENANTS DECIDE NOT TO RENEW THEIR LEASES UPON THEIR EXPIRATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELET THE SPACE. EVEN IF TENANTS DO
RENEW OR WE CAN RELET THE SPACE, THE TERMS OF RENEWAL OR RELETTING, INCLUDING THE COST OF REQUIRED RENOVATIONS, MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENT LEASE TERMS. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THROUGH THE
END OF 2014, LEASES WILL EXPIRE ON APPROXIMATELY 46.1 AND NONE OF THE RENTABLE SQUARE FEET AT OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 2.7 MILLION AND NO SQUARE FEET ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE BY DECEMBER 31, 2014 AT OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE
PROPERTY, RESPECTIVELY, AND THESE LEASES CURRENTLY HAVE ANNUALIZED ESCALATED RENTAL INCOME TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 113.0 MILLION AND NONE, RESPECTIVELY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROMPTLY RENEW THE
LEASES OR RELET THIS SPACE AT SIMILAR RATES, OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SL GREEN WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

 THE EXPIRATION OF LONG TERM LEASES OR OPERATING SUBLEASE INTERESTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 OUR INTEREST IN OUR COMMERCIAL OFFICE PROPERTIES LOCATED AT 1185 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK AND 1055 WASHINGTON AVENUE,
CONNECTICUT ARE THROUGH LONG-TERM LEASEHOLD INTERESTS IN THE LAND AND THE IMPROVEMENTS, RATHER THAN BY A FEE INTEREST IN THE LAND. UNLESS WE CAN PURCHASE A FEE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING
LAND OR EXTEND THE TERMS OF THESE LEASES BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION, WE WILL LOSE OUR RIGHT TO OPERATE THESE PROPERTIES AND OUR INTEREST IN THE IMPROVEMENTS UPON EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE, WHICH WOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING TERM OF THESE LONG-TERM LEASES, INCLUDING OUR UNILATERAL EXTENSION RIGHTS IS APPROXIMATELY 58 YEARS. PURSUANT
TO THE LEASEHOLD ARRANGEMENT, WE, AS TENANT UNDER THE OPERATING SUBLEASE, PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY LANDLORDS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SUBTENANTS. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT ONLY
COLLECTING RENT FROM OUR SUBTENANTS, BUT ALSO MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY AND PAYING EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY. OUR SHARE OF ANNUALIZED ESCALATED RENTAL
INCOME OF THIS PROPERTY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 76.6 MILLION, OR 29 , OF OUR SHARE OF TOTAL PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PORTFOLIO. 

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RELY ON MAJOR TENANTS, INCLUDING IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR, AND INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP OF THESE AND OTHER TENANTS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 GIVING EFFECT TO LEASES IN EFFECT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 FOR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE
PROPERTIES AS OF THAT DATE, OUR FIVE LARGEST TENANTS, BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE LEASED, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 23.7 OF OUR SHARE OF PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED RENT, AND, OTHER THAN THREE TENANTS,
CITIGROUP, INC. (AND ITS AFFILIATES), DEBEVOISE PLIMPTON, LLP AND VERIZON WHO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6.6 , 7.1 AND 3.0 OF 

 5 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR
SHARE OF PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED RENT, RESPECTIVELY, NO TENANT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 4.2 OF THAT TOTAL. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT TURMOIL WHICH HAS
RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES. OF OUR TEN LARGEST TENANTS BASED ON SQUARE FEET LEASED, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 36.6 OF OUR SHARE OF PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED RENT, 46 (INCLUSIVE OF LEASE
GUARANTORS) CARRY AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING. IF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PERSIST OR DETERIORATE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN PAST DUE ACCOUNTS, DEFAULTS, LOWER OCCUPANCY AND REDUCED
EFFECTIVE RENTS, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICE TENANTS. OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ANY OF OUR MAJOR TENANTS OR ANY OTHER TENANTS BECAME INSOLVENT, DECLARED
BANKRUPTCY, ARE PUT INTO RECEIVERSHIP OR OTHERWISE REFUSED TO PAY RENT IN A TIMELY FASHION OR AT ALL. 

 ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS IN GENERAL AND THE NORTHEASTERN COMMERCIAL OFFICE MARKETS IN PARTICULAR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS. 

 OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE UNPRECEDENTED VOLATILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, THE GENERAL GLOBAL
ECONOMIC RECESSION, AND OTHER MARKET OR ECONOMIC CHALLENGES EXPERIENCED BY THE U.S. ECONOMY OR REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS, AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST, PARTICULARLY IN NEW YORK, WESTCHESTER COUNTY AND CONNECTICUT. BECAUSE OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS
PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE BUILDINGS (AS COMPARED TO A MORE DIVERSIFIED REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO) LOCATED PRINCIPALLY IN MANHATTAN, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PERSIST OR DETERIORATE, THEN OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ABILITY TO SERVICE CURRENT DEBT AND TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL
CONDITIONS: 

SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES IN THE FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES HAVE OCCURRED AND MAY CONTINUE TO OCCUR,
WHICH MAY DECREASE DEMAND FOR OUR OFFICE SPACE, CAUSING MARKET RENTAL RATES AND PROPERTY VALUES TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED; 
 OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WE FIND ACCEPTABLE, OR AT ALL, MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR
ABILITY TO PURSUE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT, REDUCE OUR RETURNS FROM BOTH OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND OUR ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND
INCREASE OUR FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE; 
 REDUCED VALUES OF OUR PROPERTIES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES OR TO OBTAIN DEBT
FINANCING SECURED BY OUR PROPERTIES AND MAY REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED LOANS; AND 
 REDUCED LIQUIDITY IN DEBT MARKETS AND INCREASED CREDIT RISK PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY IMPAIR OUR
ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. 

THESE
CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS, MAY CONTINUE OR WORSEN IN THE FUTURE. 

 WE MAY SUFFER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IF OUR REVENUES DECLINE SINCE OUR OPERATING COSTS DO NOT NECESSARILY DECLINE IN PROPORTION TO OUR REVENUE. 

 WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCOME FROM RENTING OUR PROPERTIES. OUR OPERATING COSTS, HOWEVER, DO NOT NECESSARILY FLUCTUATE IN
RELATION TO CHANGES IN OUR RENTAL REVENUE. THIS MEANS THAT OUR COSTS WILL NOT NECESSARILY DECLINE EVEN IF OUR REVENUES DO. OUR OPERATING COSTS COULD ALSO INCREASE WHILE OUR REVENUES DO NOT. IF OUR
OPERATING COSTS INCREASE BUT OUR RENTAL REVENUES DO NOT, WE MAY BE FORCED TO BORROW TO COVER OUR COSTS, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AND WE MAY NOT HAVE CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SL GREEN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. 

WE MAY ACQUIRE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES AND PORTFOLIOS OF PROPERTIES. OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES AND THEIR SUCCESS MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE
FOLLOWING RISKS: 

EVEN IF WE ENTER INTO AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT FOR A PROPERTY, IT IS USUALLY SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS TO CLOSING,
INCLUDING DUE DILIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS TO OUR SATISFACTION; 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL; 
 ACQUIRED PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM AS WE EXPECTED; 
 OUR ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OF REPOSITIONING OR REDEVELOPING ACQUIRED PROPERTIES MAY BE INACCURATE; 
 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR NEW PROPERTIES; 
 ACQUIRED PROPERTIES MAY BE LOCATED IN NEW MARKETS WHERE WE MAY FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF MARKET KNOWLEDGE OR
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY, LACK OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREA AND UNFAMILIARITY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND PERMITTING PROCEDURES; AND 
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATE NEW ACQUISITIONS, PARTICULARLY ACQUISITIONS OF PORTFOLIOS OF
PROPERTIES, INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, AND AS A RESULT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

WE
MAY ACQUIRE PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO LIABILITIES AND WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE, OR WITH ONLY LIMITED RECOURSE, WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, IF A LIABILITY WERE ASSERTED
AGAINST US BASED UPON THOSE PROPERTIES, WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL SUMS TO SETTLE IT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW. UNKNOWN LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTIES ACQUIRED MIGHT
INCLUDE: 

LIABILITIES FOR CLEAN-UP OF UNDISCLOSED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION; 
 CLAIMS BY TENANTS, VENDORS OR OTHER PERSONS DEALING WITH THE FORMER OWNERS OF THE PROPERTIES; 
 LIABILITIES INCURRED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS; AND 
 CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION BY GENERAL PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHERS INDEMNIFIED BY THE FORMER OWNERS OF THE
PROPERTIES. 

COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO US AND INCREASE THE COSTS OF THOSE ACQUISITIONS. 

 WE MAY CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE PROPERTIES AS WE ARE PRESENTED WITH ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. WE MAY FACE COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITION
OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER INVESTORS, PARTICULARLY PRIVATE INVESTORS WHO CAN INCUR MORE LEVERAGE, AND THIS COMPETITION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US BY SUBJECTING US TO THE FOLLOWING
RISKS: 

AN INABILITY TO ACQUIRE A DESIRED PROPERTY BECAUSE OF COMPETITION FROM OTHER WELL-CAPITALIZED REAL ESTATE
INVESTORS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY TRADED AND PRIVATELY HELD REITS, PRIVATE REAL ESTATE FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES, SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, PENSION TRUSTS,
PARTNERSHIPS AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS; AND 
 AN INCREASE IN THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SUCH ACQUISITION PROPERTY, IN THE EVENT WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH DESIRED
PROPERTY. 

WE RELY ON FOUR LARGE PROPERTIES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. 

 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, FOUR OF OUR PROPERTIES, 1185 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, 919 THIRD AVENUE, 810 SEVENTH AVENUE AND 1350
AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 69 OF OUR PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED RENT, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE ANNUALIZED RENT, AND 1185 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS ALONE ACCOUNTED FOR
APPROXIMATELY 27 OF OUR PORTFOLIO ANNUALIZED RENT, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE ANNUALIZED RENT. OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

REVENUE
AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SL GREEN WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE GROUND LEASE FOR THE 1185 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS PROPERTY WERE TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON OR IF ONE
OR ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES WERE MATERIALLY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REVENUE AND CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SL GREEN WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR TENANTS AT
THESE PROPERTIES EXPERIENCED A DOWNTURN IN THEIR BUSINESS WHICH MAY WEAKEN THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT IN THEIR FAILURE TO TIMELY MAKE RENTAL PAYMENTS, DEFAULTING UNDER THEIR LEASES OR FILING
FOR BANKRUPTCY. 

 THE CONTINUING THREAT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW. 

THERE MAY BE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED AT RISK FOR FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND THIS
DECREASE MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES FROM PROPERTY RENTALS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF A TERRORIST ATTACK, TENANTS IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA MAY CHOOSE TO RELOCATE THEIR BUSINESS TO LESS POPULATED, LOWER-PROFILE
AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE NOT AS LIKELY TO BE TARGETS OF FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIVITY. THIS IN TURN WOULD TRIGGER A DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR SPACE IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA, WHICH COULD
INCREASE VACANCIES IN OUR PROPERTIES AND FORCE US TO LEASE OUR PROPERTIES ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES COULD MATERIALLY DECLINE. 

A TERRORIST ATTACK COULD CAUSE INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

 SL GREEN MAINTAINS "ALL-RISK" PROPERTY AND RENTAL VALUE COVERAGE (INCLUDING COVERAGE REGARDING THE PERILS OF FLOOD,
EARTHQUAKE AND TERRORISM) WITHIN TWO PROPERTY INSURANCE PORTFOLIOS AND LIABILITY INSURANCE. THIS INCLUDES THE ROP ASSETS. THE FIRST PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAINTAINS A BLANKET LIMIT OF
 600.0 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE NEW YORK CITY PROPERTIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO WITH A SUB-LIMIT OF 450.0 MILLION FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THIS POLICY EXPIRES
ON DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE SECOND PORTFOLIO MAINTAINS A LIMIT OF 600.0 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE, INCLUDING TERRORISM, FOR A FEW NEW YORK CITY PROPERTIES AND THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBURBAN
PROPERTIES. THE SECOND PROPERTY POLICY EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 31, 2010. ADDITIONAL COVERAGE MAY BE PURCHASED ON A STAND ALONE BASIS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE LIABILITY POLICIES COVER ALL OUR
PROPERTIES AND PROVIDE LIMITS OF 200.0 MILLION PER PROPERTY. THE LIABILITY POLICIES EXPIRE ON OCTOBER 31, 2010. 

 IN
OCTOBER 2006, SL GREEN FORMED A WHOLLY-OWNED TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY, BELMONT INSURANCE COMPANY, OR BELMONT, TO ACT AS A CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY AND BE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR
OVERALL INSURANCE PROGRAM BELMONT WAS FORMED IN AN EFFORT TO, AMONG OTHER REASONS, STABILIZE TO SOME EXTENT THE FLUCTUATIONS OF INSURANCE MARKET CONDITIONS. BELMONT IS LICENSED IN NEW YORK TO WRITE
TERRORISM, NBCR (NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, AND RADIOLOGICAL), GENERAL LIABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY AND D O COVERAGE. 

TERRORISM: BELMONT ACTS AS A DIRECT PROPERTY INSURER WITH RESPECT TO A PORTION OF OUR TERRORISM COVERAGE FOR THE NEW YORK
CITY PROPERTIES. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2009 BELMONT INCREASED ITS TERRORISM COVERAGE FROM 250 MILLION TO 400 MILLION IN AN UPPER LAYER. IN ADDITION, BELMONT PURCHASED
REINSURANCE TO REINSURE THE RETAINED INSURABLE RISK NOT OTHERWISE COVERED UNDER TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 (TRIPRA), AS DETAILED BELOW. 
 NBCR: BELMONT ACTS AS A DIRECT INSURER OF NBCR COVERAGE UP TO 250 MILLION ON THE ENTIRE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. 
 GENERAL LIABILITY: BELMONT INSURES A DEDUCTIBLE ON THE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH A 150,000 DEDUCTIBLE PER
OCCURRENCE AND A 2.2 MILLION ANNUAL AGGREGATE STOP LOSS LIMIT. SL GREEN HAS SECURED AN EXCESS INSURER TO PROTECT AGAINST CATASTROPHIC LIABILITY LOSSES ABOVE THE 150,000 DEDUCTIBLE PER
OCCURRENCE AND A STOP LOSS IF AGGREGATE CLAIMS EXCEED 2.2 MILLION. BELMONT HAS RETAINED A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TO MANAGE ALL CLAIMS WITHIN THE DEDUCTIBLE AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT DIRECT
MANAGEMENT OF LIABILITY CLAIMS WILL IMPROVE LOSS EXPERIENCE AND ULTIMATELY LOWER THE COST OF LIABILITY INSURANCE IN FUTURE YEARS. IN ADDITION, SL GREEN HAS AN UMBRELLA LIABILITY POLICY OF
 200.0 MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY: BELMONT INSURES A DEDUCTIBLE OF 1 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE ON A 30 MILLION
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY POLICY COVERING THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. 

TRIA,
WHICH WAS ENACTED IN NOVEMBER 2002, WAS RENEWED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007. CONGRESS EXTENDED TRIA, NOW CALLED TRIPRA (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION AND
EXTENSION ACT OF 2007) UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE LAW EXTENDS THE FEDERAL TERRORISM INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO OFFER TERRORISM COVERAGE AND PROVIDES FOR
COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM. OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, CONSISTING OF MORTGAGE LOANS SECURED BY OUR PROPERTIES (WHICH ARE GENERALLY
NON-RECOURSE TO US), MEZZANINE LOANS, GROUND LEASES AND SL GREEN'S 2007 UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, CONTAIN CUSTOMARY COVENANTS REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE. THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE THAT THE LENDERS OR GROUND LESSORS UNDER THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL NOT TAKE THE POSITION THAT A TOTAL OR PARTIAL EXCLUSION FROM "ALL-RISK" INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR LOSSES DUE TO
TERRORIST ACTS IS A BREACH OF THESE DEBT AND GROUND LEASE INSTRUMENTS THAT ALLOWS THE LENDERS OR GROUND LESSORS TO DECLARE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ACCELERATE REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR RECAPTURE OF GROUND
LEASE POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, IF LENDERS INSIST ON FULL COVERAGE FOR THESE RISKS AND PREVAIL IN ASSERTING THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SUCH COVERAGE, IT COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER
INSURANCE PREMIUMS. 

 OUR DEPENDENCE ON SMALLER AND GROWTH-ORIENTED BUSINESSES TO RENT OUR OFFICE SPACE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 MANY OF THE TENANTS IN OUR PROPERTIES ARE SMALLER, GROWTH-ORIENTED BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF LARGER
CORPORATE TENANTS. SMALLER COMPANIES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE A HIGHER RATE OF FAILURE THAN LARGE BUSINESSES. GROWTH-ORIENTED FIRMS MAY ALSO SEEK OTHER OFFICE SPACE, INCLUDING CLASS A SPACE, AS
THEY DEVELOP. DEPENDENCE ON THESE COMPANIES COULD CREATE A HIGHER RISK OF TENANT DEFAULTS, TURNOVER AND BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

 RECENT TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEBT FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS. 

 THE U.S. CREDIT MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATIONS AND LIQUIDITY DISRUPTIONS WHICH HAVE CAUSED THE SPREADS ON
PROSPECTIVE DEBT FINANCINGS TO WIDEN CONSIDERABLY.
CONTINUED TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING AT REASONABLE TERMS, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUTURE ACQUISITIONS
OR OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. 

 DEBT FINANCING, FINANCIAL COVENANTS, DEGREE OF LEVERAGE, AND INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. 

 SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 THE TOTAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2009, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 0.7 BILLION UNDER OUR SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND CONVERTIBLE BONDS, AND APPROXIMATELY 0.2 BILLION OF NON-RECOURSE MORTGAGE LOAN ON ONE OF
OUR PROPERTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE TOTAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NON-RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING AT OUR JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY WAS APPROXIMATELY 315.0 MILLION,
OF WHICH OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE WAS APPROXIMATELY 94.5 MILLION. CASH FLOW COULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS AT EXPECTED LEVELS AND MEET THE PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
REQUIRED UNDER OUR CURRENT MORTGAGE INDEBTEDNESS, SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING AT OUR JOINT VENTURE PROPERTIES. 

 IF
WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, THE PRINCIPAL AND UNPAID INTEREST WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY PAYABLE. IF A PROPERTY IS MORTGAGED TO SECURE PAYMENT OF
INDEBTEDNESS AND WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, THE MORTGAGEE COULD FORECLOSE ON THE PROPERTY, RESULTING IN LOSS OF INCOME AND ASSET VALUE. FORECLOSURE ON MORTGAGED PROPERTIES OR AN
INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OUR UNSECURED NOTES WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH IN ALL CASES REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS AT MATURITY. IN 2010, NONE OF THE DEBT ON EITHER OF OUR CONSOLIDATED
PROPERTIES OR OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY, RESPECTIVELY, WILL MATURE. HOWEVER, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL OUR 4 EXCHANGEABLE BONDS IN JUNE 2010. AT THE PRESENT TIME, WE INTEND TO
EXERCISE EXTENSION OPTIONS OR REFINANCE THE DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPERTIES ON OR PRIOR TO THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. IF ANY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DUE AT MATURITY CANNOT BE REFINANCED, EXTENDED
OR PAID WITH PROCEEDS OF OTHER CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS NEW EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL, OUR CASH FLOW WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT IN ALL YEARS TO REPAY ALL MATURING DEBT. AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING,
PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE OF LENDERS TO MAKE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS MAY RESULT IN HIGHER
INTEREST RATES. INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE REFINANCED DEBT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CASH FLOW AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO SL GREEN. 

 FINANCIAL COVENANTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. 

 THE MORTGAGES ON OUR PROPERTIES CONTAIN CUSTOMARY NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER MORTGAGE THE PROPERTY, TO ENTER
INTO NEW LEASES OR MATERIALLY MODIFY EXISTING LEASES, AND TO DISCONTINUE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE TERMS OF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES INCLUDE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND LIENS, AND WHICH REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL RATIOS RELATING TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF
CONSOLIDATED UNSECURED AND SECURED INDEBTEDNESS AND THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF UNENCUMBERED ASSETS. THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS
TO SL GREEN. 

 RISING INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW. 

 WE MAY INCUR INDEBTEDNESS IN THE FUTURE THAT BEARS INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE OR MAY BE REQUIRED TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT AT HIGHER
RATES. ACCORDINGLY, INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE THAT WHICH WE ANTICIPATED BASED UPON HISTORICAL TRENDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS. AT
DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD NO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS. 

 FAILURE TO HEDGE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST INTEREST RATE CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 THE INTEREST RATE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS WE MAY USE TO MANAGE SOME OF OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY INVOLVE RISK, SUCH AS THE
RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. FAILURE
TO HEDGE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST INTEREST RATE CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

NO LIMITATION ON DEBT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW. 

 OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY LIMITATION ON THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS WE MAY INCUR. IF WE BECOME MORE HIGHLY
LEVERAGED, AN INCREASE IN DEBT SERVICE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SL GREEN AND COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFAULT ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, ANY CHANGE THAT
INCREASES SL GREEN'S DEBT TO MARKET CAPITALIZATION PERCENTAGE COULD BE VIEWED NEGATIVELY BY
INVESTORS. AS A RESULT, SL GREEN'S SHARE PRICE COULD DECREASE. SL GREEN'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS VARIABLE AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AT ALL TIMES. SL GREEN
ALSO CONSIDERS FACTORS OTHER THAN MARKET CAPITALIZATION IN MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING THE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS, SUCH AS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF PROPERTIES TO BE ACQUIRED WITH DEBT FINANCING, THE
ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES UPON REFINANCING AND THE ABILITY OF PARTICULAR PROPERTIES AND OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE TO GENERATE CASH FLOW TO COVER EXPECTED DEBT SERVICE. 

 STRUCTURED FINANCE INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR EXPENSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

 WE OWNED THREE MEZZANINE AND OTHER LOANS WITH AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 27.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,
2009. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER AND ARE NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT UNDER THESE
OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY 

 10 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

HAVE
TO REALIZE UPON OUR COLLATERAL AND THEREAFTER MAKE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS OR REPAIRS TO THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PROPERTY'S INVESTMENT POTENTIAL. BORROWERS MAY
CONTEST ENFORCEMENT OF FORECLOSURE OR OTHER REMEDIES, SEEK BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AGAINST SUCH ENFORCEMENT AND/OR BRING CLAIMS FOR LENDER LIABILITY IN RESPONSE TO ACTIONS TO ENFORCE THEIR OBLIGATION TO
US. RELATIVELY HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY MAY PREVENT US FROM REALIZING AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO OUR INVESTMENT UPON FORECLOSURE OR
REALIZATION. 

 WE
EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF BOTH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL OF EACH OF OUR LOANS, IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE IMPAIRED. A LOAN IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON
CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING CONTRACTUAL TERMS. WHEN A LOAN IS IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS ACCRUAL IS
CALCULATED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INVESTMENT TO THE VALUE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE LOAN'S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OR, AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT,
TO THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IF THE LOAN IS COLLATERAL DEPENDENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES OF COLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS WILL NOT CHANGE OVER TIME OR THAT THEY WILL BE REPRESENTATIVE OF
THE AMOUNTS WE ACTUALLY COLLECT, INCLUDING AMOUNTS WE WOULD COLLECT IF WE CHOSE TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY. IF WE COLLECT LESS THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE WILL RECORD CHARGES WHICH
COULD BE MATERIAL. WE MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY EVALUATE FINANCIAL RESERVES TO PROTECT AGAINST POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES. OUR RESERVES REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT OF THE PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY OF
LOSSES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR JUDGMENT WILL PROVE TO BE CORRECT AND THAT RESERVES WILL BE ADEQUATE OVER TIME TO PROTECT AGAINST POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE CHANGES
IN THE ECONOMY OR EVENTS ADVERSELY AFFECTING SPECIFIC PROPERTIES, ASSETS, TENANTS, BORROWERS, INDUSTRIES IN WHICH OUR TENANTS AND BORROWERS OPERATE OR MARKETS IN WHICH OUR TENANTS AND BORROWERS OR
THEIR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. WE BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN OUR NON-PERFORMING LOANS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE RECENT CREDIT CRISIS, WHICH HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF MANY OF OUR
BORROWERS TO SERVICE THEIR DEBT AND REFINANCE OUR LOANS TO THEM AT MATURITY. WE HAVE INCREASED OUR PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2008 AND 2009 BASED UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ASSETS AND CONDITIONS IN
THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMY, WHICH DETERIORATED PRECIPITOUSLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. IF OUR RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES PROVE INADEQUATE, WE COULD SUFFER LOSSES WHICH WOULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, THE MARKET PRICES OF OUR SECURITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS. 

 JOINT INVESTMENTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR LACK OF SOLE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY AND RELIANCE UPON A CO-VENTURER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

 WE CO-INVEST WITH THIRD PARTIES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, CO-TENANCIES OR OTHER ENTITIES, ACQUIRING
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN, OR SHARING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING THE AFFAIRS OF, A PROPERTY, PARTNERSHIP, JOINT VENTURE, CO-TENANCY OR OTHER ENTITY. THEREFORE, WE WILL NOT
BE IN A POSITION TO EXERCISE SOLE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY REGARDING THAT PROPERTY, PARTNERSHIP, JOINT VENTURE OR OTHER ENTITY. INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OR OTHER ENTITIES MAY
INVOLVE RISKS NOT PRESENT WERE A THIRD PARTY NOT INVOLVED, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR PARTNERS, CO-TENANTS OR CO-VENTURERS MIGHT BECOME BANKRUPT OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO
FUND THEIR SHARE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PARTNERS OR CO-VENTURERS MIGHT AT ANY TIME HAVE ECONOMIC OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS, WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT
WITH OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS OR GOALS. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF IMPASSES ON DECISIONS SUCH AS A SALE, BECAUSE NEITHER WE NOR THE PARTNER, CO-TENANT OR
CO-VENTURER WOULD HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THE PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE. CONSEQUENTLY, ACTIONS BY SUCH PARTNER, CO-TENANT OR CO-VENTURER MIGHT RESULT IN
SUBJECTING PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE TO ADDITIONAL RISK. IN ADDITION, WE MAY IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS,
CO-TENANTS OR CO-VENTURERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE OWNED ONE PROPERTY AND WE HAD AN AGGREGATE COST BASIS IN THE JOINT VENTURE TOTALING
APPROXIMATELY 51.3 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR SHARE OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE DEBT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 94.5 MILLION. 

OUR JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN TERMS IN FAVOR OF OUR PARTNERS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. 

 EACH OF OUR JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED WITH OUR PARTNER IN THE JOINT VENTURE AND, IN SOME CASES, WE HAVE
AGREED TO TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO OUR PARTNER IN THE JOINT VENTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, 

 11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR
PARTNER MAY BE ENTITLED TO A SPECIFIED PORTION OF THE PROFITS OF THE JOINT VENTURE BEFORE WE ARE ENTITLED TO ANY PORTION OF SUCH PROFITS AND OUR PARTNER MAY HAVE RIGHTS TO BUY OUR INTEREST IN THE
JOINT VENTURE, TO FORCE US TO BUY THE PARTNER'S INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE OR TO COMPEL THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY OWNED BY SUCH JOINT VENTURE. THESE RIGHTS MAY PERMIT OUR PARTNER IN A PARTICULAR
JOINT VENTURE TO OBTAIN A GREATER BENEFIT FROM THE VALUE OR PROFITS OF THE JOINT VENTURE THAN US, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE JOINT VENTURE AND ON OUR
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER POSSIBLE LIABILITIES. 

 WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REGULATE OUR USE, STORAGE, DISPOSAL AND MANAGEMENT OF
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES AND CAN IMPOSE LIABILITY ON PROPERTY OWNERS OR OPERATORS FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RELEASED ON A PROPERTY AND ANY ASSOCIATED DAMAGE
TO NATURAL RESOURCES WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE RELEASE WAS LEGAL OR WHETHER IT WAS CAUSED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER OR OPERATOR. THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES ON OUR PROPERTIES MAY ADVERSELY
AFFECT OCCUPANCY AND OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OR SELL OR BORROW AGAINST THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR CLEAN-UP COSTS, PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS MAY BRING CLAIMS FOR
PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR FOR SIMILAR REASONS. VARIOUS LAWS ALSO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CONTAMINATION AT ANY FACILITY (E.G., A LANDFILL) TO WHICH WE HAVE
SENT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES FOR TREATMENT OR DISPOSAL, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE MATERIALS WERE TRANSPORTED, TREATED AND DISPOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW. 

 WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS COMPLYING WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS. 

 OUR PROPERTIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER RISKS RELATING TO CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS INCLUDING LAWS BENEFITING DISABLED PERSONS, AND OTHER
STATE OR LOCAL ZONING, CONSTRUCTION OR OTHER REGULATIONS. THESE LAWS MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY MODIFICATIONS IN THE FUTURE FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE BUDGETED AND COULD RESULT IN FINES BEING
LEVIED AGAINST US. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS AND ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS. 

 UNDER
THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, OR ADA, ALL PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS MUST MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ACCESS AND USE BY DISABLED PERSONS. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL, STATE AND
LOCAL LAWS ALSO MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR PROPERTIES, OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO RENOVATE OUR PROPERTIES. WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED AN AUDIT OR INVESTIGATION OF ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES TO DETERMINE
OUR COMPLIANCE. IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ADA OR OTHER LEGISLATION, THEN WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO BRING THE PROPERTY INTO COMPLIANCE. WE
CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ADA OR OTHER LEGISLATION. IF WE INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THE ADA AND ANY OTHER LEGISLATION, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW AND/OR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

 WE FACE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 

 MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OVER WHETHER TO ENFORCE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH ENTITIES WITH WHICH SENIOR MANAGEMENT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, HAS AN
AFFILIATION. 

 THROUGH ALLIANCE BUILDING SERVICES, OR ALLIANCE, FIRST QUALITY MAINTENANCE, L.P., OR FIRST QUALITY, PROVIDES CLEANING,
EXTERMINATION AND RELATED SERVICES, CLASSIC SECURITY LLC PROVIDES SECURITY SERVICES, BRIGHT STAR COURIERS LLC PROVIDES MESSENGER SERVICES, AND ONYX RESTORATION WORKS PROVIDES RESTORATION
SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES OWNED BY US. ALLIANCE IS OWNED BY GARY GREEN, A SON OF STEPHEN L. GREEN, THE CHAIRMAN OF SL GREEN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SL GREEN AND ITS TENANTS ACCOUNTED
FOR APPROXIMATELY 23.7 OF ALLIANCE'S 2009 TOTAL REVENUE. THE CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO WHICH THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ARE NOT THE RESULT OF ARM'S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS AND, THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE THAT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE NOT LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE WHICH COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING COMPARABLE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CHOOSE TO ENFORCE
OUR RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS, WE MAY DETERMINE TO PURSUE AVAILABLE REMEDIES, SUCH 

 12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

AS
ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, LESS VIGOROUSLY THAN WE OTHERWISE MIGHT BECAUSE OF OUR DESIRE TO MAINTAIN OUR ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED. 

AS
OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, SERVICES WERE BEING PROVIDED BY THESE ENTITIES TO 11 OF THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY ROP. 

 MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OVER WHETHER TO ENFORCE TERMS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS. 

 STEPHEN GREEN, MARC HOLLIDAY, GREGORY HUGHES, ANDREW LEVINE AND ANDREW MATHIAS ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AND NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTS
WITH SL GREEN PURSUANT TO WHICH THEY HAVE AGREED NOT TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THE ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT OR OPERATION OF OFFICE REAL ESTATE IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA. FOR THE MOST PART
THESE RESTRICTIONS APPLY TO THE EXECUTIVE BOTH DURING HIS EMPLOYMENT AND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER. EACH EXECUTIVE IS ALSO PROHIBITED FROM OTHERWISE DISRUPTING OR INTERFERING WITH OUR BUSINESS
THROUGH THE SOLICITATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES OR CLIENTS OR OTHERWISE. TO THE EXTENT THAT SL GREEN CHOOSES TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS, SL GREEN MAY DETERMINE TO PURSUE AVAILABLE
REMEDIES, SUCH AS ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, LESS VIGOROUSLY THAN WE OTHERWISE MIGHT BECAUSE OF ITS DESIRE TO MAINTAIN ITS ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED.
ADDITIONALLY, THE NON-COMPETITION PROVISIONS OF THESE AGREEMENTS DESPITE BEING LIMITED IN SCOPE AND DURATION, COULD BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITED ENFORCEMENT,
SHOULD LITIGATION ARISE OVER THEM IN THE FUTURE. MR. GREEN HAS INTERESTS IN TWO PROPERTIES IN MANHATTAN, WHICH ARE EXEMPT FROM THE NON-COMPETITION PROVISIONS OF HIS EMPLOYMENT AND
NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT. 

 SL GREEN'S FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD BE COSTLY. 

 WE BELIEVE THAT SL GREEN HAS OPERATED IN A MANNER TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND SL GREEN INTENDS TO CONTINUE
TO SO OPERATE. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, HOWEVER, ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. THE DETERMINATION THAT SL GREEN IS A REIT REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS OF FACTUAL MATTERS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE
MATTERS, SOME OF WHICH MAY NOT BE TOTALLY WITHIN SL GREEN'S CONTROL, CAN AFFECT ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. FOR EXAMPLE, TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AT LEAST 95 OF SL GREEN'S GROSS INCOME MUST COME FROM
DESIGNATED SOURCES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE REIT TAX LAWS. SL GREEN IS ALSO REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO STOCKHOLDERS AT LEAST 90 OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME EXCLUDING CAPITAL GAINS. THE FACT THAT SL GREEN
HOLDS ITS ASSETS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES FURTHER COMPLICATES THE APPLICATION OF THE REIT REQUIREMENTS. EVEN A TECHNICAL OR INADVERTENT MISTAKE COULD JEOPARDIZE SL GREEN'S REIT STATUS. FURTHERMORE,
CONGRESS AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE IRS, MIGHT MAKE CHANGES TO THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE COURTS MIGHT ISSUE NEW RULINGS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT, OR
IMPOSSIBLE, FOR SL GREEN TO REMAIN QUALIFIED AS A REIT. 

 IF
SL GREEN FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES. ALSO, UNLESS THE IRS GRANTS SL GREEN RELIEF UNDER SPECIFIC STATUTORY
PROVISIONS, IT WOULD REMAIN DISQUALIFIED AS A REIT FOR FOUR YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR IT FIRST FAILED TO QUALIFY. IF SL GREEN FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, IT WOULD HAVE TO PAY SIGNIFICANT INCOME TAXES
AND ROP WOULD THEREFORE HAVE LESS MONEY AVAILABLE TO SERVICE INDEBTEDNESS. 

 SL GREEN WOULD INCUR ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES IF RARC FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. 

 SL GREEN HAS ASSUMED THAT RARC HAS HISTORICALLY QUALIFIED AS A REIT FOR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND THAT SL GREEN
WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOLLOWING THE MERGER. HOWEVER, IF RARC FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, SL GREEN GENERALLY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED TO SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE
SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DEEMED SALE OF ASSETS BY RARC PURSUANT TO THE MERGER). 

 WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FOR TENANTS. 

 THE LEASING OF REAL ESTATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF COMPETITION ARE RENT CHARGED, LOCATION, SERVICES PROVIDED AND
THE NATURE AND CONDITION OF THE FACILITY TO BE LEASED. WE DIRECTLY COMPETE WITH ALL LESSORS AND DEVELOPERS OF SIMILAR SPACE IN THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. DEMAND FOR RETAIL SPACE 

 13 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

HAS
BEEN IMPACTED BY THE RECENT BANKRUPTCY OF A NUMBER OF RETAIL COMPANIES AND A GENERAL TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR COMPANY TO
ATTRACT AND RETAIN TENANTS. 

 OUR
COMMERCIAL OFFICE PROPERTIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED AREAS OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN AND CERTAIN SUBURBAN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICTS, OR CBDS. MANHATTAN IS THE LARGEST OFFICE
MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE OFFICE PROPERTIES IN MANHATTAN AND CBDS IN WHICH OUR SUBURBAN PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED (WHICH MAY BE NEWER OR BETTER LOCATED THAN OUR PROPERTIES)
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO LEASE OFFICE SPACE AT OUR PROPERTIES, AND ON THE EFFECTIVE RENTS WE ARE ABLE TO CHARGE. 

 LOSS OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR OPERATIONS. 

 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EFFORTS OF STEPHEN L. GREEN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SL GREEN AND AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MARC
HOLLIDAY, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SL GREEN AND PRESIDENT OF WAGP, ANDREW MATHIAS, THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SL GREEN AND GREGORY F. HUGHES, THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AND
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF SL GREEN AND THE TREASURER OF WAGP. THESE OFFICERS HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WHICH EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2010, JANUARY 2013, DECEMBER 2010 AND JUNE 2010, RESPECTIVELY. A LOSS
OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. 

 OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WOULD SUFFER IN THE EVENT OF SYSTEM FAILURES. 

 DESPITE SYSTEM REDUNDANCY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY MEASURES AND THE EXISTENCE OF A DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN FOR OUR INTERNAL
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, OUR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGES FROM ANY NUMBER OF SOURCES, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, ENERGY BLACKOUTS, NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORISM, WAR
AND TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES. ANY SYSTEM FAILURE OR ACCIDENT THAT CAUSES INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL DISRUPTION TO OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY ALSO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO
REMEDY DAMAGES CAUSED BY SUCH DISRUPTIONS. 

 COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION APPLICABLE TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES, AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND AFFECT OUR
REPUTATION. 

 CHANGING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INCLUDING THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
2002 AND OTHER SEC REGULATIONS AND NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE RULES, ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES. THESE NEW OR CHANGED LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING
INTERPRETATIONS IN MANY CASES DUE TO THEIR LACK OF SPECIFICITY, AND AS A RESULT, THEIR APPLICATION IN PRACTICE MAY EVOLVE OVER TIME AS NEW GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED BY REGULATORY AND GOVERNING BODIES,
WHICH COULD RESULT IN CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY REGARDING COMPLIANCE MATTERS AND HIGHER COSTS NECESSITATED BY ONGOING REVISIONS TO DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING
HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. AS A RESULT, OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT
IN, INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND ATTENTION FROM REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES TO COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY
WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RELATED REGULATIONS REGARDING OUR REQUIRED ASSESSMENT OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS REQUIRED THE COMMITMENT OF
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE. WE EXPECT THESE EFFORTS TO
REQUIRE THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. FURTHER, OUR DIRECTORS, PRESIDENT AND TREASURER COULD FACE AN INCREASED RISK OF PERSONAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF
THEIR DUTIES. AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. IF OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH NEW OR CHANGED LAWS,
REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS DIFFER FROM THE ACTIVITIES INTENDED BY REGULATORY OR GOVERNING BODIES DUE TO AMBIGUITIES RELATED TO PRACTICE, OUR REPUTATION MAY BE HARMED.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 
 
 OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE HARMED IF THE MARKETS INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS DECLINE OR DO NOT GROW AS ANTICIPATED. 
 
 VISIBILITY INTO OUR MARKETS IS LIMITED. OUR QUARTERLY SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF ORDERS RECEIVED DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST AND MAY BE CANCELLED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR ORDERS ARE BACK-END LOADED TOWARD THE END OF OUR SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS AND THEIR TIMING MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN PLACE. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS FORECASTS FOR FUTURE FISCAL QUARTERS ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE EXPECTED SEASONALITY OF OUR MARKETS. HOWEVER, THE MARKETS WE SERVE DO NOT ALWAYS EXPERIENCE THE SEASONALITY THAT WE EXPECT. ANY DECLINE IN OUR CUSTOMERS' MARKETS OR IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, IF OUR CUSTOMERS' MARKETS DECLINE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ON OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS DUE TO US. SUCH DECLINES COULD HARM OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND STOCK PRICE, AND COULD LIMIT OUR PROFITABILITY. ALSO, IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT, PRICING PRESSURES COULD INTENSIFY. SINCE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IS RELATIVELY FIXED IN NATURE DUE TO SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING COSTS, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY ENOUGH THESE PRICING PRESSURES COULD FURTHER REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 IF WE DO NOT INTRODUCE SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER TO ADDRESS INCREASED COMPETITION THROUGH FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INTRODUCTIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CHANGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BECOME OBSOLETE, AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL SUFFER. 
 
 WE GENERALLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED COMPETITION THROUGH FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INTRODUCTIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CHANGING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SEASONAL. WITHOUT THE TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND ENHANCEMENTS, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BECOME TECHNOLOGICALLY OBSOLETE OVER TIME, IN WHICH CASE OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS WOULD SUFFER. THE SUCCESS OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO: 

PROPERLY IDENTIFY CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PREDICT FUTURE NEEDS; 
 
 INNOVATE AND DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS; 
 
 SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN A TIMELY MANNER; 
 
 MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS IN SUFFICIENT VOLUMES AND ON TIME; 
 
 DIFFERENTIATE OUR OFFERINGS FROM OUR COMPETITORS' OFFERINGS; 
 
 PRICE OUR PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY; 
 
 ANTICIPATE OUR COMPETITORS' DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS; AND 
 
 CONTROL PRODUCT QUALITY IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS. 
 
 GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO NEGATIVE CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTING IN: 

REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OF ORDERS, OR INCREASES IN ORDER CANCELLATIONS; 
 
 INCREASED RISK OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES; 
 
 INCREASED PRICE PRESSURE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; AND 
 
 GREATER RISK OF IMPAIRMENT TO THE VALUE, AND A DETRIMENT TO THE LIQUIDITY, OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. 
 
 FAILURE TO ADJUST OUR PURCHASES DUE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS OR FAILURE TO ESTIMATE OUR CUSTOMERS' DEMAND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INCOME. 
 
 OUR INCOME COULD BE HARMED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADJUST OUR PURCHASES TO REFLECT MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT, TO A LARGE DEGREE, ON CUSTOMERS WHOSE INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL TRENDS IN THE DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. DURING A MARKET UPTURN, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OR COMPONENTS TO MEET INCREASING PRODUCT DEMAND, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. IN THE PAST WE HAVE SEEN A SHORTAGE OF PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE PARTS THAT REQUIRE CUSTOM DESIGN ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS DUE TO THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN OR THE LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY FOR DESIGN WORK. SHOULD A SUPPLIER CEASE MANUFACTURING SUCH A COMPONENT, WE WOULD BE FORCED TO REENGINEER OUR PRODUCT. IN ADDITION TO DISCONTINUING PARTS, SUPPLIERS MAY ALSO EXTEND LEAD TIMES, LIMIT SUPPLIES OR INCREASE PRICES DUE TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OR OTHER FACTORS. IN ORDER TO SECURE COMPONENTS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS, WE MAY CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO NON-CANCELABLE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH VENDORS, OR AT TIMES MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST OUR INVENTORY TO DECLINING MARKET DEMANDS. IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS LESS THAN WE EXPECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES AND BE FORCED TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES. 
 
 DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEPENDS ON CAPITAL SPENDING POLICIES OF OUR CUSTOMERS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGETS AND ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING POLICIES. 
 
 OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, LABORATORIES, UNIVERSITIES, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGETS AT THESE ORGANIZATIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PUBLIC POLICY SPENDING PRIORITIES, AVAILABLE RESOURCES, MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATION, SPENDING PRIORITIES, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY POLICIES AND PRODUCT AND ECONOMIC CYCLES, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL SPENDING POLICIES OF THESE ENTITIES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGETS FLUCTUATE DUE TO CHANGES IN AVAILABLE RESOURCES, CONSOLIDATION, SPENDING PRIORITIES, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY POLICIES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUES FROM CUSTOMERS THAT RELY ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING OR RESEARCH MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO FACTORS THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. THESE POLICIES IN TURN CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED, OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS WOULD SUFFER.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 BECAUSE WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE, OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WHEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAS DECREASED REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, JOB FUNCTIONS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE HARMED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: 

INTERRUPTION TO TRANSPORTATION FLOWS FOR DELIVERY OF PARTS TO US AND FINISHED GOODS TO OUR CUSTOMERS; 
 
 CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; 
 
 CHANGES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY'S OR REGION'S POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS; 
 
 TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS; 
 
 NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FROM CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES TO U.S. TAX LEGISLATION THAT COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; 
 
 DIFFICULTY IN STAFFING AND MANAGING WIDESPREAD OPERATIONS; 
 
 DIFFERING LABOR REGULATIONS; 
 
 DIFFERING PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; 
 
 UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND 
 
 GEOPOLITICAL TURMOIL, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND WAR. 
 
 WE CENTRALIZED MOST OF OUR ACCOUNTING AND TAX PROCESSES TO TWO LOCATIONS: INDIA AND MALAYSIA. THESE PROCESSES INCLUDE GENERAL ACCOUNTING, COST ACCOUNTING, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND TAX FUNCTIONS. IF CONDITIONS CHANGE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATIONS, INCLUDING IMPAIRING OUR ABILITY TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS AND COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND POSSIBLE DELAYS MAY OCCUR IN REPORTING FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
 
 ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST COMPLY WITH COMPLEX FOREIGN AND U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT, AND OTHER LOCAL LAWS PROHIBITING CORRUPT PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS, AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES AND PENALTIES, CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ON OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR PRODUCTS IN ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES, AND COULD ALSO MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BRAND, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, OUR BUSINESS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE OUR POLICIES. 
 
 IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, ARE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, WITHIN ANY GIVEN TWELVE MONTH PERIOD, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY CURRENCY CONTROLS, COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES. HOWEVER, FOR EXPENSES BEYOND THAT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD, OUR HEDGING STRATEGY DOES NOT MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, OUR CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS INVOLVE THIRD PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE WEAKENING OR FAILURE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION THROUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A REDUCTION IN AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTIES, INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE TERMS, AND THE FAILURE OF THE COUNTERPARTIES TO PERFORM UNDER HEDGING CONTRACTS.

 OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD HAVE LONG-TERM ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE OPERATIONAL OR FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM SUCH ACTIONS. 
 
 WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MULTIPLE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES TO ADJUST OUR COST STRUCTURE, AND WE MAY ENGAGE IN SIMILAR ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE. THESE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OUR REGULAR ONGOING COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES MAY DISTRACT MANAGEMENT, COULD SLOW IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION QUICKLY IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCREASES. IN ADDITION, DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, UNEXPECTED COSTS OR FAILURE TO MEET TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS MAY DIMINISH THE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS WE REALIZE FROM SUCH ACTIONS. ANY OF THE ABOVE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN AND HIRE KEY PERSONNEL. 
 
 OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS PARTLY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF OUR KEY RESEARCH, ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. IF WE FAIL TO RETAIN AND HIRE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE PERSONNEL, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE VERY DYNAMIC, AND OUR BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO RESPOND WITH REORGANIZATIONS, WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AND SITE CLOSURES. WE BELIEVE OUR PAY LEVELS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE WITHIN THE REGIONS THAT WE OPERATE. HOWEVER, THERE IS AN INTENSE COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY TECHNICAL SPECIALTIES IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE WE CONTINUE TO RECRUIT, AND IT MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO RETAIN OUR KEY EMPLOYEES. 
 
 OUR ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED. 
 
 IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES, AND GENERALLY EXPECT TO COMPLETE SEVERAL TRANSACTIONS PER YEAR. AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR OWN OR THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY'S EXPECTATIONS IN A GIVEN FISCAL QUARTER, OR OVER THE LONG TERM. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING THE PRODUCTS OF A NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANY IN A WAY THAT ENHANCES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMBINED BUSINESSES OR PRODUCT LINES. TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE RESULT, IN UNEXPECTED SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND EXPENSES. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD CHARGES TO EARNINGS DURING THE PERIOD IF WE DETERMINE THERE IS AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, UP TO THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY REQUIRE US TO INTEGRATE A DIFFERENT COMPANY CULTURE, MANAGEMENT TEAM AND BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF AN ACQUISITION, OUR SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF THE ENTITY DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND MEETING REVENUE TARGETS AS EXPECTED, THE RETENTION OF KEY EMPLOYEES AND THE RETENTION OF KEY CUSTOMERS. 
 
 THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN OUR SYSTEMS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. ANY DIFFICULTIES IN THE ASSIMILATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO OUR CONTROL SYSTEM COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR CAUSE US TO FAIL TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. 
 
 A SUCCESSFUL DIVESTITURE DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER LIABILITIES, CONTRACTS, FACILITIES AND EMPLOYEES TO THE PURCHASER, IDENTIFY AND SEPARATE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BE DIVESTED FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT WE WISH TO KEEP AND REDUCE FIXED COSTS PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTED ASSETS OR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IF CUSTOMERS OF THE DIVESTED BUSINESS DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE FROM THE NEW OWNERS, THIS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OTHER BUSINESSES TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE CUSTOMERS ALSO PURCHASE OTHER AGILENT PRODUCTS. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS REQUIRE VARYING LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT RESOURCES, WHICH MAY DIVERT OUR ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OR SYNERGIES OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND STOCK PRICE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. 
 
 IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE. 
 
 EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO PROVIDE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND TIME TO COMPLY WITH THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SARBANES OXLEY ACT OF 2002. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN PART II ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT, BECAUSE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2015. THE COMPANY HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE ITS CONTROLS AND EXPECTS TO REMEDIATE THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT THESE MEASURES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT FUTURE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. INADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

INTEGRATING DAKO A/S MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT, COSTLY OR TIME CONSUMING THAN EXPECTED AND OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED. 
 
 WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED BENEFITS FROM OUR ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF DAKO. IN ADDITION, THE OPERATION OF DAKO WITHIN AGILENT MAY BE A DIFFICULT, COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS THAT INVOLVES A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: 

OUR RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE; 
 
 DIFFICULTIES IN MEETING NEW PRODUCT TIMELINES; 
 
 THE ABILITY TO GROW IN EMERGING MARKETS; 
 
 INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS; 
 
 INCREASED COSTS TO ADDRESS CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FDA WARNING LETTER RECEIVED IN AUGUST 2013 WHICH HAS NOW BEEN LIFTED BY THE FDA; 
 
 INCREASED COSTS AND USE OF RESOURCES; AND 
 
 DIFFICULTIES IN THE ASSIMILATION OF DIFFERENT CORPORATE CULTURES, PRACTICES AND SALES AND DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGIES, AS WELL AS IN THE ASSIMILATION AND RETENTION OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL. 
 
 EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE DAKO WITHIN AGILENT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE REVENUE AND OTHER SYNERGIES AND GROWTH THAT WE ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE EXPECTED, AND THE COSTS OF ACHIEVING THESE BENEFITS MAY BE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE EXPECTED. AS A RESULT, THE DAKO ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EARNINGS AS EXPECTED, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OUR OPERATING MARGIN TARGETS WHEN EXPECTED, OR AT ALL, AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE OTHER ANTICIPATED STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF THIS TRANSACTION. 
 
 OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, COMPLIANCE WITH OR CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN REGULATIONS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO RECALL PRODUCTS AND CEASE THEIR MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION, AND WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES. 
 
 OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY, PACKAGING, PRODUCT CONTENT, LABOR AND IMPORT/EXPORT REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS ARE COMPLEX, CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND HAVE TENDED TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS OR TO REMEDY VIOLATIONS OF THESE REGULATIONS. ANY FAILURE BY US TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ALSO RESULT IN CESSATION OF OUR OPERATIONS OR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS, PRODUCT RECALLS OR IMPOSITIONS OF FINES AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CARRY ON OR EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE REGULATED OR SOLD INTO REGULATED INDUSTRIES, WE MUST COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE DEVELOP, CONFIGURE AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS CREATED BY THESE REGULATIONS. ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THESE REGULATIONS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, FORCE US TO MODIFY OUR PRODUCTS TO COMPLY WITH NEW REGULATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS OF PRODUCING THESE PRODUCTS. IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED OR OUR COSTS INCREASE, OUR BUSINESS WOULD SUFFER. 
 
 OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO OFTEN SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF INDUSTRIAL STANDARDS BODIES, LIKE THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION, AS WELL AS REGULATION BY OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FDA ). WE ALSO MUST COMPLY WITH WORK SAFETY RULES. IF WE FAIL TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESSES COULD BE HARMED. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FDA AND CERTAIN SIMILAR FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FDA AND CERTAIN SIMILAR FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE IN THE FUTURE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FDA AND CERTAIN SIMILAR FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES. THESE REGULATIONS GOVERN A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCT RELATED ACTIVITIES, FROM QUALITY MANAGEMENT, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT TO LABELING, MANUFACTURING, PROMOTION, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION. IF WE OR ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FDA AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR ARE PERCEIVED TO POTENTIALLY HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY, WE MAY FACE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WARNING LETTERS, ADVERSE PUBLICITY AFFECTING BOTH US AND OUR CUSTOMERS; INVESTIGATIONS OR NOTICES OF NON-COMPLIANCE, FINES, INJUNCTIONS, AND CIVIL PENALTIES; IMPORT OR EXPORT RESTRICTIONS; PARTIAL SUSPENSIONS OR TOTAL SHUTDOWN OF PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR THE IMPOSITION OF OPERATING RESTRICTIONS; INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING REQUIRED FDA CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS OR FOREIGN EQUIVALENTS; SEIZURES OR RECALLS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS; OR THE INABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS. ANY SUCH FDA ACTIONS COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REMEDIAL COSTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 20 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE EXPOSED TO PARTICULAR COMPLEX REGULATIONS SUCH AS REGULATIONS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND RELATED CONSUMABLES ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHEMICALS WHOSE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING, DISTRIBUTION AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ARE REGULATED BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY EPA UNDER THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT, AND BY REGULATORY BODIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR LAWS. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT REGULATIONS GOVERN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TESTING, MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF CHEMICALS, THE TESTING OF REGULATED CHEMICALS FOR THEIR EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY AND IMPORT AND EXPORT OF CHEMICALS. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS PERSONS FROM MANUFACTURING ANY CHEMICAL IN THE U.S. THAT HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED BY EPA FOR ITS EFFECT ON HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND PLACED ON AN EPA INVENTORY OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES. WE MUST ENSURE CONFORMANCE OF THE MANUFACTURING, PROCESSING, DISTRIBUTION OF AND NOTIFICATION ABOUT THESE CHEMICALS TO THESE LAWS AND ADAPT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN ALL APPLICABLE COUNTRIES AS THESE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE NOTIFICATION, RECORD-KEEPING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN THE MANUFACTURE OR DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, THEN WE COULD BE MADE TO PAY CIVIL PENALTIES, FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND, IN SOME CASES, BE PROHIBITED FROM DISTRIBUTING OR MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS UNTIL THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENT SUBSTANCES ARE BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 
 
 WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES TO U.S., STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCIES. SUCH CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS PROCUREMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND CONTRACT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THEIR FORMATION, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR PROVISIONS IN OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF VARIOUS CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, OR SUSPENSION FROM FUTURE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING. IF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE TERMINATED, IF WE ARE SUSPENDED FROM GOVERNMENT WORK, OR IF OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR NEW CONTRACTS IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER. 
 
 OUR RETIREMENT AND POST RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT RETIREMENT AND POST RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INTEREST RATES IMPACT OUR PLAN EXPENSES AND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, DECREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT LOSSES ON PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE OUR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS, AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. 
 
 THE IMPACT OF CONSOLIDATION AND ACQUISITIONS OF COMPETITORS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS. 
 
 THE LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO INCREASING CONSOLIDATION. CONSOLIDATION IN OUR INDUSTRIES COULD RESULT IN EXISTING COMPETITORS INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE THROUGH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND RESULT IN STRONGER COMPETITORS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN INCREASINGLY CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES AND CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY HOW INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION WILL AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS OR US. 
 
 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE CONSOLIDATION AND STREAMLINING OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE DESIRED EFFICIENCIES AND OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD BE DISRUPTED. 
 
 ALTHOUGH WE UTILIZE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING, AND MAY CONTINUE TO CONSOLIDATE, OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS TO CERTAIN OF OUR PLANTS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES AND GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE TYPICALLY CONSOLIDATE THE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS INTO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, WHICH ARE TECHNICALLY COMPLEX AND REQUIRE EXPERTISE TO OPERATE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH PROCESSES TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED LOCATIONS, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES AND PRODUCTION MAY BE DISRUPTED, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER IF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DOES NOT MATCH THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 
 
 BECAUSE WE CANNOT IMMEDIATELY ADAPT OUR PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND RELATED COST STRUCTURES TO RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WHEN DEMAND DOES NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS, OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL LIKELY EXCEED OUR PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IF, DURING A GENERAL MARKET UPTURN OR AN UPTURN IN ONE OF OUR SEGMENTS, WE CANNOT INCREASE OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER WHICH COULD LEAD TO ORDER CANCELLATIONS, CONTRACT BREACHES OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. THIS INABILITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR 
 21 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 RESULTS. BY CONTRAST, IF DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE HAD EXCESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, THEN OUR FIXED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INCOME, MARGINS, AND OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 DEPENDENCE ON CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND OUTSOURCING OTHER PORTIONS OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDING LOGISTICS SERVICES, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. DEPENDENCE ON OUTSOURCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. 
 
 AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS AND TO CUT COSTS, WE OUTSOURCE ASPECTS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND OTHER FUNCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ADDITIONAL OUTSOURCING. IF OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHER OUTSOURCERS FAIL TO PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT SATISFACTORY QUALITY LEVELS, OUR ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET AND OUR REPUTATION COULD SUFFER. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING A MARKET UPTURN, OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET OUR DEMAND REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY PRECLUDE US FROM FULFILLING OUR CUSTOMERS' ORDERS ON A TIMELY BASIS. THE ABILITY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS TO PERFORM IS LARGELY OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGING OR REPLACING OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS OR OTHER OUTSOURCERS COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS. IN ADDITION, WE OUTSOURCE SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ("IT") AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. SINCE IT IS CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS, ANY FAILURE TO PERFORM ON THE PART OF OUR IT PROVIDERS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS OUTLINED ABOVE, PROBLEMS WITH MANUFACTURING OR IT OUTSOURCING COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES, UNEXECUTED EFFICIENCIES, AND IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR STOCK PRICE. MUCH OF OUR OUTSOURCING TAKES PLACE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE SUBJECT TO GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST OPERATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO UNREIMBURSED COSTS AND COULD HARM ON-SITE OPERATIONS AND THE FUTURE USE AND VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES INVOLVED AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY ONGOING OPERATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
 CERTAIN PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED TO KEYSIGHT AS PART OF THE SEPARATION ARE UNDERGOING REMEDIATION BY HP INC. AND HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE (FORMERLY HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY) (TOGETHER "HP") FOR SUBSURFACE CONTAMINATIONS THAT WERE KNOWN AT THE TIME OF OUR SEPARATION FROM HP. HP HAS AGREED TO RETAIN THE LIABILITY FOR THIS SUBSURFACE CONTAMINATION, PERFORM THE REQUIRED REMEDIATION AND INDEMNIFY KEYSIGHT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THAT CONTAMINATION. HP WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE KEYSIGHT PROPERTIES TO PERFORM REMEDIATION. WHILE HP HAS AGREED TO MINIMIZE INTERFERENCE WITH ON-SITE OPERATIONS AT THOSE PROPERTIES, REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND SUBSURFACE CONTAMINATION MAY REQUIRE KEYSIGHT TO INCUR UNREIMBURSED COSTS AND COULD HARM ON-SITE OPERATIONS AND THE FUTURE USE AND VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT KEYSIGHT WILL NOT SEEK ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM US FOR THAT INTERFERENCE OR UNREIMBURSED COSTS. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT HP WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL ITS INDEMNIFICATION OR REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS, IN WHICH CASE KEYSIGHT MAY SEEK INDEMNIFICATION FROM US. IN ADDITION, THE DETERMINATION OF THE EXISTENCE AND COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY US PRIOR TO THE SEPARATION COULD INVOLVE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING NEGOTIATIONS AND LITIGATION. 
 
 OTHER THAN THOSE PROPERTIES CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REMEDIATION BY HP, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY HP, WITH RESPECT TO ANY LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINATION FROM PAST OPERATIONS, AND KEYSIGHT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINATION PRIOR TO THE SEPARATION, AT, RESPECTIVELY, PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED FROM HP TO US AND PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED BY US TO KEYSIGHT. WHILE WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY MATERIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY POTENTIAL SUBSURFACE CONTAMINATION AT ANY OF THOSE PROPERTIES, SUBSURFACE CONTAMINATION MAY EXIST, AND WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO MATERIAL LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT CONTAMINATION. 
 
 OUR CURRENT AND HISTORICAL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES INVOLVE, OR HAVE INVOLVED, THE USE OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION, AND THESE LIABILITIES MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. WHILE WE HAVE DIVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR RELATED BUSINESSES TO AVAGO AND ADVANTEST CORPORATION AND REGARDLESS OF INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THOSE PARTIES, WE MAY STILL BECOME SUBJECT TO LIABILITIES FOR HISTORICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION RELATED TO THOSE BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH OUR POLICY IS TO APPLY STRICT STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AT OUR SITES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., EVEN IF THE SITES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF ALL CONDITIONS THAT COULD SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY. 
 
 AS PART OF OUR ACQUISITION OF VARIAN, WE ASSUMED THE LIABILITIES OF VARIAN, INCLUDING VARIAN'S COSTS AND POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. ONE SUCH COST IS OUR OBLIGATION, ALONG WITH THE OBLIGATION OF VARIAN SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATES, INC. ("VSEA") (UNDER THE TERMS OF A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN VARIAN, VSEA AND VARIAN MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC. ("VMS")) TO EACH INDEMNIFY VMS FOR ONE-THIRD OF CERTAIN COSTS (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ANY INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED OR REALIZED BY VMS FOR SUCH COSTS) RELATING TO (A) ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION, MONITORING AND/OR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT CERTAIN FACILITIES PREVIOUSLY OPERATED BY VARIAN ASSOCIATES, INC. ("VAI") AND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THOSE FACILITIES, AND (B) U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT VAI OR VMS IS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF

 1980, AS AMENDED ("CERCLA") IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SITES TO WHICH VAI ALLEGEDLY SHIPPED MANUFACTURING WASTE FOR RECYCLING, TREATMENT OR DISPOSAL (THE "CERCLA SITES"). WITH RESPECT TO THE FACILITIES FORMERLY OPERATED BY VAI, VMS IS OVERSEEING THE ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION, MONITORING AND/OR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, IN MOST CASES UNDER THE DIRECTION OF, OR IN CONSULTATION WITH, FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL AGENCIES, AND HANDLING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. VMS IS ALSO HANDLING CLAIMS RELATING TO THE CERCLA SITES. ALTHOUGH ANY ULTIMATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL- RELATED MATTERS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES THAT, IF AGGREGATED AND ASSUMED TO OCCUR WITHIN A SINGLE FISCAL YEAR, COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCE IS CONSIDERED REMOTE. BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND OUR BEST ASSESSMENT OF THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EVENTS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED MATTERS ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 REGULATIONS RELATED TO CONFLICT MINERALS MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND COULD LIMIT THE SUPPLY AND INCREASE THE COST OF CERTAIN METALS USED IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS. 
 
 IN AUGUST 2012, THE SEC ADOPTED A NEW RULE REQUIRING DISCLOSURES BY PUBLIC COMPANIES OF SPECIFIED MINERALS, KNOWN AS CONFLICT MINERALS, THAT ARE NECESSARY TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OR PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OR CONTRACTED TO BE MANUFACTURED. THE RULE, WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2013 AND REQUIRES AN ANNUAL DISCLOSURE REPORT TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC BY MAY 31ST OF EACH YEAR, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE, DISCLOSE AND REPORT WHETHER OR NOT SUCH MINERALS ORIGINATE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO OR AN ADJOINING COUNTRY. THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING FOR DILIGENCE IN REGARDS TO THE SOURCES OF ANY CONFLICT MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF REMEDIATION AND OTHER CHANGES TO PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, OR SOURCES OF SUPPLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, OUR ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SOURCING, SUPPLY, AND PRICING OF MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. THE RULE COULD AFFECT SOURCING AT COMPETITIVE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF CERTAIN MINERALS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING TIN, TANTALUM, GOLD AND TUNGSTEN. THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS WHO PROVIDE CONFLICT-FREE MINERALS MAY BE LIMITED. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF CERTAIN MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS COSTS OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, OR SOURCES OF SUPPLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES. AS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IS COMPLEX AND WE USE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY VERIFY THE ORIGINS OF THE RELEVANT MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCEDURES THAT WE IMPLEMENT, WHICH MAY HARM OUR REPUTATION. WE MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES TO SATISFY THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS BE CERTIFIED AS CONFLICT-FREE, WHICH COULD PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. 
 
 THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM THAT WE ARE INFRINGING THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. 
 
 FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE ANALYZE AND TAKE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CLAIMS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. ANY DISPUTE OR LITIGATION REGARDING PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD BE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION AND COULD DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. A CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT COULD FORCE US TO ENTER INTO A COSTLY OR RESTRICTIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT, WHICH MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE UNDER ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, COULD REQUIRE US TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD BE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING, AND/OR COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR TO AN INJUNCTION AGAINST DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT BE USEFUL IN ASSERTING A COUNTERCLAIM, OR NEGOTIATING A LICENSE, IN RESPONSE TO A CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSES AND WE CANNOT ENSURE THAT THESE LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. 
 
 THIRD PARTIES MAY INFRINGE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND WE MAY SUFFER COMPETITIVE INJURY OR EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ENFORCING OUR RIGHTS. 
 
 OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY WE OBTAINED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. WE RELY ON VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADE SECRETS, AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, TO ESTABLISH OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. IF WE DO NOT ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SUCCESSFULLY OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY SUFFER WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS. 
 
 OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS, AND OUR PENDING COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK REGISTRATION APPLICATIONS, MAY NOT BE ALLOWED OR COMPETITORS MAY CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR SCOPE OF OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS OR TRADEMARKS. IN ADDITION, OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT PROVIDE US A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. 
 
 WE MAY NEED TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES MONITORING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETECT INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY BE HARMED IF WE CANNOT DETECT INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCE OUR 
 23 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS QUICKLY OR AT ALL. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY CHOOSE TO NOT PURSUE ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE AN INFRINGER HAS A DOMINANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITION OR FOR OTHER BUSINESS REASONS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS MIGHT AVOID INFRINGEMENT BY DESIGNING AROUND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR BY DEVELOPING NON-INFRINGING COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THEM MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN SOME COUNTRIES WHICH COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMPETITORS TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE AND COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES. FURTHERMORE, SOME OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS LICENSED TO OTHERS WHICH ALLOW THEM TO COMPETE WITH US USING THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS OF OUR TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH AUDIT OR EXAMINATION BY THE IRS OR OTHER TAX AUTHORITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. 
 
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS OF OUR TAX RETURNS BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE ASSESSMENTS CAN REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF INVENTORY, SERVICES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COST SHARE ARRANGEMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITIES. THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. A DIFFERENCE IN THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF TAX UNCERTAINTIES FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 IF TAX INCENTIVES CHANGE OR CEASE TO BE IN EFFECT, OUR INCOME TAXES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. 
 
 AGILENT BENEFITS FROM TAX INCENTIVES EXTENDED TO ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT OR EMPLOYMENT. SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE GRANTED AGILENT TAX INCENTIVES WHICH REQUIRE RENEWAL AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THE FUTURE. THE INCENTIVES ARE CONDITIONED ON ACHIEVING VARIOUS THRESHOLDS OF INVESTMENTS AND EMPLOYMENT, OR SPECIFIC TYPES OF INCOME. AGILENT'S TAXES COULD INCREASE IF THE INCENTIVES ARE NOT RENEWED UPON EXPIRATION. IF AGILENT CANNOT OR DOES NOT WISH TO SATISFY ALL OR PARTS OF THE TAX INCENTIVE CONDITIONS, WE MAY LOSE THE RELATED TAX INCENTIVE AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO REFUND TAX INCENTIVES PREVIOUSLY REALIZED. AS A RESULT, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD BE HIGHER THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE MAINTAINED THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX INCENTIVES. 
 
 WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE MOST OF OUR CASH IS GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF CASH SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 ALTHOUGH THE CASH GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES FROM OUR OPERATIONS SHOULD COVER OUR NORMAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CASH IS REQUIRED FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES SUCH AS THE MATURITY OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR DECLARED DIVIDENDS AND ACQUISITIONS OF THIRD PARTIES. OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE WERE UNABLE TO ADDRESS OUR U.S. CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY REPATRIATIONS OF OVERSEAS CASH OR OTHER SOURCES OF CASH OBTAINED AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST. 
 
 WE HAVE OUTSTANDING DEBT AND MAY INCUR OTHER DEBT IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY HAVE OUTSTANDING AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.6 BILLION IN SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, AND A 38 MILLION SECURED MORTGAGE. WE ALSO ARE PARTY TO A FIVE-YEAR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHICH EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2019. ON JUNE 9, 2015, WE INCREASED THE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY BY 300 MILLION SO THAT THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE FACILITY NOW TOTAL 700 MILLION AND RETAINED A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS US TO FURTHER INCREASE COMMITMENTS TO THE CREDIT FACILITY BY 300 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. WE MAY BORROW ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS IN THE FUTURE AND USE THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE BORROWING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, OTHER FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS OR REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. 
 
 OUR INCURRENCE OF THIS DEBT, AND INCREASES IN OUR AGGREGATE LEVELS OF DEBT, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS: 

INCREASING OUR VULNERABILITY TO DOWNTURNS IN OUR BUSINESS, TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS; 
 
 REQUIRING THE DEDICATION OF AN INCREASED PORTION OF OUR EXPECTED CASH FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, THEREBY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS; AND 
 
 LIMITING OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. 
 24 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

OUR CURRENT REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON US, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE LIENS ON OUR ASSETS AND THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO INCUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIED FINANCIAL RATIOS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE RATIOS MAY BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING OUR SENIOR NOTES CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INCUR CERTAIN LIENS OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. IF WE BREACH ANY OF THE COVENANTS AND DO NOT OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM THE LENDERS, THEN, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE CURE PERIODS, OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS COULD BE DECLARED IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. 
 
 IF WE SUFFER A LOSS TO OUR FACTORIES, FACILITIES OR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DUE TO CATASTROPHE, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. 
 
 OUR FACTORIES, FACILITIES AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ARE SUBJECT TO CATASTROPHIC LOSS DUE TO FIRE, FLOOD, TERRORISM OR OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS. IN PARTICULAR, SEVERAL OF OUR FACILITIES COULD BE SUBJECT TO A CATASTROPHIC LOSS CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKE DUE TO THEIR LOCATIONS. OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES, HEADQUARTERS AND AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES LABORATORIES IN CALIFORNIA, AND OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN JAPAN, ARE ALL LOCATED IN AREAS WITH ABOVE-AVERAGE SEISMIC ACTIVITY. IF ANY OF THESE FACILITIES WERE TO EXPERIENCE A CATASTROPHIC LOSS, IT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, DELAY PRODUCTION, SHIPMENTS AND REVENUE AND RESULT IN LARGE EXPENSES TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE FACILITY. IF SUCH A DISRUPTION WERE TO OCCUR, WE COULD BREACH AGREEMENTS, OUR REPUTATION COULD BE HARMED, AND OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, SINCE WE HAVE CONSOLIDATED OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE IN ANY ONE LOCATION. ALTHOUGH WE CARRY INSURANCE FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WE DO NOT CARRY INSURANCE OR FINANCIAL RESERVES FOR INTERRUPTIONS OR POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM EARTHQUAKES OR TERRORISM. ALSO, OUR THIRD PARTY INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL VARY FROM TIME TO TIME IN BOTH TYPE AND AMOUNT DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN THIRD PARTY INSURANCE. IF OUR THIRD PARTY INSURANCE COVERAGE IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED, OR TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE ELECTED TO SELF-INSURE, WE MAY BE AT A GREATER RISK THAT OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE HARMED BY A CATASTROPHIC LOSS. 
 
 IF WE EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN, OR BREACH IN SECURITY OF, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, OR IF WE FAIL TO IMPLEMENT NEW SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE SUCCESSFULLY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 
 
 WE RELY ON SEVERAL CENTRALIZED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT OUR COMPANY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, KEEP FINANCIAL RECORDS, PROCESS ORDERS, MANAGE INVENTORY, PROCESS SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS AND OPERATE OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE, DISRUPTIONS OR SHUTDOWNS DUE TO POWER OUTAGES, HARDWARE FAILURES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, ATTACKS BY COMPUTER HACKERS, TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES, USER ERRORS, CATASTROPHES OR OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ALSO MAY EXPERIENCE INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE OR PRODUCE ERRORS IN CONNECTION WITH SYSTEM INTEGRATION, SOFTWARE UPGRADES OR SYSTEM MIGRATION WORK THAT TAKES PLACE FROM TIME TO TIME. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE A PROLONGED SYSTEM DISRUPTION IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THAT INVOLVE OUR INTERACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, IT COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SALES AND CUSTOMERS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL COSTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SECURITY BREACHES OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD RESULT IN THE MISAPPROPRIATION OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BELONGING TO US OR TO OUR EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR SUFFERING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. 
 
 ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL BANKING INDUSTRY AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR CASH INVESTMENTS OR IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY. 
 
 AS OF OCTOBER 31 2015, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 2.0 BILLION INVESTED OR HELD IN A MIX OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, TIME DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND BANK DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY, IN SOME CASES, RESULT IN AN INABILITY TO ACCESS ASSETS SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS HIGHLY LIQUID. ANY FAILURE OF OUR COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR FUNDS IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT POSITIONS AND, IN TURN, OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. 
 
 WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY IF THE DISTRIBUTION OF KEYSIGHT COMMON STOCK TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IS DETERMINED TO BE A TAXABLE TRANSACTION. 
 
 WE HAVE RECEIVED AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE TAX COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF KEYSIGHT QUALIFIES AS A TRANSACTION THAT IS DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 355(A) AND 368(A)(1)(D) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE OPINION RELIES ON CERTAIN FACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS FROM KEYSIGHT AND US REGARDING THE PAST AND FUTURE CONDUCT OF THE COMPANIES RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND OTHER MATTERS. IF ANY OF THESE FACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS ARE INCORRECT OR NOT SATISFIED, OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE OPINION OF TAX COUNSEL AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE OPINION OF TAX COUNSEL WE HAVE RECEIVED, THE IRS COULD DETERMINE ON AUDIT THAT THE SEPARATION IS 
 25 

 TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 TAXABLE IF IT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE FACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS ARE NOT CORRECT OR HAVE BEEN VIOLATED OR IF IT DISAGREES WITH THE CONCLUSIONS IN THE OPINION. IF THE SEPARATION IS DETERMINED TO BE TAXABLE FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, OUR SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. 
 
 WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE SEPARATION WITH KEYSIGHT. 
 
 WE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT AND VARIOUS OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH KEYSIGHT TO GOVERN THE SEPARATION AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO COMPANIES GOING FORWARD. THESE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC INDEMNITY AND LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS AND COULD LEAD TO DISPUTES BETWEEN US. THE INDEMNITY RIGHTS WE HAVE AGAINST KEYSIGHT UNDER THE AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT US. IN ADDITION, OUR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO KEYSIGHT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND THESE RISKS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
