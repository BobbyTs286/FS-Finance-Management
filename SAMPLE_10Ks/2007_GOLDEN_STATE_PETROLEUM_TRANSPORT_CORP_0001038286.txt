CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Matters discussed in this document may constitute forward-looking statements.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor
protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to
provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements
include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which
are other than statements of historical facts.

Golden State Petroleum Transport Corporation (the "Company") desires to take
advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with
this safe harbor legislation. This document and any other written or oral
statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements,
which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intends," "estimate,"
"forecast," "project," "plan," S &"potential," "will," "may," "should" and
similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements in this document are based upon various
assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions,
including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating
trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third
parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made,
because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties
and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond
our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these
expectations, beliefs or projections.

In addition to these important factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein
and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, important factors that,
in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world
economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in
charterhire rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the tanker market,
including changes in demand resulting from changes in OPEC's petroleum
production levels and world wide oil consumption and storage, changes in the
Company's operating expenses, changes in governmental rules and regulations or
actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or
future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions,
potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events,
and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by
the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1. Business

The Company
Golden State Petroleum Transport Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 5, 1996. We are a special
purpose corporation that was organized solely for the purpose of issuing, as
agent for two affiliated entities Golden State Petro (IOM I-A) PLC and Golden
State Petro (IOM I-B) PLC (together, the "Owners"), Serial and Term mortgage
notes (together the "Notes"). These Notes were issued on December 24, 1996 and
January 6, 1997 and proceeds were used by the Owners to finance the construction
and acquisition of two very large crude carriers ("VLCCs" or the "Vessels") for
charter to an unaffiliated third party (the "Initial Charterer"). The Notes are
not our obligations and we do not guarantee them.

Golden State Holdings I, Limited ("GSH"), an Isle of Man company, is the owner
of all of our issued and outstanding shares along with all of the issued and
outstanding share of the Owners. GSH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Independent
Tankers Corporation, a Cayman Islands company ("ITC"), which itself is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Frontline Ltd ("Frontline"), a Bermuda company listed
on the New York, Oslo and London Stock Exchanges.

In accordance with a management agreement between each of the Owners and
Frontline, Frontline provides administrative, management and advisory services
for an annual fee of 50,000 each, payable semi-annually. All costs of
administering both us and the Owners are payable by Frontline from this
management fee. The management agreement is effective until termination by
either party upon 30 days prior written notice.

We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. In accordance with these requirements, we file reports and
other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party or of
which our property is the subject. In the future, we may be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business which, even if lacking
merit, could result in the expenditure by us of significant financial and
managerial resources.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation

We are a special purpose corporation that was organized solely to issue, as
agent on behalf of the Owners, the Notes. We have had no activity since 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have had no activity since December 31, 1996 and we have no source of
liquidity and no capital resources.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

There were no new accounting standards that would have an impact on our results.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 "Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements, which provides interpretative guidance on how registrants should
quantify financial statement misstatements. Under SAB 108 registrants are
required to consider both a "rollover" method, which focuses primarily on the
income statement impact of misstatements, and the "iron curtain" method, which
focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements. The effects of
prior year uncorrected errors include the potential accumulation of improper
amounts that may result in material misstatement on the balance sheet or the
reversal of prior period errors in the current period that result in a material
misstatement of the current period income statement amounts. Adjustments to
current or prior period financial statements would be required in the event that
after application of various approaches for assessing materiality of a
misstatement in a current period financial statements and consideration of all
relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, a misstatement is determined to
be material. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 as of December 31, 2006. The
adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations or financial position

Contractual obligations

As at December 31, 2006, we had no contractual obligations and commitments:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder
Golden State Petroleum Transport Corporation

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Golden State Petroleum
Transport Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden State Holdings I,
Limited, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related statements of
operations and retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Golden State Petroleum
Transport Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its
operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. GENERAL

Golden State Petroleum Transport Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 5, 1996. The Company is a
special purpose corporation that was organised solely for the purpose of issuing
certain mortgage notes as agent for two affiliated entities, Golden State Petro

of administering the Owners and the Company are payable by Frontline from the

and operation of vessels that transport crude oil and oil products.

Some of the oil tankers owned by Frontline may operate in competition with the
Vessels. When the charters with the Initial Charterer end, Frontline might have
a conflict of interest between its duties as manager of the Owners and the
Vessels, and its interests as a competing tanker owner.
