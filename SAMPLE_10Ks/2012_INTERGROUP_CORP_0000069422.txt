PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

GENERAL 

The InterGroup Corporation InterGroup or the
 Company and may also be referred to as we us or our in this report) is
a Delaware corporation formed in 1985, as the successor to Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust M-REIT ), a New York
real estate investment trust created in 1965. The Company has been a publicly-held company since M-REIT's first public offering
of shares in 1966. 

The Company was organized to buy, develop, operate, rehabilitate
and dispose of real property of various types and descriptions, and to engage in such other business and investment activities
as would benefit the Company and its shareholders. The Company was founded upon, and remains committed to, social responsibility.
Such social responsibility was originally defined as providing decent and affordable housing to people without regard to race.
In 1985, after examining the impact of federal, state and local equal housing laws, the Company determined to broaden its definition
of social responsibility. The Company changed its form from a REIT to a corporation so that it could pursue a variety of investments
beyond real estate and broaden its social impact to engage in any opportunity which would offer the potential to increase shareholder
value within the Company's underlying commitment to social responsibility. 

As of June 30, 2012, the Company owned approximately 79.9 
of the common shares of Santa Fe Financial Corporation Santa Fe ), a public company (OTCBB: SFEF). Santa Fe s
revenue is primarily generated through its 68.8 owned subsidiary, Portsmouth Square, Inc. Portsmouth ), a public
company (OTCBB: PRSI). InterGroup also directly owns approximately 12.5 of Portsmouth. Portsmouth s principal business
is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in the Justice Investors limited partnership Justice 
or the Partnership ). The Portsmouth has a 50.0 limited partnership interest in Justice and serves as the Managing
General Partner. The other general partner is Evon Corporation Evon ). Justice owns a 543 room hotel property located
at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California 94108, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the
 Hotel and related facilities, including a five level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Justice
are consolidated with those of the Company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Most significant partnership decisions require the active participation
and approval of both general partners. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, voting rights of the partners are determined
according to the partners entitlement to share in the net profit and loss of the partnership. The Company is not entitled
to any additional voting rights by virtue of its position as a general partner. The partnership agreement provides that no portion
of the partnership real property can be sold without the written consent of the general partners and the limited partners entitled
to more than 72 of the net profit. The partnership agreement also provides that amendments to the agreement may be made only
upon the consent of the general partners and at least seventy 75 of the interests of the limited partners and the consent of
at least 75 of the interests of the limited partners will also be required to remove a general partner. As of June 30, 2012,
there were 113 limited partners in Justice, including Portsmouth and Evon. 

Historically, the Partnership s most significant source
of income was a lease between Justice and Holiday Inn for the Hotel portion of the property. That lease was amended in 1995, and
ultimately assumed by Felcor Lodging Trust, Inc. Felcor in 1998. The lease of the Hotel to Felcor was terminated
effective June 30, 2004. With the termination of the Hotel lease, Justice assumed the role of an owner/operator with the assistance
of a third party management company. Effective July 1, 2004, the Hotel was operated as a Holiday Inn Select brand hotel pursuant
to a short-term franchise agreement until it was temporarily closed for major renovations on May 31, 2005. The Hotel was reopened
on January 12, 2006 to operate as a full service Hilton hotel, pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with Hilton Hotels Corporation.
Justice also has a Management Agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. Prism to perform the day-to-day management
functions of the Hotel. 

4 

Until September 30, 2008, the Partnership also derived income
from the lease of the parking garage to Evon. As discussed below, effective October 1, 2008, Justice entered into an installment
sale agreement with Evon to purchase the remaining term of the garage lease and related garage assets at which time the garage
became a part of the Partnership s operations. Justice also leases a portion of the lobby level of the Hotel to a day spa
operator. Portsmouth also receives management fees as the Managing General Partner of Justice for its services in overseeing and
managing the Partnership s assets and limited partnership distributions as may be declared by Justice. 

In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also
generates income from the ownership, management and, when appropriate, sale of real estate. Properties include seventeen apartment
complexes, two commercial real estate properties and two single-family houses. The properties are located throughout the United
States, but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has investments in unimproved real property. All
of the Company s residential rental properties in California are managed by professional third party property management
companies and the rental properties outside of California are managed by the Company. The commercial real estate in California
is also managed by the Company. 

The Company acquires its investments in real estate and other
investments utilizing cash, securities or debt, subject to approval or guidelines of the Board of Directors and its Real Estate
Investment Committee. The Company may also look for new real estate investment opportunities in hotels, apartments, office buildings
and development properties. The acquisition of any new real estate investments will depend on the Company s ability to find
suitable investment opportunities and the availability of sufficient financing to acquire such investments. To help fund any such
acquisition, the Company may borrow funds to leverage its investment capital. The amount of any such debt will depend on a number
of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of financing and the sufficiency of the acquisition property s
projected cash flows to support the operations and debt service. 

The Company also derives income from the investment of its
cash and investment securities assets. The Company has invested in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and
will consider other investments if such investments offer growth or profit potential. See Item 7. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company s marketable securities and
other investments. 

RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS 

Garage Installment Sale Agreement and Parking Facilities
Management Agreement 

Effective October 1, 2008, Justice and Evon entered into an
Installment Sale Agreement whereby the Partnership purchased all of Evon s right title and interest in the remaining term

to assume Evon s contract with Ace Parking Management, Inc. Ace Parking for the management of the garage
and any other liabilities related to the operation of the garage commencing October 1, 2008. The purchase price for the garage
lease and related assets was approximately 755,000, payable in one down payment of approximately 28,000 and 26 equal monthly

(90) days written notice. The monthly management fee of 2,000 and the accounting fee of 250 remain the same, but the amendment
modified how the Excess Profit Fee to be paid to Ace would be calculated. The amendment provides that, if net operating income NOI from the garage operations exceeds 1,800,000 but is less than 2,000,000, Ace will be entitled to an Excess
Profit Fee of one percent (1 of the total annual NOI. If the annual NOI is 2,000,000 or higher, Ace will be entitled to an
Excess Profit Fee equal to two percent (2 of the total annual NOI. The prior Excess Profit Fee entitled Ace to receive three

On December 10, 2004, the Partnership entered into a Franchise
License Agreement with Hilton Hotels Corporation (the Franchise Agreement for the right to operate the Hotel as
a Hilton brand hotel. The term of the Franchise Agreement is for 15 years commencing on the opening date of the Hotel, January
12, 2006, with an option to extend that Agreement for another five years, subject to certain conditions. 

Pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, the Partnership paid monthly
royalty fees for the first two years of three percent (3 of the Hotel s gross room revenue, as defined, for the preceding
calendar month; the third year was at four percent (4 of the Hotel s gross room revenue; and the fourth year until the
end of the term will be five percent (5 of the Hotel s gross room revenue. Justice also pays a monthly program fee of
four percent (4 of the Hotel s gross room revenue. The amount of the monthly program fee is subject to change; however,
the increase cannot exceed one percent (1 of the Hotel gross room revenue in any calendar year, and the cumulative increases
in the monthly fees will not exceed five percent (5 of gross room revenue. The Partnership also pays a monthly information technology
recapture charge of 0.75 of the Hotel s gross revenue. Due to the difficult economic environment, Hilton agreed to reduce
its information technology fees to 0.65 for the 2010 calendar year. 

Prior to operating the Hotel as a Hilton hotel, the Partnership
was required to make substantial renovations to the Hotel to meet Hilton standards in accordance with a product improvement plan PIP agreed upon by Hilton and the Partnership, as well as comply with other brand standards. That project included
a complete renovation and upgrade of all of the Hotel s guestrooms, meeting rooms, common areas and restaurant and bar.

to open the Hotel as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District . The Hotel opened with a limited number of rooms
available to rent, which increased as the Hotel transitioned into full operations by the end of February 2006. 

The total cost of the construction-renovation project of the
Hotel was approximately 37,030,000, which includes approximately 630,000 in interest costs incurred during the construction
phase that were capitalized. To meet those substantial financial commitments, and the costs of operations during the renovation
period and for the first five months when the Hotel ramped up its operations, the Partnership has relied on additional borrowings
to meet its obligations. As discussed in Item 2. Properties, the Partnership was able to secure adequate financing, collateralized
by the Hotel, to meet those commitments.

HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY AGREEMENT 

In February 2007, the Partnership terminated its prior hotel
management agreement with Dow Hotel Company and entered into a management agreement with Prism Hospitality Prism to manage and operate the Hotel as its agent, effective February 10, 2007. Prism is an experienced Hilton approved operator of
upscale and luxury hotels throughout the Americas. The agreement is effective for a term of ten years, unless the agreement is

fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. In support of the Partnership s efforts to reduce costs in this difficult economic
environment, Prism agreed to reduce its management fees by fifty percent from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, after
which the original fee provision went back into effect. Management fees paid to Prism during the years ended June 30, 2012 and
2011 were 626,000 and 469,000, respectively. 

GARAGE OPERATIONS 

As discussed above, until September 30, 2008, the garage portion
of the Hotel property was leased by the Partnership to Evon. Effective October 1, 2008, Justice and Evon entered into an Installment
Sale Agreement whereby the Partnership purchased all of Evon s right title and interest in the remaining term of its lease
of the parking garage, which was to expire on November 30, 2010, and other related assets. The Partnership also agreed to assume
Evon s contract with Ace Parking Management, Inc. Ace Parking for the management of the garage and any other
liabilities related to the operation of the garage commencing October 1, 2008. 

The garage is currently operated by Ace Parking for the Partnership
pursuant to a Parking Facilities Management Agreement (the Parking Agreement ). The initial term of the Parking Agreement
was to expire on October 31, 2010, with an option to renew for another five-year term. Pursuant to that agreement, the Partnership
paid Ace Parking a management fee of 2,000 per month, an accounting fee equal to 250 per month, plus Excess Profit Fee 
equal to three percent (3 of annual net profits in excess of 150,000. 

On October 31, 2010, Justice Investors and Ace Parking entered
into an amendment of the Parking Agreement to extend the term for a period of sixty two (62) months, commencing on November 1,
2010 and terminating December 31, 2015, subject to either party s right to terminate the agreement without cause on ninety
(90) days written notice. The monthly management fee of 2,000 and the accounting fee of 250 remain the same, but the amendment
modified how the Excess Profit Fee to be paid to Ace would be calculated. The amendment provides that, if net operating income NOI from the garage operations exceeds 1,800,000 but is less than 2,000,000, Ace will be entitled to an Excess
Profit Fee of one percent (1 of the total annual NOI. If the annual NOI is 2,000,000 or higher, Ace will be entitled to an
Excess Profit Fee equal to two percent (2 of the total annual NOI. 

TRU SPA LEASE 

Approximately 5,400 square feet of space on the lobby level
of the Hotel is leased to Tru Spa for the operation of a health and beauty spa. The lease expires in May 2013, with a five year
option to extend the term. The spa lease provides for minimum monthly rent of 14,000. Minimum rental amounts are subject to adjustment
every three years based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. 

CHINESE CULTURE FOUNDATION LEASE 

On March 15, 2005, the Partnership entered into an amended
lease with the Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco (the Foundation for the third floor space of the Hotel
commonly known as the Chinese Cultural Center, which the Foundation had right to occupy pursuant to a 50-year nominal rent lease. 

The amended lease requires the Partnership to pay to the Foundation
a monthly event space fee in the amount of 5,000, adjusted annually based on the local Consumer Price Index. The term of the
amended lease expires on October 17, 2023, with an automatic extension for another 10 year term if the property continues to be
operated as a hotel. This amendment allowed Justice to incorporate the third floor into the renovation of the Hotel resulting
in a new ballroom for the joint use of the Hotel and new offices and a gallery for the Chinese Culture Center.

RENTAL PROPERTIES 

As June 30, 2012, the Company's investment in real estate consisted
of properties located throughout the United States, with a concentration in Texas and Southern California. These properties include
seventeen apartment complexes, two single-family houses as strategic investments and two commercial real estate properties. All
properties are operating properties. In addition to the properties, the Company owns approximately 4.1 acres of unimproved real
estate in Texas and 2 acres of unimproved land in Maui, Hawaii. 

MANAGEMENT OF RENTAL PROPERTIES 

The Company may engage third party management companies as
agents to manage certain of Company s residential rental properties. 

On August 1, 2005, the Company entered into a Management Agreement
with Century West Properties, Inc. Century West to act as an agent of the Company to rent and manage all of the
Company s residential rental properties in the Los Angeles, California area. The Management Agreement with Century West
was for an original term of twelve months ending on July 31, 2006 and continues on a month-to-month basis, until terminated upon
30 days prior written notice. The Management Agreement provides for a monthly fee equal to 4 of the monthly gross receipts from
the properties with resident managers and a fee of 4 1/2 of monthly gross receipts for properties without resident managers.
During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the management fees were 140,000 and 161,000, respectively. 

The Company s five remaining properties located outside
of California are managed directly by the Company 

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICIES 

In addition to its Hotel and real estate operations, the Company
also invests from time to time in income producing instruments, corporate debt and equity securities, publically traded investment
funds, mortgage backed securities, securities issued by REIT s and other companies which invest primarily in real estate. 

The Company s securities investments are made under the
supervision of a Securities Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee currently has three members and is chaired
by the Company s Chairman of the Board and President, John V. Winfield. The Committee has delegated authority to manage
the portfolio to the Company s Chairman and President together with such assistants and management committees he may engage.
The Committee has established investment guidelines for the Company s investments. These guidelines presently include: (i)
corporate equity securities should be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca or the Nasdaq Stock Market
(NASDAQ); (ii) the issuer of the listed securities should be in compliance with the listing standards of the respective National
Securities Exchanges; and (iii) investment in a particular issuer should not exceed 10 of the market value of the total portfolio.
The investment policies do not require the Company to divest itself of investments, which initially meet these guidelines but
subsequently fail to meet one or more of the investment criteria. Non-conforming investments require the approval of the Securities
Investment Committee. The Committee has in the past approved non-conforming investments and may in the future approve non-conforming
investments. The Securities Investment Committee may modify these guidelines from time to time. 

The Company may also invest, with the approval of the Securities
Investment Committee, in unlisted securities, such as convertible notes, through private placements including private equity investment
funds. Those investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost on the Company s balance sheet as part of other
investments and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. As of June 30, 2012, the Company had other investments of 15,661,000. 

As part of its investment strategies, the Company may assume
short positions in marketable securities. Short sales are used by the Company to potentially offset normal market risks undertaken
in the course of its investing activities or to provide additional return opportunities. As of June 30, 2012, the Company had
obligations for securities sold (equities short) of 731,000. 

9 

In addition, the Company may utilize margin
for its marketable securities purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The use of
available leverage is guided by the business judgment of management and is subject to any internal investment guidelines, which
may be imposed by the Securities Investment Committee. The margin used by the Company may fluctuate depending on market conditions.
The use of leverage could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to large fluctuations. As of
June 30, 2012, the Company had a margin balance of 1,729,000 and incurred 587,000 and 547,000 in margin interest expense during
the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

As Chairman of the Securities Investment Committee, the Company s
President and Chief Executive officer, John V. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private
markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of Santa Fe and Portsmouth and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and
various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, his family, Santa Fe and Portsmouth may, at times, invest in the same companies
in which the Company invests. The Company encourages such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive
Officer and his family members, and the resources of Santa Fe and Portsmouth, at risk in connection with investment decisions
made on behalf of the Company. 

Further information with respect to investment
in marketable securities and other investments of the Company is set forth in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations section and Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Seasonality 

The Hotel s operations historically have been seasonal.
Like most hotels in the San Francisco area, the Hotel generally maintains higher occupancy and room rates during the first and
second quarters of its fiscal year (July 1 through December 31) than it does in the third and fourth quarters (January 1 through
June 30). These seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the Hotel. 

Competition - Hotel 

The hotel industry is highly competitive. Competition is based
on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services and guest amenities
or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties
are located. 

The Hotel is located in an area of intense competition from
other hotels in the Financial District and San Francisco in general. The Hotel is somewhat limited by having only 15,000 square
feet of meeting room space. Other hotels, with greater meeting room space, may have a competitive advantage by being able to attract
larger groups and small conventions. Increased competition from new hotels, or hotels that have been recently undergone substantial
renovation, could have an adverse effect on occupancy, average daily rate ADR and room revenue per available room RevPar and put pressure on the Partnership to make additional capital improvements to the Hotel to keep pace with
the competition. 

The Hotel s target market is business travelers, leisure
customers and tourists, and small to medium size groups. Since the Hotel operates in an upper scale segment of the market, we
also face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as limited service hotels, during periods
of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. Like other hotels, we have experienced
some decrease in some higher rated corporate and business travel as many companies have cut their travel and entertainment budgets
in response to economic conditions. As a result, there could be added pressure on all hotels in the San Francisco market to lower
room rates in an effort to maintain occupancy levels during such periods. Although we have seen some signs of recovery in the
San Francisco market during the 2012 fiscal year, like all hotels, we will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global
economic environment. 

10 

In this highly competitive market, we continue with our efforts
to upgrade our guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the Hotel from its competition.
During fiscal 2012, we completed several projects to enhance the guest experience, including our new executive lounge on the 26 th
 floor of the Hotel and the upgrading of the lobby and common areas of the Hotel. We have also made improvements to our restaurant
facilities and food and beverage services and have upgraded internet connectivity throughout the Hotel and are providing more
technological amenities for our guests. We continue to make the Hotel more energy efficient and have enhanced our recycling program
to support the concept of a greener world while reducing our operating costs. The Hotel also became a groundbreaker in implementing
Hilton s Huanying Welcome program which features a tailored experience for Chinese travelers. We have also
taken important steps to further develop our ties to the local Chinese community and the City as part of being a good corporate
citizen and to promote new business. 

Moving forward, we will continue to focus on cultivating more
international business, especially from China, and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business, leisure and group
travel. During the last twelve months, we have seen improvement in business and leisure travel. If that trend in the San Francisco
market and the hotel industry continues, it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability. However, like
all hotels, it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment. 

The Hotel is also subject to certain operating
risks common to all of the hotel industry, which could adversely impact performance. These risks include: 

Competition
 for guests and
 meetings from other
 hotels including
 competition and
 pricing pressure
 from internet wholesalers
 and distributors; 

increases
 in operating costs,
 including wages,
 benefits, insurance,
 property taxes
 and energy, due
 to inflation and
 other factors,
 which may not be
 offset in the future
 by increased room
 rates; 

labor
 strikes, disruptions
 or lock outs; 

dependence
 on demand from
 business and leisure
 travelers, which
 may fluctuate and
 is seasonal; 

increases
 in energy costs,
 cost of fuel, airline
 fares and other
 expenses related
 to travel, which
 may negatively
 affect traveling; 

terrorism,
 terrorism alerts
 and warnings, wars
 and other military
 actions, pandemics
 or other medical
 events or warnings
 which may result
 in decreases in
 business and leisure
 travel; and 

adverse
 effects of downturns
 and recessionary
 conditions in international,
 national and/or
 local economies
 and market conditions. 

Competition Rental Properties 

The ownership, operation and leasing of multifamily rental
properties are highly competitive. The Company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance
companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors. In addition, The Company competes for tenants in
markets primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements.
The Company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies. The number of competitive multifamily
properties in a particular market could adversely affect the Company s ability to lease its multifamily properties, as well
as the rents it is able to charge. In addition, other forms of residential properties, including single family housing and town
homes, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for-sale
condominium units. The Company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings
and the desirability of the Company s locations. Resident leases at the Company s apartment communities are priced
competitively based on market conditions, supply and demand characteristics, and the quality and resident service offerings of
its communities. 

11 

Environmental Matters 

In connection with the ownership of the Hotel, the Company
is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these
laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner
or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. 

Environmental consultants retained by the Partnership or its
lenders conducted updated Phase I environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 on the Hotel property. These
Phase I assessments relied, in part, on Phase I environmental assessments prepared in connection with the Partnership s
first mortgage loan obtained in July 2005. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination
on properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly-available
databases; however, Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities
or compliance concerns at the properties. 

Although the Phase I assessments and other environmental reports
we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance
activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability, we are not aware of any environmental liability
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The Company believes that the Hotel and its rental properties
are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding
hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on
the Company. The Company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability
or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of June 30, 2012, the Company had a total of 8 full-time
employees in its corporate office. Effective July 2002, the Company entered into a client service agreement with Insperity, a
professional employer organization serving as an off-site, full service human resource department for its corporate office. Insperity
personnel management services are delivered by entering into a co-employment relationship with the Company s employees.
There are also approximately 32 employees at the Company s properties outside of the State of California that are subject
to similar co-employment relationships with Insperity. The employees and the Company are not party to any collective bargaining
agreement, and the Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory. 

Employees of Justice and management of the Hotel are not unionized
and the Company believes that their relationships with the Hotel are satisfactory and consistent with the market in San Francisco.
Most of the non-management employees of the Hotel are part of three different unions: (1) Local 2 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union UNITE HERE ); (2) Stationary Engineers, Local 39; and (3) the Teamsters Local 856. The Hotel s
contract with Local 2 expired on August 14, 2009. The Parties met on February 28, 2012 and negotiated the terms of a successor
collective bargaining agreement. The parties reached a tentative agreement on that date and are awaiting receipt of the final,
ratified agreement from Local 2. The new agreement is scheduled to expire on August 14, 2013. 

The Hotel has two other labor agreements. An extension agreement
with the Stationary Engineers, Local 39 was agreed to in May 2011 with an expiration date of July 31, 2013. A new contract with
Teamsters Local 856 was reached on March 10, 2011 with an expiration date of December 31, 2012. Local 856 is required to send
notice of intent to negotiate an agreement 60 days before its expiration.

from the bank which converted its revolving line of credit facility to a term loan. The Partnership also obtained a waiver of

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

As of June 30, 2012, the Company owned approximately 79.9 
of the common shares of its subsidiary, Santa Fe and Santa Fe 68.8 owned approximately 68.8 of the common shares of Portsmouth
Square, Inc. InterGroup also directly owns approximately 12.5 of the common shares of Portsmouth. The Company's principal sources
of revenue continue to be derived from the general and limited partnership interests of its subsidiary, Portsmouth, in the Justice
Investors limited partnership Justice or the Partnership ), rental income from its investments in
multi-family real estate properties and income received from investment of its cash and securities assets. 

Portsmouth has a 50.0 limited partnership interest in Justice
and serves as the Managing General partner of Justice. Evon Corporation Evon serves as the other general partner.
Justice owns a 543 room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California 94108, known as the Hilton
San Francisco Financial District (the Hotel and related facilities, including a five-level underground parking
garage. The financial statements of Justice have been consolidated with those of the Company. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

The Hotel is operated by the Partnership as a full service
Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with Hilton Hotels Corporation. The term of the Agreement is for
a period of 15 years commencing on January 12, 2006, with an option to extend the license term for another five years, subject
to certain conditions. Justice also has a Management Agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. Prism to perform the
day-to-day management functions of the Hotel. 

The parking garage that is part of the Hotel property is managed
by Ace Parking pursuant to a contract with the Partnership. Justice also leases a portion of the lobby level of the Hotel to a
day spa operator. Portsmouth also receives management fees as a general partner of Justice for its services in overseeing and
managing the Partnership s assets. Those fees are eliminated in consolidation. 

In addition to the operations of the Hotel,
the Company also generates income from the ownership and management of real estate. Properties include seventeen apartment complexes,
two commercial real estate properties, and two single-family houses as strategic investments. The properties are located throughout
the United States, but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has investments in unimproved real
property. All of the Company s residential rental properties in California are managed by professional third party property
management companies and the rental properties outside of California are managed by the Company. The commercial real estate in
California is also managed by the Company. 

The Company acquires its investments in
real estate and other investments utilizing cash, securities or debt, subject to approval or guidelines of the Board of Directors.
The Company also invests in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and will consider other investments if such
investments offer growth or profit potential. 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2012 Compared
to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 

The Company had net loss of 671,000 for the year ended June
30, 2012 compared to net income of 10,443,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011. The significant change is primarily attributable
to the recording of an unrealized gain of 11,422,000 in fiscal 2011 related to the preferred stock of Comstock received by the
Company in exchange for debt as part of the debt restructuring, losses from investing activities in the current year, partially
offset by a significant improvement in hotel operations and an improvement in real estate operations. 

19 

The Company had net income from hotel operations of 3,913,000
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, compared to net income of 512,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The significant
increase in net income from hotel operations is primarily attributable to a 5,054,000 increase in room revenues and a 1,305,000
decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as many of the furniture and fixture improvements from the renovation of the
Hotel reached full deprecation during fiscal 2011. 

The following table sets forth a more detailed presentation
of Hotel operations for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Hotel generated
operating income of 8,997,000 before interest, depreciation and amortization, on total operating revenues of 42,462,000 compared
to operating income of 6,983,000 before interest, depreciation and amortization, on operating revenues of 36,282,000 for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The increase in income from Hotel operations is primarily attributable to increases in room,
food and beverage, and other revenues in the current year, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses due to higher
labor costs and increased staffing to improve guest satisfaction as well as greater franchise and management fees which are based
on a percentage of revenues. 

Room revenues increased by 5,054,000 for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and food and beverage revenues increased by 751,000 for the same
period. The increase in room revenues was primarily attributable to a significant increase in average daily room rates during
fiscal 2012 as the Hotel continued to see an increase in higher rated leisure, corporate and group business travel, which also
resulted in higher in food and beverage revenues. 

The following table sets forth the average
daily room rate, average occupancy percentage and room revenue per available room RevPar of the Hotel for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.

The operations of the Hotel experienced an increase in the
higher rated business, leisure and group travel segments in the fiscal 2012 as the hospitality industry in the San Francisco market
continued to show signs of recovery. As a result, the Hotel s average daily rate increased significantly by 28 for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The increase in occupancy of 1 was due to continued
increased demand for hotel rooms in San Francisco and the Hotel s ability to capture a greater share of those rooms within
its market set. Due to that increased demand, the Hotel was able to reduce the amount of discounted Internet business that it
was forced to take in prior years to maintain occupancy in a very competitive market and recessionary economic conditions. As
a result, the Hotel was able to achieve a RevPar number that was 26 higher than fiscal 2011. 

20 

During the past couple of years, we have seen our management
team guide our Hotel through a difficult economic period by taking bold steps to reduce expenses and implement innovative strategies
in order to improve operations and enhance our competitiveness in the market. As a result, we were well positioned to take advantage
of the gradual recovery that took place in the San Francisco market. We saw a significant improvement in room rates as the Hotel
was able to expand its share of the higher rated business and leisure travel which increased our operating revenues and profitability.
Those results made it possible for Justice Investors to declare its first limited partnership distribution since September 2008
as the Partnership made a total distribution in the amount of 1,000,000 in December 2011, of which Portsmouth received 500,000.
The general partners of Justice will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the Hotel and to set
the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results, cash flows and other factors, including
establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies. 

We will continue in our efforts to upgrade our guest rooms
and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the Hotel from its competition. During fiscal 2012, we completed
several projects to enhance the guest experience, including our new executive lounge on the 26 th floor of the Hotel
and the upgrading of the lobby and common areas of the Hotel. We have also made improvements to our restaurant facilities and
food and beverage services and have upgraded internet connectivity throughout the Hotel and are providing more technological amenities
for our guests. We continue to make the Hotel more energy efficient and have enhanced our recycling program to support the concept
of a greener world while reducing our operating costs. The Hotel also became a groundbreaker in implementing Hilton s Huanying Welcome program which features a tailored experience for Chinese travelers. We have also taken important steps
to further develop our ties to the local Chinese community and the City as part of being a good corporate citizen and to promote
new business. 

Moving forward, we will continue to focus on cultivating more
international business, especially from China, and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business, leisure and group
travel. During the last twelve months, we have seen improvement in business and leisure travel. If that trend in the San Francisco
market and the hotel industry continues, it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability. However, like
all hotels, it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment. 

While operating in a competitive rental market, real estate
operations improved modestly. The Company had real estate revenues of 14,537,000 for the year ended June 30, 2012 compared with
revenues of 13,571,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011. The increase in rental revenues occurred primarily in the properties
located outside of California, particularly in Texas, while the California properties remained relatively consistent with the
exception of the new California property purchased in April 2011, where the Company had rental revenues for full year during fiscal
2012 versus only two months in fiscal 2011. Real estate operating expenses increased to 7,885,000 from 7,349,000 as the result
of the increase in occupancy and rental revenue and partially as result of having a full year of expenses related to the new property
purchased in April 2011. Depreciation expense related to the Company s real estate operations decreased by approximately
 552,000 from the prior comparable year primarily as the result of a one-time depreciation expense catch-up adjustment of 737,000
recorded in fiscal 2011 due to the reclass of the Company s held for sale property from discontinued operations to continuing
operations. Management continues to review and analyze the Company s real estate operations to improve occupancy and rental
rates and to reduce expenses and improve efficiencies. 

In January 2012, the Company sold its 24-unit apartment complex
located in Los Angeles, California for 4,370,000. The Company realized a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately 1,710,000
and received net proceeds of 4,111,000 from the sale after selling costs. The Company paid off the related mortgage note payable
balance of 1,504,000. In the prior comparable year, the Company sold its 132-unit apartment complex located in San Antonio, Texas
for 5,500,000 and recognized a gain on the sale of real estate of 3,290,000 and received net proceeds of 5,291,000 from the
sale after selling costs. The Company paid off of the related outstanding mortgage note payable of 3,215,000. The net proceeds
were placed with a third party accommodator for the purpose of executing a Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange for another property.
In April 2011, the Company purchased a 9-unit beachside apartment complex located in Marina Del Rey, California for 4,000,000
to effectuate that exchange. The operations of these properties and the gains on the sales of real estate are included under Discontinued
Operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

21 

The Company had a net loss on marketable securities of 4,444,000
for the year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to a net gain on marketable securities of 2,675,000 for the year ended June 30,
2011. For the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company had a net realized loss of 2,628,000 and a net unrealized loss of 1,816,000.
For the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company had a net realized gain of 47,000 and a net unrealized gain of 2,628,000. Gains
and losses on marketable securities and other investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and
could have a significant impact on the Company s net income. However, the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities
and other investments for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have
no analytical value. For a more detailed description of the composition of the Company s marketable securities please see
the Marketable Securities section below. 

During the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company had an unrealized
loss of 436,000 related to other investments compared to an unrealized gain of 11,565,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011.
The significant difference is due to an unrealized gain of 11,422,000 related to the Company s Comstock investment in the
prior comparable year. Comstock had undergone a restructuring which resulted in the unrealized gain for the Company. 

During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company
performed an impairment analysis of its other investments and determined that one of its investments had other than temporary
impairment and recorded impairment losses of 917,000 and 976,000, for each respective period. 

Dividend and interest income decreased to 1,251,000 for the
year ended June 30, 2012 from 1,540,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011 primarily as the result of the decreased investment
in income yielding instruments. 

The Company and its subsidiaries, Portsmouth and Santa Fe,
compute and file income tax returns and prepare discrete income tax provisions for financial reporting. Since Portsmouth consolidates
Justice (Hotel) for financial reporting purposes and is not taxed on its 50 non-controlling interest in the Hotel, variability
in the tax provision results from the relative significance of the non-controlling interest and the magnitude of the pretax income
or loss at the Company and its two principal subsidiaries. The income tax benefit (expense) during the year ended June 30, 2012
and 2011 represents income tax benefit (expense) of Intergroup and its subsidiary, Portsmouth.

The Company s investment portfolio is diversified with
40 different equity positions. The Company holds one equity security that comprises more than 10 of the equity value of the
portfolio. The security represents 52.4 of the portfolio and consists of the common stock of Comstock Mining, Inc. Comstock 
- NYSE MKT: LODE) which is included in the basic materials industry group. The amount of the Company s investment in any
particular issuer may increase or decrease, and additions or deletions to its securities portfolio may occur, at any time. While
it is the internal policy of the Company to limit its initial investment in any single equity to less than 10 of its total portfolio
value, that investment could eventually exceed 10 as a result of equity appreciation or reduction of other positions. A significant
percentage of the portfolio consists of common stock in Comstock that was obtained through dividend payments by Comstock on its
7.5 Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock. Marketable securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently
traded price of each security at the balance sheet date.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

The Company s cash flows are primarily generated from
its Hotel operations, and general partner management fees and limited partnership distributions from Justice Investors, its real
estate operations and from the investment of its cash in marketable securities and other investments. 

Following the temporary suspension of operations in May 2005
for major renovations, the Hotel started, and continues, to generate positive cash flows from its operations. As a result, Justice
was able to pay some limited partnership distributions in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. However, due to the significant downturn
in the San Francisco hotel market beginning in September 2008 and the continued weakness in domestic and international economies,
no Partnership distributions were paid in fiscal 2011 and 2010. During such periods, the Company had to depend more on the revenues
generated from the investment of its cash and marketable securities and from its general partner management fees. Since we have
seen significant improvement in the operations of the Hotel, and the San Francisco market in general, Justice was in a position
to pay a limited partnership distribution in December 2011 in an aggregate amount of 1,000,000, of which Portsmouth received
 500,000. The general partners of Justice will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the Hotel
and to set the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results, cash flows and other factors,
including establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies. 

The new Justice Compensation Agreement that became effective
on December 1, 2008, when Portsmouth assumed the role of managing general partner of Justice, has provided additional cash flows
to the Company. Under the new Compensation Agreement, Portsmouth is now entitled to 80 of the minimum base fee to be paid to
the general partners of 285,000, while under the prior agreement Portsmouth was entitled to receive only 20 of the minimum base
fee. As a result of increases in Hotel gross revenues in fiscal 2012, total general partner fees paid to Portsmouth for the year
ended June 30, 2012 increased to 366,000, compared to 323,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011. 

To meet its substantial financial commitments for the renovation
and transition of the Hotel to a Hilton, Justice had to rely on borrowings to meet its obligations. On July 27, 2005, Justice
entered into a first mortgage loan with The Prudential Insurance Company of America in a principal amount of 30,000,000 (the
 Prudential Loan ). The term of the Prudential Loan is for 120 months at a fixed interest rate of 5.22 per annum.
The Prudential Loan calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately 165,000, calculated
on a 30-year amortization schedule. The Loan is collateralized by a first deed of trust on the Partnership s Hotel property,
including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents. The Prudential
Loan is without recourse to the limited and general partners of Justice. The principal balance of the Prudential Loan was 26,599,000
as of June 30, 2012. 

On March 27, 2007, Justice entered into a second mortgage loan
with Prudential (the Second Prudential Loan in a principal amount of 19,000,000. The term of the Second Prudential
Loan is for 100 months and matures on August 5, 2015, the same date as the first Prudential Loan. The Second Prudential Loan is
at a fixed interest rate of 6.42 per annum and calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of 119,000,
calculated on a 30-year amortization schedule. The Second Prudential Loan is collateralized by a second deed of trust on the Partnership s
Hotel property, including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and
rents. The Second Prudential Loan is also without recourse to the limited and general partners of Justice. The principal balance
of the Second Prudential Loan was 17,722,000 as of June 30, 2012. 

Effective April 29, 2010, the Partnership obtained a modification
of its 2,500,000 unsecured revolving line of credit facility with East West Bank that was to mature on April 30, 2010, and converted
that line of credit facility to an unsecured term loan. The modification provides that Justice will pay the 2,500,000 balance
on its line of credit facility over a period of four years, to mature on April 30, 2014. This term loan calls for monthly principal
and interest payments of 41,000, calculated on a nine-year amortization schedule, with interest only from May 1, 2010 to August
31, 2010. Pursuant to the modification, the annual floating interest rate was reduced by 0.5 to the Wall Street Journal Prime
Rate plus 2.5 (with a minimum floor rate of 5.0 per annum). The modification provides for new financial covenants that include
specific financial ratios and a return to minimum profitability after June 30, 2011. Management believes that the Partnership
has the ability to meet the specific covenants and the Partnership was in compliance with the covenants as of June 30, 2012. As
of June 30, 2012, the interest rate was 5.75 and the outstanding balance was 1,702,000. 

24 

Despite an uncertain economy, the Hotel has continued to generate
positive cash flows. While the debt service requirements related to the two Prudential loans, as well as the term loan to pay
off the line of credit, may create some additional risk for the Company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future,
management believes that cash flows from the operations of the Hotel and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all
of the Partnership s current and future obligations and financial requirements. Management also believes that there is sufficient
equity in the Hotel assets to support future borrowings, if necessary, to fund any new capital improvements and other requirements. 

In January 2012, the Company sold its 24-unit apartment complex
located in Los Angeles, California for 4,370,000. The Company realized a gain on the sale of real estate of 1,710,000 and received
net proceeds of 4,111,000 from the sale after selling costs. The Company paid off the related mortgage note payable balance of
 1,504,000. 

In December 2011, the Company refinanced its 926,000 mortgage
note payable on its 12-unit apartment building located in Los Angeles, California for a new 10-year mortgage in the amount of
 2,095,000. The interest rate on the new loan is fixed at 4.25 per annum for the first 5 years and variable for the remaining
5 years, with monthly principal and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule. The note matures in January 2022.
The Company received net proceeds of approximately 1,122,000 from the refinancing. 

In January 2011, the Company sold its 132-unit apartment complex
located in San Antonio, Texas for 5,500,000 and recognized a gain on the sale of real estate of 3,290,000. The Company received
net proceeds of 2,030,000 after selling costs and the pay-off of the related outstanding mortgage note payable of 3,215,000.
The proceeds were placed with a third party accommodator for the purpose of executing a Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange for
another property. In April 2011, the Company purchased a 9-unit beachside apartment complex located in Marina Del Rey, California
for 4,000,000. As part of the purchase, the Company obtained a 10-year mortgage note payable in the amount of 1,487,000. The
interest rate on the loan is fixed at 5.60 per annum, with monthly principal and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization
schedule. The note matures in May 2021. 

In February 2011, the Company refinanced its 715,000 adjustable
rate mortgage note payable on its 9-unit apartment building located in Los Angeles, California for a new 10-year fixed rate mortgage
in the amount of 1,265,000. The interest rate on the new loan is fixed at 5.89 per annum, with monthly principal and interest
payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule. The note matures in March 2021. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
 367,000 from the refinancing. 

In February 2011, the Company refinanced its 958,000 adjustable
rate mortgage note payable on its 14-unit apartment building located in Los Angeles, California for a new 10-year fixed rate mortgage
in the amount of 1,855,000. The interest rate on the new loan is fixed at 5.89 per annum, with monthly principal and interest
payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule. The note matures in March 2021. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
 687,000 from the refinancing. 

In December 2010, the Company modified its 5,932,000 mortgage
note payable on the property located in St. Louis, Missouri. Prior to the modification of the mortgage note, the Company paid
a fixed rate of 6.16 . Upon modification, the interest rate was based upon LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.5 . Concurrent
to the modification of the note, the Company entered into a rate swap agreement in order to settle the variable rate (i.e., LIBOR)
into a fixed rate of 1.35 , thereby allowing the Company to pay a total fixed interest rate of 4.85 . The swap agreement matures
in May 2013. A swap is a contractual agreement to exchange interest rate payments. Under the swap agreement, the Company agrees
to pay the bank (counterparty) a fixed rate and the bank agrees to pay the Company a floating rate. The interest rate swap agreement
is being measured at fair value, but was not designated by the Company as a cash flow hedge. Should the Company terminate the
swap contract prematurely, it would be required to pay the fair value of the swap valued at 60,000 as of June 30, 2012, which
is recorded as a liability by the Company under accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet. The change in the fair value of the instrument is recognized and recorded in the net unrealized gain (loss) on other
investments and derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations. 

25 

In November 2010, the Company refinanced its 1,641,000 adjustable
rate mortgage note payable on its 27-unit apartment building located in Los Angeles, California for a new 10-year fixed rate mortgage
in the amount of 3,260,000. The interest rate on the new loan is fixed at 4.85 per annum, with monthly principal and interest
payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule. The note matures in December 2020. The Company received net proceeds of approximately
 1,507,000 from the refinancing. 

In November 2010, the Company also refinanced its 3,569,000
adjustable rate mortgage note payable on its 31-unit apartment building located in Los Angeles, California for a new 10-year fixed
rate mortgage in the amount of 5,787,000. The interest rate on the new loan is fixed at 4.85 per annum, with monthly principal
and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule. The note matures in December 2020. The Company received net proceeds
of approximately 2,078,000 from the refinancing. 

The Company has invested in short-term, income-producing instruments
and in equity and debt securities when deemed appropriate. The Company's marketable securities are classified as trading with
unrealized gains and losses recorded through the statement of operations. 

Management believes that its cash, securities
assets, and the cash flows generated from those assets and from partnership distributions and management fees, will be adequate
to meet the Company s current and future obligations.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements. 

IMPACT OF INFLATION 

Hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand
factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually
are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Prism has the power and ability under the terms of its management
agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation.
Partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks, which may be influenced by inflation. For the two most recent fiscal
years, the impact of inflation on the Company's income is not viewed by management as material. 

The Company's residential rental properties provide income
from short-term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year. Rental increases are expected to offset anticipated increased
property operating expenses.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Critical accounting policies are those that are most significant
to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require judgments by management in order to make estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going
basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances for bad debts, accruals,
asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates or
our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board
of Directors and Shareholders of 
The Intergroup Corporation: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The InterGroup Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended June 30, 2012. The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The InterGroup Corporation
and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

THE INTERGROUP CORPORATION 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
PRACTICES: 

Description of the Business 

The InterGroup Corporation, a Delaware corporation, InterGroup 
or the Company was formed to buy, develop, operate and dispose of real property and to engage in various investment
activities to benefit the Company and its shareholders. 

As of June 30, 2012, the Company had the power to vote 83.9 
of the voting shares of Santa Fe Financial Corporation Santa Fe ), a public company (OTCBB: SFEF). This percentage
includes the power to vote an approximately 4 interest in the common stock in Santa Fe owned by the Company s Chairman and
President pursuant to a voting trust agreement entered into on June 30, 1998. 

Santa Fe s revenue is primarily generated through the
management of its 68.8 owned subsidiary, Portsmouth Square, Inc. Portsmouth ), a public company (OTCBB: PRSI). InterGroup
also directly owns approximately 12.5 of the common stock of Portsmouth. Portsmouth has a 50.0 limited partnership interest in
Justice Investors Justice , the Partnership or the Hotel and serves as one of the two
general partners. The other general partner, Evon Corporation Evon ), served as the managing general partner until
December 1, 2008 at which time Portsmouth assumed the role of managing general partner. As discussed in Note 2, the financial statements
of Justice are consolidated with those of the Company. 

Justice owns a 543-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny
Street, San Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the Hotel) and related facilities
including a five level underground parking garage. The Hotel is operated by the partnership as a full service Hilton brand hotel
pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with Hilton Hotels Corporation. Justice also has a Management Agreement with Prism Hospitality
L.P. (Prism) to perform the day-to-day management functions of the Hotel. 

Justice leased the parking garage to Evon through September
30, 2008. Effective October 1, 2008, Justice and Evon entered into an Installment Sale Agreement whereby Justice purchased all
of Evon s right, title, and interest in the remaining term of its lease of the parking garage, which was to expire on November
30, 2010, and other related assets. Justice also agreed to assume Evon s contract with Ace Parking Management, Inc. Ace
Parking for the management of the garage and any other liabilities related to the operation of the garage commencing October
1, 2008. The management agreement with Ace Parking was extended for another 62 months, effective November 1, 2010. The Partnership
also leases a day spa on the lobby level to Tru Spa. Portsmouth also receives management fees as a general partner of Justice for
its services in overseeing and managing the Partnership s assets. Those fees are eliminated in consolidation. 

Due to the temporary closing of the Hotel to undergo major renovations
from May 2005 until January 2006 to transition and reposition the Hotel from a Holiday Inn to a Hilton, and the substantial depreciation
and amortization expenses resulting from the renovations and operating losses incurred as the Hotel ramped up operations after
reopening, Justice has recorded net losses. These losses were anticipated and planned for as part of the Partnership s renovation
and repositioning plan for Hotel and management considers those net losses to be temporary. The Hotel has been generating positive
cash flows from operations since June 2006. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Partnership reversed that trend
as net income was 3,913,000 and 512,000, respectively. Hotel operations improved significantly during the last two fiscal years
and depreciation and amortization expenses decreased as many of the furniture and fixture improvements from the renovation of the
Hotel reached full deprecation during the fiscal 2011. Management believes that the revenues expected to be generated from the
Hotel, garage and the Partnership s leases will be sufficient to meet all of the Partnership s current and future obligations
and financial requirements. Management also believes that there is significant equity in the Hotel to support additional borrowings,
if necessary. 

33 

In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also
generates income from the ownership of real estate. Properties include apartment complexes, commercial real estate, and two single-family
houses as strategic investments. The properties are located throughout the United States, but are concentrated in Texas and Southern
California. The Company also has investments in unimproved real property. The Company s residential rental properties located
in California are managed by a professional third party property management company. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all controlled subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Investment in Hotel, Net 

The Hotel property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Building improvements are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives ranging from 3 to 39
years. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives ranging from 3
to 7 years. 

Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Costs of significant renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of its remaining estimated useful
life or life of the asset. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts;
any resulting gain or loss is included in other income (expenses). 

The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount
of the asset, including any intangible assets associated with that asset, exceeds its estimated undiscounted net cash flow, before
interest, the Partnership will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount and its estimated
fair value. If impairment is recognized, the reduced carrying amount of the asset will be accounted for as its new cost. For a
depreciable asset, the new cost will be depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life. Generally, fair values are estimated
using discounted cash flow, replacement cost or market comparison analyses. The process of evaluating for impairment requires estimates
as to future events and conditions, which are subject to varying market and economic factors. Therefore, it is reasonably possible
that a change in estimate resulting from judgments as to future events could occur which would affect the recorded amounts of the
property. No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. 

Investment in Real Estate, Net 

Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of rental property is provided on the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives of 5 to 40 years for
buildings and improvements and 5 to 10 years for equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as
incurred and major improvements are capitalized. 

The Company also reviews its rental property assets for impairment.
No impairment losses on the investment in real estate have been recorded for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. 

The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property,
which includes land, building and improvements, is determined by valuing the property as if they were vacant, and incorporates
costs during the lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases such lost rental revenue
and tenant improvements. The value of tangible assets are depreciated using straight-line method based upon the assets estimated
useful lives. 

The value of above or below market lease is based on the present
value, using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired, of the difference between (i) the contractual
amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding
in-place lease, measured over a period that the leases are expected to remain in effect. In connection with the Company s
acquisition of a real property during the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company recorded below-market lease liability of approximately
 427,000 and amortizes such amount as an increase to rental income over period that the leases are expected to remain in effect,
which range from 1 year to 15 years. 

34 

Investment in Marketable Securities 

Marketable securities are stated at fair value as determined
by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. Marketable securities are classified as trading securities
with all unrealized gains and losses on the Company's investment portfolio recorded through the consolidated statements of operations. 

Other Investments, Net 

Other investments include non-marketable securities (carried
at cost, net of any impairments loss), non marketable warrants (carried at fair value) and certain preferred securities,
received in exchange for debt instruments, carried at a book basis, initially determined using the estimated fair value on the
exchange date. The Company has no significant influence or control over the entities that issue these investments. These investments
are reviewed on a periodic basis for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company reviews several factors
to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) the length of time an investment
is in an unrealized loss position, (ii) the extent to which fair value is less than cost, (iii) the financial condition and near
term prospects of the issuer and (iv) our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in fair value. For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded impairment losses related to other
investments of 917,000 and 976,000, respectively. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company has investments in stock
warrants and has entered into an interest rate swap, both of which are considered derivative instruments. 

Derivative financial instruments consist of financial instruments
or other contracts that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying (e.g. interest rate, security price or other variable),
require no initial net investment and permit net settlement. Derivative financial instruments may be free-standing or embedded
in other financial instruments. Further, derivative financial instruments are initially, and subsequently, measured at fair value
on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 

For the investment in stock warrants, the Company used the Black-Scholes
option valuation model to estimate the fair value these instruments which requires management to make significant assumptions including
trading volatility, estimated terms, and risk free rates. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the
development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with
related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based models are highly volatile and sensitive to
changes in the trading market price of the underlying common stock, which has a high-historical volatility. Since derivative financial
instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values, the Company s consolidated statement of operations will
reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes. 

The Company measures the interest rate swap agreement at fair
value at the end of each reporting period. The Company opted not designate the interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge;
hence, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is reported as unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated
statement of operations. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less when purchased and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 

35 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash is comprised of amounts held by lenders for
payment of real estate taxes, insurance, replacement reserves for the operating properties and tenant security deposits that are
invested in certificates of deposit. 

Other Assets, Net 

Other assets include accounts receivable, prepaid insurance,
loan fees, franchise fees, license fees, inventory and other miscellaneous assets. Loan fees are stated at cost and amortized over
the term of the loan using the effective interest method. Franchise fees are stated at cost and amortized over the life of the
agreement (15 years). License fees are stated at cost and amortized over 10 years. 

Accounts receivable from the Hotel and rental property customers
are carried at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts that is based on management s assessment of the collectability
of accounts receivable. The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers but mitigates the associated credit risk by performing
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. 

Due to Securities Broker 

The Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities
purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. Various securities brokers have advanced
funds to the Company for the purchase of marketable securities under standard margin agreements. These advanced funds are recorded
as a liability. 

Obligation for Securities Sold 

Obligation for securities sold represents the fair market value
of shares sold with the promise to deliver that security at some future date and the fair market value of shares underlying the
written call options with the obligation to deliver that security when and if the option is exercised. The obligation may be satisfied
with current holdings of the same security or by subsequent purchases of that security. Unrealized gains and losses from changes
in the obligation are included in the statement of operations. 

Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities 

Accounts payable and other liabilities include trade payables,
advance deposits and other liabilities. 

Treasury Stock 

The Company records the acquisition of treasury stock under
the cost method. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards for fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy for
inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by
requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable
inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three
levels based on the observability of inputs as follows: 

36 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation
methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation
methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the
assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level 3 inputs to the valuation
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. 

Revenue Recognition 

Room revenue is recognized on the date upon which a guest occupies
a room and/or utilizes the Hotel s services. Food and beverage revenues are recognized upon delivery. Garage revenue is recognized
when a guest uses the garage space. 

Rental revenue is recognized on the straight-line method of
accounting whereby contractual rent payment increases are recognized evenly over the lease term, regardless of when the rent payments
are received by Justice. The leases contain provisions for base rent plus a percentage of the lessees revenues, which are
recognized when earned. 

Revenue recognition from apartment rentals commences when an
apartment unit is placed in service and occupied by a rent-paying tenant. Apartment units are leased on a short-term basis, with
no lease extending beyond one year. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were 445,000 and 337,000 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are calculated under the liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities at the current enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component
of income tax expense. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged
or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets
where realization is not likely. 

Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions
taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions are judged to not meet the more-likely-than-not 
threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. 

Environmental Remediation Costs 

Liabilities for environmental remediation costs are recorded
and charged to expense when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries
of such costs are recognized when received. As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, there were no liabilities for environmental remediation. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share 

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted
income (loss) per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share except that the weighted-average number of common
shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common
shares had been issued. The Company's only potentially dilutive common shares are stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs).
As of June 30, 2012, the Company had 47,255 stock options and RSUs that were considered potentially dilutive common shares. As of June 30,
2011, the Company had 95,646 stock options and RSUs that were considered potentially dilutive common shares. The basic and diluted
earnings per share were the same for the year ended June 30, 2012 because of the Company s net loss from continuing operations. 

37 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events
as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform
with the current year presentation. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04 (ASU 2011-04), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs International Financial Reporting Standard . 
ASU 2011-04 attempts to improve the comparability of fair value measurements disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Amendments in ASU 2011-04 clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement and

Other investments in non-marketable securities are carried
at cost net of any impairment loss. The Company has no significant influence or control over the entities that issue these investments.
These investments are reviewed on a periodic basis for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company reviews several factors to
determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) the length of time an investment
is in an unrealized loss position, (ii) the extent to which fair value is less than cost, (iii) the financial condition and near
term prospects of the issuer and (iv) our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in fair value.

NOTE 10 OTHER NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT 

The Partnership had a 2,500,000 unsecured revolving line of
credit facility with a bank that was to mature on April 30, 2010. Effective April 29, 2010, the Partnership obtained
a modification from the bank which converted its revolving line of credit facility to a term loan. The Partnership also obtained
a waiver of any prior noncompliance with financial covenants. 

The modification provides that Justice will pay the 2,500,000
balance on its line of credit facility over a period of four years, to mature on April 30, 2014. This term loan calls for
monthly principal and interest payments, calculated on a six-year amortization schedule, with interest only from May 1, 2010 to
August 31, 2010. Pursuant to the modification, the annual floating interest rate was reduced by 0.5 to the WSJ Prime Rate
plus 2.5 (with a minimum floor rate of 5.0 per annum). The modification provides for new financial covenants that include specific
financial ratios and a return to minimum profitability after June 30, 2011. Management believes that the partnership has the

NOTE 16 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS 

The Company follows the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
123 (Revised), Share-Based Payments SFAS No. 123R ), which was primarily codified into ASC Topic 718 Compensation
 Stock Compensation , which addresses accounting for equity-based compensation arrangements, including employee stock
options and restricted stock units. 

The Company currently has three equity compensation plans,
each of which has been approved by the Company s stockholders. The InterGroup Corporation 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Plan
(the 2008 RSU Plan ), the InterGroup Corporation 2007 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the 2007
Stock Plan and the Intergroup 2010 Omnibus Employee Incentive Plan are described below. Any outstanding options issued
under the Key Employee Plan or the Non-Employee Director Plan remain effective in accordance with their terms. 

Intergroup Corporation 2010 Omnibus Employee Incentive Plan 

On February 24, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved
The Intergroup Corporation 2010 Omnibus Employee Incentive Plan (the 2010 Incentive Plan ), which was formally adopted
by the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders. The Company believes that such awards better align the
interests of its employees with those of its shareholders. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to
the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest based on 5 years of continuous
service. Certain option and share awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined in the 2010
Incentive Plan. The 2010 Incentive plan authorizes a total of up to 200,000 shares of common stock to be issued as equity compensation
to officers and employees of the Company in an amount and in a manner to be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance
with the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan. The 2010 Incentive Plan authorizes the awards of several types of equity compensation
including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock based compensation. The 2010 Incentive Plan
will expire on February 23, 2020, if not terminated sooner by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee.
Any awards issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan will expire under the terms of the grant agreement. 

51 

On March 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee authorized the
grant of 100,000 stock options to the Company s Chairman, President and Chief Executive, John V. Winfield to purchase up
to 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Plan. The exercise price of the options is
 10.30, which is 100 of the fair market value of the Company s Common Stock as determined by reference to the closing price
of the Company s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 16, 2010, the date of grant. The options
expire ten years from the date of grant, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan. The
options shall be subject to both time and performance based vesting requirements, each of which must be satisfied before options
are fully vested and eligible to be exercised. Pursuant to the time vesting requirements, the options vest over a period of five
years, with 20,000 options vesting upon each one year anniversary of the date of grant. Pursuant to the performance vesting requirements,
the options vest in increments of 20,000 shares upon each increase of 2.00 or more in the market price of the Company s
common stock above the exercise price 10.30) of the options. To satisfy this requirement, the common stock must trade at that
increased level for a period of at least ten trading days during any one quarter. As of June 30, 2012, all the performance vesting
requirements have been met. 

In February 2012, the Compensation Committee awarded 90,000
stock options to the Company s Chairmen, President and Chief Executive, John V. Winfield to purchase up to 90,000 shares
of common stock. The exercise price of the options is 19.77 which is the fair value of the Company s Common Stock as reported
on NASDAQ on February 28, 2012. The options expire ten years from the date of grant. The options are subject to both time and performance
based vesting requirements, each of which must be satisfied before the options are fully vested and eligible to be exercised. Pursuant
to the time vesting requirements, the options vest over a period of five years, with 18,000 options vesting upon each one year
anniversary of the date of grant. Pursuant to the performance vesting requirements, the options vest in increments of 18,000 shares
upon each increase of 2.00 or more in the market price of the Company s common stock above the exercise price 19.77) of
the options. To satisfy this requirement, the common stock must trade at that increased level for a period of at least ten trading
days during any one quarter. 

In July 2011, an officer of the Company was awarded 5,000 stock
options with an exercise price of 24.92, with 1,000 options vesting each year for the next five years and expiring ten years from
the date of grant. 

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Because Black-Scholes
option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based
on historical volatility of the Company s stock, and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise
and employee termination within the valuation model; The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option
valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding; The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

The fair value of options granted during the year ended June
30, 2012 are measured by applying the Black-Scholes model on grant date using the following assumptions: 

Expected volatility 
 52.2 
 
 Expected term 
 7 years 
 
 Expected dividend yield 
 0 
 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 1.66

During the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded
stock option compensation expense of 241,000 and 278,000, respectively, related to issuance of stock options. As of June 30,
2012, there was a total of 604,000 of unamortized compensation related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over
the weighted-average of 4 years.

The InterGroup Corporation 2007 Stock Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors 

The InterGroup Corporation 2007 Stock Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (the 2007 Stock Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company on February 21, 2007,
and was thereafter adopted by the Board of Directors. The 2007 Stock Plan will terminate upon the earlier of the date all shares
reserved for issuance have been awarded or February 21, 2017, if not sooner terminated by the Board upon recommendation by the
Compensation Committee. The stock available for issuance under the 2007Stock Plan shall be unrestricted shares of the Company's
Common Stock, par value .01 per share, which may be unissued shares or treasury shares. Subject to certain adjustments upon changes
in capitalization, a maximum of 60,000 shares of the Common Stock will be available for issuance to
participants under the 2007 Stock Plan. 

All non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the
2007 Plan. Each non-employee director as of the adoption date of the 2007 Stock Plan was granted an award of 600 unrestricted shares
of the Company s Common Stock. On each July 1 following the adoption date of the 2007 Stock Plan, each non-employee director
shall receive an automatic grant of a number of shares of Company s Common Stock equal in value to 18,000 based on 100 
of the fair market value (as defined) of the Common Stock on the date of grant, provided he or she holds such position on that
date and the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant under the 2007 Stock Plan is sufficient to permit such automatic
grant. Any fractional shares resulting from such grant will be rounded up to next highest whole share. All stock awards to non-employee
directors will be fully vested on the date of grant. The dollar amount of the annual grant is subject to further adjustment by
the Board of Directors upon recommendation by the Compensation Committee. 

The stock awards granted under the
2007 Stock Plan are shares of unrestricted Common Stock and are fully vested on the date of grant. The right of the non-employee
director to receive his or her annual grant of Common is personal to the director and is not transferable. Once received, shares
of Common Stock awarded to the non-employee director are freely transferable subject to any requirements of Section 16(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). On June 28, 2007, Company filed a registration
statement on Form S-8 to register the shares subject to the 2007 Stock Plan and the Company s two prior stock option plans
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 

53 

Upon recommendation
of the Compensation Committee, the Board may, at any time and from time to time and in any respect, amend or modify the 2007 Stock
Plan. The Board must obtain stockholder approval of any material amendment to the 2007 Stock Plan if required by any applicable
law, regulation or stock exchange rule. The Board of Directors may amend the 2007 Stock Plan or any award agreement, which amendment
may be retroactive, in order to conform it to any present or future law, regulation or ruling relating to plans of this
or similar nature. No amendment or modification of the 2007 Stock Plan or any award agreement may adversely affect any outstanding
award without the written consent of the participant holding the award. 

Upon recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, the Board of Directors, on February 23, 2011, voted to increase the annual grant awarded to each of the non-employee
directors to a number of shares of Company s common stock equal in value to 22,000, effective as of the July 1, 2011 grant,
while decreasing the annual cash compensation payable to non-employee directors from 16,000 to 12,000 per year. 

For the years ended June 30, 2012
and 2011, the four non-employee directors of the Company received a total grant of 3,532 and 4,716 shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the 2007 Stock Plan , respectively. 

The InterGroup Corporation 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Plan 

On December 3, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted,
a new equity compensation plan for its officers, directors and key employees entitled, The InterGroup Corporation 2008 Restricted
Stock Unit Plan (the 2008 RSU Plan ). The Plan was adopted, in part, to replace the stock option plans that expired
on December 7, 2008. The 2008 RSU Plan was approved by shareholders at the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February
18, 2009. 

The 2008 RSU Plan authorizes the Company to issue restricted
stock units RSUs as equity compensation to officers, directors and key employees of the Company on such terms and
conditions established by the Compensation Committee of the Company. RSUs are not actual shares of the Company s common stock,
but rather promises to deliver common stock in the future, subject to certain vesting requirements and other restrictions as may
be determined by the Committee. Holders of RSUs have no voting rights with respect to the underlying shares of common stock and
holders are not entitled to receive any dividends until the RSUs vest and the shares are delivered. No
awards of RSUs shall vest until at least nine months after shareholder approval of the 2008 RSU Plan on February 18, 2009. Subject
to certain adjustments upon changes in capitalization, a maximum of 200,000 shares of the common stock
are available for issuance to participants under the 2008 RSU Plan. The 2008 RSU Plan will terminate ten (10) years from December
3, 2008, unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors. After the 2008 RSU Plan is terminated, no awards may be granted but
awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with the Plan and their applicable terms and conditions. 

Under the 2008 RSU Plan, the Compensation Committee also has
the power and authority to establish and implement an exchange program that would permit the Company to offer holders of awards
issued under prior shareholder approved compensation plans to exchange certain options for new RSUs on terms and conditions to
be set by the Committee. The exchange program is designed to increase the retention and motivational
value of awards granted under prior plans. In addition, by exchanging options for RSUs, the Company will reduce the number of shares
of common stock subject to equity awards, thereby reducing potential dilution to stockholders in the event of significant increases
in the value of its common stock.

year ended June 30, 2012, 15,000 stock options were exchanged for 8,245 RSUs. During the year ended June 30, 2011, 12,000 stock

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). On June 28, 2007, Company filed a registration statement on Form
S-8 to register the shares subject to the 2007 Stock Plan and the Company s two prior stock option plans under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 

Upon recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, the Board may, at any time and from time to time and in any respect, amend or modify the 2007 Stock Plan. The Board
must obtain stockholder approval of any material amendment to the 2007 Stock Plan if required by any applicable law, regulation
or stock exchange rule. The Board of Directors may amend the 2007 Stock Plan or any award agreement, which amendment may be retroactive,
in order to conform it to any present or future law, regulation or ruling relating to plans of this or similar nature. No amendment
or modification of the 2007 Stock Plan or any award agreement may adversely affect any outstanding award without the written consent
of the participant holding the award. 

Upon recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, the Board of Directors, on February 23, 2011, voted to increase the annual grant awarded to each of the non-employee
directors to a number of shares of Company s common stock equal in value to 22,000, effective as of the July 1, 2011 grant,
while decreasing the annual cash compensation payable to non-employee directors from 16,000 to 12,000 per year.

For the fiscal year ended June 30,
2012, the four non-employee directors of the Company, Josef A. Grunwald, Gary N. Jacobs, John C. Love and William J. Nance, each
received a grant of 883 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2007 Stock Plan. 

The InterGroup Corporation 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Plan 

On December 3, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted, subject
to shareholder approval, a new equity compensation plan for its officers, directors and key employees entitled, The InterGroup
Corporation 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the 2008 RSU Plan ). The 2008 RSU Plan was approved and ratified by the
shareholders on February 18, 2009. 

The 2008 RSU Plan authorizes the Company to issue restricted
stock units RSUs as equity compensation to officers, directors and key employees of the Company on such terms and
conditions established by the Compensation Committee of the Company. RSUs are not actual shares of the Company s common stock,
but rather promises to deliver common stock in the future, subject to certain vesting requirements and other restrictions as may
be determined by the Committee. Holders of RSUs have no voting rights with respect to the underlying shares of common stock and
holders are not entitled to receive any dividends until the RSUs vest and the shares are delivered. No awards of RSUs shall vest
until at least six months after shareholder approval of the Plan. Subject to certain adjustments upon changes in capitalization,
a maximum of 200,000 shares of the common stock are available for issuance to participants under the 2008 RSU Plan. The 2008 RSU
Plan will terminate ten (10) years from December 3, 2008, unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors. After the 2008 RSU
Plan is terminated, no awards may be granted but awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with the Plan
and their applicable terms and conditions. 

The shares of common stock to be delivered upon the vesting
of an award of RSUs have been registered under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement filed on Form S-8 by the
Company on June 16, 2010. The grant of RSUs is personal to the recipient and is not transferable. Once received, shares of common
stock issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs are freely transferable subject to any requirements of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act. Under the 2008 RSU Plan, the Compensation Committee also has the power and authority to establish and implement an exchange
program that would permit the Company to offer holders of awards issued under prior shareholder approved compensation plans to
exchange certain options for new RSUs on terms and conditions to be set by the Committee. The exchange program is designed to increase
the retention and motivational value of awards granted under prior plans. In addition, by exchanging options for RSUs, the Company
will reduce the number of shares of common stock subject to equity awards, thereby reducing potential dilution to stockholders
in the event of significant increases in the value of its common stock. 

Pursuant to an exchange offer authorized by the Compensation
Committee, a total of 8,245 RSUs were issued to five holders of Non-Employee Director stock options in exchange for a total of
15,000 stock options which were surrendered to the Company on June 30, 2012. The number of RSUs issued was determined by multiplying
the number of options that were surrendered by the difference between the exercise price of the options surrendered 11.23) and
the closing price of the Company s common stock on June 30, 2012 of 24.94, with that product divided by the closing price
of the common stock on June 30, 2012. Of the 8,245 RSUs issued pursuant to that exchange offer, 4,125 will vest on October 1, 2012
and 4,120 will vest on April 1, 2013. 

The InterGroup Corporation 2010 Omnibus Employee Incentive
Plan 

On February 24, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved
The InterGroup Corporation 2010 Omnibus Employee Incentive Plan (the 2010 Incentive Plan ), which was formally adopted
by the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders. The 2010 Incentive Plan authorizes a total of up to 200,000
shares of common stock to be issued as equity compensation to officers and employees of the Company in an amount and in a manner
to be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The 2010 Incentive Plan authorizes the
awards of several types of equity compensation including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other
stock based compensation. The 2010 Incentive Plan will expire on February 23, 2020, if not terminated sooner by the Board of Directors
upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Any awards issued under the Plan will expire under the terms of the grant agreement. 

65 

The shares of common stock to be issued under the 2010 Incentive
Plan have been registered under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement filed on Form S-8 by the Company on June
16, 2010. Once received, shares of common stock issued under the Plan will be freely transferable subject to any requirements of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 

On February 28, 2012, the Compensation Committee authorized
the grant of 90,000 stock options to the Company s Chairman, President and Chief Executive, John V. Winfield to purchase
up to 90,000 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Plan. The exercise price of the options
is 19.77, which equals 100 of the fair market value of the Company s common stock as determined by reference to the closing
price of the Company s common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market on February 28, 2012 the date of grant. The
options expire ten years from the date of grant, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the 2010 Plan. The options
shall be subject to both time and performance based vesting requirements, each of which must be satisfied before options are fully
vested and eligible to be exercised. Pursuant to the time vesting requirements, the options vest over a period of five years, with
18,000 options vesting upon each one year anniversary of the date of grant. Pursuant to the performance vesting requirements, the
options vest in increments of 18,000 shares upon each increase of 2.00 or more in the market price of the Company s common
stock above the exercise price 19.77) of the options. To satisfy this requirement, the common stock must trade at that increased
level for a period of at least ten trading days during any one quarter. As of June 30, 2012, none of the performance vesting requirements
of the options was satisfied. 

On July 1, 2011, the Compensation Committee authorized a grant
of 5,000 stock options to the Company s Assistant Secretary and General Counsel, Michael G, Zybala, to purchase up to 5,000
shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Plan. The exercise price of the options is 24.92 and
the options expire ten years from the date of grant, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the 2010 Plan. The
options vest over a period of five years, with 1,000 options vesting upon each one year anniversary of the date of grant, July
1, 2011. 

Change in Controls Provisions in Equity Compensation Plans. 

Under the Company s 2008 RSU Plan and its 2010 Incentive
Plan, RSUs, stock options and other incentive awards may vest upon a change in control of the Company in accordance with their
respective grant agreements. Outstanding unvested RSUs issued to pursuant to the 2008 RSU Plan in exchange for vested stock options
will immediately vest upon a change in control. Outstanding stock options issued pursuant to the Company s 2010 Incentive
Plan will also immediately vest and become exercisable upon a change in control. Except for the foregoing, there are no employment
contracts between the Company and its Officers or Directors or any change in control arrangements. 

Compensation of Directors 

Until fiscal 2011, each non-employee director received an annual
cash retainer in the amount of 16,000, to be paid in equal quarterly payments. Upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee,
the Board of Directors, on February 23, 2011, voted to decrease the annual cash compensation payable to non-employee directors
from 16,000 to 12,000, effective as of fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. With the exception of members of the Audit Committee,
non-employee directors do not receive any additional fees for attending Board or Committee meetings, but are entitled to reimbursement
of their reasonable expenses to attend such meetings. Members of the Audit Committee are paid a fee of 1,000 per quarter, with
the Chair of that Committee to receive 1,500 per quarter. As an executive officer, the Company s Chairman has elected to
forego his annual board fees. 

Non-employee directors are also eligible for grants of equity
compensation under the Company s 2007 Stock Plan and 2008 RSU Plan. Pursuant to the 2007 Stock Plan, each non-employee director
was entitled to an annual grant of a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to 18,000 based on the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. To compensate for the 4,000 reduction in annual cash compensation payable
to non-employee directors as discussed above, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, increased
the annual grant of common stock to an amount equal in value to 22,000, effective as of the July 1, 2011 grant. Non-employee directors
may also be eligible to participate in exchange offers as may be authorized by the Compensation Committee under the 2008 RSU Plan
to exchange previously issued stock options for RSUs.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,
and Director Independence. 

On December 4, 1998, the Compensation Committee authorized the
Company to obtain whole life and split dollar insurance policies covering the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Winfield. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company paid annual premiums in the amount of approximately 85,000 for the split
dollar insurance policy owned by, and the beneficiary of which is, a trust for the benefit of Mr. Winfield s family. The
Company has a secured right to receive, from any proceeds of the policy, reimbursement of all premiums paid prior to any payments
to the beneficiary.

President and Chief Executive officer, John V. Winfield, oversees the investment activity of the Company in public and private
markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of Santa Fe and Portsmouth and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and
various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, his family, Santa Fe and Portsmouth may, at times, invest in the same companies
in which the Company invests. The Company encourages such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive
Officer and his family members, and the resources of Santa Fe and Portsmouth, at risk in connection with investment decisions made
on behalf of the Company. Under the direction of the Securities Investment Committee, the Company has instituted certain modifications
to its procedures to reduce the potential for conflicts of interest. 

The Company, its subsidiary Santa Fe and Santa Fe s subsidiary,
Portsmouth, have established performance based compensation programs for Mr. Winfield s management of the securities portfolios
of those companies. The performance based compensation program was approved by the disinterested members of the respective Boards
of Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. No performance bonus compensation was paid to Mr. Winfield for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.

set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 

1. Definitions .
In addition to the words and terms elsewhere defined in this Agreement, certain capitalized words and terms used in this Agreement
shall have the meanings given to them by the definitions and descriptions in the 2010 Plan, unless the context or use indicates
another or different meaning or intent, and such definitions shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms
of any capitalized words and terms defined in the 2010 Plan. 

2. Grant of Stock
Options . Effective, February 28, 2012, the Company grants to Employee, and Employee hereby receives from the Company, the right
and option to purchase (the Options 90,000 shares of the Common Stock (the Option Shares of the Company

be Incentive Stock Options under the terms of the 2010 Plan. 

3. Term of Options .
The term of the Options (the Term shall be for a period of ten (10) years, beginning February 28, 2012 (the Effective

Common Stock as determined by reference to the closing price of the Company s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Capital
Market on February 28, 2012, the date of grant. 

5. Vesting Schedule
and Requirements . The Options shall be subject to the following time and performance based vesting requirements, both 
of which must be met before the Options are fully vested and eligible to be exercised: 

(a) Time Vesting
Schedule . The Options shall vest in the following amounts on the following dates: 

 February 28, 2013 - 18,000 shares 

 February 28, 2014 - 18,000 shares 

 February 28, 2015 - 18,000 shares 

 February 28, 2016 - 18,000 shares 

 February 28, 2017 - 18,000 shares 

(b) Performance
Based Vesting Requirements . In addition to the above Time Vesting Schedule, the vesting of the Options is also subject to Performance
Based Vesting Requirements. Under the Performance Based Vesting Requirements, the Options will vest in increments of 18,000 shares
upon each increase of 2.00 or more in the Fair Market Value of the Company s Common Stock above the Exercise Price 19.77)
of the Options. To satisfy this performance requirement, the Common Stock must trade at that increased level for a period of at
least ten (10) trading days during any one quarter during the Term of the Options. For example, if the Company s Common Stock
trades at a level of 21.77 a share, or above, for at least ten (10) trading days during any one quarter, the Performance Based
Vesting Requirement will be satisfied with respect to 18,000 shares. However, Options to purchase those 18,000 shares will only
be considered to be fully vested and exercisable if the applicable time vesting requirement has also been met. For all the Options
to vest under this requirement, the Company s Common Stock has to trade at a level of at least 29.77 for period of at least
ten (10) trading days during any one quarter during the Term. 

6. Vesting Upon
Sale, Merger, Extraordinary Corporate Events. All Options issued pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately vest upon the
sale, merger, consolidation or liquidation of the Company or upon such other extraordinary corporate events as may be determined
by the Compensation Committee. 

7. Exercise of
Options and Payment . The Options shall be exercisable during the Term upon satisfaction of the vesting requirements set forth
in Section 5 hereof and any other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement. Options shall be
exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company, or an agent designated by the Company, setting forth
the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares. 

2 

A
condition of the issuance of the Option Shares as to which an Option shall be exercised shall be the payment of the Exercise Price.
The Exercise Price of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent; (b) by tendering
(either by actual delivery or attestation) previously acquired shares of the Company having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the
time of exercise equal to the Exercise Price (provided that except as otherwise determined by the Committee, the shares that are
tendered must have been held by the Employee for at least six (6) months (or such other period, if any, as the Committee may permit)
prior to their tender to satisfy the Exercise Price if acquired under the 2010 Plan or any other compensation plan maintained by
the Company or have been purchased on the open market); (c) by a cashless exercise (broker-assisted exercise) through a same
day sale commitment; (d) by utilizing a net gain procedure; (e) by a combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d); or (f) any other
method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion. 

The net gain procedure,
is intended to work, in effect, like a stock-settled SAR. An option holder who elects to use the net gain procedure will receive
the number of shares of common stock with a value equal to the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and
the exercise price of the option, less applicable tax withholding. For example, if an optionee has an option to acquire 300 shares
at an exercise price of 10.00 per share and exercises the option when the market price is 30.00 and the withholding rate is 30 ,
the optionee would receive 140 shares (100 shares would be withheld to pay the exercise price and 60 shares would be withheld to
pay the required withholding tax. 

Subject
to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of written notification of exercise and full payment
(including satisfaction of any applicable tax withholding), the Company shall deliver to the Employee share certificates in an
appropriate amount based upon the number of Option Shares purchased under the Option(s), or upon Employee s request, evidence
of book entry Shares. 

All
payments under all of the methods indicated above shall be paid in United States dollars. 

8. Termination
of Employment . If the Employee's employment by the Company shall terminate for any reason other than death, disability or termination
for cause, the Options shall terminate six months after the Employee's employment terminates (unless the Employee dies during such
period), or on the Option's expiration date, if earlier, and shall be exercisable during such period after termination of employment
only with respect to the number of shares which the Employee was entitled to purchase on the day preceding the termination of the
Employee's employment, except that the Compensation Committee may, in specific cases, and in its sole discretion, permit exercise
by an Employee of all, or a part of, the unexercised Option within the period referred to above after the Employee's employment
terminates. If the Employee's employment by the Company shall terminate for any reason other than death, disability or termination
for cause, the Employee shall have the right to retain the Options not yet vested in exchange for continued services to the Company
and/or its subsidiaries in an advisory capacity or for services as a member of the Company s Board of Directors as may be
determined by the Compensation Committee. If the Employee's employment shall terminate because of discharge for cause, the Options
shall terminate on the date of the Employee's discharge. 

3 

9. Termination
of Options Upon Death or Disability . In the event of the Employee's death or disability while in the employ of the Company
prior to vesting of the Options or Employee's death within six months after the termination of the Employee's employment (other
than by reason of discharge for cause) the Options shall terminate 12 months after the date of the Employee's death or disability
date. 

10. Leave of
Absence . A leave of absence, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the commencement thereof, shall
not be considered a termination of employment. The Options shall not be affected by any change of employment so long as Employee
continues to be an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. 

11. Right of
Company to Terminate Employment . Nothing contained in the 2010 Plan or in this Agreement shall confer on Employee the right
to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary
to terminate the employment of Employee at any time, with or without cause. 

12. Non-alienation
of Benefits . No right or benefit under the 2010 Plan or this Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale,
assignment, hypothecation, pledge, exchange, transfer, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, sell assign, hypothecate,
pledge, exchange, transfer, encumber or charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable
for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such benefit. 

13. Termination
and Amendment . No termination, modification or amendment of the 2010 Plan or of this Agreement may, without the consent of
Employee, adversely affect the rights of Employee with respect to the Options. 

14. Tax
Withholding . The Company's obligation to deliver the Option Shares upon the vesting and exercise of the Options shall be subject
to applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. The Company shall have the
power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require Employee to remit to the Company, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy
federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable
event arising as a result of the exercise of the Options. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of the Options,
Employee may elect, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or
in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the
minimum statutory total tax that could be imposed on the transaction. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing,
and signed by the Employee, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Compensation Committee, in its sole
discretion, deems appropriate. 

4 

15. Separability .
If any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (as the
same shall be amended from time to time), then such terms or provisions shall be deemed inoperative to the extent they so conflict
with the requirements of said Rule 16b-3. 

16. Adjustments
Upon Changes in Capitalization . In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of any stock
dividend, distribution, split-up, recapitalization, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or liquidation
and the like, the number and class of shares subject to any outstanding Options and the vesting of the Options, shall be appropriately
adjusted by the Compensation Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, whose determination shall be conclusive. The grant
of the Options shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassification, reorganizations
or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part
of its assets. All adjustments shall be rounded to the lowest whole number of shares of Common Stock.

1. Engage in and promote honest and ethical
conduct, acting with integrity and exercising at all times their best independent judgment;

interest between personal and professional relationships and disclose to the Company's Audit Committee and counsel any material
transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict;

4. Comply with applicable governmental laws,
rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which InterGroup is a member; 

5. Maintain the confidentiality of Company

for personal advantage; 

6. Promote ethical and honest behavior among
employees under your supervision; and 

7. Promptly report any possible violation
of this Code of Ethics to the Audit Committee and the Company's counsel. 

All Senior Financial Officers are prohibited from directly or
indirectly taking any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence InterGroup's independent public accountant
engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the financial statements of the Company for the purpose of rendering the financial
statements of InterGroup misleading. 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors shall approve
any waiver or amendment of this Code of Ethics, and any such waiver or amendment shall be disclosed promptly as required by law
and SEC regulations.

adherence to this Code of Ethics. Failure to observe the terms of this Code of Ethics may result in disciplinary action, up to
and including termination of employment. Violations of this Code of Ethics may also constitute violations of law, and may result
in civil and criminal penalties for the individual, his or her supervisor and/or InterGroup. 

If a Senior Financial Officer has any questions regarding the
best course of action in a particular situation, he or she should promptly contact the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Company's
counsel. An individual may choose to remain anonymous in reporting any possible violation of this Code of Ethics.
