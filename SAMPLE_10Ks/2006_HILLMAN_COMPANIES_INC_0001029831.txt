acquisition of a majority of SunSource common stock by Allied Capital Corporation in September
2001, changed its name to The Hillman Companies, Inc., which reflects its predominant business as
one of the largest providers of hardware-related products and related merchandising services to the
retail markets in North America. In connection with the SunSource name change, SunSource Capital
Trust, which has 4.2 million Trust Preferred Securities outstanding and trading on the American
Stock Exchange under the symbol HLM.Pr , changed its name to the Hillman Group Capital Trust.

On March 31, 2004, Hillman was acquired by an affiliate of Code Hennessy Simmons LLC CHS ).

and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 

Industry Overview 

Hillman operates in multiple channels of the retail marketplace such as hardware stores, national
and regional home centers and mass merchants. Hillman focuses on delivering merchandising systems,
point-of-sale displays, product support and sales installation services through its nationwide
field sales and service force to the retail sector.

These retail channels have experienced significant change as a result of the growth of the large
national big box Big Box chains (defined as mass merchants, home centers and large-format
grocery/drug centers), which have taken market share from the regional home centers and independent
hardware dealers and cooperatives. Hillman has developed sales, marketing, merchandising and
service specifically to meet the needs of the Big Box chains. Hillman believes that its market
knowledge, merchandising skills, breadth of inventory, and value-added services, including support
and fulfillment capabilities, will enable the Company to maintain its good relationships with the
Big Box chains.

The Hillman Group 

The Company is organized as a single business segment, the Hillman Group. With annualized sales of
approximately 382.5 million, the Hillman Group believes it is a leading provider of fasteners and
related small hardware items; keys, key duplication systems and related accessories, and
identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers and signs to retail outlets in North
America. Retail outlets served by Hillman include hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants,
pet supply stores, grocery stores and drug stores. Through its field sales and service
organization, Hillman complements its extensive product selection with value-added services for the
retailer.

Sales and service representatives regularly visit retail outlets to review stock levels, reorder
items in need of replacement, and interact with the store management to offer new product and
merchandising ideas. Thousands of items can be actively managed with the retailer experiencing a
substantial reduction in paperwork and labor costs. Service representatives also assist in
organizing the products in a consumer-friendly manner. Hillman complements its broad range of
products with value-added merchandising services such as displays, product identification stickers,
retail price stickers, store rack and drawer systems, assistance in rack positioning and store
layout, and inventory restocking services. Hillman regularly introduces new products and package
designs with color-coding for ease of shopping by consumers and modifies rack designs to improve
the attractiveness of individual store displays. Hillman functions as a merchandising manager for
retailers, supporting these services with high order fill rates and rapid delivery from its 12
distribution centers across the United States and Canada. Currently, orders are shipped within 48
hours with a 97 order fill rate.

The Company ships its products from 12 strategically located distribution centers in the United
States and Canada (See Item 2 Properties). In 2002, Hillman invested 9.8 million in a state of
the art distribution facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to improving order turnaround time
and reducing labor costs, the new facility provides additional capacity to accommodate future sales
growth. In 2004, the Company moved into a new facility in Lewisville, Texas, and the implementation
of warehouse management technology was completed in December. In June 2005, warehouse management
software was implemented in the Shafter, California facility. Hillman utilizes a third party
logistics provider to warehouse and ship customer orders in Mexico.

Hillman also manufactures and markets a value-added mix of high-tech and conventional products in
two core product categories: key duplication systems and identification systems. The
patent-protected Axxess Precision Key Duplication System has proven to be a profitable revenue
source within Big Box retailers. The technology developed for this system revolutionized the key
duplicating process utilizing computer aided alignment, indexing and duplication of keys. This
system has been placed in over 14,000 retail locations to date and is supported by Hillman sales
and service representatives.

3

In addition, Hillman offers a commercialized, consumer-operated vending system, Quick-Tag , which
provides custom engraved specialty items, such as pet identification tags, luggage tags and other
engraved identification tags. To date, more than 3,450 Quick-Tag machines have been placed in
retail locations which are being supported by Hillman s sales and service representatives.

Products and Suppliers 

Currently, Hillman purchases its products from approximately 650 vendors, the largest of which
accounted for approximately 9 of Hillman s annual purchases and the top five of which accounted
for 32.7 of its purchases. About 42 of its purchases are from overseas suppliers, with the
balance from domestic manufacturers and master distributors. Hillman s vendor quality control
procedures include on-site evaluations and frequent product testing. Vendors are also evaluated
based on delivery performance and the accuracy of their shipments.

Fasteners 

Hillman s fastener product line encompasses standard and specialty nuts, bolts, washers, screws,
anchors and picture hanging items. The line also includes brass, nylon, stainless steel, chrome
and galvanized and other miscellaneous fasteners. The depth of the line, over 40,000 products, is
believed to be the largest among suppliers servicing the hardware retail segment. Fasteners
generated 58.7 of total revenue in 2005.

Keys and Key Accessories 

Hillman provides a line of metal key products for major retailers and the automotive sector.
Hillman manufactures two metal key duplication systems that are niche-marketed to retail outlets,
primarily mass merchants and home centers, and a code cutting system for use in automotive
dealerships and in vehicle fleet environments.

The Axxess Precision Key Duplication System produces duplicate keys with the precision of a
locksmith while minimizing the technical skill required by operators. The system was developed in
response to retailers needs for reducing the miscut rate on keys. Axxess keys provide retailers
with nearly ten times more gross profit per square foot than the average of all products sold in
grocery and mass merchant channels.

Hillman also markets a conventional key cutting system. The styles of keys marketed include
standard brass keys, Wackeys , NFL, MLB, NCAA logo keys, Color Plus keys, rubber head keys, and
high security vehicle anti-theft key blanks. The conventional system is marketed to retailers who
do not experience high employee turnover and therefore do not have the same labor constraints as
mass merchants, home centers or grocery and drug retailers.

The key cutting system developed for the automotive industry, PC Code Cutter, produces automobile
keys using alphanumeric codes based on a vehicle s identification number. Utilizing a proprietary
computer program, the PC Code Cutter identifies and then cuts keys based on the automobile s
original key pattern. The PC Code Cutter is distributed through Barnes Distribution, a
distribution company serving vehicular and industrial markets. Since its introduction in February
1996, more than 7,900 PC Code Cutter and 4,100 of the new Flash Code Cutter systems have been
sold.

Hillman also markets key accessories in conjunction with its key duplication systems. Popular
accessories include the Key Light , Valet KeyChain , Fanatix key identifiers, key coils and key
clips. The Key Mates line of key accessories includes a broad range of products such as key
chains, tags, lights, floats, holders, whistles, and a host of other miscellaneous complementary
items. Revenues for keys, key accessories, and the PC Code Cutter represented 24.3 of total
revenues in 2005.

Engraving 

Quick-Tag is a patented, state-of-the-art consumer-operated vending system that custom engraves
specialty products such as pet identification tags, military-style I.D. tags, holiday ornaments and
luggage tags. Hillman initially targeted the pet identification

4

market with its Quick-Tag system, and has facilitated the process of obtaining a pet tag by
providing pet owners with a quick and convenient means to custom engrave tags while shopping at
large format retail stores such as Wal-Mart and PetSmart. Hillman has developed other high impact
applications for its Quick-Tag interactive engraving technology, including luggage tags, key
chains and military-style identification tags. The Company has placed over 3,450 Quick-Tag
machines in retail outlets throughout the United States and Canada. Using an interactive touch
screen, customers input information such as a pet name and telephone number, and the system s
proprietary technology engraves the tag in less than two minutes. The Quick-Tag system does not
require incremental labor and generates high levels of customer satisfaction and attractive margins
for the retailer. The Quick-Tag custom engraving systems generate retail profit per square foot
over seven times the typical retail average. Revenues for engraving products represented 8.4 of
total revenues in 2005.

Hillman purchases a wide variety of materials and components to manufacture the Axxess Key
Duplication and Quick-Tag engraving machines, many of which are manufactured to its specifications.
Management does not believe that it is overly dependent on any one supplier. The machine
components do not generally require proprietary technology and Hillman has identified or used
alternate suppliers for its primary sourcing needs.

Letters, Numbers and Signs LNS 

The LNS program offers an extensive collection of items for both domestic and commercial use such
as packaged self-adhesive letters and numbers, mailbox numbers and accessories, house numbers and
letters, contractor safety program signs, and driveway markers and reflectors. Typical retailers
dedicate eight linear feet of retail space for this product and view it as a significant
contributor to their retail offerings. Hillman also offers a variety of merchandisers and program
configurations for this line. LNS sales accounted for 8.6 of 2005 revenues.

Markets and Customers 

Hillman sells its products to national accounts such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowe s, Sears,
Tractor Supply, PetSmart, and PETCO. Hillman s status as a national supplier of unique,
proprietary products to Big Box retailers allows it to develop a strong market position and high
barriers to entry within its product categories. Management believes that the dynamics, which make
its services attractive to hardware retailers, are present with these larger customers as well.

Hillman services approximately 15,000 franchise and independent F I retail outlets. These
individual dealers are typically members of the larger cooperatives, such as True Value, Ace and
Do-it-Best. The Company sells directly to the cooperative s retail locations and also supplies
many fastener items to the cooperative s central warehouses. These central warehouses distribute
to their members that do not have a requirement for Hillman s in-store service. These arrangements
reduce credit risk and logistic expense for Hillman and reduce central warehouse inventory and
delivery costs for the cooperatives.

A typical hardware store maintains in inventory thousands of different items, many of which
generate small dollar sales but large profits. It is difficult for a retailer to economically
monitor all stock levels and to reorder the products from multiple vendors. The problem is
compounded by the necessity of receiving small shipments of inventory at different times and having
to stock the goods. However, failure to have these small items available will have an adverse
effect on store traffic, thereby denying the retailer the opportunity to sell items that generate
higher dollar sales.

Hillman sells its products to approximately 21,500 customers, the top five of which accounted for
44.3 of its annualized sales. Lowe s is the single largest customer, representing 18.4 of total
sales, Home Depot is the second largest at 10.9 and Wal-Mart is the third largest at 9.5 . No
other customer accounted for more than 5 of the Company s total sales in 2005.

Hillman s telemarketing activity sells to thousands of smaller hardware outlets and non-hardware
accounts. New business is also being pursued internationally in such places as Canada, Mexico,
South and Central America, and the Caribbean.

Sales and Marketing 

Management believes that Hillman provides excellent product support, customer service and profit
opportunities for its retail distribution partners. It also believes that a significant source of
its competitive advantage rests in its ability to provide a greater level of customer service than
its competitors. Hillman products are covered directly by the combined field service organization,
which provides service support through field visits. These field visits provide Hillman with
critical information relating to consumer buying patterns and retailing trends, and complements
their new product development efforts. Field service representatives also help retail customers to
improve the efficiency and profitability of Hillman s on-site merchandising systems by consulting
with customers in the areas of EDI, product planning, inventory control, systems interface and
store operations.

The national accounts field service organization consists of over 440 service people and 28 field
managers focusing on Big Box retailers, pet super stores, large national discount chains and
grocery stores. This organization reorders products, details store shelves and sets up in-store
promotions.

Management believes the Company consistently is able to be responsive to the needs of the F I
retailers because it employs the largest direct sales organization in the retail home industry.
This organization consists of 224 people, managed by 16 field managers. Each sales representative
is responsible for approximately 50 full service accounts that they call on approximately every two
weeks. Coupled with the efforts of the Marketing Department, the sales force not only sells
products, but can sell merchandising and technological support capabilities as well. The Marketing
Department provides support through the development of new products, sales collateral material,
promotional items, merchandising aids and marketing services such as advertising and trade show
management. Its electronic data interchange EDI system is used by a number of its large
customers for handling of orders and invoices.

Competition 

The primary competitors in the national accounts marketplace for fasteners are Crown-Bolt, ITW
Inc., R B, Inc. and the Newell Group. Competition is based primarily on in-store service and
price. Other competitors are local and regional distributors.

The principal competitors for Hillman s F I business are Midwest Fasteners, Serv-A-Lite and Hyko in
the hardware store marketplace. The first two carry mainly fastener products, while the latter is
the major competitor in LNS products and keys. Hillman competes primarily on field service,
merchandising, as well as product availability, price and breadth of product line.

Management estimates that Hillman sells to approximately 65 of the full service hardware stores in
the F I marketplace. The hardware outlets that purchase products but not services from Hillman
also purchase products from local and regional distributors and cooperatives. Competition in the
F I marketplace is primarily on the basis of price and availability.

Hillman competes with Hyko for LNS sales in hardware stores, home centers and mass merchants.
Competitors in the pet tag market are specialty retailers, direct mail order and retailers with
in-store mail order capability. The Quick-Tag system has patent protected proprietary technology
that is a major barrier to entry and preserves this market segment.

Insurance Arrangements 

Under the Company s current insurance programs, commercial umbrella coverage is obtained for
catastrophic exposure and aggregate losses in excess of expected claims. Since October 1991, the
Company has retained the exposure on certain expected losses related to worker s compensation,
general liability and automobile. The Company also retains the exposure on expected losses related
to health benefits of certain employees. The Company believes that its present insurance is
adequate for its businesses. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2005.

6

Employees 

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 1,853 full time and part time employees. In the opinion
of management, employee relations are good.

Backlog 

The Company s sales backlog from ongoing operations was 5.8 million as of December 31, 2005, and
 5.7 million as of December 31, 2004.

Item 1A Risk Factors. 

An investment in the Company s securities involves certain risks as discussed below. However, the
risks set forth below are not the only risks the Company faces, and it faces other risks which have
not yet been identified or which are not yet otherwise predictable. If any of the following risks
occur or are otherwise realized, the Company s business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected. You should consider carefully the risks
described below and all other information in this annual report, including the Company s financial
statements and the related notes and schedules thereto, prior to making an investment decision with
regard to the Company s securities.

The Company operates in a highly competitive industry, which may have a material adverse effect on
its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The retail industry is highly competitive, with the principal methods of competition being price,
quality of service, quality of products, product availability, credit terms and the provision of
value-added services, such as merchandising design, in-store service and inventory management. The
Company encounters competition from a large number of regional and national distributors, some of
which have greater financial resources than the Company and may offer a greater variety of
products. If these competitors are successful, the Company s business, financial
condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

The Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by seasonality and general economic conditions affecting its sales. 

Hillman has, in the past, experienced seasonal fluctuations in sales and operating results from
quarter to quarter. Typically, the first calendar quarter is the weakest due to the effect of
weather on home projects and the construction industry.

7

Large
customer concentration and the inability to
penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the business. 

The Company s three largest customers constituted approximately 38.8 of sales for 2005. The loss
of one of these customers or a material adverse change in the relationship with these customers
could have a negative impact on business. The Company s inability to penetrate new channels of
distribution may also have a negative impact on its future sales and business.

Successful
sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company s ability to
recruit and retain qualified employees. 

The success of the Company s efforts to grow its
business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, its sales force and other
personnel, including the ability of its sales force to achieve adequate customer coverage.
The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. A shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the Company s ability to implement its growth strategy.

The Company is exposed to adverse changes in currency exchange rates. 

The Company imports a significant portion of its product from the Far East including China, Taiwan
and India. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of these
countries versus the United States Dollar.

The Company s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflation in the cost of raw
materials, freight and energy. 

The Company s products are manufactured of metals, including but not limited to steel, aluminum,
zinc, and copper. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based materials in the manufacture
of LNS that are resin based and subject to fluctuations in the price of oil. As described in more
detail in Item 7 hereto, the Company has been negatively impacted by commodity and freight
inflation in recent years, and it expects energy and certain commodity prices, particularly
non-ferrous metals, may increase. If the Company is unable to mitigate these inflation increases
through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be
adversely affected.

The Company s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing product from overseas. 

The Company imports large quantities of its fastener products. Substantially all of its import
operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through
mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries
from which the Company s products
and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas,
duties, tariffs or other restrictions on its imports or adversely modify existing restrictions.
Imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the
Company s cost of goods sold. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the
Company s suppliers failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm the
Company s business.

The Company s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected
by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers,
such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security
requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or
require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to
customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher
transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s business and financial
condition.

If the Company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill or indefinite-lived
tradenames, its net income could be materially adversely affected. 

As a result of the Merger Transaction the Company has 241.5 million of goodwill and 44.7 million
of indefinite-lived tradenames recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. The
Company is required to periodically determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames have
become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset. If
the Company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames,
its net income could be materially adversely affected.

The Company s success is highly dependent on information and technology systems. 

The Company believes that its proprietary computer software programs are an integral part of its
business and growth strategies. Hillman depends on its information systems to process orders, to
manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products
efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations and to provide superior
service to its customers. There can be no assurance that the precautions which the Company has
taken against certain events that could disrupt the operations of its information systems will
prevent the occurrence of such a disruption. Any such disruption could have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and results of operations.

The inability to make timely and cost effective acquisitions may adversely affect the Company s
business. 

One element of Hillman s future growth strategy is to pursue selected acquisitions that either
expand or complement its businesses in new or existing markets. However, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to identify or acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms
favorable to the Company and in a timely manner, if at all, to the extent necessary to fulfill
Hillman s growth strategy.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into the Company s operations may result in
unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management s
attention, and there can be no assurance that Hillman will be able to successfully integrate
acquired businesses into its operations, including the Steelworks acquisition in January 2006.

The Company is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. 

A significant portion of the Company s outstanding debt has variable rate interest. Increases in
borrowing rates will increase the Company s cost of borrowing,
which may affect the Company s results of operations and
financial condition.

Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

The following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an
assessment and understanding of the Company s operations and financial condition. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and
schedules thereto appearing elsewhere herein.

General 

The Hillman Companies, Inc. Hillman or the Company is one of the largest providers of
hardware-related products and related merchandising services to the retail markets in North

Merger Transaction 

On March 31, 2004, The Hillman Companies, Inc. was acquired by an affiliate of Code Hennessy

Financing Arrangements 

On March 31, 2004, the Company, through its Hillman Group subsidiary, refinanced its revolving
credit and senior term loans with a Senior Credit Agreement (the Senior Credit Agreement consisting of a 40.0 million revolving credit (the Revolver and a 217.5 million term loan (the
 Term Loan ). The Senior Credit Agreement has a seven-year term and provides borrowings at interest
rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rates (the

13

LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.25 and 3.00 (the LIBOR Margin ), or prime (the Base Rate plus a margin of between 1.25 and 2.0 (the Base Rate Margin ). The applicable LIBOR Margin and
Base Rate Margin is based on the Company s leverage as of the last day of the preceding fiscal
quarter. In accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement, letter of credit commitment fees are
based on the average daily face amount of each outstanding letter of credit multiplied by a letter
of credit margin of between 2.25 and 3.00 per annum (the Letter of Credit Margin ). The Letter
of Credit Margin is also based on the Company s leverage at the date of the preceding fiscal
quarter. The Company also pays a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum on the average daily unused
Revolver balance.

In addition, on March 31, 2004, the Company, through The Hillman Group, issued 47.5 million of
unsecured subordinated notes to Allied Capital maturing on September 30, 2011 Subordinated Debt
Issuance ). Interest on the Subordinated Debt Issuance is at a fixed rate of 13.5 per annum, with
cash interest payments required on a quarterly basis at a fixed rate of 11.25 commencing April 15,
2004. The outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Debt Issuance shall be increased on a
quarterly basis at the remaining 2.25 fixed rate (the PIK Amount ). All of the PIK Amounts are
due on the maturity date of the Subordinated Debt Issuance.

The Company pays interest to the Trust on the Junior Subordinated Debentures underlying the Trust
Preferred Securities at the rate of 11.6 per annum on their face amount of 105.4 million, or
 12.2 million per annum in the aggregate. The Trust distributes an equivalent amount to the
holders of the Trust Preferred Securities.

On April 28, 2004, the Company entered into an Interest Rate Swap Agreement Swap with a
two-year term for a notional amount of 50.0 million. The Swap effectively fixes the interest rate
on 50.0 million of the Term Loan at a rate of 1.17 plus the applicable interest rate margin for
the first three months of the Swap with incremental increases ranging from 28 to 47 basis points in
each successive quarter.

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

On October 3, 2002, the Company, through The Hillman Group, purchased the net assets of the
DIY division DIY of the Fastenal Company of Winona, MN Fastenal ). DIY, with annual sales of
approximately 22 million, distributes fasteners, anchors, picture hanging wire, hooks, tacks, and
brads to national hardware cooperatives and home centers. The Company paid 15.3 million in cash
to Fastenal for the net assets of DIY. The transaction was financed from the Company s existing
credit lines.

On May 1, 2002, the Company s Hillman Group purchased certain assets of the Lowe s specialty
fastener business from R B, Inc. for cash consideration of 6.2 million. The purchase of the
specialty fastener business has expanded the breadth of the Company s product offering to Lowe s.
In connection with this transaction, the Company settled litigation filed by R B, Inc. in February
1996 related to the Company s sale of the Dorman Products division. The litigation settlement in
the amount of 1.25 million was fully reserved on the Company s balance sheet, and accordingly,
there was no charge to income in 2002.

On March 2, 2000, the Company contributed the interests in its Kar Products, Inc. and A H Bolt 
Nut Company Limited operations (collectively, the Kar business ), to a newly-formed partnership
affiliated with Glencoe Capital, L.L.C. Glencoe ). Glencoe contributed cash equity to the new
partnership, GC-Sun Holdings L.P. G-C ). The Company received 105 million in cash proceeds from
the transaction through repayment of assumed debt by G-C and retained minority ownership in G-C.
Affiliates of Glencoe held the controlling interest in G-C. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on
the transaction of approximately 49.1 million in the first quarter of 2000. On January 4, 2002,
G-C provided the Company notice that it intended to exercise its call right to purchase the
Company s partnership interest as a result of the merger transaction with Allied Capital. On April
13, 2002, the Company entered into a Unit Repurchase Agreement with G-C, pursuant to which G-C
exercised its call right. In exchange for its interest in G-C, the Company received a 10 million
subordinated note from G-C.

14

In February 2003, G-C sold the assets of its largest operating division, Kar Products. The proceeds
of the sale were primarily used to pay down G-C s senior creditors. Following the sale of Kar
Products, the Company estimated the enterprise value of G-C based on the cash flows and book value
of the remaining operating division under a held for sale methodology. The excess of the estimated
enterprise value less debt obligations senior to the G-C note were determined to be insufficient to
support the value of the G-C note and accrued interest thereon. Accordingly, the Company recorded
an 11.3 million charge to income during the year ended December 31, 2003 to write-down the face
value of the note and accrued interest thereon to zero.

The G-C note was distributed to the Company s common stockholders on March 31, 2004.

Subsequent Event 

On
January 5, 2006, the Company s Hillman Group, Inc. subsidiary purchased certain assets of
The SteelWorks Corporation SteelWorks ), a Denver, Colorado based manufacturer and distributor of
metal shapes, threaded rod and metal sheet to the Retail Hardware and Home Improvement Industry.
Annual revenues of the SteelWorks customer base acquired are approximately 31 million. The
aggregate purchase price was 34.2 million paid in cash at closing.

Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 

Net sales of 382.5 million in 2005 increased 30.9 million or 8.8 from 2004. Most of the
increase was due to sales to national accounts, including Lowe s,
Home Depot and Wal Mart, which were
up 12.4 million or 8.2 in 2005. Lowe s, on the strength of new store openings and new product
introductions, accounted for 8.1 million of the National Account sales increase. The Home Depot
sales increase in 2005 of 5.3 million can also be attributed primarily to new store openings.
Wal Mart s 2005 sales in the United States actually declined by 5 or 1.3 million as a result of a
concerted effort by Wal Mart corporate to reduce inventory levels in their fiscal fourth quarter.

Sales to Franchise and Independent F I hardware stores improved by 9.6 million or 7.8 
compared to 2004. The F I accounts are typically individual hardware dealers who are members of a
larger cooperative such as Ace, True Value and Do-it Best. After several years of slow growth, the
F I business had a second year of solid growth. New account activity, including 115 new stores and
over 160 competitor conversions were the primary drivers of the 2005 sales growth. Also, Hillman
introduced several new products to the F I accounts in 2005 such as chrome plated fasteners and a
new picture hanging line.

Regional accounts including 84 Lumber, Sutherlands and Westlake Hardware, increased sales by 3.6
million or 18.6 . Engraving sales also posted strong sales growth of 9.7 or 2.9 million in 2005.
The growth can be attributed to new store openings at PetSmart and PETCO combined with improvement
in Wal mart same store sales. International sales including Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin
America increased 2.5 million or 34.0 in 2005. Other accounts including the coop wholesalers,
direct marketing and commercial accounts, declined by 0.1 million in 2005.

The Company s sales backlog, based upon cancelable purchase orders, was 5.8 million as of December
31, 2005 compared to 5.7 million as of December 31, 2004.

Gross profit declined from 54.9 in
2004 to 53.9 in 2005 and was negatively affected in 2005
by cost increases in several commodities essential to both our key and LNS product lines. The
material cost of a key blank is largely dictated by the price of copper which experienced significant
increases in 2005. Also, styrene, which is used in the manufacture of
LNS, is a resin based product
affected by surging oil prices in 2005.

Selling, general and administrative S,G A expense of 140.6 million in 2005 increased 10.1
million or 7.8 over 2004. The increase in selling expenses of 4.5 million can be attributed
primarily to the cost of displays for new national account locations and retrofits of existing
stores which increased 2.1 million in 2005 compared with the prior year. The additional increase
in selling cost is the result of costs to provide service and merchandising to the expanded store
base. Warehouse and delivery costs, which are almost wholly variable with sales volume increases,
were up 3.5 million in 2005. Productivity gains from the 2005 implementation of new technology in
the Dallas and Bakersfield distributions centers kept the overall cost to pick and ship orders
relatively flat compared to 2004 despite the 8.9 increase in sales volume. Freight costs of 21.6
million, on the other hand, increased 2.6 million or 14 over the prior year. Freight costs were
negatively impacted by fuel surcharges imposed by most of the Company s transit suppliers. General
and administrative expenses were up 0.9 million in 2005 primarily as a result of additional
accounting fees associated with the restatement of the 2004 10-K.

Depreciation expense increased 0.4 million from 15.2 million in 2004 to 15.6 million in 2005.
The increased depreciation was a result of additional capital spending in 2005 for the automation
and expansion of distribution facilities, an ERP implementation in the Company s Mexico facility
and expanded placement of Quick-Tag machines.

Following the March 31, 2004 Merger Transaction, the value of intangible assets was determined by
an independent appraisal. In 2005, amortization expense increased 1.5 million as a result of a
full year amortization of the newly valued intangible assets.

The Company has recorded a management and transaction fee charge of 1.0 million for 2005 and 1.3
million for 2004. As of the closing of the Merger Transaction in March 2004, the Company is
obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of CHS for management

17

services rendered in the amount of fifty-eight thousand dollars per month, plus out of pocket
expenses, and to pay transaction fees to a subsidiary of OTPP in the amount of twenty-six thousand
dollars per month, plus out of pocket expenses, for each month. The Company was obligated to pay
management fees to a subsidiary of Allied Capital for management services rendered in the amount of
 1.8 million, plus out of pocket expenses, for calendar years subsequent to 2001. The payment of
management fees was due annually after delivery of the Company s annual audited financial
statements to the Board of Directors of the Company. The obligation to pay management fees to
Allied Capital was terminated upon the payment of outstanding fees in the amount of 2.3 million on
March 31, 2004 in connection with the closing of the Merger Transaction.

Interest expense, net, increased 3.5 million to 21.0 million in 2005 from 17.5 million in 2004.
The increase in interest expense, net, was primarily the result of increased Company debt related
to the Merger Transaction, the amortization of additional deferred financing costs and increased
borrowing costs on the variable rate Term Loan.

Interest expense on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and management purchased preferred
options related to the Merger Transaction increased from 5.5 million in 2004 to 8.0 million in
2005. The increase can be attributed to an additional quarter of interest in 2005 and additional
vesting on the management purchased preferred options.

The Company pays interest to the Trust on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the trust
preferred securities at the rate of 11.6 per annum on their face amount of 105.4 million, or
 12.6 million per annum in the aggregate. The Company receives investment income on the trust
common securities in the amount of 0.4 million per annum. The Trust distributes the equivalent
net amount to the holders of the trust preferred securities. For the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Company paid interest net of investment income of 12.2 million on the junior
subordinated debentures, which is equivalent to the amounts distributed by the Trust on the trust
preferred securities.

The Company also pays interest to the Trust on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the
trust common securities at the rate of 11.6 per annum on their face amount of 3.3 million, or
 0.4 million per annum in the aggregate. The Trust distributes an equivalent amount to the Company
as a distribution on the underlying trust common securities. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the Company paid 0.4 million interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures, which is equivalent
to the amounts received by the Company as investment income.

The effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004
were 858.1 and 22.4 , respectively. The change in effective rate
is attributable to lower levels of book income and the existence of large permanent differences. See Note 5, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the
three years ended December 31, 2005, for income taxes and disclosures related to 2005 and 2004
income tax events.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 

Net sales increased 33.9 million or 10.7 in 2004 to 351.6 million from 317.7 million in 2003.
Sales to national accounts represented 19.4 million of the 33.9 million total sales increase.
The new store growth of our national accounts customers was primarily responsible for the increased
fastener, keys, and LNS sales to Lowe s, increased keys and LNS sales to Home Depot, and increased
keys sales to Wal-Mart. Sales to Franchise and Independent F I accounts increased 9.4 million
from 2003 primarily due to improved economic activity at the retail level and increased sales of
galvanized fasteners used in the newly formulated treated lumber. The F I accounts are typically
individual hardware dealers who are members of larger cooperatives, such as True Value, Ace, and
Do-It-Best. In addition, the regional and engraving accounts increased 3.3 million over the
comparable period in 2003. The regional accounts represent mid-sized hardware and lumber chains.
Sales by our Canadian division increased 1.3 million, export sales increased 0.7 million, and
other sales were 0.2 million less than the prior year.

The Company s sales backlog, based upon cancelable purchase orders, was 5.7 million as of December
31, 2004 and 4.8 million as of December 31, 2003.

18

The Hillman Group s gross margin of 55.0 in 2004 increased slightly from 54.9 in 2003. Price
increases together with production efficiencies following the December 2003 consolidation of the
Rockford packaging and distribution facility into the Company s Cincinnati facility offset the
rising cost of the Company s products.

The Company s consolidated selling, general and administrative S,G A expenses increased 9.7
million or 8.1 from 120.8 million in 2003 to 130.5 million in 2004. Selling expenses increased
 9.8 million or 17.1 primarily as a result of increased servicing and display costs at new
national account stores. Warehouse and delivery expenses increased 3.6 million or 8.9 as a
result of increased freight and labor costs of 2.8 million to process and ship the additional
sales volume. General and administrative expenses decreased by 4.0 million or 18.0 as a result
of a substantial decrease in medical claims experienced in 2004 compared to 2003 which included
 1.5 million in claims by an employee for medical services. In addition, 2004 expense declined
further from 2003 as a result of the elimination of several positions from our corporate office and
Tempe facility together with the December 2003 shutdown of the Rockford facility. Stock
compensation expenses from stock options related to the Merger Transaction were 0.3 million in
2004. There was no stock compensation expense in 2003.

Depreciation expense increased 0.8 million to 15.2 million in 2004 from 14.4 million in 2003
primarily as a result of an increase in the depreciable fixed asset base in connection with the
placement of key duplication machines used in new national accounts.

Amortization expense increased 4.3 million to 5.7 million in 2004 from 1.4 million in 2003. The
increase in amortization was the result of an increase in the valuation of certain intangible
assets in connection with the Merger Transaction.

The Company has recorded a management and transaction fee charge of 1.3 million for 2004 and 1.8
million for 2003. As of the closing of the Merger Transaction in March 2004, the Company is
obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of CHS for management services rendered in the
amount of fifty-eight thousand dollars per month, plus out of pocket expenses, and to pay
transaction fees to a subsidiary of OTPP in the amount of twenty-six thousand dollars per month,
plus out of pocket expenses. The Company was obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of
Allied Capital for management services rendered in the amount of 1.8 million, plus out of pocket
expenses, for calendar years subsequent to 2001. The payment of management fees was due annually
after delivery of the Company s annual audited financial statements to the Board of Directors of
the Company.

Income from operations for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was 10.0 million and includes 30.7
million in non-recurring costs recorded in connection with the Merger Transaction. This compares to 36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The Company s consolidated operating profit margin from operations (income from operations as a
percentage of net sales) was 11.5 in 2003 and 2.8 in 2004. However, 2004 includes the
non-recurring costs of 30.7 million recorded in connection with the Merger Transaction. The operating profit
margin was impacted by a reduction of S,G A expenses and management fees as a percentage of sales,
but these benefits were offset by the increase in amortization costs as a percentage of sales which
resulted from the Merger Transaction.

Interest expense, net, increased 2.1 million to 17.5 million in 2004 from 15.4 million in 2003.
The increase in interest expense, net, was primarily the result of increased Company debt related
to the Merger Transaction and the amortization of additional deferred financing costs.

Interest expense was 5.5 million in 2004 on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and
management purchased preferred options related to the Merger Transaction. No such interest expense
was recorded in 2003.

The Company pays interest to the Trust on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the
trust preferred securities at the rate of 11.6 per annum on their face amount of 105.4

19

million, or 12.6 million per annum in the aggregate. The Company receives investment income
on the trust common securities in the amount of 0.4 million per annum. The Trust distributes the
equivalent net amount to the holders of the trust preferred securities. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid interest net of investment income of 12.2 million on
the junior subordinated debentures, which is equivalent to the amounts distributed by the Trust on
the trust preferred securities.

The Company also pays interest to the Trust on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the
trust common securities at the rate of 11.6 per annum on their face amount of 3.3 million, or
 0.4 million per annum in the aggregate. The Trust distributes an equivalent amount to the Company
as a distribution on the underlying trust common securities. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company paid 0.4 million interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures, which is equivalent
to the amounts received by the Company as investment income.

The effective tax rates in 2004 and 2003
were 22.4 and (149.2) , respectively. The 2004
rate was impacted by the existence of large permanent items. The 2003 rate included a 3.9 million increase in the deferred tax
valuation allowance.
See Note 5, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the
three years ended December 31, 2005, for income taxes and disclosures related to 2004 and 2003
income tax events.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 13.9
million, primarily due to the net loss adjusted for non-cash charges of 32.5 million for
depreciation, amortization, dispositions of equipment, deferred taxes, PIK interest, and interest
on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock which were partially offset by cash related adjustments
of 18.6 million for routine operating activities represented by changes in inventories, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other assets.
The 2005 increase in accounts receivable of 4.1 million is primarily the result of sales growth.
The inventory increase of 11.3 million in 2005 can be attributed to the
growth in sales as well as inventory builds at the end of the year for anticipated roll outs of new
customer programs scheduled for the first quarter of 2006. Accounts payable was 3.5 million lower at the end
of 2005 as the Company elected to take advantage
of cash discounts from vendors.

Net cash used for investing activities was 15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Capital expenditures for the year totaled 15.2 million, consisting of 7.2 million for key
duplicating machines, 2.3 million for engraving machines, 1.5 million for Cincinnati office
expansion and 4.2 million for equipment purchases.

Net cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 1.7 million,
primarily related to principal payments on the senior term loan.

Management believes projected cash flows from operations and revolver availability will be
sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months.

The Company s working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) position of 104.4 million
as of December 31, 2005, represents an increase of 16.7 million from the December 31, 2004 level
of 87.7 million as follows:

 Interest payments for the long term senior term loans and the long term unsecured subordinated notes. Interest payments on
the variable rate long term senior term loans were calculated at the LIBOR rate plus margin of 7.6875 in effect as of December 31, 2005.

All of the obligations noted above are reflected on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2005, except for the Interest Payments and Operating Leases. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2005 for additional information.

The Company has a purchase agreement with its supplier of key blanks which requires minimum
purchases of 100 million key blanks per year. To the extent minimum purchases of key blanks are
below 100 million the Company must pay the suppliers .0035 per key multiplied by the shortfall. Since the
inception of the contract in 1998, the Company purchases of key blanks from the supplier have
exceeded 100 million. The purchase agreement expires on December 31, 2006.

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 34.8 million available under its secured credit
facilities. The Company had approximately 214.3 million of outstanding debt under its secured
credit facilities at December 31, 2005, consisting of 214.2 million in a term loan and 0.1
million in capitalized lease obligations. The term loan consisted of a 213.1 million Term B Loan
currently at a six (6) month LIBOR rate plus margin of 7.6875 , a 0.6 million Term B Loan
currently at a three (3) month LIBOR rate plus margin of 7.812 and a 0.5 million Term B loan at
the prime rate plus margin of 9.5 . The capitalized lease obligations were at various interest
rates.

Interest on the Subordinated Debt Issuance of 47.5 million which matures September 30, 2011 is at
a fixed rate of 13.5 per annum, with cash interest payments being required on a quarterly basis at
a fixed rate of 11.25 commencing April 15, 2004. The outstanding principal balance of the
Subordinated Debt Issuance shall be increased on a quarterly basis by the remaining 2.25 PIK
Amount. All of the PIK Amounts are due on the maturity date of the Subordinated Debt Issuance. As
of December 31, 2005, the outstanding Subordinated Debt Issuance including the PIK Amounts was
 49.2 million.

In accordance with the Company s Senior Credit Agreement, Hillman must maintain its fixed charge
coverage at all times in excess of 1.05x from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and 1.15x
thereafter to continue monthly distributions on its Trust Preferred Securities 1.0 million per
month). Hillman s fixed charge coverage was 1.38x for the twelve-month period ended December 31,
2005 as calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement.

The Company had deferred tax assets aggregating 39.2 million, net of valuation allowance of 15.6
million, and deferred tax liabilities of 69.6 million as of December 31, 2005, as determined in
accordance with SFAS 109. Management believes that the Company s net deferred tax assets will be
realized through the reversal of existing temporary differences between the financial statement and
tax basis, as well as through future taxable income.

21

Inflation 

The Company is sensitive to inflation present in the economies of the United States and our
foreign suppliers located primarily in Taiwan and China. Inflation in recent years has produced
only a modest impact on the Company s operations, however, the recent growth in China s economic
activity produced a spike in the cost of certain imported fastener products in the latter part of
2003 and 2004 increasing the cost of certain fasteners as much as 45 . Additionally, recent
increases in the cost of diesel fuel have contributed to transportation rate increases. Continued
inflation and resulting cost increases over a period of years would result in significant increases
in inventory costs and operating expenses. Such higher cost of sales and operating expenses can
generally be offset by increases in selling prices, although the ability of the Company s operating
divisions to raise prices is dependent on competitive market conditions. The Company was able to recover most of the 2003 and 2004
fastener cost increases by raising prices to its customers.

Related Party Transactions 

On September 26, 2001, the Company was acquired by Allied Capital pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 18, 2001. In connection with this
Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company was obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of
Allied Capital for management services rendered in the amount of 1.8 million per year, plus out of
pocket expenses, for calendar years subsequent to 2001. The Company has recorded a management fee
charge of 0.5 million, and 1.8 million on the Predecessor s Statement of Operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003. Payment of management fees was
due annually after delivery of the Company s annual audited financial statements to the Board of
Directors of the Company. The obligation to pay management fees to Allied Capital was terminated
upon the payment of outstanding fees in the amount of 2.3 million on March 31, 2004 in connection
with the close of the Merger Transaction.

On March 31, 2004, the Company was acquired by an affiliate of CHS. In connection with the CHS
acquisition, the Company is obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of CHS in the amount
of 58 thousand per month and to pay transaction fees to a subsidiary of OTPP in the amount of 26
thousand per month, plus out of pocket expenses, for each month commencing with the closing date of
the Merger Transaction. The Company has recorded management and transaction charges and expenses
from CHS and OTPP of 1.0 million and 0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
nine month period ended December 31, 2004.

The Predecessor Company incurred interest expense to Allied Capital on the unsecured subordinated
note at a fixed rate of 18.0 per annum. Cash interest payments were required on a quarterly basis
at a fixed rate of 13.5 with the remaining 4.5 fixed rate (the PIK Amount being added to the
principal balance. The subordinated debt and accrued interest thereon of 45.6 million were paid
in full at March 31, 2004 in connection with the Merger Transaction. See discussion above and in
Note 8, Long-Term Debt, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their
effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates
requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such
differences may be material to the Company s consolidated financial statements and results of
operations.

The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company s consolidated
financial statements include estimates associated with its evaluation of the recoverability of
goodwill as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to insurance programs,
litigation, and taxation. The Company s purchase price allocation methodology requires estimates
of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, significant estimates
form the basis for the Company s reserves with respect to

22

sales and returns allowances,
collectibility of accounts receivable, inventory valuations, deferred tax assets, and certain
benefits provided to current employees. Various
assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The
process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such
as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions and product mix. The Company
re-evaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.
Specific factors are as follows: recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets are subject to
annual impairment testing; purchase price allocation adjustments are based on changes in
settlements of liabilities and assets realized; litigation is based on projections provided by
legal counsel; deferred taxes are based on the Company s projections of future taxable income;
sales and returns and allowances are based on historical activity and customer contracts; accounts
receivable reserves are based on doubtful accounts and aging of outstanding balances; inventory
reserves are based on expected obsolescence and excess inventory levels; and employee benefits are
based on benefit plan requirements and severance agreements. Historically, actual results have not
significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above. The dollar
amounts below are presented in thousands.

Revenue Recognition : 

Revenue is recognized when products are shipped or delivered to customers depending upon when title
and risks of ownership have passed.

The Company offers a variety of sales incentives to its customers primarily in the form of
discounts, rebates and slotting fees. Discounts are recognized in the financial statements at the
date of the related sale. Rebates are estimated based on the anticipated rebate to be paid and a
portion of the estimated cost of the rebate is allocated to each underlying sales transaction.
Slotting fees are used on an infrequent basis and are not considered to be significant. Discounts,
rebates and slotting fees are included in the determination of net sales.

The Company also establishes reserves for customer returns and allowances. The reserve is
established based on historical rates of returns and allowances. The reserve is adjusted quarterly
based on actual experience. Returns and allowances are included in the determination of net sales.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts :

The Company establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification
method and also provides a reserve in the aggregate. The estimates for calculating the aggregate
reserve are based on historical information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was 434 and 526
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Inventory Realization :

Inventories consisting predominantly of finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or market,
cost being determined principally on the weighted average cost method. Excess and obsolete
inventories are carried at net realizable value. The historical usage rate is the primary factor
used by the Company in assessing the net realizable value of excess and obsolete inventory. A
reduction in the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to market is recorded for inventory
with no usage in the preceding twenty-four month period or with on hand quantities in excess of
twenty-four months average usage. The inventory reserve amounts were 3,948 and 3,558 at December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Property and Equipment :

Property and equipment, including assets acquired under capital leases, are carried at cost and
include expenditures for new facilities and major renewals. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss
is reflected in income from operations.

23

Depreciation :

For financial accounting purposes, depreciation, including that related to plant and equipment
acquired under capital leases, is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, generally three to ten years, or over the terms of the related leases.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets :

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangibles with
indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. If
impairment is indicated a write-down to fair value is recorded. Other intangible assets arising
principally from the Merger Transaction are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from four to twenty-three years. Trademarks are not amortized due to their indefinite useful lives.

Long-Lived Assets :

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, the Company has evaluated its long-lived assets for financial impairment and will continue
to evaluate them based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows as events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.

Investments: 

All of the Company s investments are in marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale securities which are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses,
net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income.

Income Taxes :

Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) and are measured using
the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided for tax benefits where it is more likely than not that certain
tax benefits will not be realized. Adjustments to valuation allowances are recorded from changes
in utilization of the tax related item.

Self-insurance Reserves :

The Company self insures its product liability, worker s compensation and general liability losses
up to 250 thousand per occurrence. Catastrophic coverage is maintained for occurrences in excess
of 250 thousand up to 35 million.

The Company self insures its group health claims up to an annual stop loss limit of 150 thousand
per participant. Aggregate coverage is maintained for annual group health insurance claims in
excess of 125 of expected claims.

Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based on an analysis of historical
insurance claim data and certain actuarial assumptions.

Retirement Benefits :

Certain employees of the Company are covered under a profit-sharing and retirement savings plan defined contribution plan ). See Note 14, Retirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

24

Shipping and Handling : 

The costs incurred to ship product to customers, including freight and handling expenses, are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company s Statements of Operations.
The Predecessor Company s shipping and handling costs were 3,629 and 15,916 for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The Successor Company s
shipping and handling costs were 18,615 and 12,790 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively.

Research and Development :

The Company incurs research and development costs consisting primarily of internal wages and
benefits in connection with improvements to the key duplicating and engraving machines. The
Predecessor Company s research and development costs were 277 and 1,381, for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The Successor Company s
research and development costs were 1,058 and 796 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively.

Stock Based Compensation :

For options granted under the 2004 stock option plan, the Company applies the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25 ), and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based employee
compensation plans. The Company is also subject to disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS 123 ). Had compensation cost for the plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the fair value method of SFAS
123, the effect on the Company s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been
approximately 6. There would have been no compensation charge for the periods ended December 31,
2004, March 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.

Using fair value method of SFAS 123, the fair value of the options granted in fiscal 2005 was 33.
The fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield equaling 0 , risk-free interest
rate of 3.8 , expected volatility assumed to be 34 , and expected life of 6 years. See Note 13,
Stock Based Compensation, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments : 

Cash, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and bank
revolving credit are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value due to
short-term maturity or revolving nature of these instruments.

Translation of Foreign Currencies : 

The translation of the Company s Canadian and Mexican foreign currency based financial statements
into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate during the
period. The exchange rates represent the noon buying rates reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Please reference Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements :

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to
prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable
to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No.
154 requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the
direct effects of the change, and that indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such
as a change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, be
recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in
depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and error corrections made in
fiscal years beginning after the date the statement was issued. The Company is required to adopt
the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning January 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets- an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29. The statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result
of the exchange. The statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and
adoption is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial
position.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151 ). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. This statement requires that these items be
expensed as incurred and not included in overhead.

26

In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation
of fixed production overhead to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005 and adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s results of operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 123(R),
 Share-Based Payment SFAS 123(R) ). This statement revises Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 ), and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) will require compensation
costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements
(with limited exceptions). The amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the
grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Compensation cost will be
recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. On March
29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 SAB No. 107 ), which provides
supplemental guidance in adopting SFAS 123(R). Pursuant to the SEC guidance in SAB No. 107, the
Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application without restating prior periods, which
requires the recognition of compensation expense for all stock options and other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable on and after
January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) is not expected to have
a material effect on the Company s result of operations or financial position.

Forward Looking Statements 

Certain disclosures related to acquisitions and divestitures, refinancing, capital
expenditures, resolution of pending litigation and realization of deferred tax assets contained in
this annual report involve substantial risks and uncertainties and may constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, 
 could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, project or
the negative of such terms or other similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on management s
current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events. Although management
believes that the expectations, assumptions and projections on which these forward-looking
statements are based are reasonable, they nonetheless could prove to be inaccurate, and as a
result, the forward-looking statements based on those expectations, assumptions and projections
also could be inaccurate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance. Instead, forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that may cause the Company s strategy, planning, actual results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any strategy,
planning, future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those currently
anticipated as a result of a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties discussed
under captions Risk Factors set forth in Item 1 of this annual report. Given these
uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any
such forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this annual report;
they should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other individual. We
undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this annual report might not occur or be
materially different from those discussed.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as borrowings under the Senior
Credit Agreement bear interest at variable interest rates. It is the Company s policy to enter
into interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet objectives. On
April 28, 2004, the Company entered into an Interest Rate Swap Agreement Swap with a two-year
term for a notional amount of 50 million. The Swap fixes the interest rate on 50 million of the
Term Loan at a rate of 1.17 plus the applicable interest rate margin for the first three months of
the Swap with incremental increases ranging from 28 to 47 basis points in each successive quarter.
Based on Hillman s exposure to variable rate borrowings at December 31, 2005, a one percent (1 change in the weighted average interest rate for a period of one year would change the annual
interest expense by approximately 1.6 million.

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate changes of the Canadian and Mexican currencies as
it impacts the 2.7 million net asset value of its Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries as of December
31, 2005. Management considers the Company s exposure to foreign currency translation gains or
losses to be minimal.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(dollars in thousands)

with the Company surviving the merger Merger Transaction ). The total consideration paid in the
Merger Transaction was 511,646 including repayment of outstanding debt and including the value of
the Company s outstanding Trust Preferred Securities 102,395 at merger).

Prior to the merger, Allied Capital Corporation Allied Capital owned 96.8 of the Company s

Company s voting common stock.

The Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet and its related Consolidated Statements of Operations,
Cash Flows and Changes in Stockholders Equity for the periods presented prior to the March 31,
2004 Merger Transaction are referenced herein as the predecessor financial statements (the
 Predecessor or Predecessor Financial Statements ). The Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and its related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Cash Flows and
Changes in Stockholders Equity for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended
December 31, 2004 are referenced herein as the successor financial statements (the Successor or
 Successor Financial Statements ). The accompanying Successor Financial Statements reflect the
allocation of the aggregate purchase price of 511,646, including the value of the Company s Trust
Preferred Securities, to the assets and liabilities of Hillman based on fair values at the date of
the merger in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141,
 Business Combinations. The following table reconciles the fair value of the acquired assets and
assumed liabilities to the total purchase price:

1. Basis of Presentation (continued): 

The purchase price includes transaction related costs aggregating 2,171 which were associated
with CHS s purchase of the Company. The purchase price
allocation reflects an 806 reduction in
goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2005. The goodwill reduction is the result of a decrease
in the expected liability for a lease abandonment of 570, adjustments to deferred taxes primarily
from the initial recognition of valuation allowances of 318 offset by other miscellaneous items of
 82.

The following table indicates the pro forma financial statements of the Company for the years ended
December 31, 2004 (including non-recurring charges of 30,707 as discussed in Note 15,
Non-Recurring Expense) and 2003. The pro forma financial statements give effect to the Merger
Transaction and subsequent refinancing as if they had occurred on January 1, 2003:

Net sales

351,564 

317,671 

Net loss

The pro forma results are based on assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that
would have occurred if the acquisition had been effective January 1, 2003, nor are they intended to
be indicative of results that may occur in the future. The underlying pro forma information
includes the historical financial results of the Company, the Company s financing arrangements, and
certain purchase accounting adjustments.

Nature of Operations: 

The Company is one of the largest providers of value-added merchandising services and
hardware-related products to retail markets in North America through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
The Hillman Group, Inc. (the Hillman Group ). A subsidiary of the Hillman Group operates in
Canada under the name The Hillman Group Canada, Ltd. and another in Mexico under the name Sunsource
Integrated Services de Mexico SA de CV. The Hillman Group provides merchandising services and products such
as fasteners and related hardware items, key duplication equipment, keys and related accessories,
and identification equipment and items to retail outlets, primarily hardware stores, home centers
and mass merchants. The Company has approximately 21,500 customers, the largest three of which
accounted for 38.8 of net sales in 2005. The average single sale in 2005 was less than six
hundred dollars.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 

Cash Equivalents : 

Cash equivalents consist of commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations and other liquid securities
purchased with initial maturities less than 90 days and are stated at cost which approximates
market value.

Investments: 

All of the Company s investments are in marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale securities which are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses,
net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income.

THE HILLMAN COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(dollars in thousands) 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued): 

Restricted Investments : 

Restricted investments, which are carried at market value, represent assets held in a Rabbi Trust
to fund deferred compensation liabilities due to the Company s employees. See Note 10, Deferred
Compensation Plans.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts :

The Company establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification
method and also provides a reserve in the aggregate. The estimates for calculating the aggregate
reserve are based on historical information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was 434 and 526
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Inventories : 

Inventories consisting predominantly of finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or market,
cost being determined principally on the weighted average cost method. Excess and obsolete
inventories are carried at net realizable value. The historical usage rate is the primary factor
used by the Company in assessing the net realizable value of excess and obsolete inventory. A
reduction in the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to market is recorded for inventory
with no usage in the preceding twenty-four month period or with on hand quantities in excess of
twenty-four months average usage. The inventory reserve amounts were 3,948 and 3,558 at December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Property and Equipment : 

Property and equipment, including assets acquired under capital leases, are carried at cost and
include expenditures for new facilities and major renewals. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their
respective accounts when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of and the resulting gain or loss is
reflected in current operations.

Depreciation : 

For financial accounting purposes, depreciation, including that related to plant and equipment
acquired under capital leases, is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, generally three to ten years or over the terms of the related leases.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets : 

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangibles with
indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. If
impairment is indicated a write-down to fair value is recorded. Other intangible assets arising
principally from the Merger Transaction are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from four to twenty-three years. Trademarks are not amortized due to their indefinite useful lives.

Long-Lived Assets : 

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, the Company has evaluated its long-lived assets for financial impairment and

39

THE HILLMAN COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(dollars in thousands) 

2. 
 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued): 

will continue to evaluate them based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows as events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully
recoverable.

Income Taxes : 

Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) 
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided for tax benefits where it is more
likely than not that certain tax benefits will not be realized. Adjustments to valuation
allowances are recorded from changes in utilization of the tax related item. See Note 5, Income
Taxes.

Retirement Benefits : 

Certain employees of the Company are covered under a profit-sharing and retirement savings plan defined contribution plan ). See Note 14, Retirement Benefits.

Revenue Recognition : 

Revenue is recognized when products are shipped or delivered to customers depending upon when title
and risks of ownership have passed.

The Company offers a variety of sales incentives to its customers primarily in the form of
discounts and rebates. Discounts are recognized in the financial statements at the date of the
related sale. Rebates are estimated based on the anticipated rebate to be paid and a portion of
the estimated cost of the rebate is allocated to each underlying sales transaction. Rebates and
discounts are included in the determination of net sales.

The Company also establishes reserves for customer returns and allowances. The reserve is
established based on historical rates of returns and allowances. The reserve is adjusted quarterly
based on actual experience. Returns and allowances are included in the determination of net sales.

Shipping and Handling : 

The costs incurred to ship product to customers, including freight and handling expenses, are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company s Statements of Operations.
The Predecessor Company s shipping and handling costs were 3,629 and 15,916 for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The Successor Company s
shipping and handling costs were 18,615 and 12,790 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively.

Research and Development :

The Company incurs research and development costs consisting primarily of internal wages and
benefits in connection with improvements to the key duplicating and engraving machines. The
Predecessor Company s research and development costs were 277 and 1,381, for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The Successor Company s
research and development costs were 1,058 and 796 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the
nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued): 

Stock Based Compensation :

For options granted under the 2004 Stock Option Plan, the Company applies the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25 ), and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based employee
compensation plans. The Company is also subject to disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS 123 ). Had compensation cost for the plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the fair value method of SFAS
No. 123, the effect on the Company s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been
approximately 6. There would have been no compensation charge for the periods ended December 31,
2004, March 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.

Using fair value method of SFAS 123, the fair value of the options granted in fiscal 2005 was 33.
The fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield equaling 0 , risk-free interest
rate of 3.8 , expected volatility assumed to be 34 , and expected life of 6 years. See also Note
13, Stock Based Compensation.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments : 

Cash, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and bank
revolving credit are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value due to the
short-term maturity or revolving nature of these instruments. The fair values of the Company s
debt instruments are disclosed in Note 8, Long-Term Debt. The fair value of the Trust Preferred
Securities is disclosed in Note 11, Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in the Company s
Junior Subordinated Debentures.

Translation of Foreign Currencies : 

The translation of the Company s Canadian and Mexican foreign currency based financial statements
into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate during the
period. The exchange rates represent the noon buying rates reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued): 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting
period. Actual results may differ from estimates.

Reclassification: 

Certain
amounts in the 2004 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to
prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable
to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No.
154 requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the
direct effects of the change, and that indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such
as a change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, be
recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in
depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and error corrections made in
fiscal years beginning after the date the statement was issued. The Company is required to adopt
the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in January 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets- an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29. The statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result
of the exchange. The statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and
adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or
financial position.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151 ). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. This statement requires that these items be
expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation
of fixed production overhead to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005 and adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s results of operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 123(R),
 Share-Based Payment SFAS 123(R) ). This statement revises Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 ), and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) will require compensation
costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements
(with limited exceptions). The amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the
grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an
employee provides service in exchange for the award. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued): 

Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 SAB No. 107 ), which provides supplemental guidance in
adopting SFAS 123(R). Pursuant to the SEC guidance in SAB No. 107, the Company will adopt the
provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2006.

The
Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective
application without restating prior periods, which requires the
recognition of compensation expense for all stock options and equity
based awards that vest or become exercisable on and after January 1,
2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company s results of operations or financial
position.

 Related Party Transactions 

On September 26, 2001, the Company was acquired by Allied Capital pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 18, 2001. In connection with the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company was obligated to pay management fees to a subsidiary of
Allied Capital for management services rendered in the amount of 1,800 per year, plus out of
pocket expenses, for calendar years subsequent to 2001. The Company has recorded a management fee
charge of 524 and 1,800 on the Predecessor s Statement of Operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. Payment of management fees was
due annually after delivery of the Company s annual audited financial statements to the Board of
Directors of the Company. The obligation to pay management fees to Allied Capital was terminated
upon the payment of outstanding fees in the amount of 2,324 on March 31, 2004 in connection with
the close of the Merger Transaction.

On March 31, 2004, the Company was acquired by an affiliate of CHS. In connection with the CHS

Transaction. The Company has recorded management and transaction fee charges and expenses from CHS
and OTPP of 1,045 and 805 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the nine month period ended

The Predecessor Company incurred interest expense to Allied Capital on the unsecured subordinated
debt at a fixed rate of 18.0 per annum. Cash interest payments were required on a quarterly basis
at a fixed rate of 13.5 with the remaining 4.5 fixed rate (the PIK Amount being added to the
principal balance. The subordinated debt and accrued interest thereon of 45,571 were paid in full
at March 31, 2004 in connection with the Merger Transaction. See discussion above and Note 8,
Long-Term Debt, for additional details.

The Company has U.S. federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards for tax purposes,
totaling 69,258 as of December 31, 2005, that are available to offset future taxable income.
These carryforwards expire from 2019 to 2024. Limitations on
utilization, primarily as a result of Internal Revenue Service
Code Section 382 change in control provisions, may apply to
approximately 44,890 of these loss carryforwards. Management believes that these losses will be
fully utilized prior to the expiration date. No valuation allowance has been provided against the
federal NOL. In addition the Company s foreign subsidiaries have NOL carryforwards aggregating
 1,344 which expire from 2009 to 2014. A valuation allowance of 470 has been established for the
foreign NOL carryforwards.

The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards with an aggregate tax benefit of 3,469
which expire from 2006 to 2024. A valuation allowance of 504 has been established for these
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards decreased
by 292 in 2005 primarily as a result of the expiration of the related state net operating losses
and other adjustments.

The Company has federal unused capital losses totaling 37,090 as of December 31, 2005 that are
available to offset future capital gains. These carryforwards expire in 2006. A valuation
allowance of 12,784 has been established for these deferred tax assets. The Company also has 283
of general business tax credits which expire from 2009 to 2021. A valuation allowance of 283 has
been established for these tax credits.

In the three month period ended March 31, 2004, a deferred tax asset was recorded for costs
incurred in connection with the Merger Transaction. The Company has established a valuation
allowance of 1,591 for the entire amount of the deferred tax asset related to the Merger
transaction costs.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes.

The valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 was 15,632 of which 15,394 was established at
the Merger Transaction date. Therefore, initial recognition of a tax benefit by a future reduction
in 15,394 of the December 31, 2005 valuation allowance will reduce goodwill related to the Merger
Transaction.

Reductions in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2003, the three months ended
March 31, 2004, the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2005 of
 708, 150, 366 and 368, respectively, were recorded as a reduction to goodwill resulting from
the initial recognition of the tax benefits from release of valuation allowances established in
purchase accounting. Foreign tax benefits in the three months ended March 31, 2004, the nine
months ended December 31, 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2005 were fully offset by charges to the valuation allowance of 35, 105, and 96,
respectively.

Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income
prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of net deferred tax
assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future
taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.

revolving credit and senior term loans with a Senior Credit Agreement (the Senior Credit
Agreement consisting of a 40,000 revolving credit (the Revolver and a 217,500 Term B Loan
(the Term Loan collateralized by the Company s cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and fixed
assets. The Senior Credit Agreement has a seven-year term and provides borrowings at interest
rates based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rates (the LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.25 and
3.00 (the LIBOR Margin ), or prime (the Base Rate plus a margin of between 1.25 and 2.0 (the
 Base Rate Margin ). The applicable LIBOR Margin and Base Rate Margin is based on the Company s
leverage at the date of the preceding fiscal quarter. In accordance with the Senior Credit
Agreement, letter of credit commitment fees are based on the average daily face amount of each
outstanding letter of credit multiplied by a letter of credit margin of between 2.25 and 3.00 per
annum the Letter of Credit Margin .) The Letter of Credit Margin is also based on the Company s
leverage at the date of the preceding fiscal quarter. The Company also pays a Commitment fee of
0.50 per annum on the average daily unused Revolver balance.

The Senior Credit Agreement, among other provisions, contains financial covenants requiring the
maintenance of specific leverage and interest coverage ratios and levels of financial position,
restricts the incurrence of additional debt and the sale of assets,
and permits acquisitions with the consent of the lenders.
Additionally, the Senior Credit Agreement restricts the Company or any
of its subsidiaries from paying dividends. Dividends to officers and
directors are allowed under certain circumstances up to a limit of 2
million per year. The Company was in compliance with all provisions of
the Senior Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2005.

of 214,336 under its secured credit facilities at December 31, 2005, consisting of a 214,237 Term
B loan and 99 in capitalized lease obligations. The term loan consisted of a 213,150 Term B Loan
currently at a six (6) month LIBOR rate of 7.6875 , a 543.7 Term B Loan currently at a three (3)
month LIBOR rate of 7.812 and a 543.7 Term B loan at the of 9.5 . The capitalized lease
obligations were at various interest rates.

As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt approximates the
recorded value as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 107, Disclosure about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments. The Company discounted the future cash flows of its senior and
subordinated debt based on borrowing rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The fair value estimate is made at a specific point in time, is subjective in nature, and involves
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimate.

Junior Subordinated Debentures (continued): 

In
connection with the public offering of TOPrS, the Trust issued 3,261 of trust common

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS 150 ), the TOPrS
constitute mandatorily redeemable financial instruments. The Company guarantees the obligations of
the Trust on the Trust Preferred Securities. Upon adoption of SFAS 150 on January 1, 2004, the
guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in the Company s Junior Subordinated Debentures have been
reclassified prospectively from the mezzanine section to the long-term liabilities section of the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Items previously shown separately on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations as preferred security distributions of guaranteed preferred beneficial
interests are classified as interest expense for the year ended

securities. The Company is amortizing the premium on the Junior Subordinated Debentures of 9,279

 Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in the Company s
Junior Subordinated Debentures (continued): 

At December 31, 2005, the recorded value of the Junior Subordinated Debentures, net of premium
amortization, was 117,295. The fair value of the Junior Subordinated Debentures on December 31,
2005 was 125,153 based on the 28.90 per share closing price of the underlying Trust Preferred
Securities as quoted on the American Stock Exchange plus the liquidation value of the trust common
securities.

 Common and Preferred Stock: 

Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger Transaction: 

There are 23,141 authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, 6,212.9 of which are issued and
outstanding. Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote. Each holder of
Class A Common Stock is entitled at any time to convert any or all of the shares into an equal
number of shares of Class C Common Stock.

There are 2,500 authorized shares of Class B Common Stock, 1,000 of which are issued and
outstanding. Holders of Class B Common Stock have no voting rights. The Class B Common Stock was
issued to certain members of the Company s management and is subject to vesting over five years
with 20 vesting on each anniversary of the Merger Transaction.

In connection with the Merger Transaction, certain members of management entered into an Executive
Securities Agreement ESA ). The ESA provides for the method and terms under which management
proceeds were invested in the Company. Under the terms of the ESA, management shareholders have
the right to put their Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock back to the Company at fair
market value if employment is terminated for other than cause. If terminated for cause, the
management shareholders can generally put the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock back to
the Company for the lower of the fair market value or cost. The SEC s Accounting Series Release
No. 268, Presentation in Financial Statements of Redeemable Preferred Stock, requires certain
securities whose redemption is not in the control of the issuer to be classified outside of
permanent equity. The put feature embedded in management s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock allows redemption at the holder s option under certain circumstances. Accordingly,
management s 407.6 Class A Common Stock shares and 1,000 Class B Common Stock shares have been
classified between liabilities and stockholder s equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The repurchase feature of the Class B Common Stock triggers variable accounting treatment under
FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting For Certain
Transactions involving Stock Compensation an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 FIN 44 ). Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the
Class B Common Stock are recorded as a charge to compensation expense over the five year vesting
period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, 311 of
compensation expense was recorded in selling, general and
administrative expense in the
accompanying Statement of Operations.

There are 30,109 authorized shares of Class C Common Stock, 2,787.1 of which are issued and
outstanding. Each share of Class C Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote, provided that the
aggregate voting power of Class C Common Stock (with respect to the election of directors) never
exceeds 30 . Each holder of Class C Common Stock is entitled at any time to convert any or all of
the shares into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock.

Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Merger Transaction: 

The Company has 238,889 authorized shares of Class A Preferred Stock, 82,104.8 of which are issued
and outstanding and 13,450.7 of which are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options to
purchase shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Holders of Class A Preferred Stock

accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. The liquidation value of the Class A Preferred Stock is
 82,104.8 at December 31, 2005. Cumulative dividends in arrears at December 31, 2005 were 18,057.

Preferred Stock, 57,282.4 of which are issued and outstanding and 9,384.2 of which are reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Holders of
Class A Preferred Stock are not entitled to any voting rights. Holders of Class A Preferred Stock
are entitled to preferential dividends that shall accrue on a daily basis at the rate of 11.0 per

plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon.

The Hillman Investment Company Class A Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable on March 31, 2028
and in accordance with SFAS 150 has been classified as debt in the accompanying December 31, 2004
Balance Sheet. Dividends on the mandatorily redeemable Class A Preferred Stock for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004 of 7,125 and 4,880, respectively
are included in interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

are restricted. Dividends to officers and directors are allowable under certain circumstances up
to a limit of 2 million per year.

converted into rights to receive options to purchase 3,895.16 shares of Hillman Companies, Inc.
Class A Preferred Stock and 2,717.55 shares of Hillman Investment Company Class A Preferred Stock
(collectively the Purchased Options ). The Purchased Options have a weighted average strike price
of 170.69 per share. The fair value of the Hillman Investment Company Class A Preferred Stock
options have been included with the underlying security in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. SFAS 150 requires security instruments with a redemption date that is certain to occur to
be classified as liabilities. The Hillman Companies, Inc. Class A Preferred Stock options, which
have a March 31, 2028 expiration date, have been classified at their fair market value in the
liability section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent the Company pays
a dividend to holders of the Class A Preferred Stock and the Hillman Investment Company Class A
Preferred Stock, the Purchased Option Holder will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the
dividend which would have been paid if the

SFAS 150 requires the initial and subsequent valuations of the Purchased Options be measured at
fair value with the change in fair value recognized as interest expense. For the year ended
December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004 interest expense of 847 and 578 has
been recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The remaining 1998 Incentive Plan Options and 2001 Incentive Plan Options were cancelled and
converted into rights to receive a pro rata share of the merger consideration. The 1998 Incentive
Plan and the 2001 Incentive Plan were then terminated.

On March 31, 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan Common Option Plan following
Board and shareholder approval. Grants under the Common Option Plan will consist of non-qualified
stock options for the purchase of Class B Common Shares. The number of Class B Common Shares

otherwise consented to by the Board, the aggregate number of Class B Common Shares for which
options may be granted under the Common Option Plan cannot exceed 51.28 in any one calendar year.

The Common Option Plan is administered by a Committee of the Board. The Committee determines the
term of each option, provided that the exercise period may not exceed ten years from date of grant.

recognized to the extent the market value of the underlying security on the measurement date
exceeds the cost to the employee. The market value on the Preferred Options increases by the
amount of dividends accrued on the underlying Preferred Stock. Compensation expense will be
recognized over the five-year vesting period in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an
interpretation of APB Opinions No. 15 and 25 FIN 28 ). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a
compensation charge of 1,290 and 272 in selling, general and
administration expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively.

pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS
133 as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities. As amended, SFAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and
recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the
derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.

On April 28, 2004, the Company entered into an Interest Rate Swap Agreement Swap with a
two-year term for a notional amount of 50,000. The Swap fixes the interest rate on 50,000 of the

 Derivatives and Hedging (continued): 

for the first three months of the Swap with incremental increases ranging from 28 to 47 basis
points in each successive quarter.

The Swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge and the fair value at December 31, 2005 was 91,
net of 60 in tax expense. The Swap is reported on the consolidated balance sheet in other current
assets. The related deferred gain on the swap agreements of 91 has been deferred in shareholders 
equity as a component of other comprehensive income. This deferred gain is then recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which the related interest payments being
hedged are recorded in interest expense.

17. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies: 

The Company self insures its product liability, worker s compensation and general liability
losses up to 250 per occurrence. Catastrophic coverage is maintained for occurrences in excess of

aggregating 4,967 related to its product liability, workers compensation and general liability
coverage.

The Company self insures its group health claims up to an annual stop loss limit of 150 per
participant. Aggregate coverage is maintained for annual group health insurance claims in excess
of 125 of expected claims.

Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based on an analysis of historical
insurance claim data and certain actuarial assumptions.

Legal proceedings are pending which are either in the ordinary course of business or incidental to
the Company s business. Those legal proceedings incidental to the business of the Company are
generally not covered by insurance or other indemnity. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
resolution of the pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows of the Company.

18. 
 
 Write-down of Note Receivable: 

On April 13, 2002, the Company entered into a Unit Repurchase Agreement with GC-Sun Holdings,
L.P. G-C ), pursuant to which G-C exercised its call right under the G-C partnership agreement to
purchase the Company s interest in G-C. In exchange for its interest in G-C, the Company received
a 10,000 subordinated note from G-C. Interest on the note was payable quarterly at a rate of 18 
from May 1, 2002 to April 30, 2003, 17 from May 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004, and 16 thereafter.
G-C s payment of interest on the note was subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the
subordinated note agreement. If such restrictions do not permit the current payment of interest in
cash when due, accrued interest is added to the principal.

In February 2003, G-C sold the assets of its largest operating division, Kar Products. The proceeds
of the sale were primarily used to pay down G-C s senior creditors. Following the sale of Kar
Products, the Company estimated the enterprise value of G-C based on the cash flows and book value
of the remaining operating division. The excess of the estimated enterprise value less debt
obligations senior to the G-C note were determined to be insufficient to support the value of the
G-C note. Accordingly, the Company recorded a 11,258 charge to income for the year ended December
31, 2003 to write-down the face value of the note and accrued interest thereon. The G-C note was
distributed to the Company s shareholders on March 31, 2004.

 Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s March 31, 2005 unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, the Company concluded that certain of its accounting practices with respect
to revenue recognition and income taxes were not in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. 

The Company s standard freight terms are FOB shipping point and historically revenue was recognized upon shipment.
However, the Company arranges for the shipment of product, selects the carrier and maintains responsibility for lost or
damaged product. Accordingly, management has determined that the risk of loss is not fully transferred to the customer until
shipments are received by the customer which is generally within two days of product shipment. Therefore, the Company
concluded that revenue was not recognized in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements . For the three months ended March 31, 2005, net sales and gross margin as originally stated
of 87,742 and 48,561 were reduced by 142 and 62, respectively. The net loss of 2,209, as originally reported, increased
by 38 as a result of the revenue recognition adjustment 

The Company also reviewed its accounting for income taxes and determined that the income
tax accounts were not properly recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109 ), APB Opinion 28, Interim Financial Reporting, and FASB Interpretation No. 18,
 Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods . Historically, the Company calculated income taxes
in the interim periods on a discrete period basis by multiplying the statutory income tax rate by pretax earnings adjusted
for permanent book tax basis differences. APB Opinion 28, however, generally requires that an estimated annual
effective tax rate be used to determine interim period income tax provisions. For the three months ended
March 31, 2005, the net loss, as originally reported, decreased by 1,923 as a result of the interim tax reporting restatement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(dollars in thousands) 

21. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risks: 

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its
cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. Concentrations of
credit risk with respect to sales and trade receivables are limited due to the large number of
customers comprising the Company s customer base and their dispersion across geographic areas. The
Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally
does not require collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the largest three customers
accounted for 38.8 of sales and 44.8 of the year-end accounts receivable balance. No other
customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company s total sales in 2005.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to purchases and trade payables are limited due to the
large number of vendors comprising the Company s vendor base, with dispersion across different
industries and geographic areas. The Company s largest vendor in terms of annual purchases
accounted for 9.0 of the Company s total purchases and 6.3 of the Company s total trade payables
on December 31, 2005.

Item 9 
 
 Changes in and Disagreements on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure. 

There were no changes in or disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure during the
year ended December 31, 2005.

Item 9A Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company s management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Based upon that evaluation, which included the matters discussed below, the Company s chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report (December 31,
2005), in ensuring that material information relating to The Hillman Companies, Inc. required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below, the Company s management has concluded
that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report fairly present in all
material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ).

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. Although we have not yet been required to assess and
report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as a result of the
restatement described above, the Company concluded that the material weaknesses described below
existed as of December 31, 2005.

(1) The Company did not maintain effective controls over the timing of the recognition of revenue.
Specifically, revenue recognition determination was not reflective of contract terms related to
when title and risk of loss transferred to the customer in order to record revenue in accordance
with GAAP. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the
Company s 2002 consolidated financial statements, interim and
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2003, the three months ended March 31, 2004, the nine months ended December 31, 2004,
the three months ended March 31, 2005, as well as audit
adjustments to the 2005 consolidated financial statements affecting
revenue, cost of sales, deferred revenue and other current assets.

(2) The Company did not maintain effective controls over its accounting
for income and other taxes
required under GAAP. Specifically, the Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of
personnel within its tax accounting function with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience
and training in the application of GAAP related to income and other taxes. This control deficiency
contributed to the following:

Deferred income tax balances related to purchase business combinations were not
appropriately determined to ensure that deferred income tax liabilities and allocated
goodwill were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP; 

Quarterly income tax provisions were not appropriately determined utilizing an estimate
of the annual effective tax rate; 

The annual income tax provision was calculated using an inappropriate estimate of
federal and state statutory tax rates; 

Deferred tax balances were not accurate; 

The income tax provision did not appropriately reflect the tax effect of stock option
exercises in accordance with GAAP; 

Valuation allowances for state tax operating loss carryforwards were overstated based 

60

on loss carryforward periods and estimates of future state taxable income;

Changes in valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions established in
purchase business combinations were incorrectly charged to income tax expense instead of
goodwill; 

State income and franchise tax provisions and the related tax payable accounts were
incorrectly calculated; 

Certain book versus tax basis differences were based on estimates which were not updated
on a timely basis and certain temporary differences were incorrectly treated as permanent
items; and 

State franchise taxes were incorrectly included as a component of income tax expense
instead of operating expenses. 

This
control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the Company s
2002 consolidated financial statements, interim and annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2003, the three months ended March 31, 2004, the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the three months ended March 31, 2005 as well as
audit adjustments to the 2005 consolidated financial statements.

(3) The
Company did not maintain effective controls over its accounting for outstanding checks.
Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to properly reclassify outstanding
checks in excess of available deposits from cash to accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages
and the revolver and to properly report cash flows from operating and financing activities. This
control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the Company s
2002 consolidated financial statements, interim and annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2003, the three months ended March 31, 2004, the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, the three months ended March 31, 2005 as well as
audit adjustments to the 2005 consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, each of these control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of the
aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

Accordingly,
management has determined that each of the above control deficiencies represents a
material weakness.

Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

Management is in the process of remediating these material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting. In particular, we intend to:

Increase our training and resources in the income tax accounting area. 

Expand review procedures and controls related to unique and specialized transactions; 

Increase review procedures and controls related to income tax accounting; 

Increase review procedures and controls related to sales and marketing initiatives as well as sales
contracts and agreements; and 

Review the disclosure committee process and increase the
frequency of such meetings from quarterly to monthly. 

Management
will consider the design and operating effectiveness of these actions
and will make any changes management determines are appropriate.

61

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Prior year
Material Weakness. As of December 31, 2004, we did not maintain
effective controls over the accounting for stock compensation.
Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to
ensure that a stock compensation charge was recorded as additional
paid-in capital in stockholders equity rather than a liability
on the balance sheet. This control deficiency resulted in a
restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended March 31, 2004. The resulting error was identified prior to December 31, 2005 as a result of expanded controls and
procedures related to unique, non-recurring transactions. With the
implementation of expanded procedures and controls related to such
transactions, management concluded that the above referenced material
weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2005.

There have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Committees 

The Company is a controlled company within the meaning of the American Stock Exchange Amex listing standards because an affiliate of CHS owns more than 50 of the outstanding shares of the
Company s common voting stock. Accordingly, the Company is exempt from the requirements of the
Amex listing standards to maintain a majority of independent directors on the Company s board of
directors and to have a nominating committee and a compensation committee composed entirely of
independent directors.

The Company does not have a nominating committee, but it does have a compensation committee. The
board of directors believes that it is not necessary to utilize a nominating committee. Director
nominees for the Company are selected by the board of directors following receipt of
recommendations of potential candidates from the Chairman of the Board of the Company. The board
is not limited by the recommendation of the Chairman and may select other nominees. There is no
charter setting forth these procedures and the board of directors has no policy regarding the
consideration of any director candidates recommended by shareholders.

The current members of the audit committee are Peter Gotsch, Mark Dolfato and Shael J. Dolman. As
noted above the Company is a controlled company within the meaning of the Amex listing standards
and, therefore, no member of the audit committee is designated as an audit committee financial
expert. 

Code of Ethics 

The Company has adopted a code of ethics which applies to, among others, its senior officers,
including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as well as every employee of
the Company. The Company s code can be accessed via its website at http://www.hillmangroup.com.
The Company intends to disclose amendments to or waivers from a required provision of the code on
Form 8-K.

made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared; 

b) 
 
 evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and
