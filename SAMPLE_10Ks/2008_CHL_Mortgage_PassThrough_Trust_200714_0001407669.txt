Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
Countrywide Financial Corporation:

We have examined management's assessment, included in the Assessment of
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that Countrywide Financial
Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, including its direct and indirect
wholly owned subsidiaries, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (CHL), Countrywide Tax
Services Corporation, Newport Management Corporation, and Countrywide Home
Loans Servicing L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of CHL (collectively, the
Company), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for publicly issued
residential mortgage-backed securities (securities collateralized by
residential mortgage loans, including prime, alternative loan products,
subprime, HELOC, and closed seconds) issued on or after January 1, 2006 for
which the Company provides cash collection and administration, investor
remittances and reporting (except for those activities relating to trustee and
paying agent services), and pool asset administration (except for those
activities relating to custodial operations of pool assets and related
documents), collectively, "Servicing Functions", excluding any transactions
issued by any government sponsored enterprise for which the Company provides
Servicing Functions (the Platform), as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007. The Platform includes all servicing criteria set forth in Schedule A to
the Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria except for the
Inapplicable Servicing Criteria and portions of the criteria footnoted on that
schedule, which are inapplicable to the Company based on the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore,
our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report.
Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

KPMG LLP, a U.S. limited liability partnership, is the U.S.
 member firm of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007 is fairly stated in all material respects.

whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

KPMG LLP, a U.S. limited liability partnership, is the U.S.
 member firm of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2007 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
