ITEM 1 
 BUSINESS. 

General 
 
 Sears Oil and Gas Corporation SRSG ), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on October 18, 2005. At the time SRSG was organized its principal business objective was to take advantage of the many and varied opportunities presented within the oil and gas industry. SRSG intended to exploit multiple revenue streams throughout the natural resources industry, including oil, gas and mining areas. However, after various failed efforts, the principals sold controlling interest in the Company. The Company now seeks another company with which to merge or acquire for stock. SRSG has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, SRSG has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. SRSG has no subsidiaries. Our fiscal year end is December 31st. 
 
 Description of Business 
 
 The Company intends to continue to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in a business opportunity. Management has not established any firm criteria with respect to the type of business with which the Company desires to become involved and will consider participating in a business enterprise in a variety of different industries or areas with no limitation as to the geographical location of the enterprise. The Company s management will have unrestricted discretion in reviewing, analyzing, and ultimately selecting a business enterprise for acquisition or participation by the Company. It is anticipated that any enterprise ultimately selected will be selected by management based on its analysis and evaluation of the business and financial condition of the enterprise, as well as its business plan, potential for growth, and other factors, none of which can be anticipated to be controlling. If the Company is able to locate a suitable business enterprise, the decision to acquire or participate in the enterprise may be made by the Company s board of directors without stockholder approval. Approval may also be obtained pursuant to the consent of a majority of the Company s stockholders and, since the principal stockholders of the Company own approximately 96 of the Company s outstanding shares, they would be able to approve any transaction with the affirmative vote of a limited number of additional shares. Further, it is anticipated that the acquisition of or participation in an enterprise may involve the issuance by the Company of a controlling interest in the Company, which would dilute the respective equity interests of the Company s stockholders and may also result in a reduction of the Company s net tangible asset value per share. 
 
 The activities of the Company will continue to be subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the Company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will, in all probability, act without the consent, vote, or approval of the Company s stockholders. The risks faced by the Company are further increased as a result of its limited resources and its inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with additional capital. (See Item 1A.Risk Factors. 
 
 Although management believes that it is in the best interest of the Company to acquire or participate in a business enterprise, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to locate a business enterprise which management believes is suitable for acquisition or participation by the Company or that if an enterprise is located, it can be acquired on terms acceptable to the Company. Similarly, there can be no assurance 

4 
 4 
 4 

that if any business opportunity is acquired, it will perform in accordance with management s expectations or result in any profit to the Company or appreciation in the market price for the Company s shares. 
 
 If business opportunities become available, the selection of an opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky and may be made on management s analysis of the quality of the other company s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. 
 
 It is anticipated that business opportunities may be introduced to the Company from a variety of sources, including its sole officer and director, and his business and social contacts, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the franchise community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. 
 
 The Company will not restrict its search to any particular business, industry, or geographical location. The Company may enter into a business or opportunity involving a start-up or new company or an established business. It is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged. 
 
 The period within which the Company may participate in a business opportunity cannot be predicted and will depend on circumstances beyond the Company s control, including the availability of business opportunities, the time required for the Company to complete its investigation and analysis of prospective business opportunities, the time required to prepare the appropriate documents and agreements providing for the Company s participation, and other circumstances. 
 
 It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed and, on the basis of that review, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be most suitable will be selected. The structure may include, but is not limited to, mergers, reorganizations, leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures, and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation, or other form of organization. Implementing the structure may require the merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the current stockholders of the Company may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of the transaction, all or a majority of the Company s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the stockholders. 
 
 The Company will most likely acquire a business opportunity by issuing shares of the Company s common stock to the owners of the business opportunity. Although the terms of the transaction cannot be predicted, in many instances the business opportunity entity will require that the transaction by which the Company acquires its participation be tax-free under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ). It is anticipated that any business opportunity acquisition will result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to the acquisition. 
 
 Notwithstanding the fact that the Company is technically the acquiring entity in the foregoing circumstances, generally accepted accounting principles will ordinarily require that the transaction be accounted for as if the Company had been acquired by the other entity owning the business venture or opportunity and, therefore, will not permit a write up in the carrying value of the assets of the other company. 
 
 It is anticipated that securities issued in a transaction of this type would be issued in reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of a substantial number of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the Company s common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for the Company s common stock. 
 
 The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of the agreement cannot be predicted, generally the agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to the closing, set forth remedies on default, and include miscellaneous other terms. 
 
 It is emphasized that management of the Company has broad discretion in determining the manner by which the Company will participate in a prospective business opportunity and may enter into transactions having a potentially adverse impact on the current stockholders in that their percentage ownership in the Company may be reduced without any increase in the value of their investment or that the business opportunity in which the Company acquires an interest may ultimately prove to be unprofitable. The transaction may be consummated without being submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the board of directors to seek the stockholders advice or consent or because of a requirement to do so by state law. 

5 

The investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments may require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs previously incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred. 
 
 The Company s operations following its acquisition of an interest in a business opportunity will be dependent on the nature of the opportunity and interest acquired. The specific risks of a given business opportunity cannot be predicted at the present time. 
 
 The Company is not registered and does not propose to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Act ). The Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment company under the Investment Act and, therefore to avoid application of the registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and the related regulations. 
 
 Regulation 
 
 It is impossible to predict what government regulation the Company may be subject to until it has acquired an interest in a business opportunity. The use of assets and/or conduct of businesses which the Company may acquire could subject it to environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade, or other governmental regulations and state or local taxation. In selecting a business opportunity to acquire, management will endeavor to ascertain, to the extent of the limited resources of the Company, the effects of government regulation on the prospective business of the Company. In certain circumstances, however, such as the acquisition of an interest in a new or start-up business activity, it may not be possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the impact of government regulation. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The Company encounters substantial competition in its efforts to locate a business opportunity. The primary competition for desirable investments comes from investment bankers, business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small business investment companies, other shell companies, and wealthy individuals. Most of these entities have significantly greater experience, resources, and managerial capabilities than the Company and are in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. 
 
 Facilities 
 
 The Company s principal executive office is currently located at the home of Mark A. Scharmann, our sole officer and director. Beginning August 2017, the Company entered into an oral agreement to pay Mr. Scharmann 500 per month as payment for use of his personal residence as the Company s office and mailing address. 
 
 Employees 
 
 The Company has no employees and its business and affairs are handled by its president who provides services to the Company on an as needed basis, without compensation. Management of the Company may engage consultants, attorneys, and accountants on an as needed basis, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities. 

ITEM 1A 
 RISK FACTORS 

Factors Affecting Future Operating Results 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning our future programs, expenses, revenue, liquidity and cash needs as well as our plans and strategies. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. Numerous factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward-looking statements, including the following risk factors. 
 
 Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty we will continue activities in which case you could lose your investment. 
 
 Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. As such we may have to cease activities and you could lose your investment. We will continue to look for a merger

candidate for our business. 
 
 We currently do not have adequate funds to cover the costs associated with maintaining our status as a Reporting Company. 
 
 As of December 31, 2017 the Company had approximately 534 cash available. 
 
 We lack an operating history and have losses which we expect to continue into the future. As a result, we may have to suspend or cease activities, which would result in a complete loss of any investment made into the Company. 
 
 We were incorporated on October 18, 2005 and we have not started any business activities or realized any revenues. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. As of December 31, 2017 our net loss since inception was 579,608. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. 
 
 As a result, we may not generate revenues in the future. 
 
 If we are able to complete financing through the sale of additional shares of our common stock in the future, then shareholders will experience dilution. 
 
 The most likely source of future financing presently available to us is through the sale of shares of our common stock. Any sale of common stock will result in dilution of equity ownership to existing shareholders. This means that if we sell shares of our common stock, more shares will be outstanding and each existing shareholder will own a smaller percentage of the shares then outstanding. To raise additional capital we may have to issue additional shares, which may substantially dilute the interests of existing shareholders. Alternatively, we may have to borrow large sums, and assume debt obligations that require us to make substantial interest and capital payments. 
 
 Because there is currently limited public trading market for our common stock, you may not be able to resell your stock . 
 
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace, under the symbol SRSG. We have limited trading. 
 
 Because our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares . 
 
 Our shares are penny stocks are covered by section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell the Company's securities including the delivery of a standardized disclosure document; disclosure and confirmation of quotation prices; disclosure of compensation the broker/dealer receives; and, furnishing monthly account statements. For sales of our securities, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from its customer a written agreement prior to making a sale. The imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices could adversely affect a shareholder's ability to dispose of his stock and as a result the investor may lose his entire investment made into the Company.

The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company s 2017 audited financial statements addresses an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, indicating that the Company has incurred losses since its inception and has no on-going operations. The report further indicates that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a working capital deficit of 234,084 and a stockholders deficit of 234,084. The Company incurred net losses of 224,387 and 63,591 for its fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has not entered into any agreements or arrangements for the provision of additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the additional debt or equity capital required to continue its operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, contingencies, litigation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements. There have been no material changes to these policies during fiscal 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017 the Company has not identified any critical estimates that are used in the preparation of the financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2017 we had cash of 534 and a negative working capital of 234,084. This compares with cash of 93 and negative working capital of 253,221 as of December 31, 2016. 
 
 Net cash used by operating activities totaled 23,704 for the year-ended December 31, 2017 consisting of a loss from operations of 224,387 which was partially offset by a 164,794 loss on extinguishment of debt, a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 17,452 and a change in accrued interest related parties of 18,437. This compares with net cash used in operating activities of 28,751 for the year-ended December 31, 2016 consisting of a loss from operations of 63,591 and a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 24,012 and a change in accrued interest related parties of 10,828. 
 
 There were no investing activities in either the year-ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 24,145 for the year-ended December 31, 2017 consisting of loans and advances from related parties. This compares with net cash provided by financing activities of 27,725 for the year-ended December 31, 2016 consisting of loans and advances from related parties. 
 
 We must secure additional funds in order to continue our business. We will be required to secure a loan to pay expenses relating to filing this report including legal, accounting and filing fees. We believe that we will be able to obtain this loan from a current shareholder of the Company; however we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional proceeds or secure additional loans in the future to cover our expenses related to maintaining our reporting company status. Furthermore, there is no guarantee we will receive the required financing to complete our business strategies; we cannot provide any assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. If we are unable to accomplish raising adequate funds then any it would be likely that any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety. 
 
 Results of Operations . We did not have revenue for either the year-ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. For the year-ended December 31, 2017, we incurred 30,830 of administrative expenses compared to 34,971 for the year-ended December 31, 2016. For the year-ended December 31, 2017 we incurred 28,763 of interest expense on notes payable and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of 164,794. The loss on extinguishment of debt arose from the excess value of shares that were issued over the value of the debt settled. This compares with 28,620 of interest expense for the year-ended December 31, 2016. 
 
 As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a loss of 224,387 for the year-ended December 31, 2017 compared to a loss of 63,591 for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Since incorporation we have incurred a loss of 579,608.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There have been no material changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes using the COSO framework, an integrated framework for the evaluation of internal controls issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, to identify the risks and control objectives related to the evaluation of our control environment. 
 
 Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective for both of our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s Audit Standard No. 5 as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation requirements by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, 

10 
 10 
 10 

even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 Sears Oil and Gas Corporation 
 Salt Lake City, Utah 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Sears Oil and Gas Corporation (the Company) as of December 31 2017, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses and has no operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 Sears Oil and Gas, Corporation 
 Ogden, Utah 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Sears Oil and Gas, Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sears Oil and Gas, Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses and has no operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

SEARS OIL AND GAS CORPORATION 
 Notes to the Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND HISTORY 
 
 Sears Oil and Gas Corporation (the Company) was incorporated on October 18, 2005 in the State of Nevada. The Company was formed to use a patented technology to produce crude oil from tar sands deposits. The Company will also conduct administrative, correlated transportation and delivery of product, financial management, and the marketing and sales programs of the operation. The Company has not commenced principle operations. 
 
 NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Basic Loss Per Share - The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. The convertible debt was not included as it would be anti-dilutive due to continuing losses.

Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments - On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
 
 Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement. 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for the cash and cash equivalents, receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. 
 
 We have reviewed accounting pronouncements issued during the past two years and have adopted any that are applicable to our company. We have determined that none had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
 
 Long-lived Assets - The Company s long lived assets are recorded at its cost. The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. 
 
 Concentration of Risk - Cash - The Company at times may maintain a cash balance in excess of insured limits. At December 31, 2017, the Company has no cash in excess of insured limits.

 Notes to the Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 Revenue Recognition - The Company will determine its revenue recognition policy when it determines a business model and achieves successful operations. 
 
 Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. 
 
 Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed straight-line over periods to be determined based on the nature of the assets. 
 
 NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES 
 
 Income Taxes - The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued FASB ASC 740-10. FASB ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than- not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by FASB ASC 740-10. 
 
 Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
 
 At December 31, 2017 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 580,000 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2037. No tax benefits have been reported in the financial statements, because the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 
 
 Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in the future. 
 
 Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:

The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal and state income tax rates to pretax income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the following:

At December 31, 2017, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 
 
 The Company did not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. 
 
 The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The tax years that remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions are those for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
 
 NOTE 4 - GOING CONCERN 
 
 The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred losses since inception and does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to raise additional capital when required to produce crude oil from tar sands. When and if these activities provide sufficient revenues it would allow it to continue as a going concern. In the interim the Company is working toward raising operating capital through the private placement of its common stock or debt instruments. 
 
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 NOTE 5 LOANS AND ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the sole officer and director of the company and another affiliated shareholder made loans to the Company in order to pay for expenses and continue the reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These loans accrue interest at the rate of 12 per annum, are due on demand and are not convertible into common stock of the Company. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, these related parties loaned a total of 24,145 to the Company. Interest in the amount of 11,837 accrued on these loans. As of December 31, 2017 the balance due to these related parties for these loans was 112,803 principal and accrued interest of 20,703. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, these related parties loaned a total of 27,725 to the Company. Interest in the amount of 9,228 accrued on these loans and interest in the amount of 5,000 was paid. As of December 31, 2016 the balance due to these related parties for these loans was 88,658 principal and accrued interest of 8,866. 
 
 Beginning August 2017, the Company entered into an oral agreement to pay the Company s sole director 500 per month as payment for use of his personal residence as the Company s office and mailing address. The Company has recorded rent expense of

 Notes to the Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 2,500 during the year ended December 31, 2017 which is included in the selling, general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2017, a convertible promissory note held by two non-affiliated entities was assigned to the Company s sole director and majority shareholder, and subsequently converted into common stock as noted in Note 6. 
 NOTE 6 CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES / RELATED AND NON-RELATED PARTIES 
 
 In March 2014, the Company issued a 40,000 convertible promissory note to the sole officer and director of the Company and a 15,000 convertible promissory note to another affiliated shareholder (the Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes had a term of one year expiring March 2015, and are now payable on demand, and accrue interest at the rate of 12 per annum. The holders of the Convertible Notes, may, at their option, convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal balance of, and all accrued interest on the Convertible Notes into shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share, at a conversion rate of 1.00 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 additional interest accrued on these Notes in the amount of 6,600 and 6,600, respectively. No interest has been paid on these Notes. 
 
 As of December 31, 2017 the balance due to these related parties for these Notes was 55,000 principal and accrued interest of 24,881. (See Note 8) 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2009, a shareholder of the Company loaned 15,000 to the Company. The note was later assigned to two non-affiliated entities. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the note was assigned to the Company s sole director and majority shareholder. The Note was accruing interest at the default rate of 23 per annum. The holder of the Note had the option to convert all of the outstanding principal balance and all accrued interest on the Note into 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share. In August 2017, the convertible promissory note along with accrued interest of 63,730 was converted into 3,000,000 shares of the Company s previously authorized but unissued common stock. The value of the shares issued was determined to be 243,524, based on the Company s enterprise value at the effective date of the agreement, as the lack of trading volume of the Company s public shares was not a feasible determinant of value. The excess of the fair value of the stock issued over the value of the debt settled of 164,794 has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The issuance of common stock resulted in a change in control of the Company [See Note 7]. 
 
 NOTE 7 CHANGE IN CONTROL 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2017, a convertible promissory note was assigned to the Company s sole officer and director, and subsequently converted into 3,000,000 shares of the Company s previously authorized but unissued common stock. This resulted in a change of control, as our sole officer and director owns 96 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares [See Note 6].
