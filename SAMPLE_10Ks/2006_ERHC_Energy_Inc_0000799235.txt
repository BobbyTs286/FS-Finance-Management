 Descr iptio n
 of Business

Overview 

ERHC
 is
 an independent oil and gas company formed in 1986, as a Colorado corporation.
 The Company was engaged in a variety of businesses until 1996, when it began
 its
 current operations. The Company s current focus is to exploit its assets, which
 are rights to working interests in exploration acreage in the Joint Development
 Zone JDZ between the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome Principe
 DRSTP and the Federal Republic of Nigeria FRN and in the exclusive
 territorial waters of Sao Tome (the Exclusive Economic Zone or EEZ ). 
The Company has formed relationships with upstream oil and gas companies to
 assist the Company in exploiting its assets in the JDZ. The Company currently
 has no other operations or assets. 

Current
 Business Operations 

In
 April
 2003, the Company and the DRSTP entered into an Option Agreement (the 2003
 Option Agreement in which the Company relinquished certain financial interests
 in the JDZ in exchange for exploration rights in the JDZ. The Company
 additionally entered into an administration agreement with the Nigeria-Sao
 Tome
 and Principe Joint Development Authority JDA ). The administration
 agreement is the formal agreement by the JDA that it will fully implement ERHC s
 preferential rights to working interests in the JDZ acreage as set forth in
 the
 2003 Option Agreement and describes certain procedures regarding the exercising
 of these rights. However, ERHC retained under a previous agreement the
 following rights to participate in exploration and production activities in
 the
 EEZ subject to certain restrictions: (a) the right to receive up to two
 blocks of ERHC s choice and (b) the option to acquire up to a 15 paid working
 interest in up to two blocks of ERHC s choice in the EEZ. The Company
 would be responsible for its proportionate share of exploration and exploitation
 costs in the EEZ blocks.

(a) 

No
 contracts have been entered into as of the date
 hereof. 

This
 exercise of the Company s rights was subject to the condition that if no license
 is awarded or a license is awarded and subsequently withdrawn by the JDA prior
 to the commencement of operations, ERHC will be entitled to receive its working
 interest in that block in a future license awarded for the block. 

In
 November 2005, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Addax
 Petroleum (Nigeria Offshore 2) Limited ("Addax"), as subsequently amended,
 whereby the Company assigned to Addax a 33.3 participating interest in Block
 4,
 leaving a 17.7 participating interest to the Company. In exchange, Addax paid
 the Company 18,000,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Under the
 participation agreement ERHC will support Addax as operator, and Addax will
 pay
 all of the Company's future costs in respect of all petroleum operations in
 Block 4. Addax is entitled to the Company's share of cost oil until Addax
 recovers the Company's costs. 

In
 February 2006, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Addax
 Petroleum Resources Nigeria Limited ("Addax Sub") whereby the Company assigned
 to Addax Sub a 15 participating interest in Block 3 of the JDZ, leaving a
 10 
 participating interest to the Company. In exchange, Addax Sub paid the Company
 7,500,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Under this agreement,
 Addax Sub agreed to pay all of the Company's future costs in respect of
 petroleum operations in Block 3. Addax Sub is entitled to the Company's share
 of
 cost oil until Addax Sub recovers the Company's costs.

In
 March
 2006, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Sinopec
 International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation Nigeria
 ("Sinopec"), and Addax Energy Nigeria Limited ("Addax Ltd."), whereby the
 Company assigned a 28.67 participating interest in Block 2 of the JDZ to
 Sinopec, and a 14.33 participating interest in Block 2 of the JDZ to Addax
 Ltd., leaving a 22 participating interest to the Company. In exchange, Sinopec
 paid the Company 13,600,000 and Addax Ltd. paid the Company 6,800,000 in
 the
 second quarter of fiscal 2006. Under this agreement, ERHC will support Sinopec
 as operator, and Sinopec and Addax Ltd. will pay all of the Company's future
 costs in respect of petroleum operations in Block 2. Sinopec and Addax Ltd.
 are
 entitled to the Company's share of cost oil until they recover the Company's
 costs and Sinopec is to receive 6 interest on its future costs, up to
 35,000,000, but only to the extent that those interest costs are covered by
 production. The Company agreed to pay a 3,000,000 cash success fee to Feltang
 International Inc. Feltang ), a company that was responsible for obtaining
 Sinopec s participation in Block 2. Additionally, the Company agreed to issue to
 Feltang 5,250,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 6,500,000
 shares at 0.355 per share. The
 finder s fees due under the Feltang Agreement were exactly the same as those
 that had been due under the Finder's Fee Agreement with Eurasia which had
 sourced the Compay's former partner, Pioneer. Again, without a technical
 operator, following Pioneer s withdrawal, ERHC would have lost the block
 entirely. 

ERHC s
 goal is to enter into agreements to exploit its interests in Blocks 5, 6 and
 9
 also. Additionally, the Company intends to exploit its rights in the
 EEZ. 

Government
 Regulation 

In
 the
 event the Company begins activities relating to the exploration and exploitation
 of hydrocarbons, it will be required to make the necessary expenditures to
 comply with the applicable health and safety, environmental and other
 regulations. 

The
 oil
 and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world.
 Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under
 constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation,
 numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding
 on the oil and gas industry and companies engaged in this industry, some of
 which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and
 regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production
 and
 marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations increase the
 cost
 of doing business and, consequently, will affect results of operations. Inasmuch
 as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and
 existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are
 unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and
 regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations
 will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would
 affect other oil and gas companies of similar size. 

Competition 

Strong
 competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with
 other independent oil and gas companies for equipment and personnel required
 to
 explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
 is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and natural gas liquids. Higher
 recent commodity prices have increased the costs of properties available for
 acquisition, and there are a greater number of companies with the financial
 resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Certain of our competitors have
 financial and other resources substantially larger than ours, and they have
 also
 established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental
 relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence,
 we
 may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In
 addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when
 responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production,
 such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and
 availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.

Employees

The
 Company currently has one executive officer, a principal accounting officer,
 a
 consultant that serves as the Corporate Secretary, and two support staff
 employees that provide services to the Company. The Company believes that its
 relationship with its employees is satisfactory. 

Item
 1A. 
 
 Risk 
 Factors 

You
 should carefully consider the risks described below before making any investment
 decision related to the Company s securities. The risks and uncertainties
 described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks
 and uncertainties not presently known or that the Company currently deems
 immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the
 following risks actually occur, the Company s business could be harmed.

The
 Company has no sources of revenue and a history of losses from
 operations 

The
 Company s business is in an early stage of development. The Company has not
 generated any revenue since its entry into the oil and gas business and has
 incurred significant operating losses. The Company has incurred net operating
 losses of 5,988,756 in fiscal 2006, 4,652,459 in fiscal 2005, 2,085,426
 in
 fiscal 2004 and 68,244,403 since inception. The Company had net income of
 23,171,536 in fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of entering into production
 sharing agreements under which it sold various participatory interests. The
 Company had net losses of 11,270,478 in fiscal 2005, 3,593,388 in fiscal
 2004,
 and 56,236,175 since inception. The Company expects to incur additional
 operating losses for the foreseeable future. 

5 

Table
 of Contents 

The
 Company has a limited operating history in the oil and gas
 business 

The
 Company s operations to date have consisted solely of acquiring rights to
 working interests in the JDZ and EEZ and entering into production sharing
 contracts. The Company will not be the operator with respect to these contracts.
 The Company s future financial results depend primarily on (1) the ability
 of its participating interest oil and gas companies to provide or obtain
 sufficient financing to meet their financial commitments in the production
 sharing contracts, (2) the ability to discover commercial quantities of oil
 and gas, and (3) the market price for oil and gas. Management cannot predict
 that the production sharing contracts will result in wells being drilled or
 if
 drilled, whether oil and/or gas will be discovered in commercial
 quantities. 

Financing
 will be needed to fund the financial commitments of the production sharing
 contracts 

While
 the
 Company is not required to fund any financial commitments pursuant to the
 production sharing contracts, project financing will be required to fund
 exploration activities. Failure of our venture partners to provide or obtain
 the
 necessary financing will preclude the commencement of exploration activities.

The
 Company may not discover commercially productive reserves in the JDZ or
 EEZ 

The
 Company s future success depends on its ability to economically locate oil and
 gas reserves in commercial quantities in the JDZ and EEZ. There can be no
 assurance that the Company s planned projects in the JDZ or EEZ will result in
 significant, if any, reserves or that the Company will have future success
 in
 drilling productive wells. 

The
 Company s non-operator status limits its control over its oil and gas projects
 in the JDZ or EEZ 

The
 Company will focus primarily on creating exploration opportunities and forming
 relationships with oil and gas companies to develop those opportunities in
 the
 JDZ or EEZ. As a result, the Company will have only a limited ability to
 exercise control over a significant portion of a project s operations or the
 associated costs of those operations in the JDZ or EEZ. The success of a future
 project is dependent upon a number of factors that are outside the Company s
 areas of control. These factors include: 

the
 availability of future capital resources to the Company and the other
 participants to be used for drilling
 wells; 

the
 approval of other participants for the drilling of wells on the projects;
 and 

the
 economic conditions at the time of drilling, including the prevailing
 and
 anticipated prices for oil and gas. 

the
 availability of deep water drilling
 rigs 

The
 Company s reliance on other project participants and its limited ability to
 directly control future project costs could have a material adverse effect
 on
 its future expected rates of return. 

The
 Company s success depends on its ability to exploit its limited
 assets 

The
 Company s only assets are rights to working interests in exploration acreage in
 the JDZ and EEZ under agreements with the JDA and DRSTP. The Company s
 operations have been limited to sustaining and managing its rights under these
 agreements. The Company s success depends on its ability to exploit these
 assets, of which there is no assurance that it will be successful. 

The
 Company s competition includes oil and gas conglomerates that have significant
 advantages over it 

The
 oil
 and gas industry is highly competitive. Many companies and individuals are
 engaged in exploring for crude oil and natural gas and acquiring crude oil
 and
 natural gas properties, resulting in a high degree of competition for desirable
 exploratory and producing properties. The companies with which the Company
 competes are much larger and have greater financial resources, experience,
 technical and managerial experience than the Company. 

Various
 factors beyond the Company s control will affect prices of oil and
 gas 

The
 availability of a ready market for the Company s future crude oil and natural
 gas production depends on numerous factors beyond its control, including the
 level of consumer demand, the extent of worldwide crude oil and natural gas
 production, the costs and availability of alternative fuels, the costs and
 proximity of transportation facilities, regulation by authorities and the costs
 of complying with applicable environmental regulations.

The
 Company s operations are located outside of the United States which subjects it
 to risks associated with international activities 

At
 September 30, 2006, all of the Company's operations were located outside the
 United States. The Company s only assets are (i) agreements with DRSTP and the
 JDA, which provide ERHC with rights to participate in exploration and production
 activities in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of central West Africa and (ii)
 production sharing contracts for property located in this region. This
 geographic area of interest is controlled by foreign governments that have
 historically experienced volatility, which is out of management s control. The
 Company s ability to exploit its interests in the agreements in this area may be
 impacted by this circumstance. 

The
 future success of the Company s international operations may also be adversely
 affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
 and labor conditions, political instability, risk of war, expropriation,
 renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, tax laws (including
 host-country import-export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes
 on
 foreign subsidiaries) and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
 local currencies in which future oil and gas producing activities may be
 denominated. As well, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect the
 Company's future results of operations and financial condition. 

The
 Company s results of operations are susceptible to general economic conditions

The
 Company s revenues and results of operations will be subject to fluctuations
 based upon the general economic conditions both in the United States and
 internationally. If there were to be a general economic downturn or a
 recession in the oil and gas industry, the Company s future revenues, the value
 of its oil and natural gas exploration concession, as well as its ability to
 exploit its assets could be materially adversely affected. 

One
 shareholder controls approximately 43 of the Company s outstanding common
 stock 

Chrome
 Oil Services Chrome beneficially owns approximately 43 of the outstanding
 common stock. As a result, Chrome has the ability to substantially
 influence, and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions that
 require stockholder approval, including the election of directors. This
 concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a
 future change in control of the Company or a liquidity event. 

The
 Company s stock price is highly volatile 

The
 Company s common stock is currently traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin
 Board. The market price of the Company s common stock has experienced
 fluctuations that are unrelated to its operating performance. The market price
 of the common stock has been highly volatile over the last several years. 
The Company can provide no assurance that its current price will be maintained.

The
 Company does not currently pay dividends on its common stock and do not
 anticipate doing so in the future 

The
 Company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock, and there is no
 assurance that the Company will achieve sufficient earnings to pay cash
 dividends on its common stock in the future. The Company intends to retain
 any
 earnings to fund its operations. Therefore, the Company does not anticipate
 paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable
 future. 

The
 Company s stock is considered a penny stock 

The
 SEC
 has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with
 transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity
 securities with a share price of less than 5.00. The penny stock rules
 require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise
 exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document
 prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature
 and level of risks in the penny stock market. These disclosure
 requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity
 in
 any secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock
 rules. The Company s common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules,
 and accordingly, investors in the common stock may find it difficult to sell
 their shares in the future, if at all.

 Unresolved
 Staff
 Comments

On
 March
 21, 2006, the Company received a comment letter from the SEC regarding its
 filing on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2005. The Company responded
 to that comment letter on April 27, 2006 and amended its Form 10-K in an effort
 to comply with the disclosure requirements of the SEC as indicated in the March
 21, 2006 comment letter. The SEC reviewed the Company s response and amended
 10-K filing and issued a follow-up comment letter on June 5, 2006 that included
 one unresolved comment. The Company filed a response to the follow-up comment
 letter on September 18, 2006, in which the Company agreed with the SEC s
 conclusion, but requested further direction in order to comply. Based on
 discussions with staff members at the SEC regarding the response, the remaining
 unresolved comment, as discussed in the following paragraph will require that
 the Company file a second amendment to its Form 10-K for the year ended
 September 30, 2005 and its Form 10-Q for the Quarter ended June 30,
 2006. 

The
 remaining unresolved staff comment requires that the Company report as a
 development stage enterprise because it meets the criteria described in
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 7., Accounting and
 Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises . The primary impact of reporting as
 a development stage enterprise is (1) the presentation of inception-to-date
 information in the statements of operations, the statement of stockholders 
equity and the statements of cash flows, (2) clear indications on the face
 of
 the financial statements and in the footnotes that the Company is in the
 development stage and (3) a description of the reasons that the Company is
 reporting as a development stage enterprise. The Company is reporting as a
 development stage enterprise in this report on Form 10-K and is in the process
 of amending its Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2005 and its Form
 10-Q for the Quarter ended June 30, 2006 to resolve Staff comments.

 Legal
 Proceed ings

On
 May 4,
 2006, a search warrant issued by the U.S. District Court of the Southern
 District of Texas, Houston Division, was executed on the Company seeking various
 records including, among other matters, documents, if any, related to
 correspondence with foreign governmental officials or entities in Sao Tome
 and
 Nigeria. With the guidance of the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld
 LLP, ERHC Energy continues to work with the U.S. Department of Justice in
 connection with the Department s investigation. The Department of Justice agreed
 to ERHC s request to return to ERHC a complete copy set of all paper documents
 seized in the Government s May 4, 2006 search of ERHC s Houston office. ERHC has
 received a copy set of these business documents. ERHC filed suit in federal
 district court in Texas in June. The lawsuit sought to protect the company s
 attorney-client privileged documents and to allow ERHC counsel to determine
 the
 factual basis for the Justice Department s search warrant affidavit, which is
 currently under seal. Although the judge has ordered that the affidavit remain
 under seal, his ruling requires the Justice Department to provide a neutral
 taint team to review all seized documents and to identify those that may be
 privileged. The neutral taint team is charged with the responsibility to
 withhold from the investigating attorneys any documents that it believes to
 be
 privileged. The ruling also provides the company with the right to challenge
 the
 Justice Department s privilege determinations in court. Since the ruling, ERHC
 has been in communication with the Justice Department regarding the Government s
 compliance with the ordered taint team procedures, and regarding the
 Government s ongoing investigation. 

The
 attorneys of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP are also assisting in ERHC s
 response to a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoena
 issued on May 9, 2006, and to a second related subpoena issued on August 26,
 2006. The subpoenas request a range of documents, including among others, all
 documents related to correspondence with foreign governmental officials or
 entities in Sao Tome and Nigeria as well as for personnel records (specifically,
 those regarding former CFO, Franklin Ihekwoaba) and other corporate records
 from
 the Company. ERHC has responded to both subpoenas. 

During
 October 2006, Lakeshore Capital Limited Lakeshore filed an arbitration claim
 against ERHC before the American Arbitration Association, seeking 4,400,000
 for
 the alleged value of 4,500,000 shares of ERHC common stock and for a warrant
 to
 purchase 1,500,000 shares at an exercise price of .20 per share, including
 interest and costs. Lakeshore claims it is owed this sum for services
 previously rendered under a contract with ERHC. ERHC believes that
 Lakeshore s claim is entirely without merit, has filed an arbitration response
 disputing Lakeshore s claim, and intends to vigorously defend all Lakeshore
 claims. 

From
 time
 to time, the Company may be subject to routine litigation, claims, or disputes
 in the ordinary course of business which, in the opinion of management, should
 not have a materially adverse effect on the Company s financial
 position.

 Manag ement s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
 Plan of Operations 

You
 must
 read the following discussion of the results of the operations and financial
 condition of the Company in conjunction with its financial statements, including
 the notes thereto included in this Form 10-K filing. The Company s
 historical results are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating
 results for any future period. 

Overview

ERHC
 reports as a development stage enterprise as there are currently no significant
 operations and no revenue has been generated from business activities. The
 Company was formed in 1986, as a Colorado corporation, and was engaged in a
 variety of businesses until 1996, when it began its current operations as an
 independent oil and gas company. The Company s goal is to maximize its
 value through exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Gulf
 of Guinea offshore of central West Africa. The Company s current focus is to
 exploit its only assets, which are rights to working interests in exploration
 acreage in the JDZ and the EEZ. The Company has entered into production
 sharing agreements with upstream oil and gas companies in these JDZ Blocks.
 The
 technical and operational expertise in conducting exploration operations will
 be
 provided by the Company s participating interest oil and gas
 companies. 

Critical
 accounting policies 

In
 December 2001, the SEC requested that companies discuss their most critical
 accounting policies in the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of
 their reports. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is
 one that is important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and
 operating results and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
 complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the
 effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

The
 Company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations
 and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any
 associated risks related to these policies on the Company s business operations
 are discussed throughout this section where such policies affect the Company s
 reported and expected financial results. Management s preparation of this
 Annual Report on Form 10-K requires it to make estimates and assumptions that
 affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and that effect the
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. There is no assurance
 that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Concentration
 of risks 

The
 Company primarily transacts its business with two financial institutions. From
 time to time the amount on deposit in either one of these institutions may
 exceed the 100,000 federally insured limit. The balances are maintained
 in demand accounts to minimize risk. 

The
 Company s current focus is to exploit its only assets, which are agreements with
 the DRSTP concerning oil and gas exploration in EEZ and with the JDA concerning
 oil and gas exploration in the JDZ. The Company has formed relationships
 with other oil and gas companies with the technical and financial capabilities
 to assist the Company in leveraging its interests in the EEZ and the JDZ. The
 Company currently has no other operations.

Stock-based
 compensation 

During
 the year ended September 30, 2004, the Company issued a former Chief Executive
 Officer an option to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
 price of 0.20 per share. Due to the resignation of this employee in January
 2006, the right to purchase 1,000,000 shares did not vest, and in June 2006,
 this former employee exercised 2,000,000 options on a cashless basis for the
 issuance of 1,272,727 shares. 

Effective
 October 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
 SFAS No. 123R, 
 Share-Based Payment, 
 as
 interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Prior to October 1,
 2005, the Company had accounted for stock options according to the provisions
 of
 Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, 
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, 
 and
 related interpretations, and therefore no related compensation expense was
 recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value. The Company adopted the
 modified prospective transition method provided for under SFAS No. 123R, and,
 consequently, has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Stock
 awards outstanding under the Company s current plans have generally been granted
 at prices which are equal to the market value of the Company s stock on the date
 of grant, generally vest over one year and bear no expiration date. Effective
 October 1, 2005, the Company began recognizing compensation expense ratably
 over
 the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. Due to the mutual resignation
 of an employee in January 2006 and the cancellation of the non-vested 1,000,000
 options, the previously recognized expense in the first fiscal quarter of 2006
 of 101,618 has been reversed. The Company currently has no non-vested employee
 options. 

Impairment
 of long-lived assets 

The
 Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets when events and
 circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. The Company
 determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows estimated
 to be generated by these assets to their respective carrying amounts. 
Impairments are charged to operations in the period to which events and
 circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. Management of
 the Company has evaluated its investment in its DRSTP concession fee and
 believes that there have been no events or circumstances that would indicate
 that such asset might be impaired. 

New
 accounting pronouncements 

In
 May
 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting
 Changes and Error Corrections ,
 a replacement
 of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 .
 This
 statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
 a
 change in accounting principle. This statement applies to all voluntary changes
 in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting
 pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
 specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes
 and
 corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
 Adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have an effect on the Company s
 consolidated financial statements. 

In
 June
 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
 for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement
 No. 109 FIN
 No. 48 ). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
 income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance
 with Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48
 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
 statement recognition and measurement classification, accounting for interest
 and penalties and accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions
 of FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
 December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN No.
 48 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of
 operations. 

Former
 Operations 

The
 Company acquired a lease in oil fields located in Wichita County, Texas, which
 was subsequently assigned to a former shareholder. However, in connection
 with the lease in Wichita County, the Company may remain liable for certain
 plugging and abandonment costs, estimated to be approximately 485,000, which
 have been accrued as of September 30, 2006 and 2005.

Results
 of Operations 

Year
 ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Year Ended September 30,
 2005 

During
 fiscal 2006, the Company had general and administrative expenses of 5,979,609
 compared with 4,645,783 in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily attributed
 to increased legal fees as a result of the Department of Justice investigation.

During
 2006, the Company had net income of 23,171,536, compared to a net loss of
 11,270,478 for fiscal 2005. The three primary reasons for the 34,442,014
 improvement in net income for the year ended September 30, 2006 were: (i) a
 30,102,250 net gain from the sale of participation interests in the three
 JDZ
 Blocks under production sharing contracts with various joint venture partners;
 (ii) a 5,749,575 non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal 2005
 as
 the result of the issuance of shares in conjunction with a conversion of debt
 to
 common stock; and (iii) fiscal 2006 income tax expense of
 2,063,000. 

During
 fiscal 2006, the Company entered
 into production sharing agreements in Blocks 2, 3 and 4 under which they sold
 various participating interests for total cash proceeds of 45,900,000 which
 resulted in net cash provided by investing activities of 45,896,876, compared
 with net cash used by investing activities of 24,277 for fiscal
 2005. 

During
 fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company had no revenues from which cash flows could
 be
 generated to support operations. In fiscal 2006, the Company relied primarily
 upon cash generated from the sale of interests to fund operations and in fiscal
 2005, the Company relied on borrowings funded from its line of credit as well
 as
 the sale of common stock. 

Year
 ended September 30, 2005 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2004

During
 fiscal 2005, the Company incurred a net loss of 11,270,478, compared to a
 net
 loss of 3,593,388 for the year ended September 30, 2004. A significant portion
 of the increase in net loss for the year ended September 30, 2005 was
 attributable to a 5,749,575 loss on extinguishment of debt related to the
 conversion of debt into common stock. 

General
 and administrative expenses were 4,645,783 in fiscal 2005 compared with
 2,085,426 in fiscal 2004, such increase was the result of the Company canceling
 in December 2004, its management services agreement with Chrome, covering all
 its operating expenses. 

During
 2005 and 2004, the Company had no revenues from which cash flows could be
 generated to support operations and thus relied on borrowings funded from its
 line of credit as well as the sale of common stock. 

Liquidity
 and Capital Resources 

As
 of
 September 30, 2006, the Company had working capital of 32,154,019. The Company
 received 45,900,000 in March 2006 from its partners
 when production-sharing agreements in Blocks 2, 3 and 4 were signed. The
 Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet working capital
 requirements for fiscal 2007. The Company has no material commitments for
 capital resources. 

Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements 

As
 of
 September 30, 2006, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet
 arrangements.

 Quantita tive
 and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The
 Company s current focus is to exploit its only assets, which are rights to
 working interest in the JDZ and EEZ under agreements with the JDA and
 DRSTP. The Company intends to form relationships with other oil and gas
 companies with technical and financial capabilities to assist the Company in
 leveraging its interests in the EEZ and the JDZ. The Company currently has
 no other operations. 

At
 September 30, 2006, all of the Company's operations were located outside the
 United States. The Company s main asset are agreements with DRSTP and the JDA,
 which provide ERHC with rights to participate in exploration and production
 activities in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of central West Africa. 
This geographic area of interest is controlled by foreign governments that
 have
 historically experienced volatility, which is out of management s control. The
 Company s ability to exploit its interests in the agreements in this area may be
 impacted by this circumstance. 

The
 future success of the Company s international operations may also be adversely
 affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
 and labor conditions, political instability, risk of war, expropriation,
 renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, tax laws (including
 host-country import-export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes
 on
 foreign subsidiaries) and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
 local currencies in which future oil and gas producing activities may be
 denominated. As well, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect the
 Company's future results of operations and financial condition. 

Market
 risks relating to the Company s operations result primarily from changes in
 interest rates as well as credit risk concentrations. The Company s
 interest expense is generally not sensitive to changes in the general level
 of
 interest rates in the United States, particularly because a substantial majority
 of its indebtedness is at fixed rates. 

The
 Company holds no derivative financial or commodity instruments, nor do we engage
 in any foreign currency denominated transactions.

 Changes
 in
 and Disagreements with Accountants on
 Accounting and Financial Disclosures

On
 November 4, 2005, Pannell Kerr Forster of Texas, P.C. ("PKF") resigned as
 independent auditor. PKF's report on the financial statements for the fiscal
 years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, contained no adverse opinion or
 disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
 audit
 scope or accounting principles. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board
 of
 Directors was informed of, but did not recommend or approve, PKF's
 resignation. 

During
 the Company's fiscal years September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the subsequent
 interim periods preceding PKF's resignation, there were no disagreements between
 the Company and PKF on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
 financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
 disagreements, if not resolved to PKF's satisfaction, would have caused PKF
 to
 make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with
 their report. 

On
 November 14, 2005, A udit
 Committee of the Board Directors engaged Malone Bailey, PC as our
 new independent auditor for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. During
 the
 two most recent fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003
 and
 the subsequent interim periods prior to our engagement of Malone Bailey,
 we did not consult with Malone Bailey regarding the application of
 accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed,
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated
 financial statements.

 Controls
 and Procedures

Management s
 Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
 management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
 control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control over
 financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding
 the
 reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance
 with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that
 in
 reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation
 of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and
 expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization;
 and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
 disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
 statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its
 inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended
 to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements
 would be prevented or detected.

Table

Management
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
 financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
 Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
 Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal
 control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2006.

Our
 independent registered public accounting firm has audited management s
 assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
 reporting as of September 30, 2006, as stated in their report which appears
 on
 page F-2 of this Form 10-K under the heading, Report
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

Changes
 in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
 as
 otherwise discussed herein, there have been no changes in our internal control
 over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter
 that
 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
 internal control over financial reporting.

Section
 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s Directors and Executive
 Officers, and persons who own beneficially more than ten percent (10 of the
 common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of all filed reports are
 required to be furnished to us. Based solely on the reports received and the
 representations of the reporting person, the Company believes that these persons
 have complied with all applicable filing requirements during the fiscal year
 ended September 30, 2006, except for late Form 5 filings by each of Messrs.
 Offor, Luca, Jeter, Uzoigwe, Nwizubo, Ntephe and Chrome Oil Services. Each
 late
 Form 5 has been or will be subsequently filed. 

Corporate
 Governance 

The
 Board
 of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics to govern the conduct of all of the
 Officers, Directors and employees of the Company. In addition, the Board has
 adopted a Charter for the Audit Committee, Governance
 and Nominating Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, FCPA Policy,
 Policy on Insider Trading, Short-Swing Trading Policy and Whistleblower
 Protection Policy. All these can be accessed on the company s website at
 www.erhc.com 

Director
 Independence 

The
 Board
 of Directors has determined that Messrs. Nwizubo,
 Jeter and Uzoigwe are Independent as defined by the Securities and Exchange
 Commission SEC and for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Code of
 1986, as amended (the Code ). No Director is deemed independent unless the
 Board affirmatively determines that the Director has no material relationship
 with the Company, either directly or as an Officer, stockholder or partner
 of an
 organization that has a relationship with the Company. In making its
 determination, the Board observes all criteria for independence established
 by
 the rules of the SEC. 

Audit
 Committee 

The
 Company s Audit Committee is constituted of Messrs. Nwizubo (Chairman), Jeter
 and Uzoigwe. The ultimate responsibility for good corporate governance rests
 with the Board, whose primary role is oversight, counseling and direction to
 the
 Company's management in the best long-term interests of the Company and its
 stockholders. The Audit Committee, in accordance with its charter, has been
 established for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting
 processes of the Company and audits of the Company's annual financial
 statements. As described more fully in its charter, the purpose of the Audit
 Committee is to assist the Board in its general oversight of the Company's
 financial reporting, internal controls and audit functions. Management is
 responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's
 financial statements; establishing and applying accounting and financial
 reporting principles; designing and implementing systems of internal controls;
 and establishing procedures designed to reasonably assure compliance with
 accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent
 auditing firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the
 consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards. In accordance with law, the Audit Committee has ultimate authority
 and responsibility to select, compensate, evaluate and, when appropriate,
 replace the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee has the
 authority to engage its own outside advisers, including experts in particular
 areas of accounting, as it determines appropriate, apart from counsel or
 advisers hired by management. All of the members of the Audit Committee meet
 the
 independence and experience requirements of the SEC. The Board of Directors
 has
 determined that Mr. Nwizubo qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert 
as defined by the SEC. 

The
 Audit
 Committee members [except the chairman] are not professional accountants or
 auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the
 activities of management and the independent auditors, nor can the Audit
 Committee certify that the independent auditors are independent under
 applicable rules. The Audit Committee serves a Board-level oversight role,
 in
 which it provides advice, counsel and direction to management and the auditors
 on the basis of the information it receives, discussions with management and
 the
 auditors, and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business,
 financial and accounting matters. Stockholders should understand that the
 designation of an Audit Committee Financial Expert is an SEC disclosure
 requirement related to Mr. Nwizubo s experience and understanding with respect
 to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose
 on
 Mr. Nwizubo s any duties, obligations or liability greater than generally
 imposed on them as members of the Audit Committee and the Board, and this
 designation as an Audit Committee Financial Expert pursuant to this SEC
 requirement does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other
 member of the Audit Committee or the Board.

 Contracts 

We
 do not
 have an employment agreement with Mr. Luca, nor do we pay him a salary for
 his
 services as Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Memon s employment agreement

REPORT
 OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
 the
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 ERHC
 Energy Inc. 

 Houston,
 Texas 

We
 have
 audited management's assessment, included in Management s Report on Internal
 Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that ERHC Energy
 Inc.,
 a corporation in the development stage, maintained effective internal control
 over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established
 in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
 issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
 ERHC s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
 financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
 control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
 on
 management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the ERHC's internal control
 over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We
 conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
 with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
 States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
 reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
 an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
 management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
 effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
 we
 consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
 a
 reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A
 company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
 financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
 to
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
 permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
 being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
 of
 the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
 timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
 company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
 statements. 

Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
 not
 prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
 effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
 inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
 with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
 our
 opinion, management s assessment that ERHC maintained effective internal control
 over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
 material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
 Control Integrated Framework 
 issued
 by the COSO. Also in our opinion, ERHC maintained, in all material respects,
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006,
 based on criteria established in Internal
 Control Integrated Framework 
 issued
 by the COSO.

REPORT
 OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
 the
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 ERHC
 Energy Inc. 

 Houston,
 Texas 

We
 have
 audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ERHC Energy Inc., a
 corporation in the development stage, as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 and
 the
 related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
 the responsibility of ERHC s management. Our responsibility is to express
 an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
 we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
 the
 financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
 in
 the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
 evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
 our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
 our
 opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
 in all material respects, the financial position of ERHC as of September 30,
 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
 years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
 in
 the United States of America. 

We
 have
 also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
 Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of ERHC s internal control
 over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established
 in Internal
 Control - Integrated Framework 
 issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
 and our report dated November 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
 management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and an
 unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
 reporting.

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For
 the Years Ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and for the Period
 from
 Inception, 

September
 5, 1995, to September 30,
 2006 

Note
 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

General
 Business and Nature of Operations 

ERHC
 Energy Inc. is an independent oil and gas company that reports as a development
 stage enterprise because there are currently no significant operations and
 no
 revenue has been generated from business activities. ERHC was formed in 1986,
 as
 a Colorado corporation, and was engaged in a variety of businesses until 1996,
 when it began its current operations as an independent oil and gas
 company. ERHC s goal is to maximize its value through exploration and
 exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Guinea offshore of central
 West Africa. ERHC s current focus is to exploit its assets, which are rights to
 working interests in exploration acreage in the Joint Development Zone JDZ between the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome Principe DRSTP and the
 Federal Republic of Nigeria FRN and in the exclusive territorial waters of
 Sao Tome (the Exclusive Economic Zone or EEZ ). ERHC has formed
 relationships with upstream oil and gas companies to assist ERHC in exploiting
 its assets in the JDZ as further described in Note 4. ERHC currently has no
 other operations. 

Consolidated
 Financial Statements 

The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ERHC and its wholly
 owned subsidiary after elimination of all significant inter-company accounts
 and
 transactions. 

Use
 of
 estimates 

The
 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.
 S.
 generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated
 financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
 contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
 revenues and expenses during the reporting period for the years then ended.
 Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Cash
 equivalents 

ERHC
 considers all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity
 of
 three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. 

Concentration
 of risks 

ERHC
 primarily transacts its business with two financial institutions. From time
 to
 time the amount on deposit in either one of these institutions may exceed the
 100,000 federally insured limit. The balances are maintained in demand
 accounts to minimize risk. 

ERHC s
 current focus is to exploit its assets, which are agreements with the DRSTP
 concerning oil and gas exploration in EEZ and with the JDA concerning oil and
 gas exploration in the JDZ. ERHC has formed relationships with Sinopec
 International
 Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation Nigeria ("Sinopec"), and Addax
 Energy Nigeria Limited ("Addax Ltd.") to assist ERHC in leveraging its interests
 in the EEZ and the JDZ. Should circumstances impede ERHC from perfecting its
 interests in the 2001 Agreement with DRSTP or the 2003 Option Agreement, ERHC s
 business would be materially affected. Should ERHC perfect its interests in
 the
 2001 Agreement and the 2003 Option Agreement, there is no certainty that ERHC
 will be able to obtain sufficient financial and other resources to develop
 its
 interests. ERHC currently has no other operations.

Properties
 and equipment 

ERHC
 uses
 the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing
 activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved
 properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including
 geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved
 properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs, are expensed. Development
 costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful
 exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
 Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the
 determination of whether a well has found proved reserves. A determination
 of
 whether a well has found proved reserves is made shortly after drilling is
 completed. The determination is based on a process that relies on
 interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, and engineering data. If
 a
 well is determined to be successful, the capitalized drilling costs will be
 reclassified as part of the cost of the well. If a well is determined to be
 unsuccessful, the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to expense in
 the
 period the determination is made. If an exploratory well requires a major
 capital expenditure before production can begin, the cost of drilling the
 exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination
 of whether proved reserves have been found only as long as: i) the well has
 found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing
 well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii) drilling of the
 additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future.
 If drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned, or if the well
 has
 not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves, the exploratory well
 is assumed to be impaired, and its costs are charged to expense. 

In
 the
 absence of a determination as to whether the reserves that have been found
 can
 be classified as proved, the costs of drilling such an exploratory well is
 not
 carried as an asset for more than one year following completion of drilling.
 If,
 after that year has passed, a determination that proved reserves exist cannot
 be
 made, the well is assumed to be impaired, and its costs are charged to expense.
 Its costs can, however, continue to be capitalized if sufficient quantities
 of
 reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing
 well and sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well's
 economic and operating feasibility. 

The
 impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is
 reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net
 cash flows is less than the net book value. ERHC determines if impairment has
 occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review
 of
 all fields. 

Development
 costs of proved oil and gas properties, including estimated dismantlement,
 restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs, are depreciated and
 depleted on a field basis by the units-of-production method using proved
 developed and proved reserves, respectively. The costs of unproved oil and
 gas
 properties are generally combined and impaired over a period that is based
 on
 the average holding period for such properties and the Company's experience
 of
 successful drilling. 

Asset
 Retirement Obligation 

ERHC s
 asset retirement obligation ARO relates to the plugging and abandonment of
 certain oil and gas properties in Wichita Falls, Texas. The provisions of SFAS
 No. 143 require the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
 to be recorded and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the
 associated asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the initially
 recognized asset retirement cost is depleted over the useful life of the asset.
 If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes, an
 adjustment is recorded to the retirement obligation and the asset retirement
 cost. The offsetting ARO liability is recorded at fair value, and accretion
 expense recognized as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected
 settlement value. The fair value of the ARO asset and liability is measured
 using expected future cash out flows discounted at the Company s credit adjusted
 risk free interest rate. These oil and gas properties were abandoned and written
 off during the year ended September 30, 1999 and the current liability is fully
 accreted and represents management s best estimate of the fair value of the
 outstanding obligation. 

Impairment
 of long-lived assets 

ERHC
 evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets when events and circumstances
 indicate that such assets might be impaired. ERHC determines impairment by
 comparing the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by these
 assets to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments are charged to
 operations in the period to which events and circumstances indicate that such
 assets might be impaired. ERHC has evaluated its investment in its DRSTP
 concession fee in light of its 2003 Option Agreement (see Note 4) and there
 have
 been no events or circumstances that would indicate that such asset might be
 impaired.

Income
 taxes 

ERHC
 accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 109 - Accounting
 for Income Taxes, 
which
 provides for an asset and liability approach in accounting for income
 taxes. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
 recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences, using currently enacted
 tax laws, attributable to differences between financial statement carrying
 amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 

Common
 stock issued for goods received and services rendered 

ERHC
 has
 issued shares of common stock for goods received and services rendered. The
 costs of the goods or services are valued according to the terms of relative
 agreements or market value on the date of obligation. The cost of the goods
 or
 services has been charged to operations. 

Net
 income (loss) per share 

Basic
 net
 income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
 weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by
 the
 weighted average number of shares outstanding, after giving effect to
 potentially dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the
 period. Potentially dilutive common share equivalents are not included in
 the computation of diluted income (loss) per share if they are
 anti-dilutive. Diluted income (loss) per common share is the same as basic
 for all periods presented because the effect of potentially dilutive common
 shares arising from outstanding stock warrants and options was
 anti-dilutive. For the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004
 the potentially dilutive common shares from stock options and warrants were
 5,346,423, 5,074,847 and 5,395,813 respectively. If all convertible debt
 instruments, including accrued interest were to be considered, an additional
 192,680, 167,565 and 65,492,921 common shares for the years ended
 September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, may have been dilutive
 depending on the results of operations. 

Stock-based
 compensation 

On
 October 1, 2005, ERHC began recording compensation expense associated with
 stock
 options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with Statement
 of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, as interpreted
 by
 SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Prior to October 1, 2005, ERHC had
 accounted for stock options according to the provisions of Accounting Principles
 Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
 interpretations, and therefore no related compensation expense was recorded
 for
 awards granted with no intrinsic value. ERHC adopted the modified prospective
 transition method provided for under SFAS No. 123R, and consequently, has not
 retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this transition method,
 compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in the first quarter
 of Fiscal 2006 includes: 1) quarterly amortization related to the remaining
 unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to October 1, 2005,
 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
 provisions of SFAS No. 123; and 2) quarterly amortization related to all stock
 option awards granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
 value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. 

As
 referred to in Note 9, ERHC changed the exercise price of 3,000,000 options
 effective January 1, 2005. Such options for which the exercise price has been
 changed are referred to as re-priced options and are accounted for as
 compensatory options using variable accounting treatments in accordance with
 FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
 Based Compensation - an Interpretation of APB No. 25. Under variable plan
 accounting, compensation expense is adjusted for increases or decreases in
 the
 fair market value of ERHC s common stock to the extent that the market value
 exceeds the exercise price of the option. Variable plan accounting was applied
 to the re-priced options until the options were exercised in June 2006.

Had
 compensation costs for the stock options granted to an employee been determined
 based on the fair value at the grant date for the year ending September 30,
 2005
 and 2004, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the net loss and
 net loss per share would have been reflective of the pro forma amounts indicated
 below:

The
 weighted average fair value at date of grant for options re-priced during the
 fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 0.38. The fair value of options at
 date of grant was estimated using the Black-Sholes option-pricing model with
 the
 following weighted average assumptions:

The
 Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for estimating the fair
 value
 of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
 Because option valuation models require the use of subjective assumptions,
 changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the
 options. The Company s options do not have the characteristics of traded
 options; therefore, the option valuation models do not necessarily provide
 a
 reliable measure of the fair value of its options. 

New
 accounting pronouncements 

In
 May
 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
 replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 . This statement
 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in
 accounting principle. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in
 accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting
 pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
 specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes
 and
 corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
 Adoption of SFAS 154 is not expected to have an effect on the Company s
 consolidated financial statements. 

In
 June
 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
 Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN
 No. 48 ). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
 income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance
 with Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48
 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
 statement recognition and measurement classification, accounting for interest
 and penalties and accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions
 of FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
 December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN No.
 48 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of
 operations.

Reclassifications 

During
 the year ended September 30, 2005, ERHC corrected a 1,222,153 understatement
 in
 the number of shares of common stock outstanding that has consistently existed
 for many years. The shares were issued at a time when the stock had no
 significant value and, accordingly, the correction of outstanding shares
 resulted in a 122 increase in common stock and a corresponding decrease in
 additional paid-in capital. All periods presented have been corrected to include
 these additional shares.

 - Revision to Financial Statements 

ERHC
 has
 revised its financial statements to report as a development stage company for
 the year ended September 30, 2006. Accordingly, the statements of operations,
 stockholders equity and cash flows include inception to date amounts. The
 consolidated statements of stockholders equity (deficit) of the Company for the
 years from inception (September 5, 1995) through September 30, 1998 were audited
 by other auditors who are no longer members of the PCAOB and whose reports
 for
 each of the years ended from inception (September 5, 1995) through September
 30,
 1998 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

Note 5
 - DRSTP Concession Fee 

As
 described in Note 4 ERHC sold various participating interests in Blocks 2,
 3 and 4 for total cash proceeds of 45,900,000. ERHC
 agreed to pay a 3,000,000 cash success fee 1,500,000 was paid in March 2006
 and the remaining 1,500,000 is included
 in accounts payable at September 30, 2006) to Feltang International Inc., a
 British Virgin Island company that was responsible for obtaining Sinopec s
 participation in Block 2. ERHC also will issue to Feltang 5,250,000 shares
 of
 common stock and warrants to purchase 6,500,000 shares at an exercise price
 of
 0.355 per share. The common stock was valued at 4,803,750 (included in
 accounts payable at September 30, 2006) based on the quoted market value of
 the
 common stock on the date Sinopec signed the production sharing agreement. The
 warrants were valued at 5,154,500 based on a valuation using the Black-Scholes
 Option Pricing Model and the following assumptions; market price of 0.915,
 strike price of 0.355, volatility of 115 , interest rate of 4.42 , dividend
 yield of 0 and expected life of 4 years. Following is an analysis of the sale

Note 6
 - Notes Payable 

Convertible
 Debt - Non-Related Party 

At
 September 30, 2006, ERHC had 33,513 of nonaffiliated convertible debt and
 5,032 accrued but unpaid interest outstanding. At September 30, 2006, the
 note
 was in default and ERHC has been unable to locate the payee. If the outstanding
 convertible debt were converted using the conversion price of 0.20 per share,
 ERHC would be required to issue 192,725 shares of common stock based on an
 outstanding principal amount of 33,513 and accrued interest of 5,032. During
 the year ended September 30, 2005, non-affiliated note holders agreed to convert
 1,592,520 of convertible debt and 84,850 of accrued interest into 8,386,855
 shares of common stock. The conversion price was 0.20 per share. 

Convertible
 Debt - Related Party 

At
 September 30, 2006, ERHC had no affiliated debt outstanding. During the year
 ended September 30, 2005, ERHC had convertible debt instruments with Chrome
 Energy, L.L.C., a related party totaling 8,969,420, bearing interest at rates
 ranging from 5.5 to 20 . Certain of the maturity dates on these notes had
 been
 extended and all were converted during the year ended September 30,
 2005. 

During
 2005, ERHC restructured outstanding debt to Chrome totaling 10,134,084 and
 enter into a new 2,500,000 working capital line of credit. To facilitate the
 debt restructuring, ERHC issued 14,023,352 shares of common stock; 12,465,202
 shares immediately, 623,260 shares on the advance of 1,000,000 and the
 remaining 934,890 shares upon receipt of the additional 1,500,000 available
 under the working capital line. In addition, ERHC issued 12,308,560 shares
 of
 common stock to satisfy current interest accrued but not paid of 2,461,712
 on
 the notes that were consolidated into the new 10,134,084 note. 

Pursuant
 to the debt restructure, ERHC issued a 12 note with a principal amount of
 10,134,084, to be settled at the option of ERHC at 0.175 per share, and
 expiring on January 31, 2007. ERHC also issued a 10 working capital line of
 credit of 2,500,000 to be settled at ERHC s option at 0.175 per share. When
 the working capital line of credit was fully funded in January 2005, there
 was
 12,634,084 of principal outstanding under these two notes.

On
 January 28, 2005, ERHC exercised its right to convert the two new notes dated
 at
 December 15, 2004 in favor of Chrome, with a principal balance of 10,134,084
 and accrued interest at January 28, 2005 of 146,597, and the note dated at
 December 15, 2004, in favor of Chrome with an original principal amount of
 2,500,000 and accrued interest at January 28, 2005 of 11,986. ERHC issued
 to
 Chrome 73,100,954 shares of ERHC common stock in conversion of the entire
 outstanding principal and accrued interest of these notes. The Notes were
 converted at 0.175 per share. 

Note 7
 - Accrued Salaries 

At
 September 30, 2004, ERHC had accrued salaries of 723,035, owed to former
 Officers. The amounts and rights claimed by these officers were subject to
 lawsuits in which ERHC negotiated final settlements in 2005. During 2005, ERHC
 paid 76,275 and issued 595,000 shares of common stock valued at 394,450 to
 fully settle these claims. ERHC recognized a 252,310 gain in connection with
 the settlement. 

Note 8
 - Income Taxes 

At
 September 30, 2005 ERHC had a consolidated net operating loss carry-forward
 NOL of approximately 63.6 million expiring through 2025. ERHC had a
 deferred tax asset of approximately 21.8 million resulting from this NOL. 
The loss carry forwards are subject to certain limitations under the Internal
 Revenue Code including Section 382 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. During the
 year ended September 30, 2006, ERHC recognized a significant gain on the sale
 of
 various participation interests (see Note 5), which utilized a substantial
 portion of the current net operating loss carry-forwards. The net operating
 loss
 carry-forward was also adjusted to remove losses limited under Section 382.

The
 composition of deferred tax assets and the related tax effects at September
 30,
 2006 and September 30, 2005 are as follows:

 and
 accrued interest on convertible debt notes. During the year ended September
 30,
 2006, there were no shares issued for the conversion of convertible debt. During
 the year ended September 30, 2005, non-affiliated note holders converted

 14,023,352 shares of common stock, 12,465,202 issued immediately, 623,260 shares
 issued on the advance of 1,000,000 and the remaining 934,890 shares upon
 receipt of an additional 1,500,000 available under the working capital line.
 In
 addition, ERHC issued 12,308,359 shares of common stock to satisfy current
 interest accrued but not paid of 2,461,712. The shares of common stock to
 Chrome for entering into the debt restructuring had a fair value of 5,749,575
 and have been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt. 

During
 the year ended September 30, 2005, ERHC issued 73,100,954 shares of common
 stock
 to Chrome for conversion of all of its debt representing 12,634,084 of

Stock
 Options Issued and Re-Priced 

On
 January 1, 2005, ERHC issued options to purchase a total of 1,750,000 shares
 of
 common stock, upon completion of a full year of service to three consultants
 as
 part of their initial compensation packages. These options have an exercise
 price of 0.20 per share and vest on December 31, 2005. These options were
 exercised, on a cashless basis, during the year ended September 30, 2006, for
 a
 total of 1,339,030 shares. 

During
 the year ended September 30, 2005, ERHC modified the exercise price of 3,000,000
 options granted to one employee from 0.30 per share to 0.20 per share, which
 made those options subject to variable plan accounting. Under variable plan
 accounting, compensation expense is adjusted for increases or decreases in
 the
 fair market value of ERHC s common stock to the extent that the market value
 exceeds the new exercise price of the option. Variable plan accounting is
 applied to the re-priced options until the options are exercised, forfeited,
 or
 expire unexercised. For the year ended September 30, 2005, ERHC incurred
 additional expense of 194,737 as a result of an upward change in the fair
 market value on the underlying common stock. In January 2006, 1,000,000 of
 these
 options were cancelled upon the resignation of the employee and a reduction
 to
 expense of 60,660 was recognized in fiscal 2006. The remaining 2,000,000
 options were exercised, on a cashless basis, in June 2006 and 1,272,727 shares
 were issued.

Legal
 Proceedings 

On
 May 4,
 2006, a Federal court search warrant sought various records including, among
 other matters, documents, if any, related to correspondence with foreign
 governmental officials or entities in Sao Tome and Nigeria. ERHC continues
 to
 cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation. 

Related
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoenas issued on May 9 and
 August 26, 2006 also requested a range of documents. ERHC has responded to
 both
 subpoenas. 

During
 October 2006, Lakeshore Capital Limited filed an arbitration claim against
 ERHC
 seeking 4,400,000 for the alleged value of 4,500,000 shares of ERHC common
 stock and for a warrant to purchase 1,500,000 shares at an exercise price of
 .20 per share, including interest and costs. Lakeshore claims it is owed
 this sum for services previously rendered under a contract with ERHC. ERHC
 believes that Lakeshore s claim is entirely without merit and intends to
 vigorously defend all Lakeshore claims. 

From
 time
 to time, ERHC may be subject to routine litigation, claims, or disputes in
 the
 ordinary course of business which, in the opinion of management, should not
 have
 a materially adverse effect on ERHC s financial position. 

Employment
 and Consulting Agreements 

On
 January 23, 2006, ERHC hired Feltang, as discussed in Note 5. 

From
 August 1, 2004 until January 20, 2006, Ali Memon was ERHC s President and Chief
 Executive Officer. Mr. Memon had a three-year employment agreement that
 originally included a base salary of 150,000 per year. On January 20, 2006,
 by
 mutual agreement with the Board of Directors, Ali Memon resigned both positions.
 Under Mr. Memon s employment agreement, ERHC has expensed the remaining net
 salary to be paid, of which 175,000 remains in accounts payable at September
 30, 2006. This amount will be paid out through the remainder of the contract
 term. 

On
 January 21, 2006, the Board of Directors appointed Walter Brandhuber as Director
 and Chief Executive Officer. On March 20, 2006, the Board of Directors appointed
 Franklin Ihekwoaba as Chief Financial Officer. On July 24, 2006, both resigned.
 The Board of Directors appointed Board Member Nicolae Luca as Interim Chief
 Executive Officer until a successor is named. Mr. Luca has served as a
 Non-Executive Director since February 2001. Mr. Luca currently receives no
 cash
 compensation but is reimbursed for related travel and business
 expenses. 

On
 January 1, 2005, ERHC hired an individual who requires monthly payment of cash
 and the issuance of options for a total of 500,000 shares of common stock upon
 a
 full year of service. The options issued under this consulting agreement vested
 on December 31, 2005 and included provisions for cashless exercise. These
 options were exercised in April 2006, on a cashless basis, for 388,889 shares.
 Either party may terminate this consulting agreement with 30 days
 notice.

 shares. This agreement was terminated on January 1, 2006. 

During
 May 2003, ERHC hired an individual for general consulting services, including
 transaction support and evaluation of geological and seismic data. The agreement
 has been revised several times. The most recent revision became effective on
 April 1, 2006 and terminates on September 30, 2006. The consultant s
 compensation was 2,000 per month revised from 10,000 per month effective
 April
 2005. During the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total expense

Management
 Services Agreement 

ERHC
 entered into a management services agreement with Chrome Oil Services, Ltd.
 COS in February 2001. Pursuant to that agreement, COS provided
 management and business development services in addition to providing specified
 services in the areas of refinery maintenance, engineering design, and upstream
 oil industry services. COS provided these services for a management fee of
 68,000 per month. Former Chief Financial Officer Mr. Okpala and Corporate
 Secretary, Mr. Ntephe were consultants of COS that provided services to ERHC
 and
 these persons received salaries and overhead expense reimbursement
 from COS, not from ERHC. Expenses not covered under the management services
 agreement were borne by the Company. Total management fees incurred during
 the
 years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 0, 204,000 and 816,000,
 respectively. On December 23, 2004, ERHC and COS cancelled the

 The
 registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and

 have: 

a)
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
 controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
 material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
 subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
 during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b)
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal

5.
 The
 registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most
 recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
 registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s Board of Directors
 (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a)
 All
 significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
 of
 internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
 adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and
 report financial information; and 

b)
 Any
 fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
 who
 have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
 reporting.
