 PART I Forward-Looking Statements: From time to time, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC or the Corporation) has made and may continue to make written or oral forward-looking statements regarding our
outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels and ratios, liquidity levels, asset levels, asset quality, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting PNC and its future business and operations or the impact of legal,
regulatory or supervisory matters on our business operations or performance. This Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Report or Form 10-K) also includes forward-looking statements. With respect to all such forward-looking statements, you should review
our Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A, our Risk Management, Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgments, and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information sections included in Item 7, and Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24
Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 

ITEM 1 B USINESS 
 B USINESS O VERVIEW Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and
institutional banking, asset management, and residential mortgage banking, providing many of our products and services nationally, as well as products and services in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey,
Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally. At
December 31, 2012, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders equity were 305.1 billion, 213.1 billion and 39.0 billion, respectively. We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have
diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through internal growth, strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries. 
 RBC B ANK (USA) A CQUISITION On March 2, 2012, we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of RBC Bank (USA), the U.S. retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada. As part of the acquisition, PNC also
purchased a credit card portfolio from RBC Bank (Georgia), National Association. PNC paid 3.6 billion in cash as the consideration for the acquisition of both RBC Bank (USA) and the credit card portfolio. The transaction added approximately 18.1
billion in deposits, 14.5 billion of loans and 1.1 billion of goodwill and intangible assets to PNC s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of business activity associated with the RBC Bank (USA)
acquisition subsequent to March 2, 2012. RBC Bank (USA), based in Raleigh, North Carolina, operated more than 400 branches in North
Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and South Carolina. The primary reasons for the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) were to enhance

shareholder value, to improve PNC s competitive position in the financial services industry, and to further expand PNC s existing branch network in the states where it currently
operates as well as expanding into new markets. S ALE OF S MARTSTREET 
 Effective October 26, 2012, PNC divested certain deposits and assets of the Smartstreet business unit, which was acquired by PNC as part of the RBC
Bank (USA) acquisition, to Union Bank, N.A. Smartstreet is a nationwide business focused on homeowner or community association managers and had approximately 1 billion of assets and deposits as of September 30, 2012. The gain on sale was
immaterial and we reduced goodwill and core deposit intangibles of 46 million and 13 million, respectively. F LAGSTAR 
B RANCH A CQUISITION Effective December 9, 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern metropolitan
Atlanta, Georgia area from Flagstar Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. We assumed approximately 210 million of deposits associated with these branches. No loans were acquired in the transaction. 
 B ANK A TLANTIC B RANCH A CQUISITION 
 Effective June 6, 2011, PNC acquired 19 branches in the greater Tampa, Florida area from BankAtlantic, a subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. We
assumed approximately 324 million of deposits associated with these branches. No loans were acquired in the transaction. 
 R EVIEW O F B USINESS S EGMENTS In addition to the following information relating to our lines of business, we incorporate the information under the captions Business Segment Highlights, Product Revenue, and Business Segments Review in
Item 7 of this Report here by reference. Also, we include the financial and other information by business in Note 26 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report here by reference.

same basis. Business segment information does not include PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. (GIS). Results of operations of GIS through June 30, 2010 and the related after-tax gain on its
sale in the third quarter of 2010 are reflected in discontinued operations. Retail Banking provides deposit, lending,
brokerage, investment management and cash management services to consumer and small business customers within our primary geographic markets. Our customers are serviced through our branch network, call centers, online banking and mobile channels.
The branch network is principally located in our primary geographical markets. Our core strategy is to acquire and retain customers who
maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with PNC. We also seek revenue growth by deepening our share of our customers financial assets, including savings and liquidity deposits, loans and investable assets, including
retirement assets. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels while continuing to optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we have a disciplined process to continually improve the
engagement of both our employees and customers, which is a strong indicator of customer growth, retention and relationship expansion.

 Residential Mortgage Banking directly originates primarily first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis with a
significant presence within the retail banking footprint, and also originates loans through majority owned affiliates. Mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate. These loans are typically
underwritten to government agency and/or third-party standards, and sold, servicing retained, to secondary mortgage conduits of Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal Home Loan Banks and
third-party investors, or are securitized and issued under the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) program, as described in more detail in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in Item 8 of this
Report and included here by reference. The mortgage servicing operation performs all functions related to servicing mortgage loans, primarily those in first lien position, for various investors and for loans owned by PNC. Certain loan applications
are brokered by majority owned affiliates to others. Residential Mortgage Banking is focused on adding value to the PNC franchise by building
stronger customer relationships, providing quality investment loans, and delivering acceptable returns consistent with a moderate risk philosophy. Our national distribution capability provides volume that drives economies of scale, risk dispersion,

S UPERVISION AND R EGULATION 
 O VERVIEW 
 PNC is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended (BHC Act) and a financial holding company under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 22
Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments and
require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank
subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy requirements. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by, among other regulatory bodies, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which result in examination reports and ratings (which are not publicly available) that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. The results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the
imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among
other things, that such operations are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with the regulations or supervisory policies of the agency. This supervisory framework could materially
impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a new agency established by
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), is responsible for examining PNC Bank, N.A. and its affiliates (including PNC) for compliance with most consumer financial protection laws and for enforcing such laws with
respect to PNC Bank, N.A. and its affiliates. This authority previously was exercised by the OCC and the Federal Reserve. The CFPB also now has authority for prescribing rules governing the provision of consumer financial products and services such
as credit cards, student and other loans, deposits and residential mortgages. The agency has issued final regulations that impose broad new

requirements relating to our mortgage origination activities and the servicing activities we perform for residential mortgage loans. These regulations include a requirement that residential
mortgage lenders, like PNC Bank, make a good faith and reasonable determination at or before the time of consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the prospective borrower has a reasonable ability to repay that loan. The new
regulations also include broad new requirements applicable to servicers of residential mortgage loans, like PNC, which include provisions requiring policies and procedures relating to how servicers respond to and manage loans of borrowers who are in
default. Most of these regulations are scheduled to take effect in January of 2014. In addition, the CFPB is now considering additional regulations that will modify the application and closing disclosures that must be provided to borrowers in
connection with residential mortgage loans. As a result of Dodd-Frank, after July 21, 2011, subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A. are subject
to state law and regulation to the same extent as if they were not subsidiaries of a national bank. Additionally, based on Dodd-Frank, state authorities may assert that certain state consumer financial laws that provide different requirements or
limitations than Federal law may apply to national banks, including PNC Bank, N.A. Such state laws may be preempted if they meet certain standards set forth in Dodd-Frank or other applicable law. We expect to experience an increase in regulation of
our Retail Banking, Asset Management Group and Residential Mortgage Banking businesses and additional compliance obligations, revenue and cost impacts. We also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public company and by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our
banking and securities businesses with operations outside the United States, including those conducted by BlackRock, are also subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business. 
 As a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of
our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and certain of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to
conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets and deposits, or reconfigure existing operations. We anticipate new
legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. These initiatives would be in addition to the actions already taken by Congress and the
regulators, including the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009

(Credit CARD Act), the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (the SAFE Act), and Dodd-Frank, as well as changes to the regulations implementing the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, including the new rules set forth in Regulation E related to overdraft charges. Dodd-Frank, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, comprehensively reforms the regulation of financial institutions, products and services. Dodd-Frank requires various federal regulatory
agencies to implement numerous new rules and regulations. Because the federal agencies are granted broad discretion in drafting these rules and regulations, and many implementing rules either have not yet been issued or have only been issued in
proposed form, many of the details and much of the impact of Dodd-Frank may not be known for many months or years. Among other things, Dodd-Frank provides for new capital standards that eliminate the treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1
regulatory capital; requires that deposit insurance assessments be calculated based on an insured depository institution s assets rather than its insured deposits; raises the minimum Designated Reserve Ratio (the balance in the Deposit
Insurance Fund divided by estimated insured deposits) to 1.35 ; establishes a comprehensive regulatory regime for the derivatives activities of financial institutions; limits proprietary trading and owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private
equity funds by banking entities; requires the Federal Reserve to establish a variety of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total assets; places limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit
card transactions; and establishes new minimum mortgage underwriting standards for residential mortgages. Dodd-Frank established the
10-member inter-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is charged with identifying systemic risks and strengthening the regulation of financial holding companies and certain non-bank companies deemed to be systemically
important and could, in extraordinary cases and in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, break up financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. Dodd-Frank also requires the Federal
Reserve to establish prudential standards for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion that are more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to bank holding companies with assets
below this threshold, and that increase in stringency for bank holding companies that present heightened risk to the financial system. Additional information concerning these enhanced prudential standards is provided in Item 1A Risk
Factors of this Report. The FSOC may make recommendations to the Federal Reserve concerning the establishment and refinement of these prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements.

Legislative and regulatory developments to date, as well as those that come in the future, have had and are
likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. The more detailed description of the significant regulations to which we are subject included in this Report is based on the current regulatory environment and is subject to
potentially material change. See also the additional information included in Item 1A of this Report under the risk factors discussing the impact of financial regulatory reform initiatives, including Dodd-Frank and regulations promulgated to
implement it, on the regulatory environment for PNC and the financial services industry. Among other areas that have been receiving a high
level of regulatory focus over the last several years are compliance with anti-money laundering laws and the protection of confidential customer information. In addition, at least in part driven by the current economic and financial situation, there
is an increased focus on fair lending and other issues related to the mortgage industry. Ongoing mortgage-related regulatory reforms include measures aimed at reducing mortgage foreclosures. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the CFPB, the SEC, the CFTC, other federal and state regulatory
authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of our businesses. The profitability of our businesses could
also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. 
 There are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion
is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to us. To a substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and supervision of financial services institutions and their holding
companies is not to protect our shareholders and our non-customer creditors, but rather to protect our customers (including depositors) and the financial markets in general.

B ANKING R EGULATION AND 
S UPERVISION Capital Regulations . PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. are subject to the regulatory capital
requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. In addition, PNC is subject to the Federal Reserve s capital plan rule and annual capital stress testing and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. As
part of this annual capital planning process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (BHCs), including PNC, that have 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. This capital
adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating BHC to the Federal Reserve that describes the company s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the
results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a severely stressed scenario provided by the Federal Reserve (supervisory severely adverse scenario). In
evaluating a BHC s capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including the company s risk profile, the strength of the company s internal capital assessment process, and whether the company s projected pro
forma Basel I Tier 1 common capital ratio under the hypothetical supervisory severely adverse scenario would remain above 5 percent throughout the nine quarter planning horizon even if the company continued with the capital distributions proposed
under a baseline scenario. In addition, the Federal Reserve evaluates a company s projected path towards compliance with the proposed Basel III regulatory capital framework. After completing its review, the Federal Reserve may object or not
object to the firm s proposed capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. 
 In connection with the 2013 CCAR, PNC filed its capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of September 30, 2012 with the
Federal Reserve on January 7, 2013. PNC expects to receive the Federal Reserve s response (either a non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2013 CCAR by March 15, 2013. The Federal Reserve also has
announced that it intends to publish on this date the results of its assessments, including the Federal Reserve s estimates of the Basel I capital ratios for each of the largest 19 BHCs participating in the 2013 reviews, including PNC, during
the review period under the Federal Reserve s severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the firm s proposed base case capital distributions. Prior to this release, the Federal Reserve will release on March 7, 2013 its
estimate of the Basel I capital ratios, as well as its estimate of certain revenue and loss information, for such BHCs under the same supervisory severely adverse scenario but applying the common assumptions concerning capital distributions by firms
established by the Federal Reserve for the stress tests required by Dodd-Frank
(Dodd- 

Frank capital action assumptions). PNC also is required to publicly disclose, in March 2013, its estimates of certain capital, revenue and loss information under the same hypothetical supervisory
severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the Dodd-Frank capital action assumptions. Federal Reserve regulations also require that PNC and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate mid-year stress test using financial data as
of March 31 st and three company-derived
macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario in September. The Federal banking agencies have requested comment on proposed rules to implement the Basel III capital framework in the United States. These rules have not yet been finalized and remain subject to
change. For additional information on these proposed rules, see Recent Market and Industry Developments in Item 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report. PNC s estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 7.5 at
December 31, 2012, excluding the benefits of the transitional phase-in periods provided by Basel III. This estimate is based on management s understanding of the Basel III proposed rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies in June
2012 and on available data and information as of December 31, 2012. It also reflects our estimates of PNC s risk-weighted assets under Basel II (with the modifications proposed in June 2012) and application of the Basel II.5 market risk
rules that became effective on January 1, 2013. Both our Basel II and Basel III estimates are point in time estimates and are subject to further regulatory guidance and clarity, as well as the development, refinement, validation and regulatory
approval of internal models. Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends . The principal source of our liquidity at the parent
company level is dividends from PNC Bank, N.A. PNC Bank, N.A. is subject to various federal restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent. PNC Bank, N.A. is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of
credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company
liquidity and on certain contractual restrictions is also available in the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section and the Trust Preferred Securities portion of the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest
Entities section of Item 7 of this Report, and in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 
 Federal Reserve rules provide that a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit
resources to support such banks if necessary. Consistent with the source of strength

policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net
income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the 2013 CCAR, discussed above, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects capital plans submitted in 2013 will reflect conservative dividend payout ratios and net share repurchase
programs, and that requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30 of projected after-tax net income available to common shareholders will receive particularly close scrutiny. The Federal Reserve also has stated that it expects BHCs that
meet the minimum capital ratio requirements under Basel III during the transition periods provided by Basel III, but that do not meet the fully-phased in Basel III minimum plus capital conservation buffer ratio of 7 percent Tier 1 common (plus any
applicable capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks), to maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting this standard in accordance with the phase-in schedule included in the agencies proposed Basel III
rules. Additional Powers Under the GLB Act . The Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLB Act) permits a qualifying bank holding
company to become a financial holding company and thereby engage in, or affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. Permitted affiliates
include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature or incidental
thereto or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000. In order to be and remain a financial holding company, a
bank holding company and its subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed. In addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity if any of its insured
depository institutions received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 
 The Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator of a financial holding company, with its operating entities, such as its subsidiary
broker-dealers, investment advisers, insurance companies and banks, as well as investment companies advised by investment adviser subsidiaries of the financial holding company, also being subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state
 functional regulators with normal regulatory responsibility for companies in their lines of business.

As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally
allowed to conduct new financial activities, and PNC is generally permitted to acquire non-bank financial companies that have less than 10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve. In addition, our non-bank subsidiaries
(and any financial subsidiaries of subsidiary banks) are permitted to engage in certain activities that were not permitted for bank holding companies and banks prior to enactment of the GLB Act, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain
activities that were previously permitted. Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. 
 In addition, the GLB Act permits national banks, such as PNC Bank, N.A., to engage in expanded activities through the formation of a financial
subsidiary. PNC Bank, N.A. has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank, N.A. may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary
in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve. Certain activities, however, are impermissible for a financial subsidiary
of a national bank, including certain insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities, real estate investment or development, and merchant banking. Other Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision . The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository
institution and its holding company. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, 
 significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Generally, the smaller an institution s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the
agencies powers, ultimately permitting the agencies to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be influenced by an institution s capital classification. For instance, only a well capitalized 
depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an adequately capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits only with prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2012, PNC
Bank, N.A. exceeded the required ratios for classification as well capitalized. For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, we refer you to the Funding and Capital Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Laws and regulations limit the scope of our permitted activities and investments. National banks (such as PNC Bank,

N.A.) and their operating subsidiaries generally may engage only in any activities that are determined by the OCC to be part of or incidental to the business of banking, although a financial
subsidiary may engage in a broader range of activities as described above. Moreover, examination ratings of 3 or lower, lower
capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors, can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank holding company to engage in
new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities. The
Federal Reserve s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares of any
bank or thrift, or to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company or thrift holding company. The BHC Act enumerates the factors the Federal Reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of bank holding companies or the acquisition of
banks. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the
transaction on financial stability of the United States; the organizations compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of
the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. OCC prior approval is
required for PNC Bank, N.A. to acquire another insured bank or thrift by merger. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve. Our ability
to grow through acquisitions could be limited by these approval requirements. At December 31, 2012, PNC Bank, N.A. was rated
 Outstanding with respect to CRA. Because of PNC s ownership interest in BlackRock, BlackRock is subject to the supervision
and regulation of the Federal Reserve. FDIC Insurance . PNC Bank, N.A. is insured by the FDIC and subject to premium
assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are risk based. Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower
capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank. A negative

evaluation by the FDIC or a bank s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks
in a lower risk category. Under Dodd-Frank, in April 2011, the deposit insurance base calculation shifted from deposits to average assets less Tier 1 capital. This methodology change did not materially impact the premiums due to the FDIC for PNC.
 CFPB Regulation and Supervision . Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to examine PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. for compliance with a
broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services we offer. In addition, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB
broad authority to take corrective action against PNC Bank, N.A. and PNC as it deems appropriate. The CFPB also has powers that it was assigned in Dodd-Frank to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices
relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. These authorities are in
addition to the authority the CFPB assumed on July 21, 2011 under existing consumer financial law governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. S ECURITIES AND D ERIVATIVES R EGULATION Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Several of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and may provide investment advisory services to clients, other PNC affiliates or related entities, including registered
investment companies. Certain of these advisers are registered as investment advisers to private equity funds under rules adopted under Dodd-Frank. Broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) is the primary self-regulatory organization (SRO) for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations
thereunder. An investment adviser to a registered investment company is also subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations thereunder. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also
are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions. Over the past several years, the SEC and other regulatory agencies
have increased their focus on the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries. Congress and the SEC have adopted

8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

regulatory reforms and are considering additional reforms that have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the extent of regulation of the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries and
impose additional compliance obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with those industries. Under provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and registered investment companies and their
service providers, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct
certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In
addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels,
management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns. Title VII of Dodd-Frank imposes new
comprehensive and significant regulations on the activities of financial institutions that are active in the U.S. over-the-counter OTC derivatives and foreign exchange markets. Title VII was enacted to (i) address systemic risk
issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protection to customers, and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, Title VII: (i) requires the registration
of both swap dealers and major swap participants with one or both of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC (in the case of non security-based swaps) and the SEC (in the case of security-based swaps);
(ii) requires that most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and
margin requirements in excess of historical practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-time public reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers and major swap
participants to new business conduct requirements (including the providing of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks associated with their swap and of material incentives and any conflicts
of interest associated with their swap); and (vi) imposes special duties on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting a swap with a special entity (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political
subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment). Based on the definition of a swap dealer under Title VII, PNC Bank, N.A.
registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer on January 31, 2013. As a result thereof, PNC Bank, N.A. is subject to all of the above-described regulations and

requirements imposed on registered swap dealers, and the CFTC will have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank, N.A. s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. Because of
the limited volume of our security-based swap activities, we have not registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. The above described requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC Bank, N.A.
and will introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). In addition, an investment adviser to private funds or to registered investment companies may be required to register with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator. Registration could impose significant new
regulatory compliance burdens. Presently, we expect our subsidiaries that serve as investment advisers to such entities to be eligible for exemptions from registration as a commodity pool operator. 
 BlackRock has subsidiaries in securities and related businesses subject to SEC, other governmental agencies, state, local and FINRA regulation, as
described above, and a federally chartered nondepository trust company subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock by these agencies and otherwise, we refer you to the
discussion under the Regulation section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained electronically at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 
 C OMPETITION We are
subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and from non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. 
 In making loans, PNC Bank, N.A. competes with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other
non-bank lenders, and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers, hedge funds, mutual fund complexes and private equity firms. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important in the current
environment as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Traditional deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for consumer investment dollars.

ITEM 1A R ISK F ACTORS 
 We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a
financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and are present in the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management
processes to help manage these risks. There are risks that are known to exist at the outset of a transaction. For example, every loan
transaction presents credit risk (the risk that the borrower may not perform in accordance with contractual terms) and market risk (a potential loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movement in market interest rates or credit spreads),
with the nature and extent of these risks principally depending on the financial profile of the borrower and overall economic conditions. We focus on lending that is within the boundaries of our risk framework, and manage these risks by adjusting
the terms and structure of the loans we make and through our oversight of the borrower relationship, as well as through management of our deposits and other funding sources. Risk management is an important part of our business model. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so
that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, technology, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and
reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report. 
 The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, which are described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.
 The possibility of the moderate economic recovery returning to recessionary conditions or of turmoil or volatility in the financial
markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although the United States
economy has shown modest improvement recently, economic conditions continue to pose a risk to financial institutions, including PNC. The economic recovery, although continuing, did so only at a pace in 2012 below trend for other recent recoveries
from recessions. Job growth has not yet been sufficient to significantly reduce high unemployment in the United States. Consumer and business confidence is improving but remains in the cautious zone.

There continues to be concern regarding the possibility of a return to recessionary conditions, as well as regarding the possibility of increased turmoil or volatility in financial markets.
 The recent global recession and disruption of the financial markets has led to concerns over the solvency of certain Eurozone states,
including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, affecting these countries capital markets access, as well as market perception of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to these countries 
creditworthiness. Certain of the major rating agencies have downgraded the sovereign credit ratings of Greece, Portugal and Ireland to below investment grade. The sovereign credit ratings of France, Italy and Spain have also been downgraded. These
ratings downgrades, uncertainties surrounding the implementation of reform programs, the effect of economic contraction, and the Eurozone s financial inter-linkages increase the risk of financial distress spreading to other Eurozone states. If
measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, they may result in a delayed economic recovery, the exit of one or more member states from the Eurozone, or more severe recessionary conditions. If realized,
these risk scenarios could contribute to severe financial market stress or a global recession, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well. Although the so-called fiscal cliff was averted in early 2013, Congress and the President still need to resolve issues with respect to the U.S. government s debt ceiling and other
budgetary and spending matters. Uncertainty as to whether these issues can be resolved or how effective a resolution might be increases the risk of slower economic growth. The nature and ultimate resolution of these issues, or a failure to achieve a
timely and effective resolution, may further adversely affect the U.S. economy through possible consequences including downgrades in the ratings for U.S. Treasury securities, government shutdowns, or substantial spending cuts resulting from
sequestration. Current economic conditions have had an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and may not improve in the
near future. We expect these conditions to continue to have an ongoing negative impact on us and a worsening of conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on us and on others in the
financial services industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with the current economic and market environment:

Investors may have less confidence in the equity markets in general and in financial services industry stocks in particular, which could place downward
pressure on PNC s stock price and resulting market valuation. 

Economic and market developments, in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, may further affect

12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

consumer and business confidence levels and may cause declines in credit usage and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates.

The continuation of the current very low interest rate environment, which is expected to continue at least through mid-year 2015 based on statements by
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also hamper our ability to increase our net interest income. 

Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our
customers become less predictive of future behaviors. 

The process we use to estimate losses in our credit exposures requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including with respect to economic
conditions and how economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. At any point in time or for any length of time, such losses may no longer be capable of accurate estimation, which may, in turn, adversely impact
the reliability of the process for estimating losses and, therefore, the establishment of adequate reserves for those losses. 

We could suffer decreases in customer desire to do business with us, whether as a result of a decreased demand for loans or other financial products
and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with PNC. 

Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current
market conditions, or otherwise. 

A continuation or deterioration of current economic trends may lead to declines in the values of our businesses potentially resulting in goodwill
impairments. 

A lessening of confidence in the creditworthiness of the United States or other governments whose securities we hold could impact the value of those
holdings. 

Increased regulation of compensation at financial services companies as part of government efforts to reform the industry may hinder our ability to
attract, retain and incentivize well-qualified individuals in key positions. 

Investors in mortgage loans and other assets that we sell or sold are more likely to seek indemnification from us against losses or otherwise seek to
have us share in such losses or to request us to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable representations and warranties or other contractual provisions.

We may be subject to additional fees and taxes as the government seeks to recover some of the costs of its recovery efforts, reduce the national debt
or pay for additional government programs, in particular from the financial services industry. The regulatory
environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, including Dodd-Frank and regulations promulgated to implement it. 
 The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry, including
engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to reduce systemic risks and protect consumers and investors. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide
economic stimulus, financial market stability and enhanced regulation of financial services companies and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our bank
supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives will likely increase our costs and reduce our revenue,
and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank) mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Many parts of the law are now in effect and others are now in the implementation stage, which is
likely to continue for several years. The law requires that regulators, some of which are new regulatory bodies created by Dodd-Frank, draft, review and approve more than 300 implementing regulations and conduct numerous studies that are likely to
lead to more regulations, a process that, while well underway, is proceeding somewhat slower than originally anticipated, thus extending the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of Dodd-Frank on us. 
 A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including PNC, do business.

Newly created regulatory bodies include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The CFPB
has been given authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than 10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer protection laws.
The FSOC has been charged with

identifying systemic risks, promoting stronger financial regulation and identifying those non-bank companies that are systemically important and thus should be subject to regulation
by the Federal Reserve. In addition, in extraordinary cases and together with the Federal Reserve, the FSOC could break up financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States.

Dodd-Frank (through provisions commonly known as the Volcker Rule prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in some types of
proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks and their affiliates to sponsor, invest in or have other financial relationships with private equity or hedge funds. In October 2011, four of the five agencies with authority for rulemaking
issued proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule. In January 2012, the fifth agency issued substantially similar proposed rules. The rules set forth a complex and detailed compliance, reporting and monitoring program for large banks, and seek
comments on numerous questions. Although the comment deadline expired in February 2012 on the four agency proposals (and later in 2012 on the single agency proposal), the agencies have not yet issued final rules. The timing and content of the final
rules remain uncertain. The manner in which the questions posed by the proposed rules are addressed by the agencies will have an important influence on the impact of the final rules on PNC. 
 Although PNC no longer has a designated proprietary trading operation, the proposed rules broadly define what constitutes potentially
prohibited proprietary trading, thereby making the scope of the statutory and regulatory exemptions for trading activities, including the exemptions for hedging activities and customer trading, all the more important. Until more is known
about how the final rules will define proprietary trading and the scope of permissible trading activities, it is not possible to determine the impact to PNC of the proprietary trading prohibition. However, any meaningful limitation on
PNC s ability to hedge its risks in the ordinary course or to trade on behalf of customers would likely be adverse to PNC s business and results of operations. In addition, the proposed rules contain extensive compliance and recordkeeping
requirements related to permissible trading activities. Such requirements, if included in a final rule, could increase the costs of hedging or other types of permissible transactions and potentially result in PNC not engaging in certain
transactions, or types of transactions, in which we would otherwise engage. With respect to the restrictions on private
equity and hedge fund activities, as of December 31, 2012, PNC held interests in such funds likely to be covered totaling approximately 859 million including three

sponsored funds with total invested capital of approximately 389 million. PNC expects that over time it will need to eliminate these investments and cease sponsoring these funds, although it is
likely that at least some of these amounts will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required, and the Volcker Rule also permits extensions of the compliance date under some circumstances. A forced sale of some of these
investments due to the Volcker Rule could result in PNC receiving less value than it would otherwise have received. Depending on the provisions of the final rule, it is possible that other structures through which PNC conducts business, such as
operating subsidiaries, joint ventures or securitization vehicles, but that are not typically referred to as private equity or hedge funds, could be restricted, with an impact that cannot now be evaluated. 

Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, in December 2011 the Federal Reserve requested comment on proposed rules that would establish enhanced prudential standards
governing U.S. bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in consolidated total assets covered companies ). The proposed enhanced prudential standards would include, among other things, heightened liquidity risk management
standards; new standards governing oversight by a covered company s board of directors and board-level risk committee; and new limits on the aggregate amount of credit exposure a covered company may have to any single customer or counterparty.
These proposed rules also would establish an early remediation regime for covered companies, under which the Federal Reserve would be required to take increasingly stringent actions against a covered company as its financial condition or
risk management deteriorated as reflected by the company s current or projected post-stress capital levels, compliance with supervisory liquidity and risk management standards and, in some instances, market-based indicators, such as credit
default swap spreads. The comment period on the proposed rules closed in March 2012. Final rules, however, have not been issued, and as such the impact of these rules cannot now be evaluated. 

In addition, the relevant regulatory agencies have proposed rules to implement the Dodd-Frank provisions requiring retention of risk by certain
securitization participants through holding interests in the securitization vehicles, but the rules are not yet finalized or effective. As a result, the ultimate impact of these Dodd-Frank provisions on PNC remains unpredictable. That impact on PNC
could be direct, by requiring PNC to hold interests in a securitization vehicle or other assets that represent a portion of the credit risk of the assets held by the securitization vehicle, or indirect, by impacting markets in which

PNC participates and increasing the costs associated with mortgage assets that we originate. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been and continues to be substantially less
private (that is, non-government backed) securitization activity than had previously been the case. It is unclear at present whether and to what extent the private securitization markets will rebound. In recent years, PNC has only engaged to a
limited extent in securitization transactions under circumstances where we might expect to be required to retain additional risk on our balance sheet as a result of implementation of these Dodd-Frank provisions. If the market for private
securitizations rebounds and PNC decides to increase its participation in that market, we would likely be required under the regulations to retain more risk than would otherwise have been the case, and as a result could be required to consolidate
certain securitization vehicles on our balance sheet, with currently an uncertain financial impact. 

On the indirect impact side, PNC originates loans of a variety of types, including residential and commercial mortgages, credit card, auto, and
student, that historically have commonly been securitized, and PNC is also a significant servicer of residential and commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. PNC anticipates that the risk retention requirements will
impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan products made available, the terms on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for
loans, and the need for third-party loan servicers. It should be noted that the risk retention rules themselves could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets. One effect of having substantially reduced opportunities to
securitize loans would likely be a reduction in the willingness of banks, including PNC, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements. Any of these potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules could affect the way in which
PNC conducts its business, including its product offerings, and could also affect PNC s revenue and profitability, although, as noted above, not in ways that are currently predictable. 

Title VII of Dodd-Frank imposes new comprehensive and significant restrictions on the activities of financial institutions that are active in the U.S.
over-the-counter OTC derivatives and foreign exchange markets. Title VII (i) requires the registration of both swap dealers and major swap participants with one or both of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission CFTC (in the case of non security-based swaps) and the Securities Exchange Commission SEC (in the case of security-based swaps); (ii) requires that most

standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap
participants to capital and margin requirements in excess of current practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-time public reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers
and major swap participants to new business conduct requirements (including an obligation to provide daily marks to counterparties and to disclose to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks associated with a swap and material incentives
and conflicts of interest associated with the swap); and (vi) imposes special duties on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting a swap with a special entity (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or
political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment). Based on the definition of a swap dealer under Title VII, PNC Bank, N.A. registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer effective January 31, 2013. As a result, PNC Bank, N.A.
will be subject to all of the above-described restrictions and the CFTC will have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank, N.A. s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. 
 The above described requirements will collectively impose potentially significant implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC
and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). 

New provisions under Dodd-Frank concerning the applicability of state consumer protection laws to national banks, such as PNC Bank, N.A., became
effective in 2011. Questions may arise as to whether certain state consumer financial laws that may have previously been preempted by federal law are no longer preempted as a result of the effectiveness of these new provisions. Depending on how such
questions are resolved, we may experience an increase in state-level regulation of our retail banking business and additional compliance obligations, revenue impacts and costs. In addition, provisions under Dodd-Frank that also took effect in 2011
permit state attorneys general to bring civil actions against national banks, such as PNC Bank, N.A., for violations of law, as well as regulations issued by the CFPB. 

Dodd-Frank requires bank holding companies that have 50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve, the
FDIC and the FSOC a resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial

distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on PNC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the
company s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of PNC under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additionally could require PNC to divest assets or take other actions if we did not submit an acceptable resolution
plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC also has adopted a rule that requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, N.A., to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC that includes, among
other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. PNC and PNC
Bank, N.A. must file their first plans under these rules by December 31, 2013. Depending on how the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., it is possible that these requirements could affect
the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs. 

Other provisions of Dodd-Frank will affect regulatory oversight, holding company capital requirements, and residential mortgage products.
 While much of how the Dodd-Frank and other financial industry reforms will change our current business operations depends
on the specific regulatory promulgations and interpretations, many of which have yet to be released or finalized, it is clear that the reforms, both under Dodd-Frank and otherwise, will have a significant effect on our entire industry. Although
Dodd-Frank and other reforms will affect a number of the areas in which we do business, it is not clear at this time the full extent of the adjustments that will be required and the extent to which we will be able to adjust our businesses in
response to the requirements. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects at this stage, we believe compliance with Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations and other initiatives will continue to negatively
impact revenue, at least to some extent, and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. 
 New capital and liquidity standards will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater
liquidity than has historically been the case. New and evolving capital and liquidity standards will have a significant effect on banks
and bank holding companies, including PNC. These evolving standards include the

proposals issued by the U.S. banking agencies in June 2012 to implement the Basel III capital framework in the United States and revise the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel
I. The Basel III proposed rules would, among other things, narrow the definition of regulatory capital, require the phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 regulatory capital, establish a new Tier 1 common capital requirement for banking
organizations and revise the capital levels at which a bank would be subject to prompt corrective action. As of December 31, 2012, PNC had 331 million of trust preferred securities included in Tier 1 capital which, under these rules and
Dodd-Frank, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital over time to the extent they remain outstanding. The proposed rules also would require that unconsolidated investments in financial entities (potentially including PNC s investment in
BlackRock), as well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, above certain thresholds be deducted from regulatory capital and significantly limit the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (including minority
interests in the form of REIT preferred securities) may be included in regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2012, PNC had approximately 1.4 billion of REIT preferred securities outstanding. PNC has submitted the necessary redemption notice
to redeem 375 million of this amount on March 15, 2013, as discussed further in the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section in Item 7 of this Report. In addition, the proposed rules would remove the filter
that currently excludes unrealized gains and losses (other than those resulting from other-than-temporary impairments) on available for sale debt securities from affecting regulatory capital, which could increase the volatility of regulatory capital
of banking organizations, including PNC. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III rules would require that banking organizations maintain a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 , a total capital ratio
of 8.0 and a leverage ratio of 4 . Moreover, the proposed rules, when fully phased-in, would require banking organizations, including PNC, to maintain a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 7.0 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and a total capital ratio
of 10.5 to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including common stock dividends and share repurchases) and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. For banking organizations subject to the Basel II advanced approaches (such as
PNC), these levels could be supplemented by an additional countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5 during periods of excessive credit growth, although this buffer is proposed to initially be set at zero in the United States. Such
organizations would also be subject to a new supplementary leverage ratio that would take into account certain off-balance sheet items. The
proposed rules issued in June 2012 that would revise the Basel I risk-weighting framework (referred to as the standardized approach) and the Basel II risk-weighting framework (referred to as the advanced approaches) would replace the use of credit
ratings with alternative

Table of Contents 

methodologies for assessing creditworthiness and establish a new framework (referred to as the Simplified Supervisory Framework Approach) for risk-weighting securitization exposures (such as
privately issued mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). The standardized approach also would, among other things, significantly revise the risk weight assigned to residential mortgages (with risk weights changing from between 50 
to 100 to between 35 and 200 and increase the risk weight applicable to certain types of commercial real estate loans under Basel I. The advanced approaches rule would, among other things, significantly alter the methodology for determining
counterparty credit risk weights, including the establishment of a credit valuation adjustment for counterparty risk in over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions, under Basel II. The Basel III framework adopted by the Basel Committee also includes new short-term liquidity standards (the Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and long-term funding standards (the Net Stable Funding Ratio). The
Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which is scheduled to begin to take effect on January 1, 2015 and be fully phased in by January 1, 2019, is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash, or other high quality
and unencumbered liquid assets that can readily be converted to cash, to meet estimated liquidity needs in a stress scenario lasting 30 days. The Basel Committee has defined the types of assets that would qualify as high quality liquid assets, and
also has established various assumptions regarding cash outflows and inflows during the 30-day stress period, for purposes of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The Net Stable Funding Ratio is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and
liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Net Stable Funding Ratio is scheduled to take effect by January 1, 2018 but continues to undergo review by the Basel Committee. 
 In November 2011, the Basel Committee also adopted a framework that would require globally systemically important banks G-SIBs to maintain
additional Tier 1 common capital ranging between 1.0 to 2.5 of risk-weighted assets, with the actual required amount varying based on the firm s global systemic importance as determined using five criteria (size, interconnectedness, lack of
substitutability, cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity). The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to propose a capital surcharge in the United States based on the Basel Committee s G-SIB framework. While these rules have not
yet been proposed, and the identity of the banking organizations that would be subject to a surcharge as a G-SIB definitively determined, PNC believes that it is unlikely to be deemed a G-SIB based on the criteria included in the Basel
Committee s framework. Dodd-Frank directs the Federal Reserve to establish heightened risk-based and leverage capital requirements and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies, like PNC, that have 50 billion or more in assets. The
Basel Committee also has adopted an analytical framework for national jurisdictions to use in determining whether to apply a capital surcharge to

firms that may be systemically important on a domestic basis D-SIBs ), but that are not G-SIBs. The Federal Reserve has stated that it is still considering whether to impose an
additional capital surcharge on bank holding companies that have 50 billion or more in consolidated total assets, but that are not subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Because proposals by the U.S. agencies to implement the Basel III capital standards and revise the Basel I risk-weighting framework have not been finalized, and any additional heightened capital or
liquidity standards that may be established by the Federal Reserve under Basel III or Dodd-Frank (such as, for example, a D-SIB surcharge) remain subject to rulemaking in the U.S., the full effect of these standards on PNC s regulatory capital
and liquidity, both during and after any applicable phase-in periods, is uncertain at this time. The need to maintain more and higher quality
capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit PNC s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in
PNC taking steps to increase its capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for
which are inconsistent with the assets underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require PNC to increase its holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing PNC s ability to invest in longer-term
or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the
ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
 Our lending and servicing businesses and the value of the loans and debt securities we hold may be adversely affected by economic conditions,
including a reversal or slowing of the current moderate recovery. Downward valuation of debt securities could also negatively impact our capital position. Given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans, and the importance of lending to our overall business, weak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on
our business and our results of operations. This could adversely impact loan utilization rates as well as delinquencies, defaults and customer ability to meet obligations under the loans. This is particularly the case during the period in which the
aftermath of recessionary conditions continues and the positive effects of economic recovery appear to be slow to materialize and unevenly spread among our customers.

Further, weak economic conditions would likely have a negative impact on our business, our ability to serve
our customers, and our results of operations. Such conditions are likely to lead to increases in the number of borrowers who become delinquent or default or otherwise demonstrate a decreased ability to meet their obligations under their loans. This
would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The value to us of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or
other financial instruments supported by loans, similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy. We have historically not considered government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk loans as defaults are materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guaranteed amounts for approved claims
by the applicable government agency. While the level of claim denials by government agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has historically been low, if financial conditions prompt government agencies to deny or curtail
an increasing number of these claims, we could face additional losses in our lending business. In addition, in the event that submitted claims are denied or curtailed as a result of our failure as a servicer of the loan to adhere to applicable
agency servicing guidelines, we will be required to remit the difference between the claims proceeds that should have been received and the claim amounts actually received to the holder of the loan. 
 A failure to sustain reduced amounts of the provision for credit losses, which has benefitted results of operations in recent periods, could result in
decreases in net income. As was typical in the banking industry, the economic downturn that started in 2007 resulted in PNC experiencing
high levels of provision for credit losses. In 2009, PNC reported provision for credit losses totaling 3.9 billion. Subsequently, in part due to improvement in economic conditions, as well as actions taken by PNC to manage its portfolio, PNC s
provision for credit losses has declined substantially, to 2.5 billion in 2010, 1.2 billion in 2011 and 1.0 billion in 2012. This decline in provision for credit losses has been a major contributor to PNC s ability to maintain and grow its
net income during this period. As the provision for credit losses stabilizes, there may not be as much opportunity as there has been for declining provision to help PNC maintain and grow net income. In addition, if PNC s provision for credit
losses were to rise back towards levels experienced during the height of the economic downturn, it would have an adverse effect on PNC s net income and could result in lower levels of net income than PNC has reported in recent periods.

Our regional concentrations make us particularly at risk to adverse economic conditions in our primary
retail banking footprint. Although many of our businesses are national in scope, our retail banking business is concentrated within our
retail branch network footprint, located principally in our primary geographic markets. Thus, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast regions. 
 Our business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. 
 As most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be particularly sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil
and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets, such as that experienced during the recent financial crisis, can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed above, including the
impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to us. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on PNC and our business and financial performance. 

It can affect the value or liquidity of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. 

It can affect the value of servicing rights, including those we carry at fair value. 

It can affect our ability to access capital markets to raise funds necessary to support our businesses and maintain our overall liquidity position.
Inability to access capital markets as needed, or at cost effective rates, could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. 

It can affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer for others or the assets for which we provide processing and information
services. Although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for our services. 

It can affect the required funding of our pension obligations to the extent that the value of the assets supporting those obligations drops below
minimum levels. 

In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which we engage. 
 Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and is likely to continue to be a significant
contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.

Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements
in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be
able to predict adequately. As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or
interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and
liabilities. For example: 

Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay
on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and profitability. 

Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in
turn, affect our loss rates on those assets. 

Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts. 

Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or increase the
risk associated with such hedges. 

Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the
profitability of such assets. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the
Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of
the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits
and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve s policies also
influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.

PNC faces legal and regulatory risk arising out of its residential mortgage businesses. 
 Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in the business of mortgage and home equity
loan lending and servicing and in the mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance industries. PNC has received inquiries from governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities on these topics and is responding to these inquiries. These inquiries
and investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, possibly resulting in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, alterations in our business practices and additional expenses and collateral costs. 
 In addition to governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, PNC, like other companies with residential mortgage and home equity loan
origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions, other litigation and claims from: the owners of, investors in, or purchasers of such loans originated or serviced by PNC (or securities backed by such loans), homeowners involved
in foreclosure proceedings or various mortgage-related insurance programs, downstream purchasers of homes sold after foreclosure, title insurers, and other potential claimants. Included among these claims are claims from purchasers of mortgage and
home equity loans seeking the repurchase of loans where the loans allegedly breached origination covenants and representations and warranties made to the purchasers in the purchase and sale agreements. 
 At this time PNC cannot predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect upon PNC from governmental, legislative or regulatory actions and private
litigation or claims arising out of residential mortgage and home equity loan lending, servicing or reinsurance practices, although such actions, litigation and claims could, individually or in the aggregate, result in significant expense. See Note
23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and
investigations and additional information regarding potential repurchase obligations relating to mortgage and home equity loans. Moreover,
the CFPB recently issued final regulations that impose new requirements relating to our residential mortgage origination practices and servicing practices. These regulations are not yet in effect, but we are in the processes of implementing them. We
cannot predict at this time the overall cost of implementing these requirements, but implementation is likely to result in significant expense.

The issues described above may affect the value of our ownership interests, direct or indirect, in property
subject to foreclosure. In addition, possible delays in the schedule for processing foreclosures may result in an increase in nonperforming loans, additional servicing costs and possible demands for contractual fees or penalties under servicing
agreements. There is also a continuing risk of incurring costs related to further remedial and related efforts required by the consent orders
and related to repurchase requests arising out of either the foreclosure process or origination issues. Reputational damage arising out of this industry-wide inquiry could also have an adverse effect upon our existing mortgage and home equity loan
business and could reduce future business opportunities. One or more of the foregoing could adversely affect PNC s business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies from time to
time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing. 
 Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties
to PNC in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired. In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive to
complete than anticipated (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly harder or take longer
to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. Our ability to achieve
anticipated results from acquisitions is often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets. Also,
litigation and governmental investigations that may be filed or commenced, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC.

Integration of an acquired company s business and operations into PNC, including conversion of the
acquired company s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company s or PNC s existing businesses. In some
cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas. 
 Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends,
in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own. As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. In addition,
legal and regulatory or other governmental proceedings, claims, investigations or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies may result in future monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including
damages, fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC. The processes of integrating acquired businesses, as well as the
deconsolidation of divested businesses, also pose many additional possible risks which could result in increased costs, liability or other adverse consequences to PNC. Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to pre-acquisition activities of companies we have acquired, including National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future. 
 The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely
execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit
risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the
loan or derivative exposure due us.

We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the
geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product
pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues. We are subject to intense competition from various financial
institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in Item 1 of this Report under Competition. 
 In all, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits),
product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important
competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services. 
 Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our
business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities. A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures
could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or
decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income. The performance
of our asset management businesses may be adversely impacted by overall economic and market conditions as well as the relative performance of our products compared with the offerings by competitors. 
 Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations,
customer preferences and needs. In addition, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better
performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit

the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such
a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings. 
 As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by
regulators, which affect our business as well as our competitive position. PNC is a bank holding company and a financial holding company
and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization. Our businesses are subject to regulation by
multiple bank regulatory bodies as well as multiple securities industry regulators. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that operate in the banking and securities
businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC s ability to service its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries. Applicable laws and regulations also restrict permissible activities and
investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to
combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as
damage to our reputation and businesses. In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by banking and other
regulatory bodies. Examination reports and ratings (which often are not publicly available) and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct, growth, and profitability of our businesses. 
 Due to the current economic environment and issues facing the financial services industry, we anticipate that there will be new legislative and
regulatory initiatives over the next several years, including many focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. These initiatives will be in addition to the actions already taken by Congress and the
regulators, through enactment of the Credit CARD Act, the SAFE Act, and Dodd-Frank, as well as changes to the regulations implementing the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Federal Truth in Lending Act,

and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Legislative and regulatory initiatives have had and are likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. This impact could include rules
and regulations that affect the nature and profitability of our business activities, how we use our capital, how we compensate and incent our employees, the type and amount of instruments we hold for liquidity purposes, and other matters potentially
having a negative effect on our overall business results and prospects. Under the regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company
is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank, N.A. when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its
shareholders or creditors. Our ability to pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on dividends from our operating subsidiaries,
principally PNC Bank, N.A. Banks are subject to regulation that limits and governs the payout of dividends to their holding companies. We
discuss these and other regulatory issues applicable to PNC, including some particular areas of current regulatory focus or concern, in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and in Note 22 Regulatory Matters
in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and
procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom
we do business. We must comply with generally accepted accounting principles established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
accounting, disclosure and other rules set forth by the SEC, income tax and other regulations established by the U.S. Treasury and state and local taxing authorities, and revenue rulings and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service,
which affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards, or interpretations of those standards, can
impact our revenue recognition and expense policies and affect our estimation methods used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Changes in income tax regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, and other guidance can impact our
tax liability and alter the timing of cash flows associated with tax deductions and payments. New guidance often dictates how changes to standards and regulations are to be presented in our consolidated financial statements, as either an adjustment
to beginning retained earnings for the period or as income or expense in current

period earnings. In some cases, changes may be applied to previously reported disclosures. The determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets is highly subjective, and inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial
position. The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic
evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly
and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this
area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in
the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. Our asset valuation may include methodologies,
estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this, along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets, could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition. We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported
at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on
quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling
techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial
condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates,
rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be more difficult to value certain of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active
markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In such cases, valuations in certain asset classes may require

more subjectivity and management judgment; valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market
conditions in any particular market (e.g. credit, equity, fixed income, foreign exchange) could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary
significantly. There are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business. 
 PNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the
pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial
instruments and balance sheets items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also,
information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our
shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. See the Model Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section included in Item 7
of this Report. We are subject to operational risk. Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error and external events. Operational
risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with
contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform
operational functions necessary to our business. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which we review and update, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control
weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone business opportunities.

We continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive
in this arena. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new
technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow
us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Our information systems may
experience interruptions or breaches in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any
failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect our customer relationships. While we have policies, procedures and systems designed to
prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there remains the risk that such a failure, interruption or security breach might occur and, if it does occur, that it might not be sufficiently remediated. 
 Recently, there have been several well-publicized series of apparently related denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including
PNC. In a denial of service attack, hackers flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites
unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. The recent attacks against PNC resulted in temporary disruptions in customers ability to access the corporate website and to perform on-line banking transactions, although no customer data
was lost or compromised. Furthermore, even if not directed at PNC specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the
financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of PNC s business. In addition, there have been increasing
efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as phishing. The ability of our customers to
bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.

Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems
change frequently (and generally increasing in sophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas
around the world, we may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures. 
 Despite temporary disruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers, to date these efforts have not had a material impact on
PNC. Nonetheless, the occurrence of any such failure, interruption or security breach of our systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage the reputation of PNC, result in a loss of customer
business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability. In addition, the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems has led, and we expect will
continue to lead, to increased costs to PNC with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks, as well as costs reimbursing customers for losses suffered as a result of these actions. Successful attacks or systems failures at other large
financial institutions, whether or not PNC is included, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions with a potential negative impact on PNC s business, additional demands on the part of our regulators, and
increased costs to deal with risks identified as a result of the problems affecting others. Our business and financial results could be
impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We
have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental
investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in
connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. 
 Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that
a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the
outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate

losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe some of our pending legal proceedings in Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report. Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters,
natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of
disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, explosions, and other severe weather conditions or catastrophic accidents), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could
impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers,
suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These
types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. 
 Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if
any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or
regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.

PART II ITEM 5 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY ,
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 (a) (1) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the symbol PNC. At the close of business on
February 15, 2013, there were 75,100 common shareholders of record. Holders of PNC common stock are entitled to receive dividends when
declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for this purpose. Our Board of Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common stock until dividends for all past dividend periods on any series of outstanding preferred
stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. The Board presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial
condition and operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as those relating to the ability of bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company
and regulatory capital limitations). The amount of our dividend is also currently subject to the results of the Federal Reserve s 2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) as part of its supervisory assessment of capital adequacy
described under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report. The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit us from
paying dividends without its approval. For further information concerning dividend restrictions and restrictions on loans, dividends or advances from bank subsidiaries to the parent company, see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1
of this Report, Funding and Capital Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section, Liquidity Risk Management in the Risk Management section, and Trust Preferred Securities in the Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of Item 7 of this Report, and Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities and Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report, which we include here by reference. We include here by reference additional information relating to PNC common
stock under the caption Common Stock Prices/Dividends Declared in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report. We include here by reference the information regarding our compensation plans under which PNC equity securities are authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2012 in the table (with introductory

As part of the National City transaction, we established the PNC Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series M (the Series M Preferred Stock ), which
mirrored in all material respects the former National City Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. On December 10, 2012, PNC issued 500.1 million aggregate liquidation amount (5,001 shares) of the Series M Preferred Stock to the
National City Preferred Capital Trust I (the Trust as required pursuant to the settlement of a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement between the Trust and PNC dated as of January 30, 2008. Immediately upon such issuance, PNC redeemed all
5,001 shares of the Series M Preferred Stock from the Trust on December 10, 2012 at a redemption price equal to 100,000 per share.

 Our current stock repurchase program allows us to purchase up to 25 million shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program was
authorized on October 4, 2007 and will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others,
market and general economic conditions, economic capital and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations, including the impact of the Federal
Reserve s supervisory assessment of capital adequacy program.

(f) 
 We redeemed the Series N (TARP) Preferred Stock on February 10, 2010. In connection with the redemption, we accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance
discount on the Series N Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of 250 million in the first quarter of 2010. This resulted in a noncash reduction in net income attributable to common shareholders and related
basic and diluted earnings per share. The Series N Preferred Stock was issued on December 31, 2008. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding certain business, regulatory and legal risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors, the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24
Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Also, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Critical Accounting
Estimates And Judgments sections included in Item 7 of this Report for certain other factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from those anticipated in the
forward-looking statements included in this Report. See also the Executive Summary section in Item 7 of this Report for additional information affecting financial performance.

(f) 
 Amounts for 2012, 2011 and 2010 include cash and money market balances. 

(g) 
 Calculated as taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially
exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) on the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the years 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 144 million, 104 million, 81
million, 65 million and 36 million, respectively.

 K EY S TRATEGIC G OALS At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on revenue growth, with an emphasis on deepening customer relationships and increasing fee income, while reducing expenses. Our goal for 2013
is to deliver positive operating leverage and create momentum going into 2014, while investing for the future, and managing risk and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the
communities where we do business. The primary drivers of revenue are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We
strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering convenient banking options and innovative technology solutions, providing a broad range of fee-based and credit products and services, focusing on customer service, and enhancing our
brand. This strategy is designed to give our customers choices based on their needs. Our approach is focused on effectively growing targeted market share and share of wallet rather than short term fee revenue optimization. We may also
grow revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. PNC faces
a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity,
and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report. Our
priorities for 2013 are to build capital to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework and return excess capital to shareholders, subject to regulatory
approval. We continue to work to improve the quality of our capital and expect to build capital through retained earnings. PNC continues to maintain a strong bank holding company liquidity position. See the Capital and Liquidity Actions section of
this Executive Summary, the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this
Report. 
 
 RBC B ANK (USA) A CQUISITION 
 On March 2, 2012, we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of RBC Bank (USA), the U.S. retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of
Canada. As part of the acquisition, PNC also purchased a credit card portfolio from RBC Bank (Georgia), National Association. PNC paid 3.6 billion in cash as the consideration for the acquisition of both RBC Bank (USA) and the credit card
portfolio. The transaction added approximately 18.1 billion in deposits, 14.5 billion of loans and 1.1 billion of goodwill and intangible assets to PNC s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of
business activity associated with the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition subsequent to March 2, 2012. RBC Bank (USA), based in Raleigh, North
Carolina, operated more than 400 branches in North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and South Carolina. The primary reasons for the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) were to enhance shareholder value, to improve PNC s competitive
position in the financial services industry, and to further expand PNC s existing branch network in the states where it currently operates as well as expanding into new markets. When combined with PNC s existing network, PNC now has 2,881
branches across 17 states and the District of Columbia, ranking it fifth among U.S. banks in branches. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional
information regarding this acquisition and the Smartstreet divestiture and 2011 branch acquisitions described below. 
 S ALE OF S MARTSTREET Effective October 26, 2012, PNC divested certain deposits and assets of the Smartstreet business unit, which was acquired by PNC as part of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, to Union Bank, N.A.
Smartstreet is a nationwide business focused on homeowner or community association managers and had approximately 1 billion of assets and deposits as of September 30, 2012. The gain on sale was immaterial and resulted in a reduction of
goodwill and core deposit intangibles of 46 million and 13 million, respectively. B RANCH A CQUISITIONS 
 Effective December 9, 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area from Flagstar Bank, FSB,
a subsidiary of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. Effective June 6, 2011, PNC acquired 19 branches in the greater Tampa, Florida area from BankAtlantic, a subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of
the branch activity subsequent to each date of the respective acquisitions.

S ALE OF PNC G LOBAL I NVESTMENT 
S ERVICING On July 1, 2010, we sold PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. (GIS), a leading provider of processing,
technology and business intelligence services to asset managers, broker-dealers and financial advisors worldwide, for 2.3 billion in cash. The pretax gain in discontinued operations recorded in the third quarter of 2010 related to this sale was
 639 million, net of transaction costs, or 328 million after taxes. Results of operations of GIS through June 30, 2010 are presented as
income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on our Consolidated Income Statement in this Report. Once we entered into the sales agreement, GIS was no longer a reportable business segment. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. C APITAL AND 
L IQUIDITY A CTIONS Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common
stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and our
primary bank regulators as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve. In connection with the 2013
CCAR, PNC filed its capital plan and stress testing results with the Federal Reserve on January 7, 2013. PNC expects to receive the Federal Reserve s response (either a non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of
the 2013 CCAR by March 15, 2013. For additional information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, see Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation of this
Report. A summary of 2012 capital and liquidity actions follows. D EBT S ECURITIES I SSUED On
March 8, 2012, PNC Funding Corp issued 1 billion of senior notes, unconditionally guaranteed by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., due March 8, 2022. Interest is paid semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.30 . The offering resulted in
gross proceeds to us of 990 million before offering related expenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which included advances to PNC and its subsidiaries to finance their activities, repayment of
outstanding indebtedness, and repurchases and redemptions of issued and outstanding securities of PNC and its subsidiaries. On June 20,
2012, PNC Bank, N.A. issued 1.0 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes with an initial maturity date of July 20, 2013, subject to the holder s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of June 20, 2014.

Interest is paid at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of 22.5 basis points, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain
extensions of maturity by the holder. On October 22, 2012, PNC Bank, N.A. issued 1.0 billion of subordinated notes with a maturity date
of November 1, 2022. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 2.70 , on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2013. T RUST P REFERRED S ECURITIES R EDEEMED On April 25, 2012 we redeemed 300 million of trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust D with a current distribution rate of 6.125 and 6 million of trust preferred securities issued
by Yardville Capital Trust III with a current distribution rate of 10.18 . In addition, on May 25, 2012 we redeemed 500 million of trust preferred securities issued by National City Capital Trust III with a current distribution rate of 6.625 .
These redemptions together resulted in a noncash charge for unamortized discounts of approximately 130 million in the second quarter of 2012. 
 On July 30, 2012 we redeemed 450 million of trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust E with a current distribution rate of 7.750 and
 517.5 million of enhanced trust preferred securities issued by National City Capital Trust IV with a current distribution rate of 8.000 . These redemptions together resulted in a noncash charge for unamortized discounts of approximately 95 million

 On April 24, 2012, we issued 60 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/4,000th interest in a share of our Fixed-to-Floating Rate
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series P, in an underwritten public offering resulting in gross proceeds of 1.5 billion to us before commissions and expenses. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the depositary shares for general

 On November 9, 2012 PNC issued 500.1 million of its parent company Senior Notes due November 9, 2022 (the Senior Notes which were
sold in a secondary public offering made in connection with the remarketing of PNC s Remarketable 8.729 Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 (the Subordinated Notes owned by the National City Preferred Capital Trust I (the
 Trust ). In the remarketing the Trust sold the Subordinated Notes and PNC exchanged the Senior Notes with the purchasers of the Subordinated Notes. The Senior Notes were then sold by the purchasers in the secondary public offering. The
Senior Notes bore interest at 8.729 from and including June 10, 2012, to but excluding November 9, 2012 and thereafter bear interest at 2.854 per annum. The proceeds of the remarketing were ultimately used by the Trust, after the
completion of the Preferred Stock transactions described below, to redeem all 500.0 million outstanding of its 12 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal APEX and .1 million Common Securities of the Trust. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2012, PNC incurred noncash charges for unamortized discounts of 70 million related to this redemption. After the closing of
these transactions, including the redemption of the Normal APEX, only the Senior Notes due November 9, 2022 remain outstanding. As
required under a stock purchase contract agreement, the Trust purchased 500.1 million of PNC s Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series M (the Preferred Stock ). PNC then redeemed all of the Preferred Stock from the Trust

 R ECENT M ARKET AND I NDUSTRY D EVELOPMENTS 
 There have been numerous legislative and regulatory developments and dramatic changes in the competitive landscape of our industry over the last several
years. The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulation of the financial services industry, including
engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect consumers and investors. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future
initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus, financial market stability and enhanced regulation of financial services companies and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more
intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with new regulations will increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Some new
regulations may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), enacted in July 2010, mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Many parts of the law are now in effect and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to
continue for several years. Until such time as the regulatory agencies issue final regulations implementing all of the numerous provisions of
Dodd-Frank, PNC will not be able to fully assess the impact the legislation will have on its businesses. However, we believe that the expected changes will be manageable for PNC and will have an overall smaller impact on us than on our larger peers.
 Included in these recent legislative and regulatory developments are evolving regulatory capital standards for financial institutions. These
evolving standards include the three sets of proposed rules that the U.S. banking agencies released in June 2012 to implement the Basel III regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel III) and also
make other changes to U.S. regulatory capital standards for banking institutions. The Basel III proposed rules include heightened capital requirements for banking institutions in terms of both higher quality capital and higher regulatory capital
ratios. The proposed Basel III rules would become effective under a phase-in period and would be in full effect on January 1, 2019. The
capital rules issued by the Federal banking agencies in June 2012 would also revise the manner in which a banking

institution determines its risk-weighted assets for risk-based capital purposes under the Basel II framework applicable to large or internationally active banks (referred to as the advanced
approaches) and under the Basel I framework applicable to all banking institutions (referred to as the standardized approach). For additional information on the proposed capital rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies in June 2012 and the
potential impact of such rules on PNC, please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. The public comment period on these three sets
of proposed rules closed on October 22, 2012, and final rules have not yet been issued. The agencies originally proposed that the Basel III and advanced approaches proposal would become effective on January 1, 2013, but subsequently
indicated that the effective date of these rules remains under consideration. The standardized approach proposal is proposed to become effective on January 1, 2015. In June 2012, the Federal banking agencies also adopted final market risk capital rules to implement the enhancements to the market risk framework adopted by the Basel Committee (commonly referred to as
 Basel II.5 ). The final rules, which apply to PNC, became effective January 1, 2013 and, among other things, narrow the types of positions that are subject to the market risk capital framework, establish a new stressed Value at Risk VaR charge for covered trading positions, provide for certain market risk-related public disclosures and replace references to credit ratings in the market risk rules with alternative methodologies for assessing credit risk.
 A number of other reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including PNC, do
business. We provide additional information on a number of these provisions (including new regulatory agencies (such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)), consumer protection regulation, enhanced prudential standards (including stress
test requirements), limitations on investment in and sponsorship of funds, risk retention by securitization participants, new regulation of derivatives, and potential applicability of state consumer protection laws) and some of their potential
impacts on PNC in Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. As noted in prior
filings, in April 2011, PNC and other mortgage servicers entered into Consent Orders with the OCC and Federal Reserve Board requiring, among other matters, that the servicers retain independent consultants to conduct reviews of default and
foreclosure files from the 2009-2010 timeframe regarding possible improper financial harm to borrowers as a result of such default and foreclosure activities. In early 2013, PNC and 12 other servicers agreed with the OCC and the Federal Reserve to
end the independent consultants files review program and to replace it with an

accelerated remediation process. PNC agreed to pay approximately 70 million for distribution to potentially affected borrowers in the review population, and agreed to provide approximately 111
million in additional loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention relief, which may be satisfied pursuant to the amended consent orders by a variety of borrower relief actions or by additional cash payments or resource commitments to borrower
counseling or education. PNC expects residential mortgage foreclosure-related compliance expenses to decrease substantially in 2013 compared with 2012. There have been, and continue to be, numerous other governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations on this topic and other issues related to mortgage lending and servicing. These
inquiries and investigations may result in significant additional actions, penalties or other remedies. For additional information, including
with respect to some of the governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations, please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report and Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The mortgage industry, including PNC, has seen further changes in behavior
and demand patterns of government-sponsored enterprises, FHLMC and FNMA, for loans sold into agency securitizations, primarily focused on loans originated prior to 2008. PNC recorded an additional pre-tax provision of 761 million in 2012 for
residential mortgage repurchase obligations related to expected elevated levels of repurchase demands bringing the total reserve on our balance sheet for residential mortgage repurchase claims at December 31, 2012 to 614 million. 
 H URRICANE S ANDY During the last week of October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread damage along the East Coast particularly in New Jersey, a key market area for us. The storm resulted in significant property damage
to our customers, the closing or disruption of many businesses and damage to the community infrastructure. Despite the damage and disruption to some of its branches and facilities, PNC assisted its customers, clients and borrowers in the affected
areas. PNC waived a number of checking account and loan fees, including late payment fees on business and consumer loans, which did not have a significant impact to PNC s financial statements. PNC also incurred expenses related to Hurricane
Sandy the majority of which are related to damage to branches in the affected areas. In addition, PNC also experienced some credit-related expenses. These expenses did not have a significant impact to PNC s financial statements.

 Our performance in 2012 included the following: 

Net income for 2012 of 3.0 billion decreased 2 percent compared to 2011. Revenue growth of 8 percent and a decline in the provision for credit losses
were more than offset by a 16 percent increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared with 2011. Further detail is included below and in the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7. 

Net interest income of 9.6 billion for 2012 increased 11 percent compared with 2011 driven by the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, organic
loan growth and lower funding costs. 

Noninterest income of 5.9 billion for 2012 increased .2 billion compared to 2011. The increase was primarily driven by higher residential mortgage
loans sales revenue related to an increase in loan origination volume, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and higher corporate service fees, largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations.

The provision for credit losses decreased to 1.0 billion for 2012 compared to 1.2 billion for 2011. The decline in the comparison was driven by
overall credit quality improvement. 

Noninterest expense of 10.6 billion for 2012 increased 1.5 billion compared with 2011 primarily driven by operating expense for the RBC Bank (USA)
acquisition, higher integration costs, increased noncash charges related to redemption of trust preferred securities and a charge for residential mortgage banking goodwill impairment, partially offset by the impact from higher residential mortgage
foreclosure-related expenses in 2011.

Overall credit quality improved during 2012. 

Nonperforming assets of 3.8 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased 9 percent compared to December 31, 2011. The decrease in nonperforming
assets from December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to decreases in commercial real estate and commercial nonperforming loans. This decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and higher nonperforming home equity
loans from a change in policy for home equity loans past due 90 days being placed on nonaccrual status, compared to a prior policy of past due 180 days. Additionally, pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, nonperforming
consumer loans increased related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs resulting from bankruptcy. Of these loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments as of December 31, 2012. Further detail is included in the
Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more of 2.4 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased .6 billion, or 21 percent, from December 31, 2011,
primarily due to a decline in government insured delinquent residential real estate loans, a decline in delinquent home equity loans due to a change in policy for home equity loans past due 90 days being placed on nonaccrual status, compared to
prior policy of past due 180 days, and a decrease in non government insured residential real estate loans pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs
resulting from bankruptcy. Further detail is included in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. 

Net charge-offs of 1.3 billion for 2012 were down 21 percent compared to net charge-offs of 1.6 billion for 2011. The allowance for loan and lease
losses was 2.17 of total loans and 124 of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012, compared with 2.73 and 122 at December 31, 2011, respectively. B ALANCE S HEET H IGHLIGHTS 

Total loans increased by 27 billion, or 17 percent, to 186 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to 159 billion at December 31, 2011.

Total commercial lending increased by 20.6 billion, or 23 percent, from December 31, 2011, due to strong organic growth and the impact from the
RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. 

Total consumer lending increased 6.2 billion, or 9 percent, from December 31, 2011 primarily in home equity and automobile loans,

including the impact from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. 

Total deposits were 213 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with 188 billion at December 31, 2011. 

Transaction deposits increased to 177 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to 148 billion at December 31, 2011, including the impact from
the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition as well as organic transaction deposit growth from increases in both consumer and commercial liquidity. Transaction deposits were 83 percent of total deposits at December 31, 2012, reflecting our strong customer
focus and core strategy to grow checking relationships. 

Retail certificates of deposit declined by 5.7 billion at December 31, 2012 from December 31, 2011 due to runoff of maturing accounts.

As of February 22, 2013, deposits have declined by approximately 2.7 from the December 31, 2012 level as a result of seasonal and normal
business activity. Deposit fluctuations due to the Transaction Account Guarantee Program s expiration have not been significant. Management expects that in the current interest rate environment, additional deposit runoff will not be
significant. 

PNC s balance sheet remained core funded with a loans to deposits ratio of 87 percent at December 31, 2012 and retained a strong bank holding
company liquidity position. 

Trust preferred securities and hybrid capital securities redeemed in 2012 totaled 2.3 billion with a weighted average rate of 8.3 percent, effectively
lowering funding costs. 

PNC issued approximately 2 billion of preferred stock in 2012 with a weighted average rate of 5.9 percent. 

PNC had strong capital levels at December 31, 2012 with a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 9.6 percent compared to 10.3 percent at December 31,
2011, which reflected a decrease of approximately 1.2 percentage points from the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA), partially offset by retention of earnings. 

PNC s estimated proforma Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio was 7.5 percent at December 31, 2012 without benefit of phase-ins, based on
current understanding of Basel III proposed rules, estimates of Basel II (with proposed modifications) risk-weighted assets, and application of Basel II.5 rules. PNC s goal is to be within a Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio range of
between 8.0 to 8.5 percent by year end 2013 without benefit of phase-ins. We believe we are positioned to reach this goal.

this Item 7 describes in greater detail the various items that impacted our results for 2012 and 2011. A VERAGE 
C ONSOLIDATED B ALANCE S HEET H IGHLIGHTS Total assets were 305.1 billion at
December 31, 2012 compared with 271.2 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase from year end 2011 was primarily due to the addition of assets from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and organic loan growth. 
 Various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends
apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 provides information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at December 31, 2012 compared with
December 31, 2011. Total average assets increased to 295.0 billion for 2012 compared with 265.3 billion for 2011, reflecting an
increase of 24.2 billion in average interest-earning assets to 248.6 billion for 2012, compared with 224.3 billion in 2011. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in average total loans, including
those acquired from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Total loans at December 31, 2012 increased 26.8 billion to 185.9 billion compared
to December 31, 2011. Average total loans increased by 24.6 billion to 176.6 billion for 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to increases in average commercial loans of 17.2 billion and in average consumer loans of 5.1 billion. Loans
added from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition contributed to the increase. In addition, average commercial loans increased from organic loan growth primarily in corporate banking, real estate and asset-based lending and average consumer loans increased
due to growth in indirect auto loans. Loans represented 71 percent of average interest-earning assets for 2012 compared to 68 percent for 2011. 
 Average investment securities increased 1.1 billion to 60.8 billion in 2012 compared with 2011. Total investment securities comprised 24 percent of
average interest-earning assets for 2012 and 27 percent for 2011. Average noninterest-earning assets totaled 46.5 billion in 2012 compared
with 41.0 billion in 2011. The increase included the impact of higher adjustments for net unrealized gains on securities, which are included in noninterest-earning assets for average balance sheet purposes, the impact of the

RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, including goodwill, and an increase in equity investments. 
 Average total deposits increased by 18.5 billion to 201.6 billion in 2012 compared with 2011. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in
average transaction deposits of 23.9 billion partially offset by a decrease of 7.4 billion in retail certificates of deposit attributable to runoff of maturing accounts. Growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits, average money market deposits
and average interest-bearing demand deposits drove the increase in transaction deposits, which resulted from deposits added in the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and organic growth. Average transaction deposits were 161.9 billion for 2012 compared with
 138.0 billion for 2011. Total deposits at December 31, 2012 were 213.1 billion compared with 188.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7.
 Average total deposits represented 68 percent of average total assets for 2012 and 69 percent for 2011. 
 Average borrowed funds increased to 41.8 billion for 2012 compared with 35.7 billion for 2011. An increase in commercial paper and net issuances of
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings during 2012 drove the increase compared with 2011. Total borrowed funds at December 31, 2012 were 40.9 billion compared with 36.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and are further discussed within the
Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7. In addition, the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds.

 Total business segment earnings were 3.4 billion for 2012 and 3.1 billion for 2011. Highlights of results for 2012 and 2011 are included below.
Enhancements were made to the internal funds transfer pricing methodology during the second quarter of 2012. Retrospective application of our new funds transfer pricing methodology has been made to the prior period reportable business segment
results and disclosures to create comparability to the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our financial statements. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed
changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated. During the third quarter of 2012, PNC increased the amount of internally observed
data used in estimating the key commercial lending assumptions of Probabilities of Default (PDs) and Losses Given Default (LGDs). The estimated impact as of the beginning of the third quarter 2012 was approximately an increase of 41 million and a
decrease of 55 million to the provision for credit losses of Retail Banking and Corporate Institutional Banking, respectively. Prior periods are not presented on a comparable basis as it is not practicable to do so.

B ANKING Retail Banking earned 596 million in 2012 compared with 371 million in 2011. The increase in
earnings resulted from organic growth in transaction deposit balances, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, lower rates paid on deposits, higher levels of customer-initiated transactions, a lower provision for credit losses, and the impact
of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, partially offset by the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions and higher additions to legal reserves. C ORPORATE I NSTITUTIONAL B ANKING Corporate Institutional Banking earned 2.3 billion in 2012 compared with 1.9 billion in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher revenue partially offset by higher
noninterest expense and a provision for credit losses of zero in 2012 compared with a benefit of 124 million in 2011. We continued to focus on building client relationships including increasing cross sales and adding new clients where the
risk-return profile was attractive. A SSET M ANAGEMENT G ROUP 
 Asset Management Group earned 145 million in 2012 compared with 168 million in 2011. Assets under administration increased to 224 billion at
December 31, 2012 from 210 billion at December 31, 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets. Revenue increased 44 million in the year over year comparison as strong sales and higher average equity markets increased noninterest
income by 4 and higher average deposit balances increased net interest income by 6 . The revenue increase was offset by higher noninterest expense from strategic business investments and higher provision for credit losses.

R ESIDENTIAL M ORTGAGE B ANKING 
 Residential Mortgage Banking reported a loss of 308 million in 2012 compared with earnings of 89 million in 2011. Earnings declined from the prior year
primarily as a result of higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, higher noninterest expense, including goodwill impairment, and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by increased loan sales
revenue driven by higher loan origination volume. B LACK R OCK 
 Our BlackRock business segment earned 395 million in 2012 and 361 million in 2011. We hold an equity investment in BlackRock, which is a key component
of our diversified revenue strategy. BlackRock is a publicly traded company, and additional information regarding its business is available in its filings with the SEC. N ON -S TRATEGIC A SSETS P ORTFOLIO This business segment consists primarily of non-strategic assets obtained through acquisitions of other companies. Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of 237 million for 2012 compared with 200

Consolidated Income Statement Review. N ET I NTEREST I NCOME

 Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning
assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis and Analysis
Of Year-To-Year Changes In Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this Report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion of purchased impaired loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Item 7 for additional information.
 The increase in net interest income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, organic
loan growth and lower funding costs. Purchase accounting accretion remained stable at 1.1 billion in both periods. The net interest margin
was 3.94 for 2012 and 3.92 for 2011. The increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest-bearing liabilities of 29 basis points, largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the
yield on total interest-earning assets. The decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital
securities during 2012, in addition to an increase in FHLB borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources. The decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on
new securities in the current low rate environment. With respect to the first quarter of 2013, we expect net interest income to decline by
two to three percent compared to fourth

quarter 2012 net interest income of 2.4 billion, due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to 50 to 60 million, including lower expected cash recoveries. 
 For the full year 2013, we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012, assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of
approximately 400 million, while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison. We believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013, due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion
and assuming that the current low rate environment continues. N ONINTEREST I NCOME 
 Noninterest income totaled 5.9 billion for 2012 and 5.6 billion for 2011. The overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in
residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and higher corporate service fees, largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase
obligations. Asset management revenue, including BlackRock, totaled 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with 1.1 billion in 2011. This increase
was primarily due to higher earnings from our BlackRock investment. Discretionary assets under management increased to 112 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with 107 billion at December 31, 2011 driven by stronger average equity
markets, positive net flows and strong sales performance. For 2012, consumer services fees were 1.1 billion compared with 1.2 billion in
2011. The decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth. As further discussed in the Retail Banking portion of the Business Segments Review section of this
Item 7, the Dodd-Frank limits on interchange rates were effective October 1, 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately 314 million in 2012 and 75 million in 2011. This impact was partially offset by higher volumes of
merchant, customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Corporate services revenue
increased by .3 billion, or 30 percent, to 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012. The major components of corporate
services revenue are treasury management revenue, corporate finance fees, including revenue from capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage servicing revenue, including commercial mortgage banking activities. See the
Product Revenue portion of this Consolidated Income Statement Review for further detail.

Residential mortgage revenue decreased to 284 million in 2012 from 713 million in 2011. This decrease of
 429 million, or 60 percent, was largely due to a higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations of 761 million in 2012 compared with 102 million in 2011, partially offset by an increase in loan sales revenue driven by higher
loan origination volume. The higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations in 2012 reflected expected further elevated
levels of repurchase demands primarily as a result of changes in behaviors and demand patterns of two government-sponsored enterprises, FHLMC and FNMA, for loans sold into agency securitizations. The recorded liability for residential mortgage
indemnification and repurchase claims was 614 million at December 31, 2012. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Item 7 for more detail. Service charges on deposits grew to 573 million in 2012 compared with 534 million in 2011. This increase reflected continued success in growing customers, including through the RBC Bank (USA)
acquisition. Net gains on sales of securities totaled 204 million for 2012 and 249 million for 2011. The net credit component of
other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of securities recognized in earnings was 111 million in 2012 compared with 152 million for 2011. 
 Other noninterest income increased by .4 billion, or 38 percent, to 1.5 billion for 2012 compared with 1.1 billion for 2011. This increase was
primarily due to 267 million of gains on sales of approximately 9 million Visa Class B common shares during the third and fourth quarters of 2012, as well as higher revenue associated with private equity investments. We continue to hold
approximately 14.4 million Visa Class B common shares with an estimated fair value of approximately 916 million as of December 31, 2012. Our recorded investment in these remaining shares was approximately 251 million at December 31,
2012. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed.
Further details regarding our trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Further details regarding private and other equity investments are included
in the Market Risk Management Equity And Other Investment Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the
Business Segments Review section of this Item 7. For 2013, we currently expect both noninterest income and total revenue to increase
compared with 2012. 
 
 P RODUCT R EVENUE 
 In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury
management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities for customers of all our business segments. A portion of the revenue and expense related to these products is reflected in the Corporate 
Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in the Corporate Institutional Banking table in the Business Segments Review section of this
Item 7 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows. 
 Treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled 1.4 billion for 2012 and 1.3 billion for
2011. Higher deposit balances along with strong growth in commercial card, lockbox and traditional products, including DDA, wire and ACH, led to the favorable results. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services totaled 710 million in 2012 compared with 622 million in 2011. The comparison reflects higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and strong
customer driven capital markets activity. Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing
(including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary services, net of commercial mortgage servicing rights amortization, and commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations net of economic hedge), and revenue
derived from commercial mortgage loans intended for sale and related hedges (including loan origination fees, net interest income, valuation adjustments and gains or losses on sales). Commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of 330 million in 2012 compared with 136 million in 2011. The increase in the comparison was mainly due to the impact of recoveries on
commercial mortgage servicing rights in 2012 compared to impairments taken during 2011.

 The provision for credit losses totaled 1.0 billion for 2012, a decrease of .2 billion, or 14 percent, compared with 1.2 billion for 2011. The decline
in the comparison was driven by overall credit quality improvement. We currently expect our provision for credit losses in the first quarter
of 2013 to be between 200 and 300 million, as we expect the benefit of commercial loan reserve releases to be lower in 2013 compared to 2012. 
 The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the
provision for credit losses. See also Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section of Item 7 of this Report. N ONINTEREST E XPENSE Noninterest expense was 10.6 billion
for 2012 and 9.1 billion for 2011. Noninterest expense for 2012 included noncash charges of 295 million related to redemption of trust preferred securities, integration costs of 267 million, 225 million of residential mortgage
foreclosure-related expenses, and a noncash charge of 45 million for residential mortgage banking goodwill impairment. Noninterest expense for 2011 included 324 million of residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses, 198 million of noncash
charges related to redemption of trust preferred securities and 42 million of integration costs. The increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared with 2011 also reflected operating expense for the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, higher personnel
expense, higher settlements for other litigation and increased expenses for other real estate owned. In the first quarter of 2013, we expect
noninterest expense to decrease by at least 300 million compared to noninterest expense in fourth quarter 2012 of 2.8 billion. This expected decline is primarily due to our expectations for a significant reduction in residential mortgage
foreclosure-related compliance expenses, which were 91 million in the fourth quarter and included the impact of a charge of approximately 70 million for the early 2013 amendment to our foreclosure consent orders, and for no anticipated noncash
charges related to redemption of trust preferred securities and goodwill impairment, and integration costs, which were 70 million, 45 million and 35 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, respectively.

For full year 2013, we have increased our continuous improvement expense savings goal to 700 million,
which represents approximately 7 percent of our noninterest expense in 2012 and reflects an expected decline in residential mortgage foreclosure-related compliance expenses. We expect that amount to be offset by investments in our businesses and
infrastructure, including the full year impact of investing in the Southeast. However, we are not expecting to incur integration costs in 2013 and anticipate the charges for any noncash charges related to redemption of trust preferred securities to
be approximately 60 million or less in 2013. As a result, we currently expect total noninterest expense for 2013 to decline by mid-single
digits on a percentage basis compared with 2012. E FFECTIVE I NCOME T AX R ATE 
 The effective income tax rate was 23.9 in 2012 compared with 24.5 in 2011. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory
rate primarily due to tax credits PNC receives from our investments in low income housing partnerships and other tax exempt investments. We
expect our 2013 full year effective tax rate to be between 25 to 26 percent, reflecting expected higher pre-tax income.

 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report.
 The increase in total assets of 33.9 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the
addition of assets from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and organic loan growth. Total liabilities increased 29.4 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011 primarily due to the addition of deposits from the RBC Bank
(USA) acquisition, organic growth in transaction deposits, and higher commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, partially offset by the maturity of retail certificates of deposit and lower bank notes and senior and subordinated debt.
 An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows.

L OANS A summary of the major categories of loans outstanding follows. Outstanding loan balances of 185.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 159.0 billion at December 31, 2011 were net of unearned
income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums of 2.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2.3 billion at December 31, 2011, respectively. The balances include purchased impaired loans
but do not include future accretable net interest (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the carrying value of the loan) on those loans. Loans increased 26.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011. On March 2, 2012, our RBC Bank (USA) acquisition added 14.5 billion of loans, which included 6.3
billion of commercial, 2.7 billion of commercial real estate, 3.3 billion of consumer (including 3.0 billion of home equity loans and .3 billion of credit card loans), 2.1 billion of residential real estate, and .1 billion of equipment lease
financing loans. Excluding acquisition activity, the increase in commercial loans was due to growth primarily in asset-based lending, real estate, healthcare, and public finance loans while the growth in consumer loans was primarily driven by
organic growth in automobile loans and the acquisition of an indirect automobile loan portfolio in the third quarter, partially offset by lower education loans. In addition, excluding acquisition activity, residential real estate loans declined due
to continued run-off. Loans represented 61 of total assets at December 31, 2012 and 59 of total assets at December 31, 2011.
Commercial lending represented 59 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 56 at December 31, 2011. Consumer lending represented 41 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 44 at December 31, 2011. 
 Commercial real estate loans represented 6 of total assets at both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

 We are committed to providing credit and liquidity to qualified borrowers. Total loan originations and new
commitments and renewals totaled 157.0 billion for 2012. Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries, types of
businesses and consumers across our principal geographic markets. The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the Allowance for
Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit are sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments and are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others:

Probability of default, 

Loss given default, 

Exposure at date of default (EAD), 

Movement through delinquency stages, 

Amounts and timing of expected cash flows, 

Value of collateral, and 

Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in historical results. 
 H IGHER R ISK L OANS Our total ALLL of 4.0 billion at December 31, 2012 consisted of 1.8 billion and 2.2 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. The ALLL included
what we believe to be appropriate loss coverage on higher risk loans in the commercial and consumer portfolios. We do not consider government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk as defaults have historically been materially mitigated by
payments of insurance or guarantee amounts for approved claims. Additional information regarding our higher risk loans is included in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 and in Note 5 Asset Quality

 Over 85 percent of the net reclassifications were driven by the commercial portfolio. Over half of the commercial portfolio impact related to excess cash recoveries
recognized during the period, with the remaining due to improvements of cash expected to be collected on both RBC Bank (USA) and National City loans in future periods. The remaining net reclassifications were due to future cash flow changes in the
consumer portfolio. 

(b) 
 As of December 31, 2012 we estimate that the reversal of contractual interest on purchased impaired loans will total approximately 1.2 billion in future periods.
This will offset the total net accretable interest in future interest income of 2.2 billion on purchased impaired loans.

The unpaid principal balance of purchased impaired loans increased to 8.3 billion at December 31,
2012 from 7.5 billion at December 31, 2011 due to the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA), partially offset by payments, disposals, and charge-offs of amounts determined to be uncollectible. The remaining purchased impaired mark at December 31,
2012 was 913 million, which was an increase from 854 million at December 31, 2011. The associated allowance for loan losses increased slightly by .1 billion to 1.1 billion at December 31, 2012. The net investment of 6.3 billion at

December 31, 2012 increased 11 from 5.7 billion at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, our largest individual purchased impaired loan had a recorded investment of 18.6
million. We currently expect to collect total cash flows of 8.5 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the 6.3 billion net
investment at December 31, 2012 and the accretable net interest of 2.2 billion shown in the Accretable Net Interest-Purchased Impaired Loans table.

P URCHASED I MPAIRED L OANS A CCRETABLE 
D IFFERENCE S ENSITIVITY A NALYSIS The following table provides a sensitivity analysis on the
Purchased Impaired Loans portfolio. The analysis reflects hypothetical changes in key drivers for expected cash flows over the life of the loans under declining and improving conditions at a point in time. Any unusual significant economic events or
changes, as well as other variables not considered below (e.g., natural or widespread disasters), could result in impacts outside of the ranges represented below. Additionally, commercial and commercial real estate loan settlements or sales proceeds
can vary widely from appraised values due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, special use considerations, liquidity premiums, and improvements / deterioration in other income sources.

(a) 
 Declining Scenario Reflects hypothetical changes that would decrease future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast decreases
by 10 and unemployment rate forecast increases by 2 percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values decrease by 10 . 

(b) 
 Improving Scenario Reflects hypothetical changes that would increase future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast increases
by 10 , unemployment rate forecast decreases by 2 percentage points and interest rate forecast increases by 2 percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values increase by 10 . 

The impact of declining cash flows is primarily reflected as immediate impairment (allowance for loan
losses). The impact of increased cash flows is first recognized as a reversal of the allowance with any additional cash flow increases reflected as an increase in accretable yield over the life of the loan.

(a) 
 Includes 367 million of both amortized cost and fair value of securities classified as corporate stocks and other at December 31, 2012. Comparably, at
December 31, 2011, the amortized cost and fair value of corporate stocks and other was 368 million. The remainder of securities available for sale were debt securities. 

The carrying amount of investment securities totaled 61.4 billion at December 31, 2012, which was
made up of 51.0 billion of securities available for sale carried at fair value and 10.4 billion of securities held to maturity carried at amortized cost. Comparably, at December 31, 2011, the carrying value of investment securities totaled
 60.6 billion of which 48.6 billion represented securities available for sale carried at fair value and 12.0 billion of securities held to maturity carried at amortized cost. The increase in carrying amount between the periods primarily reflected an increase of 2.0 billion in available for sale asset-backed securities, which was primarily due to net purchase activity, and an
increase of .6 billion in available for sale non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities due to increases in fair value at December 31, 2012. These increases were partially offset by a 1.7 billion decrease in held to maturity debt
securities due to principal payments. Investment securities represented 20 of total assets at December 31, 2012 and 22 at December 31, 2011. We evaluate our portfolio of investment securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. We consider the
portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. U.S. Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively represented 59 of the investment securities portfolio at
December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, the securities available for sale portfolio included a net unrealized gain of 1.6
billion, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2011 was a net unrealized loss of 41 million. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit
spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa.

The improvement in the net unrealized gain as compared with a loss at December 31, 2011 was primarily
due to improvement in the value of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, which had a decrease in net unrealized losses of 1.1 billion, and lower market interest rates. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for
sale portfolio are included in Shareholders equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss from continuing operations, net of tax, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional information regarding our investment securities is included in Note 8 Investment Securities and Note 9 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Report. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities do not impact liquidity or risk-based capital under currently
effective capital rules. However, reductions in the credit ratings of these securities could have an impact on the liquidity of the securities or the determination of risk-weighted assets which could reduce our regulatory capital ratios under
currently effective capital rules. In addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of OTTI on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios. 
 The expected weighted-average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 4.0 years at December 31, 2012 and 3.7 years
at December 31, 2011. We estimate that, at December 31, 2012, the effective duration of investment securities was 2.3 years for an
immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.2 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2011 were 2.6 years and 2.4 years, respectively.

 Available for sale asset-backed securities include 3 million of available for sale agency asset-backed securities. 

We conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment quarterly on all securities in an
unrealized loss position to determine whether the loss represents OTTI. Our assessment considers the security structure, recent security collateral performance metrics, external credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or
principal payments, our judgment and expectations of future performance, and relevant independent industry research, analysis and forecasts. 
 We also consider the severity of the impairment and the length of time that the security has been impaired in our assessment. Results of the periodic
assessment are reviewed by a cross-functional senior management team representing Asset 

Liability Management, Finance, and Market Risk Management. The senior management team considers the results of the assessments, as well as other factors, in determining whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary. For those debt securities where we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities
prior to expected recovery, we recognize the credit portion of OTTI charges in current earnings and the noncredit portion of OTTI is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Also see our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income in Item 8 of this Report.

R ESIDENTIAL M ORTGAGE -B ACKED S ECURITIES 
 At December 31, 2012, our residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio was comprised of 31.4 billion fair value of US government
agency-backed securities and 6.1 billion fair value of non-agency (private issuer) securities. The agency securities are generally collateralized by 1-4 family, conforming, fixed-rate residential mortgages . The non-agency securities are also
generally collateralized by 1-4 family residential mortgages. The mortgage loans underlying the non-agency securities are generally non-conforming (i.e., original balances in excess of the amount qualifying for agency securities) and
predominately have interest rates that are fixed for a period of time, after which the rate adjusts to a floating rate based upon a contractual spread that is indexed to a market rate (i.e., a hybrid ARM ), or interest rates that are
fixed for the term of the loan. Substantially all of the non-agency securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and at
origination had credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over-collateralization and/or excess spread accounts. During 2012, we
recorded OTTI credit losses of 99 million on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. All of the losses were associated with securities rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2012, the noncredit portion of impairment
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income for non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities for which we have recorded an OTTI credit loss totaled 150 million and the related securities had a fair value of 3.7 billion. 
 The fair value of sub-investment grade investment securities for which we have not recorded an OTTI credit loss as of December 31, 2012 totaled 1.9
billion, with unrealized net gains of 114 million. C OMMERCIAL M ORTGAGE -B ACKED 
S ECURITIES The fair value of the non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio was 5.9 billion
at December 31, 2012 and consisted of fixed-rate, private-issuer securities collateralized by non-residential properties, primarily retail properties, office buildings, and multi-family housing. The agency commercial mortgage-backed securities
portfolio was 2.0 billion fair value at December 31, 2012 consisting of multi-family housing. Substantially all of the securities are the most senior tranches in the subordination structure. 
 There were no OTTI credit losses on commercial mortgage-backed securities during 2012. A SSET -B ACKED S ECURITIES The
fair value of the asset-backed securities portfolio was 6.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and consisted of fixed-rate and floating-rate, private-issuer securities collateralized primarily by various consumer credit products, including
residential

mortgage loans, credit cards, automobile loans, and student loans. Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and have credit protection in the form
of credit enhancement, over-collateralization and/or excess spread accounts. We recorded OTTI credit losses of 11 million on asset-backed
securities during 2012. All of the securities are collateralized by first lien and second lien residential mortgage loans and are rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2012, the noncredit portion of impairment recorded in Accumulated
other comprehensive income for asset-backed securities for which we have recorded an OTTI credit loss totaled 52 million and the related securities had a fair value of 603 million. For the sub-investment grade investment securities (available for sale and held to maturity) for which we have not recorded an OTTI loss through December 31, 2012, the fair value was 47 million,
with unrealized net losses of 3 million. The results of our security-level assessments indicate that we will recover the cost basis of these securities. Note 8 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report provides additional information on OTTI losses and further detail regarding our process for
assessing OTTI. If current housing and economic conditions were to worsen, and if market volatility and illiquidity were to worsen, or if
market interest rates were to increase appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio could be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.

 We stopped originating commercial mortgage loans held for sale designated at fair value in 2008 and continue pursuing
opportunities to reduce these positions at appropriate prices. At December 31, 2012, the balance relating to these loans was 772 million, compared to 843 million at December 31, 2011. We sold 32 million in unpaid principal balances of
these commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2012 and sold 25 million in 2011.

We sold 2.2 billion of commercial mortgages held for sale carried at the lower of cost or market in 2012.
The comparable amount in 2011 was 2.4 billion. The increase in these loans to 620 million at December 31, 2012, compared to 451 million at December 31, 2011, was due to an increase in loans awaiting sale to government agencies.
 We recognized total net gains of 41 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2011 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for
sale, net of hedges. Residential mortgage loan origination volume was 15.2 billion in 2012 compared with 11.4 billion in 2011.
Substantially all such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold 13.8 billion of loans and recognized related gains of 747 million during 2012. The comparable amounts for 2011 were 11.9 billion
and 384 million, respectively. Interest income on loans held for sale was 168 million in 2012 and 193 million in 2011. These amounts are
included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. Additional information regarding our loan sale and servicing
activities is included in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. G OODWILL AND O THER I NTANGIBLE A SSETS Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 10.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 10.1 billion at December 31, 2011. During 2012, we recorded goodwill of 950 million and other intangible
assets of 180 million associated with the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold certain deposits and assets of the Smartstreet business unit, which was acquired by PNC as part of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, which
resulted in a reduction of goodwill and core deposit intangibles by approximately 46 million and 13 million, respectively. Also in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a 45 million noncash charge for goodwill impairment related to PNC s
Residential Mortgage Banking business segment. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity and Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

 See the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional
information regarding our 2012 capital and liquidity activities and 2013 activities to date. Total funding sources increased 29.4 billion at
December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011. Total deposits increased 25.2 billion, or 13 , at December 31, 2012
compared with December 31, 2011. On March 2, 2012, our RBC Bank (USA) acquisition added 18.1 billion of deposits, including 6.9 billion of money market, 6.7 billion of demand, 4.1 billion of retail certificates of deposit, and .4
billion of savings. Excluding acquisition activity, money market and demand deposits increased during 2012, partially offset by the maturity of retail certificates of deposit. Interest-bearing deposits represented 67 of total deposits at
December 31, 2012 compared to 69 at December 31, 2011. Total borrowed funds increased 4.2 billion from December 31, 2011 to 40.9 billion at December 31, 2012, due to increases in Federal funds purchased and repurchase
agreements, FHLB borrowings and commercial paper net issuances, partially offset by net repayments and maturities of bank notes and senior debt and a reduction in subordinated debt due to redemptions of trust preferred securities and hybrid capital
securities.

C APITAL We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital
redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. Total shareholders equity increased 5.0 billion, to 39.0 billion at
December 31, 2012 compared with December 31, 2011, reflecting an increase in retained earnings of 2.0 billion and the issuance of 480 million of preferred stock in September and October 2012 and 1.5 billion in April 2012. This
contributed to the increase in capital surplus preferred stock from 1.6 billion at December 31, 2011 to 3.6 billion at December 31, 2012. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased .9 billion, to .8 billion, at
December 31, 2012 compared with a loss of .1 billion at December 31, 2011 due to higher net unrealized gains on securities, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on cash flow hedge derivatives. Common shares outstanding were
528 million at December 31, 2012 and 527 million at December 31, 2011. Our current common stock repurchase program
permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and
timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, and the potential impact
on our credit ratings. Consistent with our capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in the first quarter of 2012, PNC purchased 190 million of common stock in 2012 under a 250 million authorization for 2012 as part of its existing
25 million share repurchase program in open market or privately negotiated transactions. During 2013, management does not expect to repurchase any common stock under this repurchase program. See Supervision and Regulation in
Item 1 of this Report for further information concerning restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases, including the impact of the Federal Reserve s current supervisory assessment of capital adequacy program, which is also discussed in
the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7.

 Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect all bank holding companies to have a level and composition of
Tier 1 capital well in excess of the 4 Basel I regulatory minimum, and they have required the largest US bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet credit needs of their
customers through estimated stress scenarios. They have also stated their view that common equity should be the

dominant form of Tier 1 capital. As a result, regulators are now emphasizing the Tier 1 common capital ratio in their evaluation of bank holding company capital levels, although a formal ratio
for this metric is not provided for in current regulations. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our December 31, 2012 capital levels were aligned with them. 
 Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish capital requirements that would, among other things, eliminate the Tier 1 treatment of trust
preferred securities following a phase-in period expected to begin in 2013. Accordingly, PNC has redeemed some of its trust preferred securities and will consider redeeming others on or after their first call date, based on such considerations as
dividend rates, future capital requirements, capital market conditions and other factors. See the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our April
2012, May 2012, July 2012, and November 2012 redemptions of trust preferred securities and hybrid capital securities. See Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on trust preferred securities. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio was 9.6 
at December 31, 2012, compared with 10.3 at December 31, 2011. Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased 100 basis points to 11.6 at December 31, 2012 from 12.6 at December 31, 2011. Our total risk-based capital ratio
declined 110 basis points to 14.7 at December 31, 2012 from 15.8 at December 31, 2011. The decline in these ratios was primarily due to the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, which resulted in higher goodwill and risk-weighted assets, partially
offset by retention of earnings which more than offset organic asset growth. Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio reflected our 2012 capital actions of issuing approximately 2.0 billion of preferred stock and redeeming approximately 2.3 billion of
trust preferred securities and hybrid capital securities. Basel I risk-weighted assets increased 30.1 billion from 230.7 billion at December 31, 2011 to 260.8 billion at December 31, 2012 due to the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and
organic loan growth for 2012. At December 31, 2012, PNC Bank, N.A., our domestic bank subsidiary, was considered well
capitalized based on U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements under Basel I. To qualify as well-capitalized , regulators currently require banks to maintain capital ratios of at least 6 for Tier 1 risk-based, 10 for total
risk-based, and 5 for leverage. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We
believe PNC Bank, N.A. will continue to meet these requirements during 2013.

PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. entered the parallel run qualification phase under the Basel II capital
framework on January 1, 2013. The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices
among large, internationally active banking organizations. The U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel II capital framework in December 2007 and in June 2012 requested comment on proposed modifications to these rules
(collectively referred to as the advanced approaches ). See Recent Market and Industry Developments in the Executive Summary section of this Financial Review. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted
assets, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must successfully complete a parallel run qualification phase. This phase must last at least four consecutive quarters, although, consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, we currently anticipate
a multi-year parallel run period. The access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to undertake new business
initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory
oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution s capital strength. We provide additional information regarding enhanced
capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

 PNC consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary
beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb
losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. A summary of VIEs, including those
that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 is included in Note 3 in the Notes To Consolidated Financial

 Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred Securities 
 In connection with 402 million in principal amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures associated with 390 million of trust preferred
securities as of December 31, 2012 that were issued by various subsidiary statutory trusts, we are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments. Generally, if (i) there is an event of default under the
debentures, (ii) PNC elects to defer interest on the debentures, (iii) PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities issued by the statutory trusts, or (iv) there is a default under PNC s
guarantee of such payment obligations, as specified in the applicable governing documents, then PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the
debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with PNC Preferred Funding Trust II and Trust III, as described in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and
Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. See the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our

The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority
of Level 3 assets represent Non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio for which there was limited market activity. An instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. PNC reviews and updates fair value hierarchy
classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. PNC s policy is to
recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. During 2012, there were transfers of securities available for sale from Level 2 to Level 3 of 478 million consisting of mortgage-backed securities as a result of a
ratings downgrade which reduced the observability of valuation inputs and certain state and municipal securities with valuation inputs that were determined to be unobservable. Level 2 to Level 3 transfers also included 127 million and 27 million
for loans and residential mortgage loans held for sale, respectively, as a result of reduced market activity in the nonperforming residential mortgage sales market which reduced the observability of valuation inputs. Also during 2012, there was a
transfer out of Level 3 securities available for sale of 40 million due to an instrument being reclassified to a loan and no longer being carried at fair value. During 2011, there were no material transfers of assets or liabilities between the
hierarchy levels.

European entities are defined as supranational, sovereign, financial institutions and non-financial
entities within the countries that comprise the European Union, European Union candidate countries and other European countries. Foreign exposure underwriting and approvals are centralized. PNC currently underwrites new foreign activities if the
credit is generally associated with activities of its United States commercial customers, and, in the case of PNC Business Credit s United Kingdom operations, transactions that are predominantly well collateralized by self liquidating assets
such as receivables, inventories or, in limited situations, the borrower s appraised value of certain fixed assets, such that PNC is at minimal risk of loss. Formerly, PNC had underwritten foreign infrastructure leases supported by highly rated
bank letters of credit and other collateral, US Treasury securities and the underlying assets of the lease. Country exposures are monitored and reported on a regular basis. We actively monitor sovereign risk, banking system health, and market
conditions and adjust limits as appropriate. We rely on information from internal and external sources, including international financial institutions, economists and analysts, industry trade organizations, rating agencies, econometric data
analytical service providers and geopolitical news analysis services.

Among the regions and nations that PNC monitors, we have identified seven countries for which we are more
closely monitoring their economic and financial situation. The basis for the increased monitoring includes, but is not limited to, sovereign debt burden, near term financing risk, political instability, GDP trends, balance of payments, market
confidence, banking system distress and/or holdings of stressed sovereign debt. The countries identified are: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain (collectively GIIPS ), Belgium and France. At December 31, 2012, PNC s
exposure to Turkey was de minimis.

Direct exposure primarily consists of loans, leases, securities, derivatives, letters of credit and
unfunded contractual commitments with European entities. As of December 31, 2012, the 1.9 billion of funded direct exposure (.61 of PNC s total assets) primarily represented 645 million for cross-border leases in support of national
infrastructure, which were supported by letters of credit and other collateral having trigger mechanisms that require replacement or collateral in the form of cash or United States Treasury or government securities, 600 million for United Kingdom
foreign office loans and 168 million of securities issued by AAA-rated sovereigns. The comparable level of direct exposure outstanding at December 31, 2011 was 1.6 billion (.59 of PNC s total assets), which primarily included 625
million for cross-border leases in support of national infrastructure, 382 million for United Kingdom foreign office loans and 357 million of securities issued by AAA-rated sovereigns. The 550 million of unfunded direct exposure as of December 31, 2012 was largely comprised of 449 million for unfunded contractual commitments primarily for United Kingdom local office commitments
to PNC Business Credit corporate customers on a secured basis or activities supporting our domestic customers export activities through the confirmation of trade letters of credit. Comparably, the 485 million of unfunded direct exposure as of
December 31, 2011 was largely comprised of 440 million for unfunded contractual commitments primarily for United Kingdom local office commitments to PNC Business Credit corporate customers on a secured basis. 
 We also track European financial exposures where our clients, primarily U.S. entities, appoint PNC as a letter of credit issuing bank and we elect to
assume the joint probability of default risk. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, PNC had 2.5 billion and 2.3 billion, respectively, of indirect exposure. For PNC to incur a loss in these indirect exposures, both the obligor
and the financial counterparty participating bank would need to default. PNC assesses both the corporate customers and the participating banks for counterparty risk and where PNC has found that a

participating bank exposes PNC to unacceptable risk, PNC will reject the participating bank as an acceptable counterparty and will ask the corporate customer to find an acceptable participating
bank. Direct and indirect exposure to entities in the GIIPS countries totaled 241 million as of December 31, 2012, of which 122
million was direct exposure for cross-border leases within Portugal, 67 million represented direct exposure for loans outstanding within Ireland and 31 million represented indirect exposure for letters of credit with strong underlying obligors,
primarily U.S. entities, with participating banks in Ireland, Italy and Spain. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2011 were total direct and indirect exposure of 181 million, consisting of 118 million of direct exposure for
cross-border leases within Portugal, indirect exposure of 48 million for letters of credit with strong underlying obligors, primarily U.S. entities, with participating banks in Ireland, Italy and Spain and 15 million for unfunded contractual
commitments in Spain. Direct and indirect exposure to entities in Belgium and France totaled 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2012.
Direct exposure of 138 million primarily consisted of 69 million for cross-border leases within Belgium, 35 million for unfunded contractual commitments in France and 30 million of covered bonds issued by a financial institution in France.
Indirect exposure was 1.1 billion for letters of credit with strong underlying obligors, primarily U.S. entities, with creditworthy participant banks in France and Belgium. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2011 were total direct and
indirect exposure of 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 of which there was 154 million of direct exposure primarily consisting of 75 million for cross-border leases within Belgium and 62 million for unfunded contractual commitments in
France. In addition, direct exposure at December 31, 2011 included 11 million for 90 Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC guaranteed Turkish loans. Indirect exposure at December 31, 2011 was 935 million for letters
of credit with strong underlying obligors and creditworthy participant banks in France and Belgium.

 We have six reportable business segments: 

Retail Banking 

Corporate Institutional Banking 

Asset Management Group 

Residential Mortgage Banking 

BlackRock 

Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio Business segment results, including inter-segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 26 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Item 7 differ from those amounts shown in Note 26 primarily due to the presentation in this Business Segments Review of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.
 Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative
body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal
methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability to the
current period presentation to reflect any such refinements. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. We have aggregated the business results for certain similar operating
segments for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a
transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. During the second quarter of 2012, enhancements were made to the funds transfer pricing methodology. Retrospective application of our new funds transfer
pricing methodology has been made to the prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability to the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our financial statements.

A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using
our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill and other intangible assets at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments. 
 We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk in the
business segment loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes
react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated. During the third quarter of 2012, PNC
increased the amount of internally observed data used in estimating the key commercial lending assumptions of PDs and LGDs. The estimated impact as of the beginning of the third quarter 2012 was approximately an increase of 41 million and a
decrease of 55 million to the provision for credit losses of Retail Banking and Corporate Institutional Banking, respectively. Prior periods are not presented on a comparable basis as it is not practicable to do so. 
 Total business segment financial results differ from consolidated income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests. The impact of these
differences is reflected in the Other category. Other for purposes of this Business Segments Review and the Business Segment Highlights in the Executive Summary includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for
disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of
investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, alternative investments including private equity, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments and
differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments results exclude their portion of net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Retail Banking earned 596 million for 2012 compared with earnings of 371 million in 2011. The increase in
earnings resulted from organic growth in transaction deposit balances, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, lower rates paid on deposits, higher levels of customer-initiated transactions, a lower provision for credit losses, and the impact
of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, partially offset by the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions and higher additions to legal reserves. The results for 2012 include the impact of the retail business associated with the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and the credit card portfolio purchase from RBC Bank (Georgia), National Association in
March 2012. Retail Banking added approximately 12.1 billion in deposits, 4.9 billion in loans, 460,000 checking relationships, over 400 branches, and over 400 ATMs through this acquisition. Retail Banking s footprint extends across 17 states
and Washington, D.C., covering nearly half the US population and serving 5,733,000 consumers and 742,000 small businesses with 2,881 branches and 7,282 ATMs. Retail Banking s core strategy is to grow consumer and small business checking households profitably by providing an experience that builds customer loyalty and creates opportunities to sell other
products and services, including loans, savings accounts, investment products and money management services. Net checking relationships grew 714,000 in 2012, including 460,000 from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Organic net checking relationships
grew by 4 in 2012 from year end 2011. The growth reflects strong results and gains in all of our markets as well as strong customer retention in the overall network. Active online banking customers and active online bill payment customers increased
by 20 and 12 , respectively, from year end 2011. The business is also focused on expanding the use of technology, using services such as online banking and mobile deposit taking to improve customer service convenience and lower our service delivery
costs. Total revenue for 2012 was 6.3 billion compared with 5.6 billion in 2011. Net interest income of 4.3 billion increased 510 million
compared with 2011. The increase resulted from higher organic transaction deposit balances, lower rates paid on deposits, and the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Noninterest income increased 239 million compared to 2011. The increase was driven by the 267 million gain on the sale of 9 million Visa Class B common shares. Noninterest income has been adversely
affected by Dodd-Frank limits related to interchange rates that became effective in October 2011. The negative impact of these limits was approximately 314 million in 2012 and approximately 75 million in 2011. This impact has been partially offset
by higher volumes of merchant, customer credit card and debit card transactions and the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition.

The provision for credit losses was 800 million in 2012 compared with 891 million in the prior year. Net
charge-offs were 814 million for 2012 compared with 857 million for 2011. Improvements in credit quality over the prior year were evident in the small business and credit card portfolios. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter
of 2012, consumer charge-offs were taken in 2012 related to troubled debt restructurings resulting from bankruptcy. Such loans have been classified as troubled debt restructurings and have been measured at the fair value of the collateral less costs
to sell. Noninterest expense increased 483 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the operating
expenses associated with RBC Bank (USA) and higher additions to legal reserves. Growing core checking deposits is key to Retail
Banking s growth and to providing a source of low-cost funding to PNC. The deposit product strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of
balances for relationship customers. In 2012, average total deposits of 130.2 billion increased 7.7 billion, or 6 , compared with 2011. 

Average transaction deposits grew 13.4 billion, or 16 , and average savings deposit balances grew 1.7 billion, or 20 , year over year as a result of
organic deposit growth, continued customer preference for liquidity, and the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. In 2012, average demand deposits increased 7.8 billion, or 19 , to 48.2 billion; average money market deposits increased 5.6 billion, or 14 ,
to 46.6 billion. 

Total average certificates of deposit decreased 7.3 billion, or 22 , compared to 2011. This decline was in support of our low-cost funding strategy
and was due to the run-off of maturing accounts partially offset by the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Retail
Banking continues to focus primarily on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific customer sectors, including mass and mass affluent consumers, small businesses and auto dealerships. In 2012, average total loans were 63.9 billion,
an increase of 5.5 billion, or 9 , of which 4.0 billion was attributable to the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, primarily in the home equity portfolio. 

Average indirect auto loans increased 2.4 billion, or 77 , over 2011. The increase was due to the expansion of our indirect sales force and product
introduction to acquired markets, as well as overall increases in auto sales. An indirect auto portfolio of 522 million was purchased in September 2012. 

Average home equity loans increased 2.3 billion, or 9 , in 2012. The increase was due to the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. The remainder of the
portfolio 

60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

showed a decline as loan demand was outpaced by paydowns, refinancing and charge-offs. Retail Banking s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 97 of the portfolio
attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. 

Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased 631 million, or 6 , over 2011. The increase was due to the acquisition of RBC Bank
(USA). The remainder of the portfolio showed a decline as loan demand was outpaced by paydowns, refinancing and charge-offs. 

Average auto dealer floor plan loans grew 338 million, or 23 , in 2012, primarily resulting from dealer line utilization and additional dealer
relationships. 

Average credit card balances increased 325 million, or 9 , over 2011 as a result of the portfolio purchase from RBC Bank (Georgia), National
Association in March 2012 and organic customer growth.

Average education loans were down 225 million, or 2 , from 2011 as paydowns and charge-offs in the discontinued government guaranteed portfolio
outpaced growth in the private portfolio. 

Average indirect other and residential mortgages in this segment are primarily run-off portfolios and declined 317 million and 234 million,
respectively, in 2012. The indirect other portfolio is comprised of marine, RV, and other indirect loan products. 
 Nonperforming assets increased 298 million to 1.1 billion due to a change in policy on home equity loans, implemented in the first quarter of 2012,
which places these loans on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due (versus the prior policy of 180 days) as well as the implementation of regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 related to troubled debt restructurings resulting from
bankruptcy. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the level of commercial nonperforming assets.

Corporate Institutional Banking earned 2.3 billion in 2012, compared with 1.9 billion in 2011.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher revenue partially offset by higher noninterest expense and a provision for credit losses of zero in 2012 compared with a benefit of 124 million in 2011. We continued to focus on building client
relationships including increasing cross sales and adding new clients where the risk-return profile was attractive. Results in 2012 include
the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition in March 2012, which added approximately 7.5 billion of loans and 4.8 billion of deposits at acquisition date. Highlights of Corporate Institutional Banking s performance throughout 2012 include the following: 

Corporate Institutional Banking continued to execute on strategic initiatives, including in the Southeast, by organically growing and
deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. Approximately 1,100 new primary Corporate Banking clients were added in 2012. 

Loan commitments increased 24 to 181 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011, primarily due to the RBC Bank (USA)
acquisition and growth in our Corporate Banking (Corporate Finance, Financial Services Advisory and Banking, Public Finance and Healthcare businesses), Real Estate and Business Credit (asset-based lending) businesses. 

Period-end loan balances have increased for the ninth consecutive quarter, including an increase of 4 at December 31, 2012 compared with
September 30, 2012 and 22 compared with December 31, 2011. 

Our Treasury Management business, which ranks among the top providers in the country, continued to invest in markets, products and infrastructure as
well as major initiatives such as healthcare. 

Cross sales of treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to customers in PNC s markets continued to be successful and
were ahead of 2011. 

Midland Loan Services was the number one servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily and healthcare loans and was the second leading servicer of
commercial and multifamily loans by volume as of June 30, 2012 according to Mortgage Bankers Association. Midland is the only U.S. commercial mortgage servicer to receive the highest primary, master and special servicer ratings from Fitch
Ratings, Standard Poor s and Morningstar. Net interest income in 2012 was 4.1 billion, a 16 increase from
2011, reflecting higher average loans and deposits, partially offset by lower spreads on loans and deposits. Corporate service fees were 1.0
billion in 2012, an increase of 278 million from 2011, primarily due to higher

commercial mortgage servicing revenue and merger and acquisition advisory fees. The major components of corporate service fees are treasury management, corporate finance fees and commercial
mortgage servicing revenue. Other noninterest income was 568 million in 2012 compared with 485 million in 2011. The increase of 83 million
was primarily due to gains on asset sales and the impact of customer driven capital markets activity. The provision for credit losses was
zero in 2012 compared with a benefit of 124 million in 2011. The increase reflects higher loan and commitment levels offset by positive credit migration. Despite the increase, the overall credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs were 142
million in 2012, which decreased 233 million, or 62 , compared with 2011. The decline was attributable primarily to the commercial real estate portfolio. Nonperforming assets declined for the eleventh consecutive quarter, and at 1.2 billion, represented a 37 decrease from December 31, 2011. Noninterest expense was 2.0 billion in 2012, an increase of 196 million from 2011. Higher compensation-related costs were driven by improved performance and higher staffing, including the impact of the
RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Average loans were 86.1 billion in 2012 compared with 67.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 28 . Organically,
average loans grew 20 in the comparison. 

The Corporate Banking business provides lending, treasury management, and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized corporations,
government and not-for-profit entities, and selectively to large corporations. Average loans for this business increased 11.0 billion, or 33 , in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to an increase in loan commitments from new customers.
Organically, average loans for this business grew 22 in the comparison. 

PNC Real Estate provides commercial real estate and real estate-related lending and is one of the industry s top providers of both conventional
and affordable multifamily financing. Average loans for this business increased 2.7 billion, or 17 , in 2012 compared with 2011 due to increased originations. 

PNC Business Credit is one of the top five asset-based lenders in the country with increasing market share according to the Commercial Finance
Association. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with moderate risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans increased 1.9 billion, or 23 , in 2012 compared with 2011 due to customers seeking stable lending
sources, loan usage rates, and market share expansion.

PNC Equipment Finance is the 4th largest bank-affiliated leasing company with over 11 billion in equipment finance assets.
 Average deposits were 60.0 billion in 2012, an increase of 10.0 billion, or 20 , compared with 2011. 

Deposit growth has been very strong, consistent with the industry-wide trend, as clients hold record levels of cash. 

Deposit inflows into noninterest-bearing demand deposits continued as FDIC insurance has been an attraction for customers maintaining liquidity during
this prolonged period of low interest rates. 

The repeal of Regulation Q limitations on interest-bearing commercial demand deposit accounts became effective in the third quarter of 2011. Interest
in this product has been muted due to the current rate environment.

As of February 22, 2013, commercial deposits have declined by 3.6 billion from the December 31, 2012 level as a result of seasonal and
normal business activity. Deposit fluctuations due to the Transaction Account Guarantee Program s expiration have not been significant. Management expects that in the current interest rate environment, additional runoff of commercial deposits
will not be significant. The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was 282 billion at December 31, 2012 compared
with 267 billion at December 31, 2011. Servicing additions exceeded portfolio run-off. See the additional revenue discussion regarding
treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of the Consolidated Income Statement Review.

Asset Management Group earned 145 million in 2012 compared with 168 million in 2011. Revenue increased
 44 million in the year over year comparison as strong sales and higher average equity markets increased noninterest income by 4 and higher average deposit balances increased net interest income by 6 . The revenue increase was offset by higher
noninterest expense from strategic business investments and higher provision for credit losses. During 2012 the business continued to focus on client acquisition and asset and revenue growth. The core growth strategies for the business continue to include: investing in higher growth geographies including the Southeast region, increasing internal referral sales and adding new front line sales
staff throughout our footprint. For 2012, the business delivered strong sales production, grew high value clients and benefited from significant referrals from other PNC lines of business. Over time, the successful execution of these strategies and
the accumulation of our strong sales performance are expected to create meaningful growth in assets under management and noninterest income. Highlights of Asset Management Group s performance during 2012 include the following: 

Assets under administration of 224 billion with positive net flows of 2.5 billion in discretionary assets under management after adjustments to total
net flows for cyclical client activities, 

Strong sales production, up 32 over the prior year including a 37 increase in the acquisition of new primary clients, 

Significant referrals from other PNC lines of business, reflecting an increase of approximately 39 over 2011, 

Continuing levels of new business investment and focused hiring to drive growth, with over 360 external new hires, and 

PNC Wealth
Insight was awarded a 2012 CIO 100 Award by CIO Magazine. The online client reporting tool now
enables clients to view their PNC Investments brokerage accounts and access all client

information through a mobile application that supports a number of smartphone platforms. Assets under administration increased to 224 billion at December 31, 2012 from 210 billion at December 31, 2011. Discretionary assets under management were 112 billion at December 31,
2012 compared with 107 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase in the comparisons was driven by stronger average equity markets, positive net flows, and strong sales performance. Total revenue for 2012 was 973 million compared with 929 million for 2011. Noninterest income was 676 million for 2012, an increase of 27 million from the prior year attributable to stronger average
equity markets, increased sales and new client acquisition. Net interest income was 297 million for 2012 compared with 280 million for 2011. The increase was primarily a result of growth in transaction deposit balances. 
 Provision for credit losses of 11 million in 2012 increased 35 million compared to a benefit of 24 million for 2011. Noninterest expense was 732
million in 2012, an increase of 45 million, or 7 , from the prior year. The increase was attributable to investments in the business including the Southeast region and higher compensation-related costs. Asset Management Group remains focused on
disciplined expense management as it invests in these strategic growth opportunities. Average deposits of 8.3 billion for 2012 increased
 461 million, or 6 , over the prior year. Average transaction deposits grew 8 compared with 2011 and were partially offset by the strategic run-off of maturing certificates of deposit in the comparison. 
 Average loan balances of 6.2 billion increased 72 million, or 1 , from the prior year primarily due to increased consumer loan activity partially
offset by decreases in commercial and commercial real estate loans.

Residential Mortgage Banking reported a loss of 308 million in 2012 compared with earnings of 89 million
in 2011. Earnings declined from the prior year primarily as a result of higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, higher noninterest expense, including goodwill impairment, and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing
rights, partially offset by increased loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume. The strategic focus of the business is the
acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. Two key aspects of this strategy are: (i) competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving
their home purchase and refinancing needs; and (ii) pursuing strategic partnerships with reputable residential real estate franchises to acquire new customers. A key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity,
especially in the bank footprint markets. Residential Mortgage Banking overview: 

Total loan originations were 15.2 billion for 2012 compared with 11.4 billion in 2011. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct
channels under FNMA, FHLMC and FHA/VA agency guidelines. Refinancings were 77 of originations for 2012 and 76 in 2011. During 2012, 30 of loan originations were under the original or revised Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP or HARP 2).

Investors having purchased mortgage loans may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do
not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. At December 31, 2012, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Residential Mortgage
Banking business segment was 614 million compared with 83 million at December 31, 2011. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Item 7 and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 

PNC has experienced and expects to experience further elevated levels of residential mortgage loan repurchase demands reflecting changes in behavior and demand patterns
of two government-sponsored enterprises, FHLMC and FNMA, primarily related to loans sold in 2004 through 2008 into agency securitizations. 

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled 119 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with 118 billion at December 31, 2011.
Payoff volumes remained high, but new direct loan origination volume and servicing portfolio acquisitions offset the decline. 

Noninterest income was 317 million in 2012 compared with 751 million in 2011. The decrease resulted from current year additions to reserves of 761
million for residential mortgage loan repurchase obligations as compared to 102 million in 2011 and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by increased loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume.

Net interest income was 209 million in 2012 compared with 201 million in 2011. 

Noninterest expense was 992 million in 2012 compared with 797 million in 2011. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increased
residential mortgage origination volumes, servicing costs, a goodwill impairment charge and higher additions to legal reserves. Included in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 was an approximately 70 million charge resulting from an
agreement to amend consent orders previously entered into by PNC with its banking regulators. The agreement ends the independent foreclosure review program under the consent orders and replaces it with an accelerated remediation process.

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights was .7 billion at both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

 PNC accounts for its investment in BlackRock under the equity method of accounting, exclusive of a related deferred tax liability of 1.9 billion at December 31,
2012 and 1.7 billion at December 31, 2011. In May 2012, we exchanged 2 million shares of BlackRock Series B Preferred Stock for an equal number of shares of BlackRock common stock. The exchange transaction had no impact on the carrying
value of our investment in BlackRock nor on our use of the equity method of accounting. Our voting interest in BlackRock common stock was approximately 21 at December 31, 2012. 

(d) 
 Does not include liquidity discount. PNC
accounts for its shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock at fair value, which offsets the impact of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock to partially fund BlackRock long-term incentive plan (LTIP) programs. The
fair value amount of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the caption Other assets. Additional information regarding the valuation of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included in Note 9
Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. On September 29, 2011, PNC transferred
1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock to BlackRock to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation. Upon transfer, Other assets and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were reduced by 172 million, representing
the fair value of the shares transferred. On January 31, 2013, we transferred an additional 205,350 shares to BlackRock in connection with our obligation. The transfer reduced Other assets and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
by 33 million. After this transfer, we hold approximately 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which are available to fund our obligation in connection with the BlackRock LTIP programs. Additional information regarding our
BlackRock LTIP shares obligation is included in Note 16 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

This business segment consists primarily of non-strategic assets obtained through acquisitions of other
companies. Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of 237 million in 2012 compared with 200 million in 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income driven
by declines in loan balances and purchase accounting accretion. 2012 included the impact of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, which added
approximately 1.0 billion of residential real estate loans, .2 billion of commercial/commercial real estate loans and .2 billion of OREO assets. Of these assets, 1.0 billion were deemed purchased impaired loans. 
 Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio overview: 

Net interest income was 830 million in 2012 compared with 913 million 2011. The decrease was driven by lower purchase accounting accretion and loan
balances. 

Noninterest income was 13 million in 2012 compared with 47 million 2011. The decline was driven mainly by larger valuation adjustments to liabilities
for estimated repurchase losses on home equity loans sold. 

The provision for credit losses was 181 million in 2012 compared with 366 million in 2011. The decrease in the provision for credit losses reflected
a declining loan portfolio and improvement in asset quality. 

Noninterest expense in 2012 was 287 million compared with 275 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher other real estate owned
expenses. 

Average portfolio loans declined to 12.4 billion in 2012 compared with 13.4 billion in 2011. The overall decline was driven by customer payment
activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets partially offset by the addition of loans from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. 

Nonperforming loans were .7 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The consumer lending portfolio comprised 80 of
nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012. Nonperforming consumer loans increased 83 million from December 31, 2011 as a result of a change in the nonaccrual policy for home equity loans requiring loans to be placed on nonaccrual at 90
days past due compared to the prior policy of 180 days. Also contributing to the increase was a change in the treatment of certain consumer loans classified as TDRs, pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012. These TDRs
resulted from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower thereby granting a concession upon discharge from personal liability.

Net charge-offs were 299 million in 2012 and 370 million in 2011. Net charge-offs declined 17 on the consumer lending portfolio and 23 on the
commercial lending portfolio. The business activity of this segment is to manage the wind-down of the portfolio assigned to
it while maximizing the value and mitigating risk. The fair value marks taken upon acquisition of the assets, the team we have in place, and targeted asset resolution strategies help us to manage these assets. 

The Commercial Lending portfolio declined 18 to 1.35 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011. Loans to residential
developers declined 32 to .7 billion while the lease financing portfolio remained relatively flat at .7 billion. The leases are long-term with relatively low credit risk. 

The Consumer Lending portfolio declined .4 billion, or 4 , when compared to the same period last year. Excluding .9 billion of residential mortgage
loans from the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, the portfolio decreased 13 . The portfolio s credit quality has stabilized through actions taken by management. We have implemented various refinance programs, line management programs, and loss
mitigation programs to mitigate risks within this portfolio while assisting borrowers to maintain homeownership when possible. 

When loans are sold, we may assume certain loan repurchase obligations to indemnify investors against losses or to repurchase loans that they believe
do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. From 2005 to 2007, home equity loans were sold with such contractual provisions. At December 31, 2012, the liability for
estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio was 58 million compared to 47 million at December 31, 2011. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Item 7 and Note 24

C RITICAL A CCOUNTING E STIMATES 
A ND J UDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies.
Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions
that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Fair Value Measurements We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when
assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value
inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent
third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in
underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. PNC applies ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the
hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. The following
sections of this Report provide further information on this type of activity: 

Fair Value Measurements included within this Item 7, and 

Note 9 Fair Value included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit
 We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance For Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate
to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet
date. Our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of
which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: 

Probability of default (PD), 

Loss given default (LGD), 

Exposure at date of default (EAD), 

Movement through delinquency stages, 

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, 

Value of collateral, and 

Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in historical results. 
 In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer
loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest
category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. We have allocated approximately 1.8 billion, or 44 , of the ALLL at December 31, 2012 to the commercial lending category.
Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. Approximately 2.2 billion, or 56 , of the ALLL at December 31, 2012 have been allocated to these consumer lending categories. 
 During the third quarter of 2012, PNC increased the amount of internally observed data used in estimating the key commercial lending assumptions of PD
and LGD.

To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be
required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: 

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7
(which includes an illustration of the estimated impact on the aggregate of the ALLL and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit assuming we increased pool reserve loss rates for certain loan categories), and

Note 7 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements and
Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report. Estimated Cash Flows On Purchased Impaired Loans ASC 310-30 Loans and Debt
Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly SOP 03-3) provides the GAAP guidance for accounting for certain loans. These loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is
probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. 
 In our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, using internal and third-party
credit quality information to determine whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all contractually required payments. This point in time assessment is inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment
involved. Those loans that qualify under ASC 310-30 are recorded at fair value at acquisition, which involves estimating the expected cash
flows to be received. Measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 310-30 prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the acquisition date. 
 Subsequent to the acquisition of the loan, we are required to continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan. The
measurement of expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. All of these factors are inherently subjective and can
result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. Such changes in expected cash flows could increase future earnings volatility due to increases or decreases in the accretable yield (i.e., the difference between the
undiscounted expected cash flows and the recorded investment in the loan). The accretable yield is recognized as interest income on a constant effective yield method over the life of the loan. In addition, changes in

expected cash flows could result in the recognition of impairment through provision for credit losses if the decline in expected cash flows is attributable to a decline in credit quality.
 Goodwill Goodwill
arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail Banking and Corporate Institutional Banking
businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and, with respect to some products and services, an
international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services. As such, the value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services
are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually,
in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into
consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. For this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount Step
1 of the goodwill impairment test) as further discussed below. The fair values of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions based upon market comparables. Additionally, we may also
evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative of fair value, including price to earnings ratios and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an
operating segment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting unit s
goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. In this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test). If the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. The implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is determined by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and
liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) with the residual amount equal to the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.

A reporting unit s carrying amount is based upon assigned economic capital as determined by PNC s
internal management methodologies. In performing Step 1 of our goodwill impairment testing, we utilize three equity metrics: 

Assigned reporting unit economic capital as determined by our internal management methodologies, inclusive of goodwill. 

A 6 , well capitalized , Tier 1 common ratio for the reporting unit. 

The capital levels for comparable companies (as reported in comparable company public financial statements), adjusted for differences in risk
characteristics between the comparable companies and the reporting unit. In determining a reporting unit s fair value
and comparing it to its carrying value, we utilize the highest of these three amounts (the targeted equity in our discounted cash flow methodology. Under this methodology, we will infuse capital to achieve the targeted equity amount. As
of October 1, 2012 (annual impairment testing date), there was no unallocated excess capital (difference between shareholders equity minus total economic capital assigned and increased by the incremental targeted equity capital infusion).
 Except for the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit, which is discussed below, the estimated fair values of our reporting units
exceeded their carrying values by at least 10 and are not considered to be at risk of not passing Step 1. By definition, assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a
significant change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to decrease below their respective carrying values. During 2012, an interim period goodwill impairment test was performed for the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit as a result of additional provision recorded for residential mortgage repurchase
obligations during the second quarter. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the fair value of the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and no impairment was recorded. However, the results of Step 1 of the
annual goodwill impairment test indicated that the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit s fair value using a discounted cash flow approach was less than its carrying value. Our residential mortgage banking business, similar to other
residential mortgage banking businesses, is operating in an unsettled environment, which may result in higher operating costs, and has experienced increased uncertainties such as elevated indemnification and repurchase liabilities and foreclosure
related issues. Additionally, the current level of refinance volumes is not expected to continue indefinitely given that interest rates have been low for a prolonged period of time. During the fourth quarter, we recorded additional provision for
residential mortgage repurchase obligations of approximately 254

million principally driven by expected elevated levels of repurchase demands primarily as a result of further changes in behavior and demand patterns of government-sponsored enterprises, FHLMC
and FNMA, for loans sold into agency securitizations, including the years 2004 and 2005. These risk characteristics were reflected in the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit s assigned economic capital utilized and discount rate
assumption in the impairment test. We performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and determined that Residential Mortgage Banking s goodwill was impaired. The most significant fair value adjustment assumption related to the provision for
residential mortgage repurchase obligations as we believe a market participant would consider an incremental amount reasonably possible above the amount accrued. The impairment charge of 45 million was included in noninterest expense and did not
affect our regulatory and capital ratios. The Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit does not have any remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2012. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2011 or 2010. See Note 10 Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 
 Lease Residuals We provide
financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems, and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the
leased property, less unearned income. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors.
Residual values are derived from historical remarketing experience, secondary market contacts, and industry publications. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third-party, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the
risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the estimated residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. Residual values are reviewed for impairment at
least annually.

Revenue Recognition We earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: 

Lending, 

Securities portfolio, 

Asset management, 

Customer deposits, 

Loan sales and servicing, 

Brokerage services, 

Sale of loans and securities, 

Certain private equity activities, and 

Securities and derivatives trading activities, including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services, providing
merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and participating in certain capital markets transactions. Revenue earned on interest-earning assets, including the accretion of discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans recorded at
fair value, is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument. The timing and amount of revenue that we
recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market
conditions or industry norms. Residential And Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 We elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management
strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below. The fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows,
taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions. 
 Assumptions incorporated into the residential MSRs valuation model reflect management s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use
in valuing the residential MSRs. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available. As a benchmark for the
reasonableness of its residential MSRs fair value, PNC obtains opinions of value from independent parties brokers ). These brokers provided a range (+/- 10 bps) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that
reflected conditions in the secondary market, and any recently executed servicing transactions. PNC compares its internally-developed

residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers ranges, management will assess whether a valuation
adjustment is warranted. For 2012 and 2011, PNC s residential MSRs value has not fallen outside of the brokers ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 Commercial MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. Commercial MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily
observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available. Commercial MSRs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Commercial MSRs are periodically
evaluated for impairment. For purposes of impairment, the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type, which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset. The fair value of commercial MSRs is
estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations. 
 PNC employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. Residential MSRs
values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair
value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential MSRs portfolio. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential MSRs assets. Commercial MSRs
are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant
management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic
value of the MSRs. The fair value of residential and commercial MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of December 31,
2012 are shown in Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair
value. Management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions. Future
interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied

forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and
are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate. A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to
the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities. 
 Income Taxes In the normal
course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various
state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax
treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these
relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount
different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. Proposed
Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued several Exposure Drafts for comment during 2012 as well as
the beginning of 2013. In January 2013, the FASB issued Proposed Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860):
Effective Control for Transfers with Forward Agreements to Repurchase Assets and Accounting for Repurchase Financings . This exposure draft would change the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity agreements repos-to-maturity ).

Under the existing guidance, repos-to-maturity may meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales, but the proposed guidance would require them to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It would
also clarify the evaluation of whether financial assets that will be repurchased are substantially the same as those transferred. Additionally, the exposure draft proposes a change to the accounting for repurchases that are part of
repurchase financings, such that the initial transfer and repurchase are evaluated as two separate transactions. The effective date has not yet been determined. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. 
 In December 2012, the FASB issued Proposed ASU Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Subtopic 825-15) . The FASB has exposed a single-model
approach which would apply to all financial instruments carried at amortized cost or at fair-value through other comprehensive income (replacing the current ASC 450, Contingencies, ASC 310-10, Receivables Overall, ASC 310-30, Receivables
 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality and ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities approaches). This model would require reserves for all expected credit losses over the life of the
instrument. Under the proposal, retrospective application with cumulative adjustment to retained earnings will be required and early adoption would not be permitted. The effective date has not yet been determined. We are evaluating the impact of
this proposal on our financial statements. In October 2012, the FASB issued Proposed ASU Consolidation (Topic 810): Accounting for the
Difference between the Fair Value of the Assets and the Fair Value of the Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity . This exposure draft would define collateralized financing entity and require a reporting entity
that consolidates a collateralized financing entity and measures the associated financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, to measure that fair value consistently with how a market participant would price the reporting entity s
net exposure. The reporting entity would allocate portfolio-level adjustments to the individual assets and liabilities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The exposure draft would require a modified retrospective approach to be applied at adoption
for only those collateralized financing entities that exist at the date of adoption. Early adoption would be permitted. An effective date has not yet been determined. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements.
 In October 2012, the FASB issued Proposed ASU Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative
Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. This exposure draft would clarify the timing of release of Currency Translation Adjustments
(CTA) from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) upon deconsolidation or

Table of Contents 

derecognition of a foreign entity, subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity and in step acquisitions. Specifically, 1) Upon deconsolidation or derecognition of a foreign entity,
CTA would be released; 2) Upon sale of a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity, CTA would not be released, unless it also represents the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which it resides; and
3) In a step acquisition, the AOCI related to the previously held investment would be included in the calculation of gain or loss upon change in control. The proposed standard would be applied prospectively from the date of adoption with early
adoption permitted. An effective date has not yet been determined. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. 
 In July 2012, the FASB issued Proposed ASU Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements. This
exposure draft would require an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount under the arrangement is fixed at the reporting date per ASC 450-20, Contingencies Loss
Contingencies. This exposure draft would also require an entity to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation as well as information about the risks that such obligations pose to an entity s future cash flows. If the primary role of a
reporting entity in the joint and several liability arrangement is that of a guarantor, then it should account for the obligation under ASC 460, Guarantees. This guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those
obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of an entity s fiscal year of adoption. The effective date has not yet been determined. The comment period ended September 20, 2012. We are
evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 S TATUS O F Q UALIFIED 
D EFINED B ENEFIT P ENSION P LAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined
benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are applied as a percentage of eligible compensation. Pension contributions are based on an
actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine
and review the plan s investment policy, which is described more fully in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review
the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan. The primary assumptions used to measure pension obligations and costs are the discount rate, compensation increase and expected long-term return on assets. Among these, the compensation increase
assumption does not significantly affect pension expense. The discount rate used to measure pension obligations is determined by comparing
the expected future benefits that will be paid under the plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. The impact on pension expense of a 0.5 decrease in discount rate in the current environment is 21 million per
year. In contrast, the sensitivity to the same change in discount rate in a higher interest rate environment is less significant. The
expected long-term return on assets assumption also has a significant effect on pension expense. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested
in by the pension plan and the asset allocation policy currently in place. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, long term refers to the period over which the plan s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed.
We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations.
Accordingly, we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns. To evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption, we examine a variety of viewpoints and data. Various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of U.S. equity

Table of Contents 

securities have historically returned approximately 10 annually over long periods of time, while U.S. debt securities have returned approximately 6 annually over long periods. Application of
these historical returns to the plan s allocation ranges for equities and bonds produces a result between 7.25 and 8.75 and is one point of reference, among many other factors, that is taken into consideration. We also examine the plan s
actual historical returns over various periods and consider the current economic environment. Recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that, especially for short time periods, recent returns are not reliable
indicators of future returns. While annual returns can vary significantly (actual returns for 2012, 2011, and 2010 were +15.29 , +.11 , and +14.87 , respectively), the selected assumption represents our estimated long-term average prospective
returns. Acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption, we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with
similar pension investment strategies, so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from others. In all cases, however, this data simply informs our process, which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of
future investment returns, given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the
expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2012 was 7.75 , the same as it was for 2011. After considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the
effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective fixed income returns, we are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to 7.50 for determining pension cost for 2013. 
 Under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over
future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to increase or decrease by up to 8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations. 
 We currently estimate a pretax pension expense of 73 million in 2013 compared with pretax expense of 89 million in 2012. This year-over-year expected
decrease reflects the impact of favorable returns on plan assets experienced in 2012 as well as the effects of the lower discount rate required to be used in 2013. The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2013 estimated expense as a baseline.

(a) 
 The impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. 
 Our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance has the most impact on
contribution requirements and will drive the amount of required contributions in future years. Also, current law, including the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan.
We do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the plan during 2013. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a
less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees, which are described more fully in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report.

O BLIGATIONS As discussed in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing
involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets. C OMMERCIAL M ORTGAGE L OAN R ECOURSE O BLIGATIONS We originate, close, and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to FNMA under FNMA s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. We participated in a similar
program with the FHLMC. Under these programs, we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances
through a loss share arrangement. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was 12.8 billion and 13.0 billion, respectively. The potential
maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was 3.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 4.0 billion at December 31, 2011. We
maintain a reserve for estimated losses based on our exposure. The reserve for losses under these programs totaled 43 million and 47 million as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and is included in Other
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. If payment is required under these programs, we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred, although the value of the collateral is
taken into account in determining our share of such losses. Our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the Corporate Institutional Banking segment. 
 R ESIDENTIAL M ORTGAGE R EPURCHASE O BLIGATIONS 
 While residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have
sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where PNC is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and
sale agreements. Residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through Agency securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. As

discussed in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, Agency securitizations
consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with FNMA, FHLMC, and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) program, while Non-agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with private investors. Mortgage loan sale
transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve FNMA, FHLMC or private investors. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with FNMA
and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with Federal Housing Agency (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-insured and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. Repurchase obligation
activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. Loan covenants and representations
and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that PNC has sold loans that are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the
loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the
validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. 
 We investigate every investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for
indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to the settlement with that investor. Indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the
investor s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred
loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor, we typically respond to such indemnification and repurchase requests within 90 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. With the
exception of the sales agreements associated with the Agency securitizations, most sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests.

Table of Contents 

Indemnification and repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole
payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. In connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no
longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction. For the first and second-lien mortgage balances
of unresolved and settled claims contained in the tables below, a significant amount of these claims were associated with sold loans originated through correspondent lender and broker origination channels. In certain instances when indemnification
or repurchase claims are settled for these types of sold loans, we have recourse back to the correspondent lenders, brokers and other third-parties (e.g., contract underwriting companies, closing agents, appraisers, etc.). Depending on the
underlying reason for the investor claim, we determine our ability to pursue recourse with these parties and file claims with them accordingly. Our historical recourse recovery rate has been insignificant as our efforts have been impacted by the
inability of such parties to reimburse us for their recourse obligations (e.g., their capital availability or whether they remain in business) or factors that limit our ability to pursue recourse from these parties (e.g., contractual loss caps,
statutes of limitations). 
 
 Origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity, and, accordingly, management
continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. We establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien
mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. For the first and second-lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to
investor sale agreements based on claims made, demand patterns observed to date and/or expected in the future, and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. To estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of
representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio (both actual and estimated future defaults), (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims,
(iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about file requests, delinquent and liquidated loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions,
(iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims rescission rate ), and (v) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement, or indemnification.

(e) 
 Activity relates to loans sold through Non-agency securitizations and loan sale transactions. 

During 2012 and 2011, unresolved and settled investor indemnification and repurchase claims were primarily
related to one of the following alleged breaches in representations and warranties: (i) misrepresentation of income, assets or employment, (ii) property evaluation or status issues (e.g., appraisal, title, etc.), (iii) underwriting
guideline violations, or (iv) mortgage insurance rescissions. During 2012, FNMA and FHLMC expanded their efforts to reduce their exposure to losses on purchased loans resulting in a dramatic increase in second and third quarter repurchase
claims, primarily on the 2006-2008 vintages, but also other vintages. Included in this higher volume were repurchase claims made on loans in later stages of default than had previously been observed. For example, in the second quarter of 2012, we
experienced repurchase claims on loans which had defaulted more than two years prior to the claim date, which was inconsistent with historical
activity. In addition, in December 2012, PNC discussed with FHLMC and FNMA their intentions to further expand their purchased loan review activities in 2013 with a focus on 2004 and 2005 vintages, as well as certain loan modifications and aged
default loans not previously reviewed. Based on our discussions with both FNMA and FHLMC, we expect an increase in repurchase claims in 2013 and have increased the liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims accordingly.
 The ongoing elevated repurchase claim activity in 2012 contributed to the higher balance of unresolved claims for

residential mortgages in 2012, as well as the increase in residential mortgage indemnification and repurchase settlement activity in 2012. In response to the significant increase in claims in
2012 and expected increase in claims in 2013 due to changes in FNMA s and FHLMC s behavior, management revised its estimates of future claims resulting in significant increases to the indemnification and repurchase liability in both the
second and fourth quarters of 2012. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the liability for estimated losses on
indemnification and repurchase claims for residential mortgages totaled 614 million and 83 million, respectively. We believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and
repurchase claims for all residential mortgage loans sold and outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. In making these estimates, we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. See Note 24
Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 
 Indemnification and repurchase liabilities, which are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are initially recognized when
loans are sold to investors and are subsequently evaluated by management. Initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification and repurchase liability for the sold residential mortgage portfolio are recognized in Residential
mortgage revenue on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Home Equity Repurchase Obligations PNC s repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by
National City prior to our acquisition of National City. PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these
transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines/loans is reported in the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment. 
 Loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans
PNC sold to the investors are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including
underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual
obligations, investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. We investigate every
investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to settlement with that investor. Indemnifications for loss or loan
repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not

been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the
investor, we typically respond to home equity indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. Most home equity sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other
remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests. Investor indemnification or repurchase claims are
typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. In connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and
the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.

related to one of the following alleged breaches in representations and warranties: (i) misrepresentation of income, assets or employment, (ii) property evaluation or status issues (e.g., appraisal, title, etc.), or (iii) underwriting
guideline violations. The lower balance of unresolved indemnification and repurchase claims at December 31, 2012 is attributable to lower claims submissions and lower inventories of claims undergoing review due to the elevated settlement
activity in 2011. The lower 2012 indemnification and repurchase settlement activity was also affected by the lower claim activity and the lower inventory of claims mentioned above as well as a higher rate of claim rescissions. 
 An indemnification and repurchase liability for estimated losses for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to
be repurchased was established at the acquisition of National City. Management s evaluation of these indemnification and repurchase liabilities is based upon trends in indemnification and repurchase claims, actual loss experience, risks in the
underlying serviced loan portfolios, current economic conditions and the periodic negotiations that management may enter into with investors to settle existing and potential future claims.

At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the liability for estimated losses on indemnification
and repurchase claims for home equity loans/lines was 58 million and 47 million, respectively. We believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims
for all home equity loans/lines sold and outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. In making these estimates, we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. See Note 24 Commitments and
Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Indemnification and
repurchase liabilities, which are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are evaluated by management on a quarterly basis. Initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification and repurchase liability for
home equity loans/lines are recognized in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

R ISK M ANAGEMENT 
 PNC encounters risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.
This Risk Management section describes our risk management philosophy, appetite, culture, governance, risk identification, controls and monitoring and reporting. We also provide an analysis of our 
 key areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, market, and model. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and
equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. 
 We view Risk Management as a cohesive combination of the following risk elements: 

Risk Philosophy PNC s risk philosophy is to manage to an overall moderate level of risk to capture opportunities and optimize shareholder value. We dynamically set our strategies and make distinct risk taking
decisions with consideration for the impact to our aggregate risk position. The following principles guide our risk taking activities: 

1. 
 Identify and Understand Risks and Returns 

2. 
 Make Balanced Risk Decisions 

3. 
 Continuously Monitor and Manage Risks 
 Risk Appetite, Strategy and Optimization Risk appetite represents the organization s desired enterprise risk position. Reviewed periodically through the Risk Reporting process, the risk appetite serves as an operating guide for making
balanced risk decisions that support our business strategies; it will adjust over time to reflect the current and anticipated economic environment, growth objectives, and our risk profile. The risk appetite is not set or managed through a single determinant; rather, it is derived through a series of

quantitative and qualitative risk limits defined in policy and managed through the application of the enterprise risk management framework. The primary risk policies establish the enterprise
level risk limits and collectively represent PNC s enterprise risk appetite. This serves as an operating guide for making balanced risk decisions that support our business strategies, including growth strategy and exit strategy, where
appropriate. Risk Culture All employees are treated as risk managers, and they are responsible for understanding the overall risk philosophy and principles and how they apply within their areas. They are encouraged to collaborate
across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. PNC reinforces risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives. Incentives for
relevant employees incorporate risk management results through balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance. Proactive communication,
between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of issues. PNC s multi-level risk committee structure provides a formal channel to identify, decision, and report risk. Risk committees membership
includes representatives from business and risk groups that are responsible for helping ensure risk issues are proactively identified, decisioned, and communicated appropriately within the enterprise risk management framework. 
 Risk Organization and Governance 
 PNC employs a comprehensive Risk Management governance structure to help ensure that risks are identified; balanced decisions are made that consider risk
and return; and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this governance structure provide oversight for risk management activities at the board, corporate, and business levels. We use our governance structure
to assess the effectiveness of our Risk Management practices on an ongoing basis, based on how we manage our day-to-day business activities and on our development and execution of more specific strategies to mitigate risks. Specific responsibilities
include: Board of Directors The Board oversees enterprise risk management. The Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors evaluates PNC s risk appetite, management s assessment of the enterprise risk profile, and the enterprise-wide risk structure and processes established by management to identify, measure, monitor, and manage risk. The Audit
Committee of the Board also has responsibility for select areas of risk (e.g., Financial Reporting, Ethics, ICFR). Corporate
Committees At the management level, PNC has established several senior management-level committees to facilitate the review, evaluation, and management of risk. The

risk management, in part, by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate committees, which are the supporting committees for EC. The corporate committees are responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, recommending risk limits,
policies, and metrics, monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key risk issues, and approving significant transactions and initiatives. Working Committees The working committees are generally subcommittees of the corporate committees and include risk management committees for each of PNC s major businesses or
functions. Working committees are intended to define, design and develop the risk management framework at the business or function level. The working committees help to implement key enterprise-level activities within a business or function. These
committees recommend risk management policies for the business or function that are consistent with the enterprise-wide risk management objectives and policies. The business level committees are also responsible for approving significant initiatives
under a certain threshold. Working Groups Where appropriate, management will also form ad hoc groups (working groups) to
address specific risk topics and report to a working committee or corporate committee. These working groups generally have a narrower scope and may be limited in their duration. Policies and Procedures PNC uses various risk management policies and procedures to provide direction and guidance to management and the Board of Directors. These policies and
procedures are organized in a framework of different levels requiring review and approval at varying committees within the governance structure. Business Activities Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes. Integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately identify,
measure, manage, monitor, and report risks which may significantly impact each business. Risk Identification and Quantification
 Risk identification takes place across a variety of different risk types throughout the organization. These risk types consist of, but
are not limited to, Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk. Risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our governance
structure supports risk identification by facilitating that issues of the risk types, both existing and emerging, are assessed and mitigation strategies implemented. These risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and
assessed against the risk appetite.

Multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Risk Control and Self Assessments (RCSAs),
scenario analysis, stress testing, and special investigations. Risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or
businesses. The aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the risk appetite and tolerances as established through the policy framework and approved by the Board of Directors or by appropriate
managing committees. This enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to
our risk appetite. Risk Control and Limits PNC uses a multi-tiered risk policy, procedure, and committee charter framework to provide direction and guidance for identifying, decisioning, and managing risk, including appropriate processes to
escalate control parameter exceptions when applicable. Risk limits, defined quantitatively and qualitatively, are established within policy
across risk categories. When setting risk limits, PNC considers major risks, aligns with established risk appetite, balances risk-reward, leverages analytics, and adjusts limits timely in response to changes in external and internal environments.
 Quantitative and qualitative operating guidelines support risk limits and serve as an early warning system for potential violations of the
limits. These operating guidelines trigger mitigation strategies and management escalation protocols if limits are breached. Risk
Monitoring and Reporting PNC uses similar tools to monitor and report risk as to perform Risk Identification. These tools include
KRIs, KPIs, RCSAs, scenario analysis, stress testing, and special investigations. The risk identification and quantification processes, the
risk control and limits reviews, and the tools used for risk monitoring provide the basis for risk reporting. The objective of risk reporting is comprehensive risk aggregation and transparent communication of aggregated risks. Risk reports are
produced at the line of business level, the functional level (credit, market, operational) and the enterprise level. The enterprise level report aggregates the risks identified in the functional and business reports. The enterprise level report is
provided through the governance structure to the Board of Directors.

C REDIT R ISK M ANAGEMENT 
 Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is
inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks.
Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in PNC s risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are: identified and assessed; managed through specific
policies and processes; measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the board through our governance structure. 
 Asset Quality Overview Overall
asset quality trends in 2012 improved from December 31, 2011 and included the following: 

Nonperforming loans decreased 306 million, or 9 , to 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 compared with 3.6 billion as of December 31,
2011. This decrease was mainly attributable to decreases in commercial real estate and commercial nonperforming loans, which were partially offset by the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and higher nonperforming consumer loans. Pursuant to regulatory
guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, nonperforming consumer loans, primarily home equity and residential mortgage, increased 288 million in 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs, net of charge-offs,
resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability. Of these loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments at
December 31, 2012. Additionally, nonperforming home equity loans increased due to a change in policy made in the first quarter of 2012 which places home equity loans on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more compared with 180 days
under the prior policy. 

Overall loan delinquencies decreased 797 million, or 18 , from year-end 2011. The reduction was mainly due to a decline in government insured
residential real estate loans in addition to a first quarter of 2012 policy change for home equity loans whereby loans are placed on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days compared to prior policy of placing loans on nonaccrual status when past due
180 days. In addition, consumer loan delinquencies, primarily residential real estate delinquencies, decreased pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 related to treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs resulting
from bankruptcy as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate delinquencies. 

Net charge-offs were 1.3 billion in 2012, down 21 from 2011 net charge-offs of 1.6 billion. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third
quarter of 2012, additional consumer charge-offs of 128.1 million have been taken in 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability under bankruptcy protection where no formal
reaffirmation was provided by the borrower. Such loans have been classified as TDRs and have been measured at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

The provision for credit losses declined 14 to 1.0 billion for 2012 compared with 1.2 billion for 2011. 

The level of ALLL decreased 7 to 4.0 billion at December 31, 2012 from 4.3 billion at December 31, 2011.

N ONPERFORMING A SSETS AND L OAN 
D ELINQUENCIES Nonperforming Assets, including OREO and Foreclosed Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not
probable and include nonperforming TDRs, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming
loans. Additional information regarding our nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in
the table below. Nonperforming assets decreased 362 million from December 31, 2011, to 3.8 billion at December 31, 2012, as
discussed above. Nonperforming loans decreased 306 million to 3.3 billion and OREO and foreclosed assets decreased 56 million to 540 million. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, OREO and foreclosed assets decreased to 2.04 at
December 31, 2012 from 2.60 at December 31, 2011. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans declined to 1.75 at December 31, 2012, compared to 2.24 at December 31, 2011. Total nonperforming assets have declined 2.6
billion, or 41 , from their peak of 6.4 billion at March 31, 2010. Management continues to evaluate nonaccrual and charge-off policies
for second-lien consumer loans (residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines) pursuant to interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties. This will
result in future classification of performing second-lien consumer loans as nonperforming where the first-lien loan is 90 days or more past due. Pursuant to the guidance, the Company will adopt a policy in the first quarter of 2013, subsequent to
operationalizing related procedures, to
charge- 

off a portion of certain second-lien consumer loans (residential mortgage and home equity lines of credit) where the first-lien loan is 90 days or more past due. Additionally, given these
operational enhancements and pursuant to interagency supervisory guidance, the company will update certain additional nonaccrual and charge-off policies. We estimate adding approximately 350 million to 450 million to the nonaccrual consumer loan
population in the first quarter of 2013. If these policies had been in effect as of December 31, 2012, there would have been an estimated cumulative charge-off of approximately 140 million. The credit loss policies for these loans are
considered in our reserving process and the risk of loss associated with these loans was considered in the determination of our ALLL at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, TDRs included in nonperforming loans were 1.6 billion or 49 of total nonperforming loans compared to 1.1 billion or 32 of nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2011.
Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 64 of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012, up from 51 at December 31, 2011. Home equity TDRs comprise 70 of home equity
nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012, down from 77 at December 31, 2011. The level of TDRs in these portfolios is expected to result in elevated nonperforming loan levels because TDRs remain in nonperforming status until a borrower
has made at least six consecutive months of payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. At December 31, 2012, our
largest nonperforming asset was 38 million and in the Real Estate Rental and Leasing Industry. Our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under 1 million. Eight of our ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are
from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 11 and 4 of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2012.

the 245 million added to OREO through the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA), 109 million remained at December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 31 and 32 , respectively, of our OREO and foreclosed assets were
comprised of 1-4 family residential properties. Excluded from OREO at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, was 380 million and 280 million of residential real estate that was acquired by us upon foreclosure of serviced
loans because they are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

 The table above represents nonperforming asset activity for 2012 and 2011. For 2012, nonperforming assets decreased 362
million from 4.2 billion at December 31, 2011 to 3.8 billion primarily due to decreases in commercial real estate and commercial nonperforming loans. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher nonperforming consumer loans. Pursuant to
regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, nonperforming consumer loans, primarily home equity and residential mortgage, increased 288 million in 2012

related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been
granted based upon discharge from personal liability. Of these loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments at December 31, 2012. Additionally, nonperforming home equity loans increased due to a change in policy made in the first
quarter of 2012 which places home equity loans on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more compared with 180 days under the prior policy. Approximately 85 of total nonperforming loans are secured by collateral which is generally expected to
reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of December 31, 2012, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 53 of unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date. Approximately 24 of commercial lending
nonperforming loans are contractually current as to principal and interest. See Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional nonperforming asset information. 
 Purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the
original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. The accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value.
Generally, decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled purchased impaired loans will result in an impairment charge to the provision for
loan losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. Generally, increases in the net present value of expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans will first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to
the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. This accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans significantly reduces nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above.
This treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of ALLL to nonperforming loans. See Note 6 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for
additional information on these loans. Loan Delinquencies We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of
each loan. Loans for which payment is 30 days or more past due are considered delinquent. Loan

88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans. Total early stage loan delinquencies, or accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days, were 1.4 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of 175 million or 11 from December 31, 2011. The main driver
of this decrease was due to consumer lending early stage delinquencies, mainly home equity, which were partly offset by an increase in commercial lending early stage delinquencies related to commercial and commercial real estate loans. 
 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are considered late stage delinquencies. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to
accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment

and/or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. These loans decreased 622 million, or 21 ,
from 3.0 billion at December 31, 2011, to 2.4 billion at December 31, 2012, mainly due to improvements in government insured delinquent residential real estate loans, decline in delinquent home equity loans due to the change in policy
made in the first quarter of 2012, along with the decrease in non government insured residential real estate loans pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as
TDRs resulting from bankruptcy. The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Additional information regarding accruing loans past due is included in Note 5 Asset Quality in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

 In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted a policy stating that Home equity loans past due 90 days or more would be placed on nonaccrual status. Prior policy required
that these loans be past due 180 days before being placed on nonaccrual status. 

On a regular basis our Special Asset Committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are
not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower s ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months. These loans totaled 242 million at
December 31, 2012 and 438 million at December 31, 2011. Home Equity Loan Portfolio 
 Our home equity loan portfolio totaled 35.9 billion as of December 31, 2012, or 19 of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, 23.6 billion, or
66 , was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and 12.3 billion, or 34 , consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 3 of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of
December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 37 of the total
portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2 of the portfolio. Historically, we have originated and sold first lien residential real estate mortgages which
resulted in a low percentage of home equity loans where we hold the first lien mortgage position. The remaining 61 of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. For the majority of the home equity
portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, the credit performance of this portion of the portfolio is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.
 Subsequent to origination, PNC is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by PNC is satisfied. Therefore,
information about the current lien status of the

loans is limited, for loans that were originated in subordinated lien positions where PNC does not also hold the senior lien, to what can be obtained from external sources. PNC contracted with a
third-party service provider to provide updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources. We track
borrower performance monthly, including obtaining updated FICO scores at least quarterly, original LTVs, updated LTVs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless
of lien position that we may or may not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management purposes. For internal reporting and risk management purposes we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g.,
home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analytics monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency, modification
status, and bankruptcy status of these loans, as well as based upon the delinquency, modification status, and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).
 In establishing our ALLL for non-impaired loans, we utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. In accordance with
accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses and not lifetime expected losses. The roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30-59 days
past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60-89 days past due), and ultimately charge-off. The roll through to charge-off is based on PNC s actual loss experience for each type of pool. Since a pool may

consist of first and second liens, the charge-off amounts for the pool are proportionate to the composition of first and second liens in the pool. Our experience has been that the ratio of first
to second lien loans has been consistent over time and is appropriately represented in our pools used for roll-rate calculations. Generally,
our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20 year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines
of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. Based upon outstanding balances at December 31, 2012, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.

 Includes approximately 166 million, 208 million, 213 million, 61 million, 70 million and 526 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with
draw periods scheduled to end in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and thereafter, respectively. We view home equity lines
of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest
payments. Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at December 31, 2012, for home equity lines of credit
for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3.86 were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.96 were greater than or equal to 90 days past due. Generally,
when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges, and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include a loss mitigation loan modification
resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR. See Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this Report for additional information. 

L OAN M ODIFICATIONS AND T ROUBLED 
D EBT R ESTRUCTURINGS Consumer Loan Modifications 
 We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where
appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and
permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, certain payment
plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this Report. A temporary modification, with a term between three and 60 months, involves a change in original loan terms
for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 60 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed.
Permanent modifications primarily include the government-created Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) or PNC-developed HAMP-like modification programs. For consumer loan programs, such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a
willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. Examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family, or a loss of employment. Permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the
borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with
changes in terms for up to 60 months, although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months. We also monitor the success rates and
delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers needs while mitigating credit losses. The following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified
consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months, twelve months and fifteen months after the modification date.

In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a HAMP
trial payment period. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to the loan s contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms. A payment plan involves
the borrower paying the past due amounts over a short period of time, generally three months, in addition to the contractual payment amounts over that period upon which a borrower is

brought current. Due to the short term nature of the payment plan there is a minimal impact to the ALLL. Under a HAMP trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. This allows a
borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a HAMP modification. Subsequent to successful

Table of Contents 

borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due and restructure the loan s contractual terms, along with bringing the
restructured account to current. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, there is not a significant increase in the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will
be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies. Residential conforming and certain residential construction loans have been
permanently modified under HAMP or, if they do not qualify for a HAMP modification, under PNC-developed programs, which in some cases may operate similarly to HAMP. These programs first require a reduction of the interest rate followed by an
extension of term and, if appropriate, deferral of principal payments. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 4,188 accounts with a balance of 627 million and 2,701 accounts with a balance of 478 million, respectively, of
residential real estate loans have been modified under HAMP and were still outstanding on our balance sheet. We do not re-modify a defaulted
modified loan except for subsequent significant life events. A re-modified loan continues to be classified as a TDR for the remainder of its term regardless of subsequent payment performance. Commercial Loan Modifications and Payment Plans Modifications of terms for large
commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the term of the loan and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified large commercial loans are
usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as
well as in Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Beginning in 2010, we
established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 68 million and 81
million, respectively, in loan balances were covered under these modification and payment plan programs. Of these loan balances, 24 million have been determined to be TDRs as of both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Troubled Debt Restructurings A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs typically result from our loss mitigation activities and
include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, extensions, and bankruptcy discharges from personal liability, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of
collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2012, 3.1 billion of loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain consumer government insured or guaranteed loans which
were evaluated for TDR consideration, are not classified as TDRs. The comparable amount for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 2.7 billion. Table 42: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings

 Includes credit cards and certain small business and consumer credit agreements whose terms have been restructured and are TDRs. However, since our policy is to exempt
these loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance as generally these loans are directly charged off in the period that they become 180 days past due, these loans are excluded from nonperforming loans.

(b) 
 Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, additional troubled debt restructurings related to changes in treatment of certain loans of 366
million in 2012, net of charge-offs, resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability were added to the consumer lending
population. The additional TDR population increased nonperforming loans by 288 million. Charge-offs have been taken where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded investment of the loan and were 128.1 million. Of
these nonperforming loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments at December 31, 2012. 

(c) 
 Accruing loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.
 Total TDRs increased 656 million or 30 during the year ended December 31, 2012 to 2.9 billion. Of this total,
nonperforming TDRs totaled 1.6 billion, which represents approximately 49 of total nonperforming loans.

TDRs that have returned to performing (accruing) status are excluded from nonperforming loans. These loans
have demonstrated a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. These TDRs increased .3 billion, or 35 during 2012 to 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. This increase reflects the further
seasoning and performance of the TDRs. See Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Total net charge-offs are lower than they would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for
purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge-offs to average loans. See Note 6 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on net
charge-offs related to these loans. We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan portfolio and determine this allowance based on
quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio as of the
balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance
experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated. During the

third quarter of 2012, PNC increased the amount of internally observed data used in estimating the key commercial lending assumptions of PD and LGD. See the Critical Accounting Estimates And
Judgments section of this Item 7 for additional information. We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using
methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential mortgage, and consumer
installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate,
observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based
on PD and LGD credit risk ratings.

Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD;
the results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance to determine the amount of the reserve. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for
non-impaired commercial loans. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve LGD by 5 for all categories of non-impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2012, then the aggregate of the ALLL and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and
letters of credit would increase by 74 million. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to
asset-based lending customers that continue to show demonstrably lower LGD. Further, the large investment grade or equivalent portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. Additionally,
guarantees on loans greater than 1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our ALLL. Allocations
to non-impaired consumer loan classes are based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately
charge-off. A portion of the ALLL related to qualitative and measurement factors has been assigned to loan categories. These factors include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

Industry concentrations and conditions, 

Recent credit quality trends, 

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, 

Recent macro-economic factors, 

Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and 

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions.

Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits
the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our
expectations as of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2012, we had established reserves of 1.1 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, all loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired in the RBC Bank (USA)
acquisition were recorded at fair value . No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at acquisition. See Note 6 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for
additional information. In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this
allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities.
We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is similar to the one we use for determining
our ALLL. We refer you to Note 5 Asset Quality and Note 7 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of
Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information on key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolio and establish the allowances.

As further described in the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7, the provision
for credit losses totaled 1.0 billion for 2012 compared to 1.2 billion for 2011. For 2012, the provision for commercial lending credit losses declined by 39 million or 22 from 2011. Similarly, the provision for consumer lending credit losses
decreased 126 million or 13 from 2011. At December 31, 2012, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 124 . The comparable amount
for December 31, 2011 was 122 . These ratios are 79 and 84 , respectively, when excluding the 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, of allowance at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 allocated to consumer loans and lines
of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming
status. Additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted based on our estimate of expected cash flows and additional allowance is recorded when
these cash flows are below recorded investment. See Table 33: Nonperforming Assets By Type within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information. The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During 2012,
improving asset quality trends, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, improving economic conditions, realization of previously estimated losses through charge-offs and overall portfolio growth, combined to result in reducing the
estimated credit losses within the portfolio. As a result, the ALLL balance declined 311 million, or 7 , to 4.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012. 
 
 See Note 7 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit and
Note 6 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the ALLL and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. 
 C REDIT D EFAULT S WAPS From a credit risk management perspective, we use credit default swaps (CDS) as a tool to manage risk concentrations in the credit portfolio. That risk management could come from protection purchased or
sold in the form of single name or index products. When we buy loss protection by purchasing a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs for a particular
obligor or reference entity. When we sell protection, we receive a CDS premium from the buyer in return for PNC s obligation to pay the
buyer if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. We evaluate the counterparty credit worthiness for all
our CDS activities. Counterparty creditworthiness is approved based on a review of credit quality in accordance with our traditional credit quality standards and credit policies. The credit risk of our counterparties is monitored in the normal
course of business. In addition, all counterparty credit lines are subject to collateral thresholds and exposures above these thresholds are secured. CDSs are included in the Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP section of Table 54: Financial Derivatives Summary in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk
Management discussion.

Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. This includes losses that may arise as a result of non-compliance
with laws or regulations, failure to fulfill fiduciary responsibilities, as well as litigation or other legal actions. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to:

Transaction processing errors, 

Unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties, 

Material disruption in business activities, 

System breaches and misuse of sensitive information, 

Regulatory or governmental actions, fines or penalties, and 

Significant legal expenses, judgments or settlements. PNC s Operational Risk Management is inclusive of Technology Risk Management, Compliance, and Business Resiliency. Operational Risk Management focuses on balancing business needs, regulatory
expectations and risk management priorities through an adaptive and proactive program that is designed to provide a strong governance model, sound and consistent risk management processes and transparent operational risk reporting across the
enterprise. The PNC Board determines the strategic approach to operational risk via establishment of the operational risk appetite and
appropriate risk management structure. This includes establishment of risk metrics and limits and a reporting structure to identify, understand and manage operational risks. Executive Management has responsibility for operational risk management. The executive management team is responsible for monitoring risk issues through management reporting and a governance structure of
risk committees and sub-committees. Within Risk Management, Operational Risk Management functions are responsible for developing and
maintaining the policies, methodologies, tools, and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor, and report operational risks, including compliance risk. A key function of Operational Risk Management is to help ensure
business units alignment with the Operational Risk Management framework and to validate results and overall program effectiveness. 
 Business Unit management is responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risks inherent in the products, services, and activities for which
they are responsible. Business Unit management is also responsible for adhering to PNC s enterprise-wide operational risk management policies

and procedures; including regularly identifying, measuring, and monitoring operational risks in their respective area, as well as capturing, analyzing and reporting operational loss events.
 Management of operational risk is based upon a comprehensive framework designed to enable the company to determine the enterprise and
individual business unit s operational risk profile in comparison to the established risk appetite and identify operational risks that may require further mitigation. This framework is established around a set of enterprise-wide policies and a
system of internal controls that are designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. This framework employs a number of techniques to manage operational risk, including: 

Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) are performed at least annually across PNC s businesses, processes, systems and products. RCSA
methodology is a standard process for management to self assess operational risks, evaluate control effectiveness, and determine if risk exposure is within established tolerances, 

Scenario Analysis is leveraged to proactively evaluate operational loss events with the potential for severe business, financial, operational or
regulatory impact on the company or a major business unit. This methodology leverages standard processes and tools to evaluate a wide range of business and operational risks encompassing both external and internal events relevant to the company.
Based upon scenario analysis conclusions, management may implement additional controls or risk management activities to reduce exposure to an acceptable level, 

A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) framework allows management to assess actual operational risk results compared to expectations and thresholds, as well as
proactively identify unexpected shifts in operational risk exposure or control effectiveness. Enterprise-level KRIs are designed to monitor exposure across the different inherent operational risk types, including compliance risk. Business-specific
KRIs are established in support of the individual risk and control self assessments, and 

Operational loss events across the enterprise are continuously captured and maintained in a central repository. This information is analyzed and used
to help determine the root causes of these events and to identify trends that could indicate changes in the company s risk exposure or control effectiveness. PNC utilizes a number of sources to identify external loss events occurring across the
financial services industry. These events are evaluated to determine whether PNC is exposed to similar events, and if so, whether appropriate controls are in place.

We continue to enhance our methodology to estimate capital requirements for Operational Risk using a
proprietary version of an Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA). Under the AMA approach, the results of the program elements described above are key inputs directly incorporated into the capital calculation methodology. 
 Risk professionals from Operational Risk Management, Technology Risk Management, Business Resiliency, Compliance, and Legal work closely with business
areas to evaluate risks and help ensure that appropriate controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services, and technologies. These risk professionals also consult with business areas in the design and
implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities. 
 PNC s technology risk management program is aligned with the operational risk framework. Management of technology risk is embedded into the culture
and decision making processes of PNC through an information and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure secure, sound, and compliant IT systems and infrastructure in support of business strategies and goals. PNC s
Technology Risk Management (TRM) function supports enterprise management of technology risk by independently assessing technology and information security risks, and by serving in an oversight role by measuring, monitoring, and challenging
enterprise technology capabilities. Our business resiliency program manages the organization s capabilities to provide services in the
case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities is based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. A testing program
validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure appropriate management reporting. Enterprise Compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of PNC s Operational Risk framework. Compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide
monitoring and tracking programs. Key compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of the
firm s operational risk profile. The Compliance, Conflicts Ethics Policy Committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, provides oversight for compliance, conflicts and ethics programs and strategies across PNC. This committee
also oversees the compliance processes related to fiduciary and investment risk. In order to help understand and where appropriate proactively address emerging regulatory issues, Enterprise Compliance communicates regularly with various

regulators with supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to PNC, its subsidiaries or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the
financial services industry. PNC uses insurance where appropriate to help mitigate the effects of operational risk events. In 2012, PNC
implemented a Network Security Privacy Liability program to address associated risks. The purchase of insurance protects against accidental losses, which, in the aggregate, may affect personnel, financial objectives, or our ability to
meet responsibilities to various stakeholder groups. While certain corporate risks are retained through a subsidiary, various insurers provide the balance of coverage. Uncertainty, related to insurer coverage determinations, may result in reduced
benefit received from insurance mitigation. Oversight of insurance purchased is provided by Risk committees within the governance structure. 
 On a quarterly basis, an enterprise operational risk report is developed to report key operational risks to senior management and the Board of Directors.
The report encompasses key operational risk management conclusions, including the overall operational risk level, risk management effectiveness and outlook, grounded in quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Key enterprise operational risks
are also included in the enterprise risk report. In addition, operational risk is an integrated part of the quarterly business-specific risk reports. Model Risk Management PNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to
estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading and granting loans, measuring interest rate risks and other market risks, predicting losses, and assessing capital
adequacy, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. There are risks involved in the use of models as they have the potential to provide inaccurate output or results, could be used for purposes other than
those for which they have been designed, or may be operated in an uncontrolled environment where unauthorized changes can take place and where other control risks exist. Model Risk Management is responsible for policies and procedures describing how
model risk is evaluated and managed, and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. The Model Risk Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, oversees all
aspects of model risk, including PNC s compliance with regulatory requirements, and approves exceptions to policy when appropriate. To
better manage our business, our practices around the use of models, and to comply with regulatory guidance and requirements, we have in place policies and procedures that define our governance processes for assessing and controlling

model risk. These processes focus on identifying, reporting, and remediating any problems with the soundness, accuracy, improper use, or operating environment of our models. We recognize that
models must be monitored over time to ensure their continued accuracy and functioning, and our policies also address the type and frequency of monitoring that is appropriate according to the importance of each model. 
 There are a number of practices we undertake to identify and control model risk. A primary consideration is that models be well understood by those who
use them as well as by other parties. Our policies require detailed written model documentation for significant models to assist in making their use transparent and understood by users, independent reviewers, and regulatory and auditing bodies. The
documentation must include details on the data and methods used to develop each model, assumptions utilized within the model, and a description of model limitations and circumstances in which a model should not be relied upon. 
 Our modeling methods and data are reviewed by independent model reviewers not involved in the development of the model to identify possible errors or
areas where the soundness of the model could be in question. Issues identified by the independent reviewer are tracked and reported using our existing governance structure until the issue has been fully remediated. It is important that models
operate in a controlled environment where access to code or the ability to make changes is limited to those so authorized. Additionally, proper back-up and recovery mechanisms are needed for the ongoing functioning of models. Our use of independent
model control reviewers aids in the evaluation of the existing control mechanisms to help ensure that controls are appropriate and are functioning properly. Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first
is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available in a stressed environment. We
manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as
usual and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity. Spot and forward
funding gap analyses are used to measure and monitor consolidated liquidity risk. Funding gaps represent the difference in projected sources of liquidity available to offset projected uses. We calculate funding gaps for the overnight, thirty-day,
ninety-day, one hundred eighty-day and one-year time intervals. Management also monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress

event. Finally, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity crisis. In the most severe liquidity stress
simulation, we assume that PNC s liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external
sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets, and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. Risk limits are established within our Liquidity Risk Policy. Management s Asset and Liability
Committee regularly reviews compliance with the established limits. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that
sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. Risk limits for parent company liquidity are established within our Enterprise Capital and Liquidity Management Policy. The Board of
Directors Risk Committee regularly reviews compliance with the established limits. Bank Level Liquidity Uses
 Obligations requiring the use of liquidity can generally be characterized as either contractual or discretionary. At the bank level,
primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 17.2 billion of bank
borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary. See the Bank Level Liquidity Sources section
below. Bank Level Liquidity Sources Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and commercial businesses. Total deposits increased to 213.1 billion at December 31, 2012
from 188.0 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily due to the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. Liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a
diverse mix of short and long-term funding sources. At December 31, 2012, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal
funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities, and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling 7.5 billion and securities available for sale totaling 51.1 billion. Of our total liquid assets of 58.6 billion, we had 25.6 billion pledged as
collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and active balance sheet management, including securities purchases
to manage duration.

In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of
relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding including long-term debt (senior notes and subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds
purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper issuances, and other short-term borrowings). PNC Bank, N.A. is
authorized by its board to offer up to 20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. Through December 31, 2012, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued 10.4 billion of debt under this program,
including the following during 2012: 

100 million of senior bank notes issued March 8, 2012 and due April 8, 2015. Interest is paid semi-annually at a fixed rate of 1.07 ,

1.0 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued June 20, 2012 with an initial maturity date of July 20, 2013, subject to
the holder s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of June 20, 2014. Interest is paid at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of 22.5 basis points, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point
increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder, 

900 million of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate on June 27, 2012 with an initial maturity date of July 27,
2013, subject to the holder s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of April 27, 2014. Interest is paid at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of 22.5 basis points, 

500 million of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate on June 27, 2012 with an initial maturity date of July 27,
2013, subject to the holder s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of January 27, 2014. Interest is paid at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of 22.5 basis points, and 

1.0 billion of subordinated notes issued October 22, 2012 and due November 1, 2022. Interest is paid semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.70 .
 See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding
our 2013 issuances under this program, which totaled 1.8 billion. Total senior and subordinated debt increased to 7.6 billion at
December 31, 2012 from 4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 due to issuances. PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and as
such has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage and other mortgage-related

loans. At December 31, 2012, our unused secured borrowing capacity was 10.5 billion with FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings increased to 9.4 billion at December 31, 2012 from 7.0
billion at December 31, 2011 due to 13.5 billion in new borrowings partially offset by 11.0 billion in maturities. PNC Bank, N.A. has
the ability to offer up to 10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2012, there was 2.4 billion outstanding under this program. Commercial paper on our Consolidated Balance Sheet also includes
 6.1 billion of commercial paper issued by Market Street Funding LLC, a consolidated VIE. PNC Bank, N.A. can also borrow from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland s (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a
potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by securities and commercial loans. At December 31, 2012, our unused secured borrowing capacity was 28.6 billion with
the Federal Reserve Bank. Parent Company Liquidity Uses Obligations requiring the use of liquidity can generally be characterized as either contractual or discretionary. The parent company s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service
related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 300 million of parent company borrowings with maturities of less than one year. 
 Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share
repurchases, and acquisitions. See the Parent Company Liquidity Sources section below. In March 2012, we used approximately 3.6 billion of parent company cash to acquire both RBC Bank (USA) and a credit card portfolio from RBC Bank
(Georgia), National Association. Additionally, in June 2012, we used 1.4 billion of parent company cash to purchase senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued by PNC Bank, N.A noted above. 
 See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for information regarding the Federal Reserve s CCAR process, including its impact on
our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. 
 See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our 2012 and 2013 capital
activities.

Parent Company Liquidity Sources 
 The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:

Bank-level capital needs, 

Laws and regulations, 

Corporate policies, 

Contractual restrictions, and 

Other factors. The amount
available for dividend payments by PNC Bank, N.A. to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately 1.5 billion at December 31, 2012. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to
pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. See Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further
discussion of these limitations. Dividends may also be impacted by the bank s capital needs and by contractual restrictions. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions under the Trust Preferred Securities 
section of the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of this Item 7 and in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and
investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. As of December 31, 2012, the parent company had approximately 3.4 billion in funds available from its cash
and investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt
securities and equity securities, including certain capital securities, in public or private markets and commercial paper. We have an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital
instruments. Total senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments decreased to 11.5 billion at December 31, 2012 from 16.0 billion at December 31, 2011 primarily due to 4.0 billion in maturities and 2.3 billion in
redemptions partially offset by 1.5 billion in new borrowings. During 2012 we issued the following securities under our shelf registration
statement: 

1.0 billion of senior notes issued March 8, 2012 and due March 8, 2022. Interest is paid semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.30 . The
offering resulted in gross proceeds to us, before offering related expenses, of 990 million, 

Sixty million depositary shares, each representing a 1/4,000 th interest in a share of our Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,

Series P, issued April 24, 2012, resulting in gross proceeds to us, before commissions and expenses, of 1.5 billion, 

Eighteen million depositary shares, each representing a 1/4,000 th interest in a share of our 5.375 Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q, issued September 21, 2012,
resulting in gross proceeds to us, before commissions and expenses, of 450 million. On October 9, 2012, pursuant to the underwriting agreement for this offering, we issued an additional 1.2 million depositary shares in satisfaction of an
option granted to the underwriters in the agreement to cover over-allotments, resulting in additional gross proceeds of 30 million, and 

On November 9, 2012, PNC issued 500.1 million of its parent company Senior Notes due November 9, 2022 (the Senior Notes ), which
were sold in a secondary public offering made in connection with the remarketing of PNC s Remarketable 8.729 Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 (the Subordinated Notes owned by the National City Preferred Capital Trust I (the
 Trust ). In the remarketing, the Trust sold the Subordinated Notes and PNC exchanged with the purchasers of the Subordinated Notes the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were then sold by the purchasers in the secondary public offering. The
Senior Notes bore interest at 8.729 from and including June 10, 2012, to but excluding November 9, 2012, and thereafter bear interest at 2.854 per annum. The proceeds of the remarketing were used by the Trust to purchase 500.1
million of PNC s Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series M (the Preferred Stock on December 10, 2012. PNC redeemed all of the Preferred Stock from the Trust immediately upon its issuance, and the Trust in turn
redeemed all 500.0 million outstanding of its 12 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal APEX and .1 million Common Securities of the Trust. After the closing of these transactions, including the redemption of the Normal APEX, only the Senior Notes due
November 9, 2022 remain outstanding. The parent company, through its subsidiary PNC Funding Corp, has the ability to
offer up to 3.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2012, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. Note 19 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes our February 2010 redemption of all 75,792 shares of our Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Shares, Series N (Series N Preferred Stock) that had been issued on December 31, 2008 to the US Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program, the acceleration of the accretion of the remaining issuance

in the first quarter of 2010), and the exchange by the US Treasury of the TARP warrant issued to it on December 31, 2008 into warrants, each to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an
exercise price of 67.33, sold by the US Treasury in a secondary public offering in May 2010. These common stock warrants will expire December 31, 2018. Status of Credit Ratings The cost and availability of short-term and long-term
funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by PNC s debt ratings. In general, rating
agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. In addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response
to legislative and regulatory changes, including as a result of provisions in Dodd-Frank. Potential changes in the legislative and

regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. A decrease, or potential decrease, in
credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. Table 45: Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2012 for PNC and PNC Bank, N.A.

We had unrecognized tax benefits of 176 million at December 31, 2012. This liability for unrecognized
tax benefits represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be
predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 21 Income Taxes in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional
information. 
 
 Our contractual obligations totaled 72.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The decline in the comparison
is primarily attributable to decreases in the remaining contractual maturities of time deposits, partially offset by increases in borrowed funds. See Funding and Capital Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7
for additional information regarding our funding sources.

M ARKET R ISK M ANAGEMENT 
 Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign
exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: 

Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, 

Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and 

Fixed income, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and underwriting.
 We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk.
Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board. 
 Market Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest
rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and
embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.

Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management
policies, which are approved by management s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board. Sensitivity results and
market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011 follow: Table 48: Interest

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest
rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios (Fourth Quarter 2012) table reflects the percentage change in net interest
income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and (iii) Yield Curve Slope Flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening
between 1-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario. Table 49: Net Interest

 All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates
are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and
the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate
scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the above table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. We also consider forward projections of purchase
accounting accretion when forecasting net interest income. The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate
scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward. Table 50: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios:
One Year Forward 

The fourth quarter 2012 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is
positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing
interest rates and market conditions. Market Risk Management Trading Risk 
 Our trading activities are primarily customer-driven trading in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts, as well as the daily
mark-to-market impact from the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) on the customer derivatives portfolio. They also include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities. We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95 confidence interval. VaR is used to estimate the
probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. PNC began to include the daily mark-to-market impact from the CVA in determining the diversified VaR measure during the first quarter of 2012 due to enhancements in our models, and comparative periods are
stated on a similar basis. During 2012, our 95 VaR ranged between 1.1 million and 5.3 million, averaging 3.2 million. During 2011, our 95 VaR ranged between .7 million and 4.8 million, averaging 2.4 million. 
 To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The
backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading-related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. This assumes that market exposures remain constant throughout the day and
that recent historical market variability is a good predictor of future variability. Our actual trading related activity includes customer revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce trading losses, and may reduce the number of instances of
actual losses exceeding the prior day VaR measure. There were two such instances during both 2012 and 2011 under our diversified VaR measure. We use a 500 day look back period for backtesting and include customer related revenue.

 Includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value. The trading revenue disclosed above includes results from providing investing and risk management services to our customers as well as results from hedges of customer activity. Trading revenue excludes
the impact of economic hedging activities which we transact to manage risk primarily related to residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights and residential and commercial mortgage loans held-for-sale. Derivatives used for economic hedges
are not designated as accounting hedges because the contracts they are hedging are typically also carried at fair value on the balance sheet, resulting in symmetrical accounting treatment for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item. Economic
hedge results, along with the associated hedged items, are reported in the respective income statement line items, as appropriate. Trading
revenue for 2012 increased 42 million compared with 2011 due to higher derivatives, foreign exchange and fixed income client sales, higher underwriting activity, improved client-related trading results and the reduced impact of counterparty credit
risk on valuations of derivative positions. 
 
 Market Risk Management Equity And Other 
 Investment Risk Equity investment
risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. PNC invests primarily in private equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial
instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that
make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.
 The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit,
market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of an institution rated single-A by the credit rating agencies. Given the illiquid nature of many of
these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. See Note 9 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 
 Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the
approved policy limits and associated guidelines. A summary of our equity investments follows:

Tax Credit Investments Included in our equity investments are tax credit investments which are accounted for under the equity method. These investments, as well as equity investments held by consolidated partnerships, totaled
 3.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2.6 billion at December 31, 2011. These equity investment balances include unfunded commitments totaling 685 million and 420 million, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other
Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on Tax Credit Investments. Private Equity
 The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and
type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled 1.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and 1.5
billion at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, 1.2 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and .6 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. Included in direct investments are investment
activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled 266 million as of December 31, 2012. The indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but
PNC receives distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee. See Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for discussion of
potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our holding interests in and sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds. 
 Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled 182 million at December 31, 2012 compared with 247 million at December 31, 2011.
 Visa In 2012, we
sold 9 million of Visa Class B common shares and entered into swap agreements with the purchaser of the shares. See Note 9 Fair Value and Note 17 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
Report for additional information. At December 31, 2012, our investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 14 million shares and was recorded at 251 million. Based on the December 31, 2012 closing price of 151.58
for the Visa Class A common shares, the fair value of our total investment was approximately 916 million at the current conversion rate which reflects adjustments in respect of all litigation funding by Visa to date. The Visa Class B common
shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances (including

those applicable to the sales in 2012) until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of all of the specified litigation.
It is expected that Visa will continue to adjust the conversion rate of Visa Class B common shares to Class A common shares in connection with any settlements of the specified litigation in excess of any amounts then in escrow for that purpose
and will also reduce the conversion rate to the extent that it adds any funds to the escrow in the future. Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees
in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on our Visa indemnification obligation. 
 Other Investments We also make
investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both. At December 31, 2012, other
investments totaled 245 million compared with 250 million at December 31, 2011. We recognized net gains related to these investments of 55 million during 2012, compared with 1 million during 2011. 
 Given the nature of these investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses. 
 Our unfunded commitments related to other investments totaled 3 million at both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. 
 Impact of Inflation Our assets
and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of
inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. Should significant levels of inflation
occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates. 
 Financial Derivatives We use a
variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to
manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. We also
enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. 

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 107 

Table of Contents 

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate
swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount
on these instruments. Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 17 Financial
Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference. Not
all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

 Summary Results Net income for
2011 was 3.1 billion, or 5.64 per diluted common share, compared with 3.4 billion, or 5.74 per diluted common share, for 2010. The decrease from 2010 was primarily due to an 850 million, or 6 , reduction in total revenue, a 492 million, or 6 ,
increase in noninterest expense and the impact of the 328 million after-tax gain on the sale of GIS recognized in 2010, partially offset by a 1.3 billion, or 54 , decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2011. In addition, 2010 net income
attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by a noncash reduction of 250 million in connection with the redemption of TARP preferred stock. Net Interest Income Net interest income was 8.7 billion for 2011 down from 9.2
billion in 2010. The net interest margin decreased to 3.92 in 2011 compared with 4.14 for 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, a decline in the rate on average loan balances and the low interest rate
environment partially offset by lower funding costs. 
 
 Noninterest Income Noninterest income was 5.6 billion for 2011 and 5.9 billion for 2010. Noninterest income for 2011 reflected higher asset management fees and other income, higher residential mortgage banking revenue,
and lower net other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI), that were offset by a decrease in corporate service fees primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights, lower service charges on deposits from the impact of
Regulation E rules pertaining to overdraft fees, a decrease in net gains on sales of securities and lower consumer services fees due, in part, to a decline in interchange fees on individual debit card transactions in the fourth quarter partially
offset by higher transaction volumes throughout 2011. Asset management revenue, including BlackRock, increased 34 million to 1.1 billion in
2011 compared to 2010. The increase was driven by strong sales performance by our Asset Management Group and somewhat higher equity earnings from our BlackRock investment. Discretionary assets under management at December 31, 2011 totaled 107
billion compared with 108 billion at December 31, 2010.

For 2011, consumer services fees totaled 1.2 billion compared with 1.3 billion in 2010. The decrease was
due to lower interchange rates on debit card transactions, lower brokerage related revenue, and lower ATM related fees, partially offset by higher volumes of customer-initiated transactions including debit and credit cards. The Dodd-Frank limits on
interchange rates were effective October 1, 2011 and had a negative impact on revenues of approximately 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Corporate services revenue totaled .9 billion in 2011 and 1.1 billion in 2010. Lower values of commercial mortgage servicing rights, largely driven by lower interest rates and higher loan prepayment
rates, and lower special servicing fees drove the decline. Residential mortgage revenue totaled 713 million in 2011 compared with 699
million in 2010. Higher loan sales revenue drove the comparison, largely offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Loan sales revenue included the impact of a decrease in the provision for residential
mortgage repurchase reserves, which decreased to 102 million in 2011 compared to 120 million in 2010. Service charges on deposits totaled
 534 million for 2011 and 705 million for 2010. The decline resulted primarily from the impact of Regulation E rules pertaining to overdraft fees. Net gains on sales of securities totaled 249 million in 2011 and 426 million for 2010. The net credit component of OTTI of securities recognized in earnings was a loss of 152 million in 2011, compared
with a loss of 325 million in 2010. Gains on BlackRock related transactions included a fourth quarter 2010 pretax gain of 160 million from
our sale of 7.5 million BlackRock common shares as part of a BlackRock secondary common stock offering. Other noninterest income totaled
 1.1 billion for 2011 compared with .9 billion for 2010. Provision For Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses declined to 1.2 billion in 2011 compared with 2.5 billion for 2010 as overall credit quality continued to improve due to
slowly improving economic conditions and actions we took to reduce exposure levels during 2011. Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense was 9.1 billion for 2011 and 8.6 billion for 2010. Noninterest expense for 2011 included 324 million of residential mortgage
foreclosure-related expenses primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters, a noncash charge of 198 million for the unamortized discount related to redemption of trust preferred securities, and 42 million for integration costs. The
comparable amounts for 2010 were 71 million, zero and 387 million, respectively.

Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 24.5 for 2011 and 25.5 for 2010. The low effective tax rates were primarily attributable to the impact of tax-exempt income and tax credits.

 Loans Loans increased 8.4
billion, or 6 , to 159.0 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010. Growth in commercial loans of 10.5 billion, auto loans of 2.2 billion, and education loans of .4 billion was partially offset by declines of 1.7
billion in commercial real estate loans, 1.5 billion of residential real estate loans and 1.1 billion of home equity loans compared with December 31, 2010. Commercial loans increased due to a combination of new client acquisition and improved
utilization. Auto loans increased due to the expansion of sales force and product introduction to acquired markets, as well as overall increases in auto sales. Education loans increased due to portfolio purchases in 2011. Commercial and residential
real estate along with home equity loans declined due to loan demand being outpaced by paydowns, refinancing, and charge-offs. Average total
loans decreased 1.8 billion or 1 , to 152.0 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily as loan growth during the second half of 2011 was offset by loan decreases during the first half of 2011. The decrease in average total loans primarily
reflected declines in commercial real estate of 3.7 billion and residential real estate of 2.8 billion, partially offset by a 5.1 billion increase in commercial loans. Commercial real estate loans declined due to loan sales, paydowns, and
charge-offs. The decrease in residential real estate was impacted by portfolio management activities, paydowns and net charge-offs. Commercial loans increased due to a combination of new client acquisition and improved utilization. Loans represented
68 of average interest-earning assets for 2011 and for 2010. The total loan balance above includes purchased impaired loans of 6.7 billion,
or 4 of total loans, at December 31, 2011, and 7.8 billion, or 5 of total loans, at December 31, 2010. Loans represented 59 of
total assets at December 31, 2011 and 57 at December 31, 2010. Commercial lending represented 56 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 53 at December 31, 2010. Consumer lending represented 44 at December 31,
2011 and 47 at December 31, 2010. Commercial real estate loans represented 6 of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 7 of total assets at December 31, 2010.

Investment Securities The carrying amount of investment securities totaled 60.6 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of 3.6 billion, or 6 , from 64.3 billion at December 31, 2010. The decline resulted from
principal payments and net sales activity related to US Treasury and government agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Investment securities represented 22 of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 24 of total assets at
December 31, 2010. Average investment securities increased 1.7 billion, to 59.7 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010. Average
securities held to maturity increased 2.3 billion, to 9.4 billion, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in average securities available for sale of .6 billion, to 50.3 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010.
The increase in average securities held to maturity was primarily a result of transfers totaling 6.3 billion from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity during the second and third quarters of 2011. The transfers were
completed in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures, and considered potential changes to regulatory capital requirements under the proposed Basel III capital standards.
 At December 31, 2011, the securities available for sale portfolio included a net unrealized loss of 41 million, which represented the
difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2010 was a net unrealized loss of 861 million. The expected weighted-average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3.7
years at December 31, 2011 and 4.7 years at December 31, 2010. Loans Held For Sale 
 Loans held for sale totaled 2.9 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with 3.5 billion at December 31, 2010. We stopped originating commercial
mortgage loans held for sale designated at fair value in 2008 and have pursued opportunities to reduce these positions at appropriate prices. At December 31, 2011, the balance relating to these loans was 843 million, compared to 877 million
at December 31, 2010. We sold 25 million in unpaid principal balances of these commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2011 and sold 241 million in 2010. We sold 2.4 billion of commercial mortgages held for sale carried at the lower of cost or market to government agencies in 2011 compared to 2.1 billion in 2010. The increase in these loans to 451
million at December 31, 2011, compared to 330 million at December 31, 2010, was due to an increase in loans awaiting sales to government agencies. Residential mortgage loan origination volume was 11.4 billion in 2011. Substantially all such loans were originated under agency or FHA standards. We sold 11.9 billion of loans and recognized related
gains of 282 million during 2011. The comparable amounts for 2010 were 10.0 billion and 231 million, respectively.

Asset Quality Overall credit quality continued to improve during 2011. Nonperforming assets declined 967 million, or 19 , to 4.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 from December 31, 2010. Accruing loans past
due increased 12 million, or less than 1 , during 2011 to 4.5 billion at year end primarily attributable to government insured or guaranteed loans. Net charge-offs declined significantly to 1.6 billion at December 31, 2011, down 44 from
2010 net charge-offs of 2.9 billion. The ALLL was 4.3 billion, or 2.73 of total loans and 122 of nonperforming loans, as of
December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, our largest nonperforming asset was 28 million in the Accommodation and Food Services
Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was under 1 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 10.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 10.8 billion at December, 31, 2010.
Goodwill increased .1 billion, to 8.3 billion, at December 31, 2011 compared with the December 31, 2010 balance primarily due to the BankAtlantic and Flagstar branch acquisitions and the correction of amounts for an acquisition affecting
prior periods. The .7 billion decline in other intangible assets from December 31, 2010 included .2 billion and .4 billion declines in commercial and residential mortgage servicing rights, respectively. 
 Funding Sources Total funding
sources were 224.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and 222.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Total deposits increased 4.6 billion, or
2 , at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 due to an increase in money market and demand deposits, partially offset by net redemptions of retail certificates of deposit. 
 Average total deposits were 183.0 billion for 2011 compared with 181.9 billion for 2010. Average deposits remained essentially flat from 2010 primarily
as a result of decreases of 8.9 billion in average retail certificates of deposit and .8 billion in average time deposits in foreign offices and other time, which were offset by increases of 6.6 billion in average noninterest-bearing deposits,
 2.5 billion in average interest-bearing demand deposits and 1.2 billion in average savings deposits. Total borrowed funds decreased 2.8
billion to 36.7 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010. The decline from December 31, 2010 was primarily due to maturities of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, bank notes and senior debt, and
subordinated debt partially offset by issuances of FHLB borrowings and senior notes.

Average borrowed funds were 35.7 billion for 2011 compared with 40.2 billion for 2010. Maturities of FHLB
borrowings drove the decline compared to 2010. Shareholders Equity 
 Total shareholders equity increased 3.8 billion, to 34.1 billion, at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 and included the
impact of the following: 

An increase of 2.4 billion to retained earnings, 

The third quarter 2011 issuance of 1.0 billion of preferred stock which contributed to the increase in capital surplus preferred stock from .6
billion at December 31, 2010 to 1.6 billion at December 31, 2011, and 

A .3 billion decline in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to net unrealized gains on securities and cash flow hedge derivatives,
offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the change in the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Risk-Based Capital Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2011 were 10.3 
for Tier 1 common, 11.1 for leverage, 12.6 for Tier 1 risk-based and 15.8 for total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2010, the regulatory capital ratios were 9.8 for Tier 1 common, 10.2 for leverage, 12.1 for Tier 1 risk-based and
15.6 for total risk-based capital. The Tier 1 common capital ratio increased when compared with December 31, 2010 due to the retention of earnings partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets primarily from loan growth. The increase in Tier
1 risk-based capital ratio resulted from the issuance of preferred stock in July 2011 and retention of earnings somewhat offset by the redemption of trust preferred securities in November 2011 and higher risk-weighted assets.

G LOSSARY O F T ERMS 
 Accretable net interest (Accretable yield) The excess of cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased impaired loan over
the carrying value of the loan. The accretable net interest is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and
certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes). Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of
activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our
customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a
percentage point. Carrying value of purchased impaired loans The net value on the balance sheet which represents the
recorded investment less any valuation allowance. Cash recoveries Cash recoveries used in the context of purchased
impaired loans represent cash payments from customers that exceeded the recorded investment of the designated impaired loan. 
 Charge-off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also
record a charge-off when a loan is transferred from portfolio holdings to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is less than carrying amount. 
 Combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) This is the aggregate principal balance(s) of the mortgages on a property divided by its
appraised value or purchase price. Commercial mortgage banking activities Includes commercial mortgage servicing,
originating commercial mortgages for sale and related hedging activities. Commercial mortgage banking activities revenue includes commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary
services, net of commercial mortgage servicing rights amortization, and commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations), and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans intended for sale and related hedges (including loan origination fees, net
interest income, valuation adjustments and gains or losses on sales).

Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity
divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. 
 Core net interest income Total net interest income less purchase accounting accretion. 
 Credit derivatives Contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one
or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due.
The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Credit spread The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative
creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrower s perceived creditworthiness. 
 Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from changes in publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency
exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including but not limited to forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity i.e., positioned
for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5 for each 100
basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: Federal funds
sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest-earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business or business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency and is
based on a measurement of economic risk. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as
a common currency of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis.

Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a
change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions. 
 Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by total revenue. Fair value The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
 FICO score A credit bureau-based industry standard score created by Fair Isaac Co. which predicts the likelihood of
borrower default. We use FICO scores both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. Lower FICO scores indicate likely higher risk of default, while higher FICO scores indicate likely lower risk of default. FICO
scores are updated on a periodic basis. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and
delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting
methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR-based funding rates at origination that represent the
interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures. Futures and forward
contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying
financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Home price index (HPI) A broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices in the U.S. 
 Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the protection seller to the
protection buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short-term rate (e.g., three-month LIBOR) and an agreed-upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. 
 Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce
interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Intrinsic value The difference between the price, if any, required to be paid for
stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock. Investment
securities Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Leverage
ratio Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. LIBOR Acronym for
London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a
global basis. PNC s product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a benchmark. Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) A
calculation of a loan s collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same
collateral. Market values of the collateral are based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For example, an LTV of less than 90 is better secured and has less credit risk than an LTV of greater than or equal to 90 . 
 Loss given default (LGD) An estimate of loss, net of recovery based on collateral type, collateral value, loan exposure,
or the guarantor(s) quality and guaranty type (full or partial). Each loan has its own LGD. The LGD risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default occurs. LGD is net of recovery,
through either liquidation of collateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings. Net interest
margin Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nonaccretable
difference Contractually required payments receivable on a purchased impaired loan in excess of the cash flows expected to be collected. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and OREO and foreclosed assets,
but exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under fair value option and purchased impaired loans. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans Loans for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonperforming
loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer customers as well as TDRs which have not returned to performing status. Nonperforming loans
exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming loans exclude purchased impaired loans as we are currently accreting interest
income over the expected life of the loans. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units
specified in a derivative contract. Operating leverage The period to period dollar or percentage change in total
revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth
exceeded revenue growth i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a
premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. 
 Other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure or foreclosure. Foreclosed assets include real and personal property, equity interests in corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. Other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) When the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary. If we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered
to have occurred. In such cases, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Further, if we do not
expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. However for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be
required to sell the security before its recovery, the other-than-temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The other-than-temporary impairment related to
credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax.

 Purchase accounting accretion Accretion of the discounts and premiums on acquired assets and liabilities. The purchase accounting
accretion is recognized in net interest income over the weighted-average life of the financial instruments using the constant effective yield method. Accretion for purchased impaired loans includes any cash recoveries received in excess of the
recorded investment. Purchased impaired loans Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired under FASB ASC 310-30
(AICPA SOP 03-3). Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. 
 Recorded investment (purchased impaired loans) The initial investment of a purchased impaired loan plus interest accretion and
less any cash payments and writedowns to date. The recorded investment excludes any valuation allowance which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses. 
 Residential development loans Project-specific loans to commercial customers for the construction or development of residential
real estate including land, single family homes, condominiums and other residential properties. Residential mortgage servicing rights
hedge gains/(losses), net We have elected to measure acquired or originated residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value under GAAP. We employ a risk management strategy designed to protect the economic value of
MSRs from changes in interest rates. This strategy utilizes securities and a portfolio of derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of

MSRs arising from changes in interest rates. These financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value which are negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the MSR
portfolio. Net MSR hedge gains/(losses) represent the change in the fair value of MSRs, exclusive of changes due to time decay and payoffs, combined with the change in the fair value of the associated securities and derivative instruments.
 Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. 
 Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. 
 Return on average common shareholders equity Annualized net income attributable to common shareholders, divided by average
common shareholders equity. Risk-weighted assets Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as
defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments. 
 Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. 
 Servicing rights An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights
include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow. 
 Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest
rate swap agreement during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Taxable-equivalent interest The
interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from Federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and
margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to
interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. 
 Tier 1 common capital Tier 1 risk-based capital, less preferred equity, less trust preferred capital securities, and less
noncontrolling interests. Tier 1 common capital ratio Tier 1 common capital divided by period-end risk-weighted

Tier 1 risk-based capital Total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred
capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to taxable and nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in
nonfinancial companies less ineligible servicing assets and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on
available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for Tier 1 risk-based capital purposes. 
 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets. 
 Total equity Total shareholders equity plus noncontrolling interests. 
 Total return swap A non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined
underlying asset (e.g ., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR-based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is
therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk-based capital Tier 1 risk-based
capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other noncontrolling interest not qualified as Tier 1, eligible gains on available for sale equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain
limitations. 
 
 Total risk-based capital ratio Total risk-based capital divided by period-end
risk-weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of interest-bearing money market deposits, interest-bearing demand
deposits, and noninterest-bearing deposits. Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) A loan whose terms have been restructured in a
manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Value-at-risk (VaR) A
statistically-based measure of risk that describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to severe and adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 days for a 95 VaR.
 Watchlist A list of criticized loans, credit exposure or other assets compiled for internal monitoring purposes. We
define criticized exposure for this purpose as exposure with an internal risk rating of other assets especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss. Yield curve A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a
 normal or positive yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A steep yield
curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An inverted or negative yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.

The impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed
debt, as well as issues surrounding the level of U.S. and European government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe. 

Actions by Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

Changes in customers , suppliers and other counterparties performance and creditworthiness. 

Slowing or failure of the current moderate economic expansion. 

Continued effects of aftermath of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties,
including adverse impacts on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations.

Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or
other factors. 

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than we
are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the moderate economic expansion will persist and interest rates will remain very low in 2013, despite drags from Federal fiscal restraint and a European recession. These
forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. 

PNC s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company s financial performance, the scope and terms of
final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the Basel Capital Accords), and management actions affecting the composition of PNC s balance sheet. In addition, PNC s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast
regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent on the ongoing development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations,
competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These
developments could include: 

Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services
industry and changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. We will be impacted by extensive reforms provided for in the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise growing out of the recent financial crisis, the precise nature, extent and timing of which, and their impact on us, remains uncertain.

Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and to Basel-related initiatives.

Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. In addition to
matters relating to PNC s business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies, such as National City. These matters may
result in

monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may
cause reputational harm to PNC. 

Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of
our intellectual property protection in general. 

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where
appropriate, through effective use of third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital standards. In particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage elevated levels of
impaired assets. 

Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information
provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings. 

Our 2012 acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) presents us with risks and uncertainties related to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC,
including: 

Anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than
expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. 

Our ability to achieve anticipated results from this transaction is dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and
the extent of deposit attrition, in part related to the state of economic and financial markets. Also, litigation and regulatory and other governmental investigations that may be filed or commenced relating to the pre-acquisition business and
activities of RBC Bank (USA) could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC. 

Integration of RBC Bank (USA) s business and operations into PNC may take longer than anticipated or be substantially more costly than anticipated
or have unanticipated adverse results relating to RBC Bank (USA) s or PNC s existing businesses. PNC s ability to integrate RBC Bank (USA) successfully may be adversely affected by the fact that this transaction results in PNC
entering several geographic markets where PNC did not previously have any meaningful retail presence. 

In addition to the RBC Bank (USA) transaction, we grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other

financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. These other acquisitions often present risks and uncertainties analogous to those presented by
the RBC Bank (USA) transaction. Acquisition risks include those presented by the nature of the business acquired as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing. 

Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share,
deposits and revenues. Industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. Our
ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 

Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, dislocations, terrorist activities or international
hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically. We
provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments and Guarantees Notes of the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Report. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

A CCOUNTING F IRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of
changes in equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and

evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

B USINESS 
 PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
 PNC has businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, and residential mortgage banking, providing many of
its products and services nationally, as well as, products and services in PNC s primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Washington, D.C.,
Delaware, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. PNC also provides certain products and services internationally. 
 N OTE 1 A CCOUNTING P OLICIES 
 B ASIS O F F INANCIAL S TATEMENT P RESENTATION 
 Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are
wholly owned, and certain partnership interests and variable interest entities. We prepared these consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2012 presentation.
These reclassifications did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We evaluate the materiality of identified errors in the financial statements using both an income statement and a balance sheet
approach, based on relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Net income includes certain adjustments to correct immaterial errors related to previously reported periods. As described in Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity, on March 2, 2012, PNC acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of RBC Bank (USA), the US retail banking subsidiary of
Royal Bank of Canada. As part of the acquisition, PNC also purchased a credit card portfolio from RBC Bank (Georgia), National Association. The transactions added approximately 18.1 billion of deposits and 14.5 billion of loans to PNC s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, see discussion of the July 1, 2010 sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. The Consolidated Income Statement and related Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the global investment
servicing business as discontinued operations for 2010. 
 
 We have considered the impact on these consolidated financial statements of subsequent events. 
 U SE O F E STIMATES We prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most
significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements, allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, and accretion on purchased impaired loans. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the
differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. I NVESTMENT I N 
B LACK R OCK , I NC . We account for our investment in the common stock and Series B Preferred
Stock of BlackRock (deemed to be in-substance common stock) under the equity method of accounting. In May 2012, we exchanged 2 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock of BlackRock for an equal number of shares of BlackRock common stock. The
exchange transaction had no impact on the carrying value of our investment in BlackRock or our use of the equity method of accounting. The investment in BlackRock is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Equity investments, while our equity
in earnings of BlackRock is reported on our Consolidated Income Statement in Asset management revenue. As described in Note 16 Stock Based
Compensation Plans, we also hold shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to our obligation to partially fund a portion of certain BlackRock long-term incentive plan (LTIP) programs. Since these preferred shares are not deemed to be in
substance common stock, we have elected to account for these preferred shares at fair value and the changes in fair value will offset the impact of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock. Our investment in the
BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other assets. Our obligation to transfer these shares to BlackRock is classified as a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument under GAAP as disclosed in
Note 17 Financial Derivatives. In September 2011, we delivered approximately 1.3 million shares of the BlackRock Series C Preferred
Stock to BlackRock in connection with our obligation. On January 31, 2013, we transferred an additional 205,350 shares to BlackRock in
connection with our obligation. After this transfer, we hold approximately 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which are available to fund our obligation in connection with the BlackRock LTIP programs.

B USINESS C OMBINATIONS 
 We record the net assets of companies that we acquire at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and we include the results of operations of
the acquired companies on our Consolidated Income Statement from the date of acquisition. We recognize, as goodwill, the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 
 S PECIAL P URPOSE E NTITIES Special purpose entities (SPEs) are defined as legal entities structured for a particular purpose. We use special purpose entities in various legal forms to conduct normal business activities. We review
the structure and activities of special purpose entities for possible consolidation under the applicable GAAP guidance. A variable interest
entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either: 

Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity s activities through those
voting rights or similar rights, or 

Has equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.
 A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. 
 VIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 Consolidations when we hold a variable interest in these entities. We consolidate a VIE if we are its
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and
(ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling
interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we do not consolidate but in which we hold a significant variable interest. 
 On January 1, 2010, we adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by
Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities. This guidance replaces previous guidance by requiring an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis as opposed to a quantitative analysis to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a
VIE. The qualitative analysis considers the purpose and the design of the VIE as well as the risks that the VIE was designed to either create or pass through to variable interest holders. This guidance also

removed the former scope exception for qualifying special-purpose entities, contained new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, and increased the frequency of required
reassessments to determine whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-17, we consolidated Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street), a credit card securitization trust, and certain Low Income
Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) investments. R EVENUE R ECOGNITION 
 We earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: 

Lending, 

Securities portfolio, 

Asset management, 

Customer deposits, 

Loan sales and servicing, 

Brokerage services, 

Sale of loans and securities, 

Certain private equity activities, and 

Securities and derivatives trading activities, including foreign exchange. We earn fees and commissions from: 

Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, 

Selling various insurance products, 

Providing treasury management services, 

Providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and 

Participating in certain capital markets transactions. Revenue earned on interest-earning assets including unearned income and the amortization/accretion of premiums or discounts recognized on acquired loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield
of the financial instrument, or based on other applicable accounting guidance. Asset management fees are generally based on a percentage of
the fair value of the assets under management. The caption Asset management also includes our share of the earnings of BlackRock recognized under the equity method of accounting. This caption also includes any performance fees which are generally
based on a percentage of the returns on such assets and are recorded as earned. Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized when
earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis. We record
private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest. We
recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair

value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans, resale agreements and our
investment in BlackRock Series C preferred stock. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), which are measured at fair value. We recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans as earned based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues, as well as impairment on
servicing rights, are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange trading, as well as
securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as services are provided. We recognize gains from the sale of loans upon receipt of cash. When appropriate, revenue is reported net of associated expenses in accordance with GAAP. 
 C ASH A ND C ASH E QUIVALENTS 
 Cash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes. 
 I NVESTMENTS We
hold interests in various types of investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as: 

Ownership interest, 

Our plans for the investment, and 

The nature of the investment. D EBT S ECURITIES Debt securities are recorded on a
trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as held to maturity and carry them at amortized cost if we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities that we purchase for short-term appreciation, trading
purposes or those with non-bifurcated embedded derivatives are carried at fair value and classified as Trading securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other
noninterest income. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are designated as securities available for sale and carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). On at least
a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment (OTTI). An investment security is deemed impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost.
Amortized cost includes adjustments (if any) made to the cost basis of an investment for accretion, amortization, previous other-than-temporary impairments and

hedging gains and losses. After an investment security is determined to be impaired, we evaluate whether the decline in value is other-than-temporary. As part of this evaluation, we take into
consideration whether we intend to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before expected recovery of its amortized cost. We also consider whether or not we expect to receive all of the
contractual cash flows from the investment based on factors that include, but are not limited to: the creditworthiness of the issuer and, in the case of securities collateralized by consumer and commercial loan assets, the historical and projected
performance of the underlying collateral. In addition, we may also evaluate the business and financial outlook of the issuer, as well as broader industry and sector performance indicators. Declines in the fair value of available for sale debt
securities that are deemed other-than-temporary and are attributable to credit deterioration are recognized on our Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the determination is made. Declines in fair value which are deemed
other-than-temporary and attributable to factors other than credit deterioration are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities, in net interest income using the constant effective yield method.
Effective yields reflect either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition or the effective interest rate determined based on significantly improved cash flows subsequent to impairment. We compute gains and
losses realized on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These securities gains/(losses) are included in the caption Net gains on sales of securities on the Consolidated Income Statement. 
 In certain situations, management may elect to transfer certain debt securities from the securities available for sale to the held to maturity
classification. In such cases, any unrealized gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of transfer is amortized over the remaining life of the security as a yield adjustment such that only the remaining
initial discount/premium from the purchase date is recognized in income. E QUITY S ECURITIES 
 AND P ARTNERSHIP I NTERESTS We account for equity securities and equity investments other
than BlackRock and private equity investments under one of the following methods: 

Marketable equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and are accounted for based on the securities quoted market prices from a
national securities exchange. Those purchased with the intention of recognizing short-term profits are classified as trading and included in trading securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on
trading securities 

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 127 

Table of Contents 

are included in Noninterest income. Marketable equity securities not classified as trading are designated as securities available for sale with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes,
reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Any unrealized losses that we have determined to be other-than-temporary on securities classified as available for sale are recognized in current period earnings.

For investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated, we use either the
equity method or the cost method of accounting. We use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee
and when the net asset value of our investment reflects our economic interest in the underlying investment. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income. We use the cost
method for all other investments. Under the cost method, there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, we write down
the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Other noninterest income. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method
investments are included in Noninterest income. Investments described above are included in the caption Equity investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. P RIVATE E QUITY I NVESTMENTS We report
private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair value. These estimates are based on available information and may not
necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. Fair value of publicly traded direct investments are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to various
discount factors for legal or contractual sales restrictions, when appropriate. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments in private companies include techniques such as multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent
appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value affiliated partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership
using procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. We value indirect investments in private equity funds based on net asset value as provided in the

financial statements that we receive from their managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied,
adjustments to the manager-provided values are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates significant changes in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. We include all private equity
investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the caption Equity investments. Changes in the fair value of private equity investments are recognized in noninterest income. We consolidate affiliated partnerships when we are the general partner and have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do
not own is reflected in the caption Noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. L OANS 
 Loans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable
future, or until maturity or payoff. Management s intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, market conditions and the availability of government programs. 
 Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are
considered delinquent. Except as described below, loans held for investment are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned
income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest on performing loans (excluding purchased impaired loans, which is further discussed below) is accrued based on the principal
amount outstanding and recorded in interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into net interest
income, over periods not exceeding the contractual life of the loan. When loans are redesignated from held for investment to held for sale,
specific reserves and allocated pooled reserves included in the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) are charged-off to reduce the basis of the loans to the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell. 
 In addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. For certain
acquired loans that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality, we follow the guidance contained in ASC 310-30 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Under this guidance, acquired purchased impaired loans are to
be recorded at fair

value without the carryover of any existing valuation allowances. Evidence of credit quality deterioration may include information and statistics regarding bankruptcy events, updated borrower
credit scores, such as Fair Isaac Corporation scores (FICO), past due status, and updated loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. We review the loans acquired for evidence of credit quality deterioration and determine if it is probable that we will be unable to
collect all contractual amounts due, including both principal and interest. When both conditions exist, we estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition for each loan either individually or on a pool basis. We
estimate the cash flows expected to be collected using internal models that incorporate management s best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds. Collateral values are also incorporated into
cash flow estimates. Late fees, which are contractual but not expected to be collected, are excluded from expected future cash flows. The
accretable yield is calculated based upon the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the loans and the recorded investment in the loans. This amount is accreted into income over the life of the loan or pool using the
constant effective yield method. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized as impairments through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the
ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a recovery of previously recorded ALLL or prospectively through an adjustment of the loan s or pool s yield over its remaining life. 
 The nonaccretable yield represents the difference between the expected undiscounted cash flows of the loans and the total contractual cash flows
(including principal and future interest payments) at acquisition and throughout the remaining lives of the loans. 
 L EASES We provide
financing for various types of equipment including aircraft, energy and power systems and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the
leased property, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing lease, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for
other-than-temporary impairment at least annually. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income while valuation adjustments on lease residuals are included in Other noninterest expense.

L OAN S ALES , L OAN S ECURITIZATIONS 
A ND R ETAINED I NTERESTS We recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when the
transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold mortgage, credit card and other loans through securitization transactions. In a securitization, financial assets are transferred
into trusts or to SPEs in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from PNC. Where the transferor is a depository institution, legal isolation is accomplished through compliance with specific rules and regulations of the relevant
regulatory authorities. Where the transferor is not a depository institution, legal isolation is accomplished through utilization of a two-step securitization structure. ASC Topic 860 Accounting For Transfers of Financial Assets requires a true sale legal analysis to address several relevant factors, such as the nature and level of recourse to the transferor, and the
amount and nature of retained interests in the loans sold. The analytical conclusion as to a true sale is never absolute and unconditional, but contains qualifications based on the inherent equitable powers of a bankruptcy court, as well as the
unsettled state of the common law, or powers of the FDIC as a conservator or receiver. Once the legal isolation test has been met, other factors concerning the nature and extent of the transferor s control and the rights of the transferee over
the transferred assets are taken into account in order to determine whether derecognition of assets is warranted. In a securitization, the
trust or SPE issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings
at the time of issuance. These ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may retain a portion or all of the
securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts. Securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in noninterest income
at the time of initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the
present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable. With the exception of loan sales to certain US government chartered entities, our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties
and with no restrictions on the retained interests. We originate, sell and service mortgage

loans under the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, we participate in a loss-sharing
arrangement with FNMA. We participated in a similar program with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and
subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with guidance contained in applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees for more information about our obligations related to sales of loans under these programs. 
 On January 1, 2010, we adopted ASU 2009-16 Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting For Transfers of Financial Assets . This guidance
removed the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity under previous GAAP. The guidance further clarified that an entity must consider all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of a transfer even if not
entered into at the time of the transfer when applying surrender of control conditions. Additionally, this guidance established conditions for accounting and reporting for transfer of a portion of a financial asset, modified the asset
sale/derecognition criteria, and changed how retained interests are initially measured. L OANS H ELD 
F OR S ALE We designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent to sell them. We transfer loans to
the Loans held for sale category at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are recorded as charge-offs. We establish a new cost basis upon transfer. Any subsequent
lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment is determined on an individual loan basis and is recognized as a valuation allowance with any charges included in Other noninterest income. Gains or losses on the sale of these loans are included in Other
noninterest income when realized. We have elected to account for certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The changes
in the fair value of these loans are measured and recorded in Other noninterest income each period. See Note 9 Fair Value for additional information. Also, we elected to account for residential real estate loans held for sale, which were not
purchased impaired loans, at fair value. Interest income with respect to loans held for sale classified as performing is accrued based on the
principal amount outstanding and the loan s contractual interest rate. In certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may
be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy. We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value; however, any loans held for sale and designated at fair value will remain at fair value for the life of the
loan. 
 
 N ONPERFORMING A SSETS 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases, including nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and other real estate owned and
foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans that have deteriorated in credit quality to the extent that full collection of
contractual principal and interest is not probable. When a loan is determined to be nonperforming (and as a result is impaired), the accrual of interest is ceased and the loan is classified as nonaccrual. The current year accrued and uncollected
interest is reversed out of net interest income. Additionally, any prior year accrued and uncollected interest is charged-off. 
 A loan acquired and accounted for under ASC 310-30 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality is reported as an accruing loan
and a performing asset due to the accretion of interest income. We generally classify Commercial Lending (Commercial, Commercial Real Estate,
and Equipment Lease Financing) loans as nonaccrual (and therefore nonperforming) when we determine that the collection of interest or principal is not probable or when delinquency of interest or principal payments has existed for 90 days or more and
the loans are not well-secured and/or in the process of collection. A loan is considered well-secured when the collateral in the form of liens on (or pledges of) real or personal property, including marketable securities, has a realizable value
sufficient to discharge the debt in full, including accrued interest. Such factors that would lead to nonperforming status would include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Deterioration in the financial position of the borrower resulting in the loan moving from accrual to cash basis accounting,

The collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due unless the asset is well-secured and/or in the process of collection,

Reasonable doubt exists as to the certainty of the borrower s future debt service ability, whether 90 days have passed or not,

The borrower has filed or will likely file for bankruptcy, 

The bank advances additional funds to cover principal or interest, 

We are in the process of liquidating the assets of a commercial borrower, or 

We are pursuing remedies under a guarantee. We charge-off commercial nonaccrual loans when we determine that a specific loan, or portion thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the
individual loan. In making this determination, we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern, the past due status when the asset is not well-secured, the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral,
and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform.

Effective in the second quarter of 2011, the commercial nonaccrual policy was applied to certain small
business credit card balances. This change resulted in loans being placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due. We continue to charge-off these loans at 180 days past due. 
 Additionally, in general, for smaller dollar commercial loans of 1 million or less, a partial or full charge-off will occur at 120 days past due for
term loans and 180 days past due for revolvers. Home equity installment loans, lines of credit, and residential real estate loans that are
not well-secured and/or not in the process of collection are charged-off at 180 days past due to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. A consumer loan is considered well-secured when the collateral in the form of liens on (or pledges of) real or personal property, including marketable securities, has a realizable value sufficient to
discharge the debt in full, including accrued interest. Starting in the first quarter of 2012, home equity installment loans and lines of credit, whether well-secured or not, are classified as nonaccrual at 90 days past due instead of the prior
policy of nonaccrual classification at 180 days past due. Well-secured residential real estate loans are classified as nonaccrual at 180 days past due. Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due. Generally, they are not placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by
regulatory guidance. If payment is received while a loan is nonperforming, generally the payment is first applied to the recorded investment;
once this principal obligation has been fulfilled, payments are applied to recover any charged-off amounts related to the impaired loan that might exist. Finally, if both principal and any charge-offs have been recovered, then the payment will be
recorded as interest income. A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty. TDRs may include restructuring certain terms of loans, receipts of assets from debtors in partial satisfaction of loans, or a combination thereof. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02 Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring . The ASU clarifies when a loan
restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). This ASU (i) eliminates the sole use of the borrowers effective interest rate test to determine if a concession has occurred on the part of the creditor, (ii) requires a
restructuring with below market terms to be considered in determining classification as a TDR, (iii) specifies that a borrower not currently in default may still

be experiencing financial difficulty when payment default is probable in the foreseeable future, and (iv) specifies that a delay in payment should be considered along with all
other factors in determining classification as a TDR. We identified as TDRs certain loans for which the allowance for credit losses had previously been measured under a general allowance for credit losses methodology. Upon identifying those loans as
TDRs, we accounted for them as impaired under the guidance in ASC 310-10-35. See Note 5 Asset Quality and Note 7 Allowances for Loan and
Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit for additional TDR information. Nonaccrual loans are generally not returned
to accrual status until the obligation is brought current and the borrower has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and collection of the contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.
 Foreclosed assets are comprised of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure. Other real estate owned is comprised principally of commercial real estate and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some
jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When we are awarded title, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated fair value less cost to sell, the recorded investment of the loan is adjusted and, typically, a charge-off or
recovery is recognized to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL). We estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals, or sales agreements with third parties. Anticipated recoveries and government guarantees are also considered in
evaluating the potential impairment of loans at the date of transfer. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount
recorded at acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in Other noninterest expense.

A LLOWANCE F OR L OAN A ND 
L EASE L OSSES We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated
probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of these loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. This evaluation is
inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: 

Probability of default (PD), 

Loss given default (LGD), 

Outstanding balance of the loan, 

Movement through delinquency stages, 

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, 

Value of collateral, and 

Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in historical results. 
 While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to,
potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. We provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses
attributable to such risks. The ALLL also includes factors which may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may include: 

Industry concentrations and conditions, 

Recent credit quality trends, 

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, 

Recent macro-economic factors, 

Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and 

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions. 
 In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer
loans. Nonperforming loans are considered impaired under ASC 310, Receivables and are evaluated for a specific reserve. Specific reserve
allocations are determined as follows: 

For commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, specific reserves are based on an analysis of the
present value of the loan s expected future cash flows, the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral. 

For commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs below the defined dollar threshold, the loans are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve
impairment using the applicable loan s LGD percentage multiplied by the balance of the loan.

Consumer nonperforming loans are collectively reserved for unless classified as TDRs, for which specific reserves are based on an analysis of the
present value of the loan s expected future cash flows. 

For purchased impaired loans, subsequent decreases to the net present value of expected cash flows will generally result in an impairment charge to the
provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the ALLL. When applicable, this process is applied across all the
loan classes in a similar manner. However, as previously discussed, certain consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, are charged off instead of being classified as nonperforming. 
 Our credit risk management policies, procedures and practices are designed to promote sound lending standards and prudent credit risk management. We have
policies, procedures and practices that address financial statement requirements, collateral review and appraisal requirements, advance rates based upon collateral types, appropriate levels of exposure, cross-border risk, lending to specialized
industries or borrower type, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance. See Note 5 Asset Quality and Note 7 Allowances for Loan and
Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit for additional information. A LLOWANCE 
F OR U NFUNDED L OAN C OMMITMENTS A ND L ETTERS O F C REDIT We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit facilities as of the
balance sheet date. We determine the allowance based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of the probability of commitment usage, credit risk factors, and, solely for commercial lending, the terms and
expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for funded exposures. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments and
letters of credit is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit are included in the provision for credit losses.

M ORTGAGE A ND O THER S ERVICING 
R IGHTS We provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial, residential and other consumer
loans. These contracts are either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale. All newly acquired or originated servicing rights are initially measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the present
value of the expected future cash flows, including assumptions as to: 

Deposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings, 

Discount rates, 

Stated note rates, 

Estimated prepayment speeds, and 

Estimated servicing costs. 
 For subsequent measurements of these assets, we have elected to utilize either the amortization method or fair value measurement based upon the asset
class and our risk management strategy for managing these assets. For commercial mortgage loan servicing rights, we use the amortization method. This election was made based on the unique characteristics of the commercial mortgage loans underlying
these servicing rights with regard to market inputs used in determining fair value and how we manage the risks inherent in the commercial mortgage servicing rights assets. Specific risk characteristics of commercial mortgages include loan type,
currency or exchange rate, interest rates, expected cash flows and changes in the cost of servicing. We record these servicing assets as Other intangible assets and amortize them over their estimated lives based on estimated net servicing income. On
a quarterly basis, we test the assets for impairment by categorizing the pools of assets underlying the servicing rights into various strata. If the estimated fair value of the assets is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized
and a valuation reserve is established. For servicing rights related to residential real estate loans, we apply the fair value method. This
election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. We manage this risk by hedging the fair value of this asset with derivatives and securities which are expected to increase in
value when the value of the servicing right declines. The fair value of these servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into
consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions. Revenue from the various loan servicing contracts for commercial, residential and other consumer loans is reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in line items Corporate services, Residential
mortgage and Consumer services. F AIR V ALUE O F F INANCIAL

G OODWILL A ND O THER I NTANGIBLE 
A SSETS We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense using accelerated or straight-line methods over their respective estimated useful lives. We review finite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable from undiscounted future cash flows or that it may exceed its fair value. 
 D EPRECIATION A ND A MORTIZATION For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. 
 We use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment ranging from one to 10 years, and depreciate buildings over an estimated useful life of up to
40 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter. We purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development
project stages are charged to Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over periods
ranging from one to seven years. R EPURCHASE A ND R ESALE A GREEMENTS 
 Repurchase and resale agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the
securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. Our policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. We monitor the market value of
securities to be repurchased and resold and additional collateral may be obtained where considered appropriate to protect against credit exposure. We have elected to account for structured resale agreements at fair value. 
 O THER C OMPREHENSIVE I NCOME Other comprehensive income consists, on an after-tax basis, primarily of unrealized gains or losses, excluding OTTI attributable to credit deterioration, on investment securities classified as available

 We record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock
on the first-in, first-out basis. D ERIVATIVE I NSTRUMENTS A ND H EDGING 
A CTIVITIES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process
to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Interest rate and total return swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk
management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. We manage these risks as part of our
asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions with only high-quality institutions, establishing credit limits, and generally requiring
bilateral netting and collateral agreements. We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement Of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, changes in fair value are
recognized in Noninterest income. We utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into
consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or rights to reclaim, cash
collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized. For those derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. 
 We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before
undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective,
hedge accounting is discontinued. 
 
 For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair
value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the difference or ineffectiveness is reflected in the Consolidated Income
Statement in the same financial statement category as the hedged item. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the
exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portions of the gain or loss on derivatives are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to interest income in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The change in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Noninterest income. 
 For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivatives are
reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The change in fair value of any ineffectiveness of the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Noninterest income. 
 We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period. If we
determine that the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge and hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in
current earnings. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. When hedge
accounting is discontinued because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in current earnings, and the
gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized immediately into earnings. When we discontinue hedge accounting because the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or no longer designated, the amount reported in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) up to the date of sale, termination or de-designation continues to be reported in Other comprehensive income or loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We did not terminate any cash flow
hedges in 2012, 2011 or 2010 due to a determination that a forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring.

We purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the
transaction, we assess if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, whether the hybrid financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in
fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet all of these conditions, the embedded derivative is recorded separately
from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value. 
 We have elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value measurement for certain financial instruments with embedded derivatives. 
 We enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial
and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair
value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in noninterest income. I NCOME T AXES 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse. The recognition of deferred
tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the
underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based
upon all available positive and negative evidence. E ARNINGS P ER C OMMON 
S HARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-class method to determine income attributable to
common shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the two-class method. Income attributable to common shareholders is then
divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more
dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class

method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and
debentures from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock
method. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. See Note 18 Earnings Per Share for additional information. 
 R ECENT A CCOUNTING P RONOUNCEMENTS In October 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2012-06, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Subsequent Accounting for an Indemnification Asset
Recognized at the Acquisition Date as a Result of a Government-Assisted Acquisition of a Financial Institution . This ASU impacts all entities that recognize an indemnification asset in purchase accounting for a government-assisted acquisition of
a financial institution. The effective date of ASU 2012-06 was January 1, 2013. However, since we currently do not have any of these assets, this ASU did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
 In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for
Impairment . This ASU simplifies the testing for indefinite lived intangible assets impairment by allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived
intangible asset is less than its carrying amount before proceeding to the quantitative impairment test. The effective date of this ASU was January 1, 2013. However, since we currently do not have any indefinite lived intangibles, this ASU did
not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic
210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities and then amended the scope of ASU 2011-11 in January 2013 through the issuance of ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets
and Liabilities. This guidance applies to all entities that have derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, or securities lending agreements that are either (i) offset in accordance with either ASC
210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, and requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect
of those arrangements on its financial position. The disclosures are required for quarterly and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented,

and will be provided in the first quarter 2013. We adopted ASU 2011-11 on January 1, 2013 for our derivatives that we offset in accordance with ASC 815-10-45 and for our repurchase/resale
arrangements under enforceable master netting arrangements, which we do not currently offset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new guidance did not change the accounting for these arrangements or require them to be offset and thus had no impact
on our statement of financial position. In December 2011, the FASB also finalized ASU 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360)
 Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) . This ASU clarified that the guidance in ASC 360-20 applies to a parent that ceases to have a controlling
financial interest (as described in ASC 810-10) in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt. The amendments within this update should be applied on a prospective basis and are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012. We adopted ASU 2011-10 on January 1, 2013. There was no material impact to our results of operations or financial position upon
adoption of ASU 2011-10 on January 1, 2013. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350) : Testing Goodwill for Impairment . The ASU permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity
qualitatively determines the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is not required to perform the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim
goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We did not utilize this guidance in our 2012 annual goodwill impairment test. The adoption of this ASU did not have a financial impact since the method for
determining the amount of impairment (Step 2) remained unchanged. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic
220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This ASU required an entity to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with total other comprehensive income, and a total
amount for comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both presentation options, the tax effect for each component must be presented in the statement in
which other comprehensive income is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be
reclassified to net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU
2011-05 . This ASU deferred those changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments pending further Board deliberation. We adopted ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 on January 1, 2012. Our 2012 financial
statements and disclosures continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU 2011-05. See the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Note 20 Other Comprehensive Income for additional information. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income . This ASU requires companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. Additionally, companies
are to disclose by component reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and their effects on the respective line items on net income and other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP. ASU 2013-02 is effective for annual
and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and we will present these disclosures in the first quarter of 2013. In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) . This ASU provides
guidance to clarify the concept of highest and best use valuation premise, how a principal market is determined, and the application of the fair value measurement for instruments with offsetting market or counterparty credit risks. It also extends
the prohibition on blockage factors to all fair value hierarchy levels. This ASU required additional disclosures for the following: (i) quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in all Level 3 financial
instruments, (ii) the valuation processes used by the reporting entity as well as a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs, (iii) a reporting entity s use of a
nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset s highest and best use if the fair value of the asset is reported, (iv) the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value in
financial statements, and (v) any transfers between Level 1 and 2 and the reason for those transfers. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. We adopted ASU 2011-04 on
January 1, 2012. See Note 9 Fair Value for additional information.

In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03 Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860), Reconsideration of
Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements . This ASU removes from the assessment of effective control (i) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the
agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (ii) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. Other criteria applicable to the assessment of effective control have not been changed by this
ASU. The adoption of ASU 2011-03 on January 1, 2012 did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
 N OTE 2 A CQUISITION AND D IVESTITURE 
A CTIVITY 
 RBC B ANK (USA) A CQUISITION On March 2, 2012, PNC acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of RBC Bank (USA), the US retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada. As part of the acquisition, PNC also
purchased a credit card portfolio from RBC Bank (Georgia), National Association. PNC paid 3.6 billion in cash as consideration for the acquisition of both RBC Bank (USA) and the credit card portfolio. The transactions added approximately 18.1
billion of deposits and 14.5 billion of loans to PNC s Consolidated Balance Sheet. RBC Bank (USA), based in Raleigh, North Carolina,
operated more than 400 branches in North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and South Carolina. The primary reasons for the acquisition of RBC were to enhance shareholder value, to improve PNC s competitive position in the financial
services industry, and to further expand PNC s existing branch network in the states where it currently operates as well as expanding into new markets. The RBC Bank (USA) transactions noted above were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, as such, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at
their estimated fair value on the acquisition date. All acquired loans were also recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the assets
acquired, and the liabilities assumed, were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition, as summarized in the following table:

 These items are considered as non-cash activity for the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In many cases the determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are
highly subjective in nature. The most significant of these determinations related to the fair valuation of acquired loans. See Note 6 Purchased Loans for further discussion of the accounting for purchased impaired and purchased non-impaired loans,
including the determination of fair value for acquired loans. The amount of goodwill recorded reflects the increased market share and related
synergies that are expected to result from the acquisition, and represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by PNC. The goodwill was assigned primarily to PNC s Retail Banking and
Corporate Institutional Banking segments, and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Other intangible assets acquired, as of March 2, 2012 consisted of the following: Table 56: RBC Bank (USA) Intangible Assets

See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets. The estimated amount of RBC Bank (USA) revenue and net income (excluding integration costs) included in PNC s
consolidated income statement for 2012 was 1.0 billion and 273 million, respectively. Upon closing and conversion of the RBC Bank (USA) transaction, subsequent to March 2, 2012, separate records for RBC Bank (USA) as a stand-alone business
have not been maintained as the operations of RBC Bank (USA) have been fully integrated into PNC. RBC Bank (USA) revenue and earnings disclosed above reflect management s best estimate, based on information available at the reporting date.
 The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma information for illustrative purposes only, for 2012 and 2011 as if RBC Bank (USA)
had been acquired on January 1, 2011. The unaudited estimated pro forma information combines the historical results of RBC Bank (USA) with the Company s consolidated historical results and includes certain adjustments reflecting the
estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments for the respective periods. The pro forma information is not indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2011. In particular, no adjustments have been
made to eliminate the impact of other-than-temporary impairment losses and losses recognized on the sale of securities that may not have been necessary had the investment securities been recorded at fair value as of January 1, 2011. The
unaudited pro forma information does not consider any changes to the provision for credit losses resulting from recording loan assets at fair value. Additionally, the pro forma financial information does not include the impact of possible business
model changes and does not reflect pro forma adjustments to conform accounting policies between RBC Bank (USA) and PNC. Additionally, PNC expects to achieve further operating cost savings and other business synergies, including revenue growth, as a
result of the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts that follow. As a result, actual results will differ from the unaudited pro forma information presented. Table 57: RBC Bank (USA) and PNC Unaudited Pro Forma Results

 In connection with the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and other prior acquisitions, PNC recognized 267 million of
integration charges in 2012. PNC recognized 42 million of integration

charges in 2011 in connection with prior acquisitions. The integration charges are included in the table above. S ALE OF S MARTSTREET Effective
October 26, 2012, PNC divested certain deposits and assets of the Smartstreet business unit, which was acquired by PNC as part of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition, to Union Bank, N.A. Smartstreet is a nationwide business focused on homeowner or
community association managers and had approximately 1 billion of assets and deposits as of September 30, 2012. The gain on sale was immaterial and resulted in a reduction of goodwill and core deposit intangibles of 46 million and 13
million, respectively. Results from operations of Smartstreet from March 2, 2012 through October 26, 2012 are included in our Consolidated Income Statement. F LAGSTAR B RANCH A CQUISITION Effective
December 9, 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area from Flagstar Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. The fair value of the assets acquired totaled approximately 211.8 million, including
 169.3 million in cash, 24.3 million in fixed assets and 18.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets. We also assumed approximately 210.5 million of deposits associated with these branches. No deposit premium was paid and no loans were
acquired in the transaction. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of the branch activity subsequent to our December 9, 2011 acquisition. B ANK A TLANTIC B RANCH A CQUISITION Effective June 6, 2011, we acquired 19 branches in the greater Tampa, Florida area from BankAtlantic, a subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. The fair value of the assets acquired totaled 324.9
million, including 256.9 million in cash, 26.0 million in fixed assets and 42.0 million of goodwill and intangible assets. We also assumed approximately 324.5 million of deposits associated with these branches. A 39.0 million deposit premium
was paid and no loans were acquired in the transaction. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of the branch activity subsequent to our June 6, 2011 acquisition. S ALE OF PNC G LOBAL I NVESTMENT S ERVICING On July 1, 2010, we sold PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. (GIS), a leading provider of processing, technology and business intelligence services to asset managers, broker-dealers and financial
advisors worldwide, for 2.3 billion in cash pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on February 2, 2010. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 639 million, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of 2010. This gain and
results of operations of GIS through June 30, 2010 are presented as Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on our Consolidated Income Statement. As part of the sale agreement, PNC has agreed to provide certain transitional
services on behalf of GIS until completion of related systems conversion activities.

A CTIVITIES AND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES 
 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES 
 We have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. These
transfers have occurred through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and loan sale transactions. Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through special
purpose entities (SPEs) that they sponsor. We, as an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, pool Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insured loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market.
In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold these loans into
securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization transactions are variable interest entities (VIEs). Our continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchases of previously transferred loans
under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs. Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary, and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically consist of collecting and
remitting monthly borrower principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing advances, which are reimbursable, are
recognized in Other assets at cost and are made for principal and interest and collateral protection. We earn servicing and other ancillary
fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer, we recognize a servicing asset at
fair value. Servicing assets are recognized in Other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and when subsequently accounted for at fair value are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9 Fair Value and Note 10
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of our residential and commercial servicing assets. 

Certain loans transferred to the Agencies contain removal of account provisions (ROAPs). Under these ROAPs,
we hold an option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a delinquent loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we recognize an asset (in
either Loans or Loans held for sale) and a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the balance of our ROAP asset
and liability totaled 190 million and 265 million, respectively. The Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed securities issued by the
securitization SPEs that are purchased and held on our balance sheet are typically purchased in the secondary market. PNC does not retain any credit risk on its Agency mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC, and the US Government (for
GNMA) guarantee losses of principal and interest. Substantially all of the Non-agency mortgage-backed securities acquired and held on our balance sheet are senior tranches in the securitization structure. 
 We also have involvement with certain Agency and Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs where we have not transferred commercial mortgage loans. These
SPEs were sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as servicer with servicing activities consistent with those
described above. We recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred
loans due to breaches of representations and warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing temporary liquidity under servicing advances and our loss exposure associated with our
repurchase and recourse obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to provide any type of credit support, guarantees, or commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors in these transactions. See Note 24 Commitments and
Guarantees for further discussion of our repurchase and recourse obligations.

M ARKET S TREET 
 Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street), owned by an independent third-party, is a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit that primarily
purchases assets or makes loans secured by interests in pools of receivables from US corporations. Market Street funds the purchases of assets or loans by issuing commercial paper. Market Street is supported by pool-specific credit enhancements,
liquidity facilities, and a program-level credit enhancement. Generally, Market Street mitigates its potential interest rate risk by entering into agreements with its borrowers that reflect interest rates based upon its weighted-average commercial
paper cost of funds. During 2011 and 2012, Market Street met all of its funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper.

PNC Bank, National Association, (PNC Bank, N.A.) provides certain administrative services, the
program-level credit enhancement and liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. The program-level credit enhancement covers net losses in the amount of 10 of commitments, excluding explicitly rated
AAA/Aaa facilities. Coverage is a cash collateral account funded by a loan facility. This facility expires in June 2017. At December 31, 2012, 1.2 billion was outstanding on this facility. 
 Although the commercial paper obligations at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were supported by Market Street s assets, PNC Bank,
N.A. may be obligated to fund Market Street under the 11.9 billion of liquidity facilities for

events such as commercial paper market disruptions, borrower bankruptcies, collateral deficiencies or covenant violations. Our credit risk under the liquidity facilities is secondary to the risk
of first loss absorbed by Market Street borrowers through over-collateralization of assets and losses absorbed by deal-specific credit enhancement provided by a third party. The deal-specific credit enhancement is generally structured to cover a
multiple of expected losses for the pool of assets and is sized to meet rating agency standards for comparably structured transactions. 
 Through the credit enhancement and liquidity facility arrangements, PNC Bank, N.A. has the power to direct the activities of Market Street that most
significantly affect its economic performance and these arrangements expose PNC Bank, N.A. to expected losses or residual returns that are potentially significant to Market Street. Therefore, PNC Bank, N.A. consolidates Market Street. PNC Bank, N.A.
is not required to nor have we provided additional financial support to Market Street, and Market Street creditors have no direct recourse to PNC Bank, N.A. C REDIT C ARD S ECURITIZATION T RUST We were the sponsor of several credit card securitizations facilitated through a trust. This bankruptcy-remote SPE was established to purchase credit card receivables from the sponsor and to issue and
sell asset-backed securities created by it to independent third-parties. The SPE was financed primarily through the sale of these asset-backed securities. These transactions were originally structured to provide liquidity and to afford favorable
capital treatment. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions consisted primarily of holding certain retained interests
and acting as the primary servicer. For each securitization series that was outstanding, our retained interests held were in the form of a pro-rata undivided interest, or sellers interest, in the transferred receivables, subordinated tranches
of asset-backed securities, interest-only strips, discount receivables, and subordinated interests in accrued interest and fees in securitized receivables. We consolidated the SPE as we were deemed the primary beneficiary of the entity based upon
our level of continuing involvement. Our role as primary servicer gave us the power to direct the activities of the SPE that most significantly affect its economic performance and our holding of retained interests gave us the obligation to absorb
expected losses, or the ability to receive residual returns that could be potentially significant to the SPE. The underlying assets of the consolidated SPE were restricted only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the SPE. We were not
required to nor did we provide additional financial support to the SPE. Additionally, creditors of the SPE have no direct recourse to PNC. 
 During the first quarter of 2012, the last series issued by the SPE, Series 2007-1, matured. At December 31, 2012, the SPE continued to exist and we
consolidated the entity as we

continued to be the primary beneficiary of the SPE through our holding of seller s interest and our role as the primary servicer. T AX C REDIT I NVESTMENTS We make certain
equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs). The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community
Reinvestment Act. Also, we are a national syndicator of affordable housing equity. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in
which our subsidiaries are the general partner or managing member and sell limited partnership or non-managing member interests to third parties. In some cases PNC may also purchase a limited partnership or non-managing member interest in the fund.
The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds, generate servicing fees by managing the funds, and earn tax credits to reduce our tax liability. General partner or managing member activities include selecting,
evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships or LLCs, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. Typically, the general partner or managing member will be the party that has the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. However, certain
partnership or LLC agreements provide the limited partner or non-managing member the ability to remove the general partner or managing member without cause. This results in the limited partner or non-managing member being the party that has the
right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. The primary sources of losses and benefits for these investments are the tax credits, tax benefits due to passive losses on the investments, and
development and operating cash flows. We have consolidated investments in which we are the general partner or managing member and have a limited partnership interest or non-managing member interest that provides us the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the entity s performance and have a limited partnership interest or non-managing member interest that could absorb losses or receive benefits that could be potentially significant. The assets are primarily
included in Equity investments and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet with the liabilities classified in Other borrowed funds, Accrued expenses, and Other liabilities and the third party investors interests included in the Equity
section as Noncontrolling interests. Neither creditors nor equity investors in these investments have any recourse to our general credit. We have not provided financial or other support to the limited partnership or LLC that we are not contractually
obligated to provide. The consolidated aggregate assets and liabilities of these investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs table and reflected in the Other business segment.

For tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to make decisions that will most significantly
impact the economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary beneficiary and thus they are not consolidated. These investments are disclosed in the Non-Consolidated VIEs table. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss. Our
maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment and partnership results. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities with the investments reflected in Equity
investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we increase our recognized investments and recognize a liability for all legally binding unfunded equity commitments. These liabilities are reflected in Other liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. R ESIDENTIAL AND C OMMERCIAL 
M ORTGAGE -B ACKED S ECURITIZATIONS In connection with each Agency and Non-agency
securitization discussed above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these transactions for consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as the nature of our involvement ultimately
determines whether or not we hold a variable interest and/or are the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of
mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPE, and (iii) the rights of third-party variable interest holders. 

The first step in our assessment is to determine whether we hold a variable interest in the securitization
SPE. We hold variable interests in Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs through our holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our recourse obligations. Each SPE in which we hold a variable interest is evaluated to
determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of
the SPEs. Thus, we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. For Non-agency securitization transactions, we would be the primary beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the power to direct the activities that most
significantly affect the economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more than insignificant variable interest in the entity. At December 31, 2012, our level of continuing involvement in Non-agency securitization SPEs did not result in PNC
being deemed the primary beneficiary of any of these entities. Details about the Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs where we hold a variable interest and are not the primary beneficiary are included in the Non-Consolidated VIEs table. Our
maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing assets, servicing advances, and our liabilities associated with our recourse obligations. Creditors of the
securitization SPEs have no recourse to PNC s assets or general credit.

(b) 
 Future accretable yield related to purchased impaired loans is not included in loans outstanding. In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products with contractual features, when concentrated, that may increase our exposure as a holder of those loan products. Possible product
features that may create a concentration of credit risk would include a high original or updated LTV ratio, terms that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments above increases in market interest rates, below-market interest rates
and interest-only loans, among others. We also originate home equity loans and lines of credit that are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. We originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. This is usually to match our borrowers asset conversion to cash expectations (i.e., working capital lines, revolvers). These products are
standard in the financial services industry and are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that may result in borrowers not being able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these
product features create a concentration of credit risk. At December 31, 2012, we pledged 23.2 billion of commercial loans to the
Federal Reserve Bank and 37.3 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2011 were 21.8 billion and
 27.7 billion, respectively.

 Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. At December 31,
2012, commercial commitments reported above exclude 22.5 billion of syndications, assignments and participations, primarily to financial institutions. The comparable amount at December 31, 2011 was 20.2 billion. 
 Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer s credit
quality deteriorates. Based on our historical experience, most commitments expire unfunded, and therefore cash requirements are substantially less than the total commitment.

N OTE 5 A SSET Q UALITY 
 Asset Quality 
 We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be
a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered
delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans. 
 The trends in nonperforming assets represent another key indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming
loans, certain TDRs, and other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets, but exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. See Note 6
Purchased Loans for further information. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional delinquency, nonperforming, and charge-off
information. The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively. Table 64: Age Analysis of Past Due Accruing Loans (a)

(a) 
 Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on
nonperforming status. 

(b) 
 In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted a policy stating that Home equity loans past due 90 days or more would be placed on nonaccrual status. Prior policy required
that these loans be past due 180 days before being placed on nonaccrual status. 

(c) 
 Nonperforming residential real estate excludes loans of 69 million and 61 million accounted for under the fair value option as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively. 

(d) 
 Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, nonperforming consumer loans, primarily home equity and residential mortgage, increased 288
million in 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs, net of charge-offs, resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon
discharge from personal liability. Charge-offs have been taken where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded investment of the loan and were 128.1 million. Of these loans, approximately 78 were current on their
payments at December 31, 2012. 

(e) 
 Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired
loans. 

(f) 
 OREO excludes 380 million and 280 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, related to residential real estate that was acquired by
us upon foreclosure of serviced loans because they are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

Nonperforming loans also include loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a
concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the TDR section of this Note 5 for additional information. For
the year ended December 31, 2012, 3.1 billion of loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain consumer government insured or guaranteed loans which were
evaluated for TDR consideration, are not classified as TDRs. The comparable amount for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 2.7 billion.

Total nonperforming loans in the Nonperforming Assets table above include TDRs of 1.6 billion at
December 31, 2012 and 1.1 billion at December 31, 2011. TDRs returned to performing (accruing) status totaled 1.0 billion and .8 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and are excluded from
nonperforming loans. These loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to
debtors in a commercial or consumer TDR were immaterial.

Additional Asset Quality Indicators We have two overall portfolio segments Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments is comprised of one or more loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in
initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The commercial segment is comprised of the commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, and commercial purchased impaired loan classes.
The consumer segment is comprised of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card, other consumer, and consumer purchased impaired loan classes. Asset quality indicators for each of these loan classes are discussed in more detail below.
 C OMMERCIAL L ENDING A SSET C LASSES 
 Commercial Loan Class For
commercial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting the
borrower s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides risk granularity in the monitoring process on an ongoing basis. These ratings are reviewed and updated on a risk-adjusted basis, generally at least once per
year. Additionally, on an annual basis, we update PD rates related to each rating grade based upon internal historical data, augmented by market data. For small balance homogenous pools of commercial loans, mortgages and leases, we apply statistical
modeling to assist in determining the probability of default within these pools. Further, on a periodic basis, we update our LGD estimates associated with each rating grade based on historical data. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned
to a commercial loan, capturing both the expectations of default and loss severity in event of default, reflects the relative estimated likelihood of loss for that loan at the reporting date. In general, loans with better PD and LGD have a lower
likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with worse PD and LGD have a higher likelihood of loss. The loss amount also considers exposure at date of default (EAD), which we also periodically update based on historical data. 
 Based upon the amount of exposure and our risk ratings, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic review. On a quarterly basis, we conduct formal
reviews of a market or business unit s loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or weakening credit quality. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer
obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial
conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Loan Class We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks connected with
commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in
assessing credit risk. As with the commercial class, a formal schedule of periodic review is performed to also assess market/geographic risk
and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, including adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that
concern management. The goal of these reviews is to assess risk and take actions to mitigate our exposure to such risks. Equipment
Lease Financing Loan Class We manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing class similar to commercial loans by
analyzing PD and LGD. Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and of the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic
review. Generally, this occurs on a quarterly basis, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently, if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual
value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, and guarantor requirements. Commercial Purchased Impaired Loans Class
 The credit impacts of purchased impaired loans are primarily determined through the estimation of expected cash flows. Commercial cash
flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items, which include but are not limited to: estimated collateral values, receipt of additional collateral, secondary trading prices, circumstances of possible and/or ongoing liquidation,
capital availability, business operations and payment patterns. We attempt to proactively manage these factors by using various procedures
that are customized to the risk of a given loan. These procedures include a review by our Special Asset Committee (SAC), ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.

 Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct
possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

C ONSUMER L ENDING A SSET C LASSES 
 Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes We use several credit quality indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated LTV ratios, and geography, to monitor and manage
credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes. We evaluate mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan servicers. A summary of asset quality indicators follows: 
 Delinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See the
Asset Quality section of this Note 5 for additional information. Nonperforming Loans: We monitor trending of nonperforming loans for
home equity and residential real estate loans. See the Asset Quality section of this Note 5 for additional information. Credit Scores :
We use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores for home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans on at least a quarterly basis. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management
reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes.

LTV (inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios for second lien positions) : At least
semi-annually, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may
occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Historically, we used, and we
continue to use, a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management reporting and risk management purposes (e.g., line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their
nature are estimates, given certain data limitations it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management s assumptions (e.g., if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, home price index (HPI)
changes will be incorporated in arriving at management s estimate of updated LTV). Geography : Geographic concentrations are
monitored to evaluate and manage exposures. Loan purchase programs are sensitive to, and focused within, certain regions to manage geographic exposures and associated risks.

A combination of updated FICO scores, originated and updated LTV ratios and geographic location assigned to
home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans are used to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Loans with higher FICO scores and lower LTVs tend to have a lower level of risk. Conversely, loans with lower FICO scores,
higher LTVs, and in certain geographic locations tend to have a higher level of risk. In the following table, we provide information on home
equity and residential real estate outstanding balances and recorded investment. See Note 4 Loans and Commitments to Extend Credit for additional information.

 Excludes purchased impaired loans of approximately 6.6 billion and 6.5 billion in outstanding balances, certain government insured or guaranteed residential real
estate mortgages of approximately 2.2 billion and 2.9 billion, and loans held for sale at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. See the Consumer Real Estate Secured Asset Quality Indicators Purchased Impaired Loans
table that follows for additional information on purchased impaired loans. 

(b) 
 Amounts shown represent outstanding balance. 

(c) 
 Based upon updated LTV (inclusive of CLTV for second lien positions). 

(d) 
 Updated LTV (inclusive of CLTV for second lien positions) are estimated using modeled property values. These ratios are updated semi-annually. The related estimates and
inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models (AVMs), HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. In cases where we are
in an originated second lien position, we generally utilize origination balances provided by a third-party which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of these calculations do not represent
actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon a current first lien balance, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we enhance our methodology. 

(e) 
 Higher risk loans are defined as loans with both an updated FICO score of less than or equal to 660 and an updated LTV greater than or equal to 100 .

(f) 
 The following states have the highest percentage of higher risk loans at December 31, 2012: New Jersey 14 , Illinois 12 , Pennsylvania 10 , Ohio 10 , Florida 9 ,
California 9 , and Maryland 5 . The remainder of the states have lower than 5 of the high risk loans individually, and collectively they represent approximately 31 of the higher risk loans. At December 31, 2011, the states with the highest
percentage of higher risk loans were as follows: Pennsylvania 13 , New Jersey 13 , Illinois 10 , Ohio 9 , Florida 8 , California 8 , Maryland 5 , and Michigan 5 . The remainder of the states had lower than 3 of the high risk loans individually, and
collectively they represented approximately 29 of the higher risk loans. 

(g) 
 In the second quarter of 2012, we made changes to the assumptions used to determine home equity first and second lien positions. This resulted in an increase in Home
equity 2nd liens of 2.4 billion and a corresponding decrease in Home equity 1st liens as of December 31, 2011.

 Amounts shown represent outstanding balance. See Note 6 Purchased Loans for additional information. 

(b) 
 For the estimate of cash flows utilized in our purchased impaired loan accounting, other assumptions and estimates are made, including amortization of first lien
balances, pre-payment rates, etc., which are not reflected in this table. 

(c) 
 The following states have the highest percentage of loans at December 31, 2012: California 21 , Florida 14 , Illinois 11 , Ohio 7 , Michigan 5 , North Carolina 5 
and Georgia at 5 , respectively. The remainder of the states have lower than a 4 concentration of purchased impaired loans individually, and collectively they represent approximately 32 of the purchased impaired portfolio. At December 31,
2011, the states with the highest percentage of loans were as follows: California 22 , Florida 13 , Illinois 12 , Ohio 9 , Michigan 5 and New York 4 . The remainder of the states have lower than a 4 concentration of purchased impaired loans
individually, and collectively they represent approximately 35 of the purchased impaired portfolio. 

(d) 
 Based upon updated LTV (inclusive of CLTV for second lien positions). 

(e) 
 Updated LTV (inclusive of CLTV for second lien positions) are estimated using modeled property values. These ratios are updated semi-annually. The related estimates and
inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party AVMs, HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. In cases where we are in an originated second lien
position, we generally utilize origination balances provided by a third-party which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of these calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level
collateral or updated LTV based upon a current first lien balance, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we enhance our methodology. 

(f) 
 In the second quarter of 2012, we made changes to the assumptions used to determine lien position. This resulted in a decrease in Home equity 1st liens of 65 million
and a corresponding increase in Home equity 2nd liens as of December 31, 2011. 

Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes 
 We monitor a variety of asset quality information in the management of the credit card and other consumer loan classes. Other consumer loan classes
include education, automobile, and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Along with the trending of delinquencies and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are obtained on a monthly basis for credit cards, and at least quarterly
for other consumer loans, as well as a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.

Consumer Purchased Impaired Loans Class 
 Estimates of the expected cash flows primarily determine the credit impacts of consumer purchased impaired loans. Consumer cash flow estimates are
influenced by a number of credit related items, which include, but are not limited to: estimated real estate values, payment patterns, updated FICO scores, the current economic environment, updated LTV ratios and the date of origination. These key
factors are monitored to help ensure that concentrations of risk are mitigated and cash flows are maximized. See Note 6 Purchased Loans for
additional information.

 At December 31, 2012, we had 36 million of credit card loans that are higher risk (i.e., loans with both updated FICO scores less than 660 and in late stage (90+
days) delinquency status). The majority of the December 31, 2012 balance related to higher risk credit card loans is geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Ohio 18 , Pennsylvania 14 , Michigan 12 , Illinois 8 , Indiana 6 ,
Florida 6 , New Jersey 5 , Kentucky 4 , and North Carolina 4 . All other states, none of which comprise more than 3 , make up the remainder of the balance. At December 31, 2011, we had 49 million of credit card loans that are higher risk. The
majority of the December 31, 2011 balance related to higher risk credit card loans is geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Ohio 20 , Michigan 14 , Pennsylvania 13 , Illinois 7 , Indiana 7 , Florida 6 and Kentucky 5 . All
other states, none of which comprise more than 4 , make up the remainder of the balance. 

(b) 
 Other consumer loans for which updated FICO scores are used as an asset quality indicator include nongovernment guaranteed or insured education loans, automobile loans
and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Other consumer loans (or leases) for which other internal credit metrics are used as an asset quality indicator include primarily government guaranteed or insured education loans, as well as consumer
loans to high net worth individuals and pools of auto loans (and leases) financed for PNC clients via securitization facilities. Other internal credit metrics may include delinquency status, geography, loan to value, asset concentrations, loss
coverage multiples, net loss rates or other factors as well as servicer quality reviews associated with the securitizations or other factors. 

(c) 
 Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history, accounts for
which we cannot obtain an updated FICO (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name, and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when necessary, takes actions
to mitigate the credit risk.

T ROUBLED D EBT R ESTRUCTURINGS (TDR S A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial
difficulties. TDRs typically result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, extensions, and bankruptcy discharges where no formal reaffirmation was
provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. In those situations where
principal is forgiven, the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. Some TDRs may not ultimately result in the full
collection of principal and interest, as restructured, and result in potential incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by
future economic conditions. Once a loan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be reported as a TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed upon, or it is fully charged off. We held specific reserves in the ALLL of 587
million and 580 million at December 31, 2012 and December 
31, 2011, respectively, for the total TDR portfolio. Table 71: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings

(a) 
 Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, additional troubled debt restructurings related to changes in treatment of certain loans of 366
million in 2012, net of charge-offs, resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability were added to the consumer lending
population. The additional TDR population increased nonperforming loans by 288 million. Charge-offs have been taken where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded investment of the loan and were 128.1 million. Of
these nonperforming loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments at December 31, 2012. 

(b) 
 Accruing loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.

(c) 
 Includes credit cards and certain small business and consumer credit agreements whose terms have been restructured and are TDRs. However, since our policy is to exempt
these loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance as generally these loans are directly charged off in the period that they become 180 days past due, these loans are excluded from nonperforming loans.

The following table quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in
the recorded investments as a result of the TDR classification during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. The Principal Forgiveness TDR category includes
principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness. These types of TDRs result in a write down of the recorded investment and a charge-off if such action has not already taken place. The Rate Reduction TDR category includes reduced interest rate
and interest deferral. The TDRs within this category would result in reductions to future interest income. The Other TDR category primarily includes postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, as well as contractual extensions. 
 In some cases, there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan. When there have been multiple concessions granted, the principal forgiveness TDR
was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in the table below. For example, if there is principal forgiveness in conjunction with lower interest rate and postponement of amortization, the type of concession will be reported as
Principal Forgiveness. Second in priority would be rate reduction. For example, if there is an interest rate reduction in conjunction with postponement of amortization, the type of concession will be reported as a Rate Reduction.

(d) 
 During 2011, the Post-TDR amounts for the Equipment lease financing loan class total less than 1 million. 

(e) 
 Includes loans modified during 2011 that were determined to be TDRs under the requirements of ASU 2011-02, which was adopted on July 1, 2011 and prospectively
applied to all modifications entered into on and after January 1, 2011. 

TDRs may result in charge-offs and interest income not being recognized. At or around the time of
modification, there was 22 million in recorded investment of commercial TDRs, 10 million in recorded investment of commercial real estate TDRs and 5 million of equipment lease financing TDRs charged off during 2012. Comparable amounts for 2011
were 26 million, 15 million and zero respectively. For residential real estate TDRs, there was 7 million of recorded investment charged off during 2012, related to modifications in which principal was partially deferred and deemed uncollectible.
The comparable amount for 2011 was 17 million. Charge-offs around the time of modification related to home equity, credit card, and other consumer TDR portfolios were immaterial for both periods. 
 A financial effect of rate reduction TDRs is that interest income is not recognized. Interest income not recognized that otherwise would have been earned
in the year ended

December 31, 2012 and 2011 related to both commercial TDRs and consumer TDRs was not material. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, management compiled TDR information related to changes in treatment of certain loans where a borrower has been discharged from personal
liability in bankruptcy and has not formally reaffirmed its loan obligation to PNC. This information has been reflected in period end balance disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2012. Because of the timing of the compilation of the TDR
information and the fact that it covers several periods, 366 million of TDRs, net of 128.1 million of charge-offs, related to this new regulatory guidance, has not been reflected as part of 2012 activity included in Table 72: Financial Impact and
TDRs by Concession Type and Table 73: TDRs which have Subsequently Defaulted.

After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent
restructured terms. In the following table, we consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The following table

presents the recorded investment of loans that were classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period prior to the reporting periods preceding January 1, 2012 and
January 1, 2011, respectively, in the table below and subsequently defaulted during these reporting periods.

(b) 
 During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no loans classified as TDRs in the Equipment lease financing loan class that have subsequently defaulted.

The impact to the ALLL for commercial lending TDRs is the effect of moving to the specific reserve
methodology from the quantitative reserve methodology for those loans that were not already put on nonaccrual status. There is an impact to the ALLL as a result of the concession made, which generally results in the expectation of fewer future cash
flows. The decline in expected cash flows, consideration of collateral value, and/or the application of a present value discount rate, when compared to the recorded investment, results in a charge-off or increased ALLL. As TDRs are individually
evaluated under the specific reserve methodology, which builds in expectations of future performance, subsequent defaults do not generally have a significant additional impact to the ALLL.

For consumer lending TDRs, the ALLL is calculated using a discounted cash flow model, which leverages
subsequent default, prepayment, and severity rate assumptions based on historically observed data. Similar to the commercial lending specific reserve methodology, the reduced expected cash flows resulting from the concessions granted impact the
consumer lending ALLL. The decline in expected cash flows, consideration of collateral value, and/or the application of a present value discount rate, when compared to the recorded investment, results in a charge-off or increased ALLL.

 Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. Excluded from impaired loans
are nonperforming leases, loans held for sale, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. See Note 6 Purchased Loans for additional information. Nonperforming equipment lease financing loans of 12 million and 22 million
at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, are

excluded from impaired loans pursuant to authoritative lease accounting guidance. We did not recognize interest income on nonperforming impaired loans while they were in impaired loan status
during 2012 and 2011. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these impaired loans
exceeded the recorded investment.

 Purchased impaired loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows
expected to be collected from the initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Several factors were considered when evaluating whether a loan was considered a purchased impaired loan,
including the delinquency status of the loan, updated borrower credit status, geographic information, and updated loan-to-values (LTV). GAAP allows purchasers to aggregate purchased impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more
pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Purchased impaired loans with homogeneous consumer,
residential real estate and smaller balance commercial loans with common risk characteristics are aggregated into pools where appropriate. Commercial loans with a total commitment greater than a defined threshold are accounted for individually. The
excess of cash flows

expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective
yield method. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. Subsequent changes in the expected cash flows of
individual or pooled purchased impaired loans from the date of acquisition will either impact the accretable yield or result in an impairment charge to provision for credit losses in the period in which the changes become probable. Decreases to the
net present value of expected cash flows will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a reclassification from accretable yield to
nonaccretable difference. Prepayments and interest rate decreases for variable rate notes are treated as a reduction of cash flows expected to be collected and a reduction of projections of contractual cash flows such that the nonaccretable
difference is not affected. Thus, for decreases in cash flows expected to be collected resulting from prepayments and interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, the effect will be to reduce the yield prospectively.

As of December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses related to purchased impaired loans
was 998 million. During 2012, 173 million of provision and 74 million of charge-offs were recorded on purchased impaired loans. At December 31, 2012, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.1 billion on 6.0 billion of purchased
impaired loans while the remaining 1.4 billion of purchased impaired loans required no allowance as the net present value of expected cash flows equaled or exceeded the recorded investment. If any allowance for loan losses is recognized on a
purchased impaired pool, which is accounted for as a single asset, the

entire balance of that pool would be disclosed as requiring an allowance. Subsequent increases in the net present value of cash flows will result in a recovery of any previously recorded
allowance for loan and lease losses, to the extent applicable, and/or a reclassification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield, which will be recognized prospectively. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans or
foreclosures, result in removal of the loan from the purchased impaired loan portfolio. The cash flow re-estimation process is completed quarterly to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance associated with the purchased impaired loans.

 Over eighty-five percent of the net reclassifications were driven by the commercial portfolio. Over half of the commercial portfolio impact related to excess cash
recoveries recognized during the period, with the remaining due to improvements of cash expected to be collected on both RBC Bank (USA) and National City loans in future periods. The remaining net reclassifications were due to future cash flow
changes in the consumer portfolio. RBC B ANK (USA) A CQUISITION 
 Loans acquired as part of the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition on March 2, 2012 had an outstanding balance of 16.7 billion. At purchase, acquired loans
were recorded at fair value. No separate valuation allowance was carried over and no allowance was created at acquisition. Fair values were determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using a market
discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. Cash flows expected to be collected as of the acquisition date were estimated using internal models and
third party data that incorporate management s best estimate of key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity, prepayment speeds, and timing of disposition upon default. In addition, each loan was reviewed to determine if it should be
classified as a purchased impaired loan accounted for under ASC 310-30. Loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it was probable at purchase that PNC will be unable to collect all contractually required
payments were considered purchased impaired. Several factors were considered when evaluating whether a loan was considered a purchased impaired loan, including the delinquency status of the loan, updated borrower credit status, geographic
information, and updated loan-to-values (LTV). In accordance with ASC 310-30, excluded from the purchased impaired loans were leases, revolving credit arrangements and loans held for sale. As of March 2, 2012, loans were classified as purchased impaired or purchased non-impaired and had a fair value of 2.0 billion and 12.5 billion, respectively, and an outstanding balance of 3.0
billion and 13.7 billion, respectively.

 RBC Bank (USA) Purchased Non-Impaired Loans 
 Other purchased loans acquired in the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition were recorded at fair value as provided in the table below. The difference between the
acquisition date fair value and the outstanding balance represents the fair value adjustment for a loan and includes both credit and interest rate considerations. Fair values were determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows
expected to be collected using a market discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a
loan s cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to net interest income (or expense) over the loan s remaining life in accordance with ASC 310-20. Fair value adjustments for revolving loans are accreted (or amortized) using a straight
line method. Term loans are accreted (or amortized) using the constant effective yield method. Table 79:

N OTE 7 A LLOWANCES FOR L OAN AND 
L EASE L OSSES AND U NFUNDED L OAN C OMMITMENTS AND L ETTERS OF C REDIT 
 We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate
to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date. We use the two main portfolio segments Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending and we develop and document the ALLL under separate
methodologies for each of these segments as further discussed and presented below. A LLOWANCE FOR 
L OAN AND L EASE L OSSES C OMPONENTS For all loans, except
purchased impaired loans, the ALLL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves, and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. See Note 6 Purchased
Loans for additional ALLL information. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio
performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated. During the third quarter of 2012, PNC increased the amount of internally observed data used in estimating the
key commercial lending assumptions of PD and LGD. A SSET S PECIFIC /I NDIVIDUAL 
C OMPONENT Commercial nonperforming loans and all TDRs are considered impaired and are evaluated for a specific reserve.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information. C OMMERCIAL L ENDING Q UANTITATIVE 
C OMPONENT The estimates of the quantitative component of ALLL for incurred losses within the commercial lending
portfolio segment are determined through statistical loss modeling utilizing PD, LGD, and outstanding balance of the loan. Based upon loan risk ratings we assign PDs and LGDs. Each of these statistical parameters is determined based on internal
historical data and market data. PD is influenced by such factors as liquidity, industry, obligor financial structure, access to capital, and cash flow. LGD is influenced by collateral type, original and/or updated LTV, and guarantees by related
parties. C ONSUMER L ENDING Q UANTITATIVE C OMPONENT 
 Quantitative estimates within the consumer lending portfolio segment are calculated using a roll-rate model based on statistical relationships, calculated
from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off. 

Qualitative Component While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to
the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. We provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ALLL also includes factors
which may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors include: 

Industry concentrations and conditions, 

Recent credit quality trends, 

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, 

Recent macro-economic factors, 

Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and 

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions. 
 A LLOWANCE FOR RBC B ANK (USA) P URCHASED 
 N ON -I MPAIRED L OANS ALLL for RBC Bank (USA) purchased non-impaired loans is determined based upon the methodologies described above compared to the remaining acquisition date fair value discount that has yet to be accreted
into interest income. After making the comparison, an ALLL is recorded for the amount greater than the discount, or no ALLL is recorded if the discount is greater. A LLOWANCE FOR P URCHASED I MPAIRED L OANS ALLL for purchased impaired loans is determined in accordance with ASC 310-30 by comparing the net present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the Recorded Investment for a given loan (or
pool of loans). In cases where the net present value of expected cash flows is lower than Recorded Investment, ALLL is established. Cash flows expected to be collected represent management s best estimate of the cash flows expected over the
life of a loan (or pool of loans). For large balance commercial loans, cash flows are separately estimated and compared to the Recorded Investment at the loan level. For smaller balance pooled loans, cash flows are estimated using cash flow models
and compared at the risk pool level, which was defined at acquisition based on risk characteristics of the loan. Our cash flow models use loan data including, but not limited to, delinquency status of the loan, updated borrower FICO credit scores,
geographic information, historical loss experience, and updated LTVs, as well as estimates for unemployment rates, home prices and other economic factors to determine estimated cash flows.

The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility
and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, unless credit-related. Securities held
to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At December 31, 2012, accumulated other comprehensive income included pretax gains of 89 million from derivatives used to hedge the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity.
The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities. During 2011, we transferred securities with a
fair value of 6.3 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. The securities were reclassified at fair value at the time of transfer and represented a non-cash transaction. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax
unrealized gains of 183 million on the securities at transfer, which are being accreted over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of the net premium on the same
transferred securities, resulting in no impact on net income. The transfers were completed in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and

certain capital measures, and considered potential changes to regulatory capital requirements under the proposed Basel III capital standards. 
 The gross unrealized loss on debt securities held to maturity was less than 1 million at December 31, 2012 and 6 million at December 31,
2011, with 73 million and 522 million of positions in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The fair value on debt securities held to maturity that were in a
continuous loss position for 12 months or more was 56 million and 85 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The following table presents gross unrealized loss and fair value of securities available for sale at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The securities are segregated between investments
that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of
other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) has been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Evaluating Investment Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments 
 For the securities in the preceding table, as of December 31, 2012 we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the
securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. On at least a quarterly basis, we conduct a comprehensive security-level assessment
on all securities in an unrealized loss position to determine if OTTI exists. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. An OTTI loss must be recognized for a debt security
in an unrealized loss position if

we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. In this situation, the amount of loss
recognized in income is equal to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the security. Even if we do not expect to sell the security, we must evaluate the expected cash flows to be received to determine if we believe a
credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. The portion of the unrealized loss relating to other factors, such as liquidity conditions in the market
or changes in market interest rates, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The security-level assessment is performed on each security, regardless of the classification of the
security as available for sale or held to maturity. Our assessment considers the security structure, recent security collateral performance metrics if applicable, external credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal
payments, our judgment and expectations of future performance, and relevant independent industry research, analysis and forecasts. Results of the periodic assessment are reviewed by a cross-functional senior management team representing
Asset Liability Management, Finance, and Market Risk Management. The senior management team considers the results of the assessments, as well as other factors, in determining whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. 
 For debt securities, a critical component of the evaluation for OTTI is the identification of credit-impaired securities, where management does not
expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The paragraphs below describe our process for identifying credit impairment for our most significant categories of securities not backed by the US
government or its agencies. Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and Asset-Backed Securities Collateralized by First-Lien
and Second-Lien Non-Agency Residential Mortgage Loans Potential credit losses on these securities are evaluated on a security by
security basis. Collateral performance assumptions are developed for each security after reviewing collateral composition and collateral performance statistics. This includes analyzing recent delinquency roll rates, loss severities, voluntary
prepayments, and various other collateral and performance metrics. This information is then combined with general expectations on the housing market, employment, and other economic factors to develop estimates of future performance. 
 Security level assumptions for prepayments, loan defaults, and loss given default are applied to every security using a third-party cash flow model. The
third-party cash flow model then generates projected cash flows according to the structure of each security. Based on the results of the cash flow analysis, we determine whether we will recover the amortized cost basis of our security. 
 The following table provides detail on the significant assumptions used to determine credit impairment for non-agency residential mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities collateralized by first-lien and second-lien non-agency residential mortgage loans.

 Calculated by weighting the relevant assumption for each individual security by the current outstanding cost basis of the security. 
 Non-Agency Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Credit losses on these securities are measured using property-level cash flow projections and forward-looking property valuations. Cash flows are projected using a detailed analysis of net operating
income (NOI) by property type which, in turn, is based on the analysis of NOI performance over the past several business cycles combined with PNC s economic outlook for the current cycle. Loss severities are based on property price projections,
which are calculated using capitalization rate projections. The capitalization rate projections are based on a combination of historical capitalization rates and expected capitalization rates implied by current market activity, our outlook and
relevant independent industry research, analysis and forecasts. Securities exhibiting weaker performance within the model are subject to further analysis. This analysis is performed at the loan level, and includes assessing local market conditions,
reserves, occupancy, rent rolls and master/special servicer details.

 F AIR V ALUE M EASUREMENT 
 Fair value is defined in GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the
measurement date. The standard focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. GAAP establishes a fair value reporting hierarchy to maximize the
use of observable inputs when measuring fair value and defines the three levels of inputs as noted below. Level 1 
 Fair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt
securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market and certain US Treasury securities that are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 
 Level 2 Fair value is estimated using
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 assets and liabilities may include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts with
quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt and equity securities and over-the-counter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable inputs. This
category generally includes US government agency debt securities, agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed debt securities, asset-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, residential mortgage loans held for sale, corporate trading
loans and derivative contracts. Level 3 Fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities may include financial instruments whose value is
determined using pricing services, pricing models with internally developed assumptions, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management
judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain available for sale and trading securities, commercial mortgage loans held for sale, certain residential mortgage loans and loans held for sale, private equity investments, residential
mortgage servicing rights, BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock and certain financial derivative contracts. The available for sale and trading securities within Level 3 include non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, auction rate
securities, certain private-issuer asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities. Assets which have been adjusted due to impairment are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and consist primarily of certain

nonaccrual loans, loans held for sale, commercial mortgage servicing rights, equity investments and other assets. We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where dealer quotes received do not
vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask
spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any
combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes based on the descriptions below are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control
testing processes. Our Model Risk Management Committee reviews significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, we have teams, independent of the traders, which verify marks and assumptions used for valuations at each period end.
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and
liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently require the use of various assumptions, estimates and judgments when measuring their fair value. As observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of Level
3 assets and liabilities, we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. These techniques include the use of a variety of inputs/assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or other relevant inputs across the
entire population of our Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions (either an increase or a decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may result in a significant increase/decrease in
the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from period to period.

F INANCIAL I NSTRUMENTS A CCOUNTED F OR 
 AT F AIR V ALUE ON A R ECURRING B ASIS Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities Securities accounted for at
fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes, or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. As of December 31, 2012, 84 of the
positions in these portfolios were priced by using pricing services provided by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a
buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. One of the vendor s prices are set with reference to market activity for highly liquid assets such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities and agency residential
mortgage-backed securities, and matrix pricing for other asset classes, such as commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities. Another vendor primarily uses discounted cash flow pricing models considering adjustments for spreads and
prepayments for the instruments we value using this service, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency adjustable rate mortgage securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), commercial mortgage-backed
securities and municipal bonds. The vendors we use provide pricing services on a global basis and have quality management processes in place to monitor the integrity of the valuation inputs and the prices provided to users, including procedures to
consider and incorporate information received from pricing service users who may challenge a price. We monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, by performing detailed reviews of
the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing. Price validation testing is performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from
third-party vendors with prices from another third-party source, by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments, by comparison to internal valuations, or by reference to recent sales of similar securities. Securities not priced by one of our
pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote. Dealer quotes received are typically non-binding. Securities priced using a dealer quote are subject to corroboration either with another dealer quote, by comparison to similar securities priced by
either a third-party vendor or another dealer, or through internal valuation in order to validate that the quote is representative of the market. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security. 
 A cross-functional team comprised of representatives from Asset Liability Management, Finance, and Market Risk Management oversees the
governance of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the fair value of securities and the price validation testing that is performed. This management team reviews pricing sources and trends and the results of validation testing.

Table of Contents 

Securities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after giving consideration to the activity level
in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical security, this price is used to determine fair value and the security is
classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include certain U.S. Treasury securities and exchange traded equities. When a quoted price in an active market for the identical security is not available, fair value is estimated using
either an alternative market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing model. If the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on market observable information, then the
security is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities
collateralized by non-mortgage-related consumer loans, municipal securities, and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly priced by third parties, either a pricing vendor or dealer. 
 In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the
hierarchy. Securities classified as Level 3 consist primarily of non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by first- and second-lien residential mortgage loans. Fair value for these securities is primarily
estimated using pricing obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar
securities. Market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency. As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates observable market
activity where available. Significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions (default rate and loss severity) and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions. The discount
rates used incorporate a spread over the benchmark curve that takes into consideration liquidity risk and potential credit risk not already included in the credit loss assumptions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions in
isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Prepayment estimates generally increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise. Credit loss estimates are driven by the ability
of borrowers to pay their loans and housing market prices and are impacted by changes in overall macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated
prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Discount rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market

interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Price validation procedures are performed and the results are reviewed for these Level 3 securities by a cross-functional
Asset Liability Management, Finance, and Market Risk Management team. Specific price validation procedures performed for these securities include comparing current prices to historical pricing trends by collateral type and vintage,
comparing prices by product type to indicative pricing grids published by market makers, and by obtaining corroborating prices from another third-party source. Certain infrequently traded debt securities within the State and municipal and Other debt securities available-for-sale and Trading securities categories are also classified in Level 3. The significant
unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread
over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases (decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate.
 Financial Derivatives 
 Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. However, the majority of derivatives that we enter into
are executed over-the-counter and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are primarily classified as Level 2 as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources. The external sources for these
inputs include industry pricing services, or are corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are primarily estimated using a combination of
Eurodollar future prices and observable benchmark interest rate swaps to construct projected discounted cash flows. Financial derivatives that are priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. 
 Fair value information for Level 3 financial derivatives is presented separately for interest rate contracts and other contracts. Interest rate contracts
include residential and commercial mortgage interest rate lock commitments and certain interest rate options. Other contracts include risk participation agreements, certain equity options and other types of contracts. 
 Significant unobservable inputs for residential mortgage loan commitments include the probability of funding and embedded servicing. The probability of
funding for residential mortgage loan commitments represents the expected proportion of loan commitments in the pipeline that will fund. Additionally, embedded in the market price of the underlying loan is a value for retaining servicing of the loan
once it is sold. Significant increases (decreases) in the fair value of a

residential mortgage loan commitment asset (liability) result when the probability of funding increases (decreases) and when the embedded servicing value increases (decreases). 
 The fair value of commercial mortgage loan commitment assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 are included in the Insignificant Level 3
assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 95: Fair Value Measurement Recurring Quantitative Information in this Note 9. Significant unobservable inputs for commercial mortgage loan commitments include spread over the benchmark U.S.
Treasury interest rate and the embedded servicing value. The spread over the benchmark curve reflects management assumptions regarding credit and liquidity risks. Embedded servicing value reflects the estimated value for retaining the right to
service the underlying loan once it is sold. Significant increases (decreases) in the fair value of commercial mortgage loan commitments result when the spread over the benchmark curve decreases (increases) or the embedded servicing value increases
(decreases). The fair value of interest rate option assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 are included in the Insignificant
Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 95: Fair Value Measurement Recurring Quantitative Information in this Note 9. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the interest rate options is expected
interest rate volatility. Significant increases (decreases) in interest rate volatility would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The fair value of risk participation agreement assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 95: Fair Value
Measurement Recurring Quantitative Information in this Note 9. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of risk participation agreements are probability of default and loss severity. Significant increases
(decreases) in probability of default and loss severity would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant
unobservable inputs for the other contracts for derivative liabilities include credit and liquidity discount and spread over the benchmark curve that are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in these
assumptions would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. In connection with the sales of certain Visa Class B common
shares in 2012, we entered into swap agreements with the purchaser of the shares to account for future changes in the value of the Class B common shares resulting from changes in the settlement of certain specified litigation and its effect on the
conversion rate of Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares and to make payments calculated by reference to the market price of the Class A common shares. At December 31, 2012, the estimated fair values of the swap

liabilities are classified as Level 3 instruments and included in Table 95: Fair Value Measurement Recurring Quantitative Information in this Note 9. The fair values of the swap agreements
are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs to the valuations are estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Class B shares into Class A shares and the estimated future price of the
Class A shares. A decrease in the conversion rate will have a negative impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa. Independent of changes in the conversion rate, an increase in the future Class A share price will have a negative
impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa, through its impact on periodic payments due to the counterparty until the maturity dates of the swaps. The fair values of our derivatives are adjusted for nonperformance risk through the calculation of our Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA). Our CVA is computed using new loan pricing and considers
externally available bond spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations. Residential Mortgage Loans Held for
Sale We account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. We have elected to
account for certain RBC Bank (USA) residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges. Additionally, with the exception of
repurchased FHA insured loans which are accounted for at amortized cost, we have elected to account for loans repurchased due to breaches of representations and warranties at fair value. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information
received from market participants. These loans are regularly traded in active markets and observable pricing information is available from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans
and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the
relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2. This category also includes repurchased and temporarily
unsalable residential mortgage loans. These loans are repurchased due to a breach of representations and warranties in the loan sales agreement and typically occur after the loan is in default. The temporarily unsalable loans have an origination
defect that makes them currently unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market. Because transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable, unobservable bid information

Table of Contents 

from brokers and investors is heavily relied upon. Accordingly, based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these loans are classified as Level 3. 
 Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights Residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Assumptions incorporated into the residential MSRs valuation model reflect management s best estimate of
factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential MSRs. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of
sales are not available. As a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential MSRs fair value, PNC obtained opinions of value from independent parties brokers ). These brokers provided a range (+/- 10 bps) based upon their own
discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions. PNC compares its internally-developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from
the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For the periods presented, PNC s residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the
brokers ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark
curve. Significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would result in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs. Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale We account for certain commercial mortgage
loans classified as held for sale at fair value. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the commercial mortgages with the related hedges. We determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale by using a discounted cash flow model. Fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market
participant would use in pricing the loans. When available, valuation assumptions include observable inputs based on the benchmark LIBOR interest rate swap curve and whole loan sales. The significant unobservable input is management s
assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate. The spread over the benchmark curve includes management s assumptions of the impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases (decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark
would result in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio. Based on the significance of unobservable
inputs, we classified this portfolio as Level 3. 
 
 Equity Investments The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of
such investments. The carrying values of direct and affiliated partnership interests reflect the expected exit price and are based on various techniques including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated
financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. A multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and the multiple of
earnings is the primary and most significant unobservable input used in such calculation. The multiple of earnings is utilized in conjunction with portfolio company financial results and our ownership interest in portfolio company securities to
determine PNC s interest in the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The magnitude of the change in fair
value is dependent on the significance of the change in the multiple of earnings and the significance of portfolio company adjusted earnings. Valuation inputs or analysis are supported by portfolio company or market documentation. Due to the size,
private and unique nature of each portfolio company, lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of investments, relevant benchmarking is not always feasible. A valuation committee reviews the portfolio company valuations on a quarterly basis and
oversight is provided by senior management of the business. We value indirect investments in private equity funds based on net asset value as
provided in the financial statements that we receive from their managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-provided
value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. These investments are classified as Level 3. 
 Customer Resale Agreements We
have elected to account for structured resale agreements, which are economically hedged using free-standing financial derivatives, at fair value. The fair value for structured resale agreements is determined using a model that includes observable
market data such as interest rates as inputs. Readily observable market inputs to this model can be validated to external sources, including yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. These instruments are classified as Level 2.

Loans Loans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as Level 2.
However, similar to residential mortgage loans held for sale, if these loans are repurchased and unsalable, they are classified as Level 3. This category also includes repurchased brokered home equity loans. These loans are repurchased due to a
breach of representations or warranties in the loan sales agreements and occur typically after the loan is in default. The fair value price is based on bids and market observations of transactions of similar vintage. Because transaction details
regarding the credit and underwriting quality are often unavailable, unobservable bid information from brokers and investors is heavily relied upon. Accordingly, based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these loans are classified as Level
3. The fair value of these loans as of December 31, 2012 is included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 95: Fair Value Measurement Recurring Quantitative Information in this Note 9. A significant
input to the valuation includes a credit and liquidity discount that is deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in this assumption would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.
 BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock We have elected to account for the shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock received in a stock exchange with BlackRock at fair value. In September 2011, we delivered approximately 1.3 million
shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to our obligation to partially fund a portion of certain BlackRock LTIP programs. On January 31, 2013, we transferred an additional 205,350 shares to BlackRock in connection with our
obligation. After this transfer, we hold approximately 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which are available to fund our obligation in connection with the BlackRock LTIP programs. The Series C Preferred Stock economically
hedges the BlackRock LTIP liability that is accounted for as a derivative. The fair value of the Series C Preferred Stock is

determined using a third-party modeling approach, which includes both observable and unobservable inputs. This approach considers expectations of a default/liquidation event and the use of
liquidity discounts based on our inability to sell the security at a fair, open market price in a timely manner. Although dividends are equal to common shares and other preferred series, significant transfer restrictions exist on our Series C shares
for any purpose other than to satisfy the LTIP obligation. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, this security is classified as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in the liquidity discount would result in a significantly lower
(higher) asset value for the BlackRock Series C and vice versa for the BlackRock LTIP liability. Other Assets and Liabilities
 We have entered into a prepaid forward contract with a financial institution to mitigate the risk on a portion of the Company s
deferred compensation, supplemental incentive savings plan liabilities and certain stock based compensation awards that are based on the Company s stock price and are subject to market risk. The prepaid forward contract is initially valued at
the transaction price and is subsequently valued by reference to the market price of the Company s stock and is recorded in either Other Assets or Other Liabilities at fair value. In addition, deferred compensation and supplemental incentive
savings plan participants may also invest based on fixed income and equity-based funds. The Company utilizes a Rabbi Trust to hedge the returns by purchasing the same funds on which the participant returns are based. The Rabbi Trust balances are
recorded in Other Assets at fair value using the quoted market price. These assets are primarily being classified in Levels 1 and 2. The other asset category also includes FHLB interests and the retained interests related to the Small Business
Administration (SBA) securitizations which are classified as Level 3. All Level 3 other assets are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 95: Fair Value Measurement Recurring Quantitative

unrealized) of 74 million for 2011. These amounts also included amortization and accretion of 189 million for 2012 compared with 109 million for 2011. The amortization and accretion amounts were included in Interest income on the Consolidated
Income Statement, and the remaining net gains/(losses) (realized and unrealized) were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

(f) 
 Net unrealized gains relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were 254 million for 2012, compared with net unrealized losses of
 204 million for 2011. These amounts were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

An instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. PNC reviews and updates fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a
reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. PNC s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. During 2012, there were transfers of securities available for sale
from Level 2 to Level 3 of 478 million consisting of mortgage-backed securities as a result of a ratings downgrade which reduced the observability of

valuation inputs and certain state and municipal securities with valuation inputs that were determined to be unobservable. Level 2 to Level 3 transfers also included 127 million and 27 million
for loans and residential mortgage loans held for sale, respectively, as a result of reduced market activity in the nonperforming residential mortgage sales market which reduced the observability of valuation inputs. Also during 2012, there was a
transfer out of Level 3 securities available for sale of 40 million due to an instrument being reclassified to a loan and no longer being carried at fair value. During 2011, there were no material transfers of assets or liabilities between the
hierarchy levels.

(a) 
 Level 3 residential mortgage-backed non-agency and asset-backed securities with fair values as of December 31, 2012 totaling 5,363 million and 677 million,
respectively, were priced by a third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow pricing model, that incorporates consensus pricing, where available. The significant unobservable inputs for these securities were provided by the third-party vendor and
are disclosed in the table. Our procedures to validate the prices provided by the third-party vendor related to these securities are discussed further in the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 9. Certain Level 3 residential mortgage-backed
non-agency and asset-backed securities with fair value as of December 31, 2012 of 744 million and 31 million, respectively, were valued using a pricing source, such as a dealer quote or comparable security price, for which the significant
unobservable inputs used to determine the price were not reasonably available. 

(b) 
 The assumed yield spread over the benchmark curve for each instrument is generally intended to incorporate non-interest-rate risks such as credit and liquidity risks.

(c) 
 Consensus pricing refers to fair value estimates that are generally internally developed using information such as dealer quotes or other third-party provided
valuations or comparable asset prices. 

(d) 
 The range on these indirect equity investments has not been disclosed since these investments are recorded at their net asset redemption values.

(e) 
 Represents the aggregate amount of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are individually and in the aggregate insignificant.
The amount includes loans and certain financial derivative assets and liabilities and other assets. 

(f) 
 Consists of total Level 3 assets of 10,988 million and total Level 3 liabilities of 376 million.

 Nonaccrual Loans The amounts
below for nonaccrual loans represent the fair value of those loans which have been adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral or LGD percentage. The LGD percentage is used to determine the
weighted average loss severity of the nonaccrual loans. As part of the appraisal process, persons ordering or reviewing appraisals are
independent of the asset manager. Appraisals must be provided by licensed or certified appraisers and conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. For loans secured by commercial properties where the underlying collateral is
in excess of 250,000, appraisals are obtained at least annually. In certain instances (e.g., physical changes in the property), a more recent appraisal is obtained. Additionally, borrower ordered appraisals are not permitted, and PNC ordered
appraisals are regularly reviewed. For loans secured by commercial properties where the underlying collateral is 250,000 and less, there is no requirement to obtain an appraisal. In instances where an appraisal is not obtained, the collateral value
is determined consistent with external third-party appraisal standards by an internal person independent of the asset manager. PNC has a real estate valuation services group whose sole function is to manage the real estate appraisal solicitation and
evaluation process for commercial loans. All third-party appraisals are reviewed by this group, including consideration of comments/questions on the appraisal by the reviewer, customer relationship manager, credit officer, and underwriter. Upon
resolving these comments/questions through discussions with the third-party appraiser, adjustments to the initial appraisal may occur and be incorporated into the final issued appraisal report. 
 If an appraisal is outdated due to changed project or market conditions, or if the net book value is utilized, management uses an LGD percentage which
represents the exposure PNC expects to lose in the event a borrower defaults on an obligation. Accordingly, LGD, which represents the loss severity, is a function of collateral recovery rates and loan-to-value. Those rates are established based upon
actual PNC loss experience and external market data. In instances where we have agreed to sell the property to a third party, the fair value is based on the contractual sales price adjusted for costs to sell. In these instances, the most significant
unobservable input is the appraised value or the sales price. The estimated

costs to sell are incremental direct costs to transact a sale such as broker commissions, legal, closing costs and title transfer fees. The costs must be essential to the sale and would not have
been incurred if the decision to sell had not been made. The costs to sell are based on costs associated with our actual sales of commercial and residential OREO and foreclosed assets, which are assessed annually. 
 Loans Held for Sale The amounts
below for loans held for sale include the carrying value of commercial mortgage loans which are intended to be sold with servicing retained. The fair value of the commercial mortgage loans is determined using discounted cash flows. Significant
observable market data includes the applicable benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rates. These instruments are classified within Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs include a spread over the benchmark curve and the embedded servicing value.
Significant increases (decreases) to the spread over the benchmark curve would result in a significantly lower (higher) carrying value of the assets. Significant increases (decreases) in the embedded servicing value would result in significantly
higher (lower) carrying value. Loans held for sale also includes syndicated commercial loan inventory. The fair value of the syndicated
commercial loan inventory is primarily determined based on prices provided by a third-party vendor. The third-party vendor prices are based upon dealer quotes. These instruments are classified within Level 2. There were no loans held for sale
categorized as Level 2 at December 31, 2012. Equity Investments The amounts below for equity investments represent the carrying value of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) investments held for sale calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The significant
unobservable input is management s estimate of required market rate of return. The market rate of return is based on comparison to recent LIHTC sales in the market. Significant increases (decreases) in this input would result in a significantly
lower (higher) carrying value of the investments. Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 Commercial MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment and the amounts below reflect an impairment of two strata at December 31, 2012 and three
strata at December 31, 2011, respectively. For purposes of impairment, the commercial MSRs are stratified based on asset type, which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset. The fair value of commercial MSRs is
estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors. Significant increases (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and discount rates
would result in significantly lower (higher) commercial MSR value determined based on current market conditions and expectations.

OREO and Foreclosed Assets The amounts below for OREO and foreclosed assets represent the carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets for which valuation adjustments were recorded subsequent to the transfer to OREO and foreclosed
assets. Valuation adjustments are based on the fair value less cost to sell of the property. Fair value is based on appraised value or sales price. The appraisal process for OREO and foreclosed properties is the same as described above for nonaccrual loans. In instances where we have agreed to sell the property to a third party, the fair value is
based on the contractual sale price adjusted for costs to sell. The significant unobservable inputs for OREO and foreclosed assets are the appraised value or the sales price. The estimated costs to sell are incremental direct costs to transact a
sale such as broker commissions, legal, closing costs and title transfer fees. The costs must be essential to the sale and would not have been incurred if the decision to sell had not been made. The costs to sell are based on costs associated with
our actual sales of commercial and residential OREO and foreclosed assets, which are assessed annually. Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale
 The amounts below for Long-lived assets held for sale represent the carrying value of the asset for which valuation adjustments were
recorded during the current year and subsequent to the transfer to Long-lived assets held for sale. Valuation adjustments are based on the fair value of the property less an estimated cost to sell. Fair value is determined either by a recent
appraisal, recent sales offer or changes in market or property conditions. Appraisals are provided by licensed or certified appraisers. Where we have agreed to sell the property to a third party, the fair value is based on the contractual sale
price. The significant unobservable inputs for Long-lived assets held for sale are the appraised value, the sales price or the changes in market or property conditions. Changes in market or property conditions are subjectively determined by
management through observation of the physical condition of the property along with the condition of properties in the surrounding market place. The availability and recent sales of similar properties is also considered. The range of fair values can
vary significantly as this category often includes smaller properties such as offsite ATM locations and smaller rural branches up to large commercial buildings, operation centers or urban branches.

The aggregate fair values in the table above do not represent the total market value of PNC s assets
and liabilities as the table excludes the following: 

real and personal property, 

lease financing, 

loan customer relationships, 

deposit customer intangibles, 

retail branch networks, 

fee-based businesses, such as asset management and brokerage, and 

trademarks and brand names. 
 We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value amounts for financial instruments. 
 General For short-term financial
instruments realizable in three months or less, the carrying amount reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. Unless otherwise stated, the rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are based on market yield curves.

Cash and due from banks The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and due from banks approximate fair values. For purposes of this disclosure only, cash and due from banks includes the following:

due from banks, and 

interest-earning deposits with banks. Cash and due from banks are classified as Level 1. Short-Term Assets 
 The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for short-term investments approximate fair values primarily due to their short-term
nature. For purposes of this disclosure only, short-term assets include the following: 

federal funds sold and resale agreements, 

cash collateral, 

customers acceptances, and 

accrued interest receivable. Short-term assets are classified as Level 2.

Table of Contents 

Securities Securities include both the investment securities (comprised of available for sale and held to maturity securities) and trading securities portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing
services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. As of December 31, 2012, 86 of the positions in these portfolios were priced by pricing services provided by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a
variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. One of the vendor s prices is set with
reference to market activity for highly liquid assets, such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and matrix pricing for other asset classes, such as commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities.
Another vendor primarily uses pricing models considering adjustments for ratings, spreads, matrix pricing and prepayments for the instruments we value using this service, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency adjustable
rate mortgage securities, agency CMOs, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds. Management uses various methods and techniques to validate prices obtained from pricing services and dealers, including reference to another
third-party source, by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments, or by comparison to internal valuations. Net Loans And Loans Held
For Sale Fair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about prepayment
rates, net credit losses and servicing fees. For purchased impaired loans, fair value is assumed to equal PNC s carrying value, which represents the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows, as adjusted for any ALLL
recorded for these loans. See Note 6 Purchased Loans for additional information. For revolving home equity loans and commercial credit lines, this fair value does not include any amount for new loans or the related fees that will be generated from
the existing customer relationships. Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. Also refer to the Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value Option sections of this Note 9 regarding the fair value of commercial and residential
mortgage loans held for sale. Loans are presented net of the ALLL and do not include future accretable discounts related to purchased impaired loans. Other Assets Other assets as shown in the preceding table includes the following:

FHLB and FRB stock, 

equity investments carried at cost and fair value, and 

BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock. Investments accounted for under the equity method, including our investment in BlackRock, are not included in the preceding Table 100: Additional Fair Value Information Related to Financial Instruments.

Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 9 regarding the fair value of equity investments.
 The aggregate carrying value of our investments that are carried at cost and FHLB and FRB stock was 1.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and
was 1.9 billion at December 31, 2011, which approximates fair value at each date. Mortgage Servicing Assets 
 Fair value is based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows, incorporating assumptions as to prepayment rates, discount rates, default
rates, escrow balances, interest rates, cost to service and other factors. The key valuation assumptions for commercial and residential
mortgage loan servicing assets at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 are included in Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Customer Resale Agreements Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note
9 regarding the fair value of customer resale agreements. Deposits The carrying amounts of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, interest-bearing money market and savings deposits approximate fair values. For time deposits, which include foreign deposits, fair
values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows assuming current interest rates. All deposits are classified as Level 2. Borrowed Funds The carrying amounts of Federal funds purchased, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, trading securities sold short, cash collateral, other short-term borrowings, acceptances outstanding and accrued interest payable are considered to be their fair value because of their short-term nature. For all other borrowed
funds, fair values are estimated using either prices obtained from third-party vendors or an internally developed discounted cash flow approach taking into consideration our current incremental borrowing rates for similar instruments. 
 Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit The fair value of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined from a market participant s view including the impact of changes in interest rates, credit and other factors. Because
our obligation on substantially all unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit varies with changes in interest rates, these instruments are subject to little fluctuation in fair value due to changes in interest rates. We establish a liability
on these facilities related to the creditworthiness of our counterparty. These instruments are classified as Level 3.

Assets and liabilities of acquired entities are recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition
date. We conduct a goodwill impairment test on our reporting units at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events
occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flow and, when applicable, market comparability methodologies. 
 Our residential mortgage banking business, similar to other residential mortgage banking businesses, is operating in an unsettled environment, which has
and may continue to result in higher operating costs, and has experienced increased uncertainties such as elevated indemnification and repurchase liabilities and foreclosure related issues. Additionally, the current level of refinance volumes is not
expected to continue indefinitely given that interest rates have been low for a prolonged period of time. Step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit using a
discounted cash flow approach was less than its carrying value. Step 2 of the impairment test was performed and indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying value. An impairment charge of 45 million was recorded
which wrote down the entire balance of goodwill in the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit. The Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit does not have any remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2012.

 We recognize as an other intangible asset the right to service mortgage loans for others. Commercial MSRs are purchased or
originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. Commercial MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. These rights are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, and are substantially amortized in proportion to
and over the period of estimated net servicing income of 5 to 10 years. Commercial MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment. For
purposes of impairment, the commercial MSRs are stratified based on asset type, which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset. If the carrying amount of any individual stratum exceeds its fair value, a valuation reserve
is established with a corresponding charge to Corporate services on our Consolidated Income Statement. The fair value of commercial MSRs is
estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations.

(a) 
 Represents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or
paid off during the period. 

(b) 
 Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates, as well as changes in assumptions such as prepayments and servicing
costs. We recognize mortgage servicing right assets on residential real estate loans when we retain the obligation to service
these loans upon sale and the servicing fee is more than adequate compensation or upon purchase of servicing rights from third parties. MSRs are subject to declines in value principally from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and
also defaults. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of MSRs declines (or increases). 
 The fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing
cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions. 
 The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011
are shown in the tables below. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial

mortgage loan prepayments and a third party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management
judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived
from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value
estimate. A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented
below. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in
mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10 and
20 in those assumptions: Table 107: Commercial Mortgage Loan Servicing Assets Key Valuation

All of these Trusts are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of PNC. In the event of certain changes or
amendments to regulatory requirements or federal tax rules, the capital securities are redeemable in whole. In accordance with GAAP, the financial statements of the Trusts are not included in PNC s consolidated financial statements. 
 At December 31, 2012, PNC s junior subordinated debt with a carrying value of 343 million represented debentures purchased and held as assets
by the Trusts and redeemable prior to maturity. The obligations of the respective parent of each Trust, when taken collectively, are the
equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of such Trust under the terms of the Capital Securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right of payment in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There are certain
restrictions on PNC s overall ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these funding restrictions, including

an explanation of dividend and intercompany loan limitations, see Note 22 Regulatory Matters. PNC is also subject to restrictions on dividends and other provisions potentially imposed under the

 P ENSION A ND P OSTRETIREMENT P LANS 
 We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where
earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at their level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who become participants on or
after January 1, 2010 are a flat 3 of eligible compensation. Participants at December 31, 2009 earn interest based on 30-year Treasury securities with a minimum rate, while new participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject
to the minimum rate. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits)
through various plans. The nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans are unfunded. The Company reserves the right to terminate plans or make plan changes at any time. PNC acquired RBC Bank (USA) during the first quarter of 2012. RBC Bank (USA) employees began to participate in PNC s pension and 401(k) plans upon meeting the plan s eligibility requirements.
Some grandfathered employees will also be eligible for PNC s postretirement medical benefits. We use a measurement date of
December 31 for plan assets and benefit obligations. A reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the
qualified pension plan follows. Table 118: Reconciliation of Changes in Projected Benefit Obligation and

At December 31, 2012, the fair value of the qualified pension plan assets was less than both the
accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded. Contributions from PNC and, in the case of postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions cover all benefits paid under the
nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy as
shown in the table. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted. Key aspects of the PPACA which are
reflected in our financials include the excise tax on high-cost health plans beginning in 2018 and fees for the Transitional Reinsurance Program and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Fund. These provisions did not have a significant effect on our
postretirement medical liability or cost. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) was established by the PPACA. Congress appropriated funding of 5 billion for this temporary ERRP to provide financial assistance to employers, unions, and state
and local governments to help them maintain coverage for early retirees age 55 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare, including their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents. PNC submitted an application for reimbursement from the ERRP
in 2012 for the 2010 and 2011 plan years. In 2012, PNC received reimbursement of .9 million related to the 2011 plan year and received reimbursement of .6 million related to the 2010 plan year. 
 PNC P ENSION P LAN A SSETS Assets related to our qualified pension plan (the Plan) are held in trust (the Trust). Effective July 1, 2011, the trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon; prior to that date, the trustee was PNC
Bank, National Association, (PNC Bank, N.A). The Trust is exempt from tax pursuant to section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan is qualified under section 401(a) of the Code. Plan assets consist primarily of listed domestic
and international equity securities, U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, and real estate investments. Plan assets as of December 31, 2011 included 11 million of PNC common stock. The Plan held no PNC common stock
as of December 31, 2012. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Administrative Committee (the Administrative Committee) adopted the
Pension Plan Investment Policy Statement, including target allocations and allowable ranges, on August 13, 2008. On February 25, 2010, the Administrative Committee amended the investment policy to include a dynamic asset allocation
approach and also updated target allocation ranges for certain asset categories. On March 1, 2011, the Administrative Committee amended the investment policy to update the target allocation ranges for certain asset categories.

The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets is to: 

Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries, 

Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan,

Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and 

Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate
level of risk. Under the dynamic asset allocation strategy, scenarios are outlined in which the Administrative Committee
has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts based on factors such as the Plan s funded status, the Administrative Committee s view of return on equities relative to long term expectations, the Administrative
Committee s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to beneficiaries. Accordingly, the
allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility required by the dynamic allocation policy. The Plan s
specific investment objective is to meet or exceed the investment policy benchmark over the long term. The investment policy benchmark compares actual performance to a weighted market index, and measures the contribution of active investment
management and policy implementation. This investment objective is expected to be achieved over the long term (one or more market cycles) and is measured over rolling five-year periods. Total return calculations are time-weighted and are net of
investment-related fees and expenses. The asset strategy allocations for the Trust at the end of 2012 and 2011, and the target allocation
range at the end of 2012, by asset category, are as follows. Table 119: Asset Strategy Allocations

The asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in accordance with the investment objective of
each of the Plan s investment managers. Certain domestic equity investment managers utilize derivatives and fixed income securities as described in their Investment Management Agreements to achieve their investment objective under the
Investment Policy Statement. Other investment managers may invest in eligible securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets held as of
December 31, 2012 for equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other assets are 59 , 33 , 5 , and 3 , respectively. 
 We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target
percentages due to market movement, cash flows, investment manager performance and implementation of shifts under the dynamic allocation policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the
Trust. On the other hand, frequent rebalancing to the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically
rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above. In addition to being diversified across asset classes, the
Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust.
 The Administrative Committee selects investment managers for the Trust based on the contributions that their respective investment styles and
processes are expected to make to the investment performance of the overall portfolio. The managers Investment Objectives and Guidelines, which are a part of each manager s Investment Management Agreement, document performance
expectations and each manager s role in the portfolio. The Administrative Committee uses the Investment Objectives and Guidelines to establish, guide, control and measure the strategy and performance for each manager. 
 The purpose of investment manager guidelines is to: 

Establish the investment objective and performance standards for each manager, 

Provide the manager with the capability to evaluate the risks of all financial instruments or other assets in which the manager s account is
invested, and 

Prevent the manager from exposing its account to excessive levels of risk, undesired or inappropriate risk, or disproportionate concentration of risk.
 The guidelines also indicate which investments and strategies the manager is permitted to use to achieve its performance
objectives, and which investments and strategies it is prohibited from using.

Where public market investment strategies may include the use of derivatives and/or currency management,
language is incorporated in the managers guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s),
implement asset allocation changes in a cost-effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are to be used only in
circumstances where they offer the most efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile of the portfolio. BlackRock receives
compensation for providing investment management services. The Asset Management Group business segment also receives compensation for payor-related services, and received compensation for providing trustee/custodian services prior to July 1,
2011. Compensation for such services is paid by PNC and was not significant for 2012, 2011 or 2010. Non-affiliate service providers for the Trust are compensated from plan assets. F AIR V ALUE M EASUREMENTS As further
described in Note 9 Fair Value, GAAP establishes the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value follows. There have been no significant changes in the valuation methodologies used at December 31, 2012 compared
with those in place at December 31, 2011: 

Money market and mutual funds are valued at the net asset value of the shares held by the pension plan at year end. 

U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt, common stock and preferred stock are valued at the closing price reported on the active market
on which the individual securities are traded. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Such securities
are generally classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy but may be a level 3 depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the market for the security. 

The collective trust fund investments are valued based upon the units of such collective trust fund held by the plan at year end multiplied by the
respective unit value. The unit value of the collective trust fund is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted marked prices in an active market. The underlying investments of the collective trust funds consist
primarily of equity securities, debt obligations, short-term investments, and other marketable securities. Due to the nature of these securities, there are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions.

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 197 

Table of Contents 

Limited partnerships are valued by investment managers based on recent financial information used to estimate fair value. Other investments held by the
pension plan include derivative financial instruments and real estate, which are recorded at estimated fair value as determined by third-party appraisals and pricing models, and group annuity contracts, which are measured at fair value by
discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the credit-worthiness of the issuer.

These methods may result in fair value calculations that may not be indicative of net realizable values or
future fair values. Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

 The qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments
are paid from the Trust. Although the Plan is underfunded as of December 31, 2012, PNC s required qualified pension contribution for 2013 is expected to be zero based on the funding calculations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
For the other plans, total contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant contributions.

 The discount rates are determined independently for each plan by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid
under each plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. For this analysis, 10 of bonds with the highest yields and 40 with the lowest yields were removed from the bond universe. 
 The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested
in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. This assumption will be changed from 7.75 to 7.50 for determining 2013 net
periodic cost.

 D EFINED C ONTRIBUTION P LANS 
 We have a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all eligible PNC employees. Effective January 1, 2010, the employer matching contribution
under the PNC Incentive Savings Plan was reduced from a maximum of 6 to 4 of a participant s eligible compensation. Certain changes to the plan s eligibility and vesting requirements also became effective January 1, 2010. Employees
hired prior to January 1, 2010 became 100 vested immediately, while employees hired on or after January 1, 2010 become vested 100 after three years of service. Employee benefits expense related to defined contribution plans was 111
million in 2012, 105 million in 2011 and 90 million in 2010. We measure employee benefits expense as the fair value of the shares and cash contributed to the plan by PNC.

Under the PNC Incentive Savings Plan, employee contributions up to 4 of eligible compensation as defined
by the plan are matched 100 , subject to Code limitations. PNC will contribute a minimum matching contribution of 2,000 to employees who contribute at least 4 of eligible compensation every pay period during the year. This amount is prorated for
certain employees, including part-time employees and those who are eligible for the company match for less than a full year. Additionally, for participants who meet the annual deferral limit or the annual compensation limit before the end of a
calendar year, PNC makes a true-up matching contribution to ensure that such participants receive the full company match available. Effective January 1, 2012, in the case of both the minimum and true-up matching contributions, eligible
employees must remain employed on the last day of the applicable plan year in order to receive the contribution. Minimum matching contributions made with respect to the 2011 and 2012 plan years are immediately 100 vested. The plan is a 401(k) Plan
and includes a stock ownership (ESOP) feature. Employee contributions are invested in a number of mutual fund investment options available under the plan at the direction of the employee. Although employees were also historically permitted to direct
the investment of their contributions into the PNC common stock fund, this fund was frozen to future investments of such contributions effective January 1, 2010. All shares of PNC common stock held by the plan are part of the ESOP. Effective
January 1, 2011, employer matching contributions were made in cash. We also maintain a nonqualified supplemental savings plan for
certain employees, known as The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Supplemental Incentive Savings Plan. Effective January 1, 2012, the Supplemental Incentive Savings Plan was frozen to new participants and for any deferrals of amounts earned on
or after such date. It was replaced by a new plan called The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation and Incentive Plan (DCIP).

 We have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) that provide for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, incentive shares/performance units, restricted stock, restricted share units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated awards to executives and, other than incentive stock options, to non-employee
directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based compensation awards during the first quarter of the year. As of December 31,
2012, no stock appreciation rights were outstanding. Total compensation expense recognized related to all share-based payment arrangements during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately 101 million, 103 million and 107 million, respectively.
 N ONQUALIFIED S TOCK O PTIONS 
 Options are granted at exercise prices not less than the market value of common stock on the grant date. Generally, options become exercisable in
installments after the grant date. No option may be exercisable after 10 years from its grant date. Payment of the option exercise price may be in cash or by surrendering shares of common stock at market value on the exercise date. The exercise
price may be paid in previously owned shares. 
 
 O PTION P RICING A SSUMPTIONS 
 For purposes of computing stock option expense, we estimated the fair value of stock options primarily by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Option pricing models require the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are subjective. We used the following assumptions in the option
pricing models to determine 2012, 2011 and 2010 option expense: 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve, 

The dividend yield typically represents average yields over the previous three-year period, however starting with the grants made after the first
quarter of 2009, we used a yield indicative of our current dividend rate, 

Volatility is measured using the fluctuation in month-end closing stock prices over a period which corresponds with the average expected option life,
but in no case less than a five-year period, and 

The expected life assumption represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on a weighted-average of
historical option activity. Table 128: Option Pricing Assumptions

To determine stock-based compensation expense, the grant-date fair value is applied to the options granted
with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, options for 12,337,000 and 13,397,000 shares of common stock were exercisable at a weighted-average price of 106.08 and 118.21, respectively. The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 37 million, 4 million and 5 million. Cash received from option exercises under
all Incentive Plans for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately 118 million, 41 million and 15 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all Incentive Plans for 2012, 2011 and 2010
was approximately 41 million, 14 million and 5 million, respectively. There were no options granted in excess of market value in 2012,
2011 or 2010. Shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the Incentive Plans were 29,192,854 at December 31, 2012. Total shares of PNC common stock authorized for future issuance
under equity compensation plans totaled 30,537,674 shares at December 31, 2012, which includes shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) as described below. 
 During 2012, we issued approximately 1.7 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity. As with past exercise
activity, we currently intend to utilize primarily treasury stock for any future stock option exercises. Awards granted to non-employee directors in 2012, 2011 and 2010 include 25,620, 27,090 and 29,040 deferred stock units, respectively, awarded
under the Outside Directors Deferred Stock Unit Plan. A deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock, which requires liability accounting treatment until such awards are paid to the participants as cash. As there are no vesting or
service requirements on these awards, total compensation expense is recognized in full on awarded deferred stock units on the date of grant. 
 I NCENTIVE /P ERFORMANCE U NIT S HARE A WARDS AND 
R ESTRICTED S TOCK /U NIT A WARDS The fair value of nonvested
incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant. The value of certain incentive/performance unit share
awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period. The Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approves the final award payout
with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards. Restricted stock/unit

awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months. 
 Beginning in 2012, we incorporated several risk-related performance changes to certain incentive compensation programs. In addition to achieving certain
financial performance metrics relative to our peers, the final payout amount will be subject to a negative adjustment if PNC fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement. However, the P CC has the
discretion to reduce any or all of this negative adjustment under certain circumstances. These awards have a three-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash. Additionally, performance-based restricted
share units were granted in 2012 to certain of our executives in lieu of stock options, with generally the same terms and conditions as the 2011 awards of the same. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 60.68, 63.25 and 54.59 per share,
respectively. We recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program. Table 130: Nonvested Incentive/Performance Unit Share Awards and Restricted Stock/Unit Awards Rollforward

 In the chart above, the unit shares and related weighted-average grant-date fair value of the incentive/performance
awards exclude the effect of dividends on the underlying shares, as those dividends will be paid in cash. At December 31, 2012, there
was 86 million of unrecognized deferred compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plans. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a period of no longer than five
years. The total fair value of incentive/performance unit share and restricted stock/unit awards vested during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately 55 million, 52 million and 39 million, respectively.

 We granted cash-payable restricted share units to certain executives. The grants were made primarily as part of an annual bonus incentive deferral plan.
While there are time-based and other vesting criteria, there are no market or performance criteria associated with these awards. Compensation expense recognized related to these awards was recorded in prior periods as part of annual cash bonus
criteria. As of December 31, 2012, there were 804,389 of these cash-payable restricted share units outstanding. A summary of all

 B LACKROCK LTIP AND E XCHANGE A GREEMENTS 
 BlackRock adopted the 2002 LTIP program to help attract and retain qualified professionals. At that time, PNC agreed to transfer up to
4 million shares of BlackRock common stock to fund a portion of the 2002 LTIP program and future LTIP

programs approved by BlackRock s board of directors, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Approximately 1.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock were transferred by PNC
and distributed to LTIP participants in connection with the 2002 LTIP program. As previously reported, PNC entered into an Exchange Agreement
with BlackRock on December 26, 2008. On that same date, BlackRock entered into an Exchange Agreement with Merrill Lynch in anticipation of the consummation of the merger of Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch that occurred on
January 1, 2009. The PNC and Merrill Lynch Exchange Agreements restructured PNC s and Merrill Lynch s respective ownership of BlackRock common and preferred equity. The transactions that resulted from our agreement restructured
PNC s ownership of BlackRock equity without altering, to any meaningful extent, PNC s economic interest in BlackRock. PNC continues to be subject to the limitations on its voting rights in its existing agreements with BlackRock.
 The exchange contemplated by these agreements was completed on February 27, 2009. On that date, PNC s obligation to deliver its
BlackRock common shares to BlackRock under LTIP programs was also replaced with an obligation to deliver shares of BlackRock s Series C Preferred Stock as part of the exchange agreement. PNC acquired 2.9 million shares of Series C
Preferred Stock from BlackRock in exchange for common shares. For the 2007 LTIP programs, BlackRock achieved the earnings performance goals
as required and the awards vested on September 29, 2011. On that date, PNC transferred approximately 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock to BlackRock. Upon transfer, Other assets and Other liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet were reduced by 172 million, representing the fair value of the shares transferred. On January 31, 2013, we
transferred an additional 205,350 shares to BlackRock in connection with our obligation. After this transfer, we hold approximately 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which are available to fund our obligation in
connection with the BlackRock LTIP programs. PNC accounts for its BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock at fair value, which offsets the impact
of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock. The fair value of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the caption Other assets. Additional information regarding the
valuation of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included in Note 9 Fair Value.

N OTE 17 F INANCIAL D ERIVATIVES 
 We use derivative financial instruments (derivatives) primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and
reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. 
 Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or
another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract. Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not
recorded on the balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate (commonly LIBOR), security price, credit
spread or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments. All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting
agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Further discussion on
how derivatives are accounted for is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies. D ERIVATIVES D ESIGNATED 
 IN H EDGE R ELATIONSHIPS Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate risk as part of
our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging
the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and
losses on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Fair Value Hedges We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to
hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and borrowings caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. The specific products hedged may include bank notes, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, and senior and subordinated debt.
We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps, and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the

fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. The specific products hedged include US Treasury, government agency and other debt
securities. For these hedge relationships, we use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portion of the change in value of our fair value hedge derivatives resulted in
net losses of 54 million for 2012 compared with net losses of 17 million for 2011 and net losses of 31 million for 2010. Cash Flow
Hedges We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated
commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting
changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of interest receipts on the loans. In the 12 months that follow
December 31, 2012, we expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income net derivative gains of 264 million pretax, or 171 million after-tax, in association with interest receipts on the hedged
loans. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2012. The maximum length of time over which forecasted loan
cash flows are hedged is 8 years. We use statistical regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of these hedge relationships at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. 
 We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related
to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is typically minimal. Gains and losses on these
forward contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. In the 12 months that follow December 31, 2012, we expect to reclassify from the amount
currently reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net derivative gains of 78 million pretax, or 51 million after-tax, as adjustments of yield on investment securities. The maximum length of time we are hedging forecasted purchases is
three months. With respect to forecasted sale of securities, there were no amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2012.

There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
related to either cash flow hedge strategy. During 2012 and 2011, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified
to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur. The amount of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income for 2012 and 2011 was not material to PNC s results of operations. 
 Net Investment Hedges We enter
into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. Dollar (USD) net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of
derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness. During 2012 and 2011, there was no net investment hedge
ineffectiveness. Further detail regarding the notional amounts, fair values and gains and losses recognized related to derivatives used in
fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedge strategies is presented in the tables that follow. D ERIVATIVES 
N OT D ESIGNATED IN H EDGE R ELATIONSHIPS We also enter into
derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. The majority of these derivatives are used to manage risk related to
residential and commercial mortgage banking activities and are considered economic hedges. Although these derivatives are used to hedge risk, they are not designated as accounting hedges because the contracts they are hedging are typically also
carried at fair value on the balance sheet, resulting in symmetrical accounting treatment for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item. 
 Our residential mortgage banking activities consist of originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans that will be sold in
the secondary market, and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the loans and commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell
mortgage-backed securities, as well as US Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to economically hedge them are included in Residential mortgage noninterest
income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 
 
 We typically retain the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that we sell. Residential
mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value influenced primarily by changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures,
swaps, options (including caps, floors, and swaptions), and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in Residential
mortgage noninterest income. Certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value. These loans, and the related
loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. In addition we originate loans for sale into the secondary market that are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these
loans and commitments from changes in fair value due to interest rate risk and credit risk include forward loan sale contracts, interest rate swaps, and credit default swaps. Gains and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are included in
Other noninterest income. Derivatives used to economically hedge the change in value of commercial mortgage servicing rights include interest rate swaps and futures. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included in Corporate Services noninterest
income. The residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as derivatives are
valued based on the estimated fair value of the underlying loan and the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right. 
 We offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps,
interest rate caps, floors, swaptions, foreign exchange contracts, and equity contracts. We primarily manage our market risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and
losses on customer-related derivatives are included in Other noninterest income. The derivatives portfolio also includes derivatives used for
other risk management activities. These derivatives are entered into based on stated risk management objectives and include credit default swaps (CDS) used to mitigate the risk of economic loss on a portion of our loan exposure. We also sold loss
protection to mitigate the net premium cost and the impact of mark-to-market accounting on CDS purchases to hedge the loan portfolio. The fair values of these derivatives typically are based on related credit spreads. Gains and losses on the
derivatives entered into for other risk management are included in Other noninterest income.

Included in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, and other risk management portfolios are
written interest-rate caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the counterparty if the underlying market interest rate
rises above or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. 
 In connection with sales of a portion of our Visa Class B common shares in 2012, we entered into swap agreements with the purchaser in which we will make
or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of Class B into Class A common shares and to make payments calculated by reference to the market price of the Class A common shares. The fair value of the swaps,
included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was 43 million at December 31, 2012. Further detail regarding the
derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the tables that follow. D ERIVATIVE 
C OUNTERPARTY C REDIT R ISK By entering into derivative contracts we are exposed to credit
risk. We seek to minimize credit risk through internal credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting agreements and collateral requirements. We generally enter into transactions with counterparties that carry high quality
credit ratings. Nonperformance risk including credit risk is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value. We generally have
established agreements with our major derivative dealer counterparties that provide for exchanges of marketable securities or cash to collateralize either party s positions. At December 31, 2012, we held cash, U.S. government securities
and mortgage-backed securities totaling 1.2 billion under these agreements. We pledged cash and U.S. government securities of 978 million under these agreements. To the extent not netted against derivative fair values under a master netting
agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other borrowed funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that
involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer s credit quality. We periodically enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to
generate revenue. We will make/receive payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain derivative swap contracts. Risk participation agreements are included in the derivatives table that follows. Our
exposure related to risk participations where we sold protection is discussed in the Credit Derivatives section below. 
 C ONTINGENT F EATURES Some of PNC s derivative instruments contain provisions that require PNC s debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. If PNC s debt
ratings were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on
derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent
features that were in a net liability position on December 31, 2012 was 1.1 billion for which PNC had posted collateral of 942 million in the normal course of business. The maximum amount of collateral PNC would have been required to post if
the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2012, would be an additional 139 million.

 C REDIT D ERIVATIVES The credit derivative underlying is based on the credit risk of a specific entity, entities, or an index. As discussed above, we enter into credit derivatives, specifically credit default swaps and risk
participation agreements, as part of our commercial mortgage banking hedging activities and for customer and other risk management purposes. Detail regarding credit default swaps and risk participations sold follows.

 We enter into credit default swaps under which we buy loss protection from or sell loss protection to a counterparty for
the occurrence of a credit event related to a referenced entity or index. The maximum amount we would be required to pay under the credit default swaps in which we sold protection, assuming all referenced underlyings experience a credit event at a
total loss, without recoveries, was 94 million at December 31, 2011.

Risk Participation Agreements We have sold risk participation agreements with terms ranging from less than 1 year to 24 years. We will be required to make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to
perform under certain derivative swap contracts with third parties. Table 141: Risk Participation Agreements

 Assuming all underlying swap counterparties defaulted at December 31, 2012, the exposure from these agreements would be 143 million based on the
fair value of the underlying swaps, compared with 145 million at December 31, 2011.

 Our Series B preferred stock is cumulative and is not redeemable at our option. Annual dividends on Series B preferred
stock total 1.80 per share. Holders of Series B preferred stock are entitled to 8 votes per share, which is equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible.

after February 1, 2013 at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

Our Series O preferred stock was issued on July 27, 2011, when we issued one
million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100 th 
interest in a share of our Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series O for gross proceeds before commissions and expenses of 1 billion. Dividends are payable when, as, and if declared by our board of directors or an
authorized committee of our board, semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year until August 1, 2021 at a rate of 6.75 . After that date, dividends will be payable on February 1, May 1, August 1 and
November 1 of each year beginning on November 1, 2021 at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.678 per annum. The Series O preferred stock is redeemable at our option on or after August 1, 2021 and at our option within 90 days of a
regulatory capital treatment event as defined in the designations. Our Series P preferred stock was issued on
April 24, 2012, when we issued 60 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/4,000 th interest in a share of our Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series P for gross proceeds before commissions and expenses of 1.5 billion. Dividends are payable when, as,
and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee of our board, quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year. Dividends are paid for each dividend period to, but excluding, May 1,
2022 at a rate of 6.125 and for each dividend period from and including May 1, 2022 at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 4.0675 per annum. The Series P preferred stock is redeemable at our option on or after May 1, 2022 and at our
option within 90 days of a regulatory capital treatment event as defined in the designations. Our Series Q preferred
stock was issued on September 21, 2012, when we issued 18 million depositary shares, each representing a
1/4,000 th interest in a share of our 5.375 Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q for gross proceeds before commissions and expenses of 450 million. Dividends are payable when, as, and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee of our board, quarterly on March 1,
June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year at a rate of 5.375 . The Series Q preferred stock is redeemable at our option on or after December 1, 2017 and at our option within 90 days of a regulatory capital treatment event as
defined in the designations. We issued additional Series Q Preferred Stock on October 9, 2012, in connection with the issuance of an additional 1.2 million depositary shares for gross proceeds before commissions and expenses of 30
million, when the underwriters exercised a portion of their over-allotment option. We have authorized but unissued Series H, I, and J
preferred stock. As described in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities, under the terms of two of the hybrid capital vehicles we issued that currently qualify as capital for regulatory purposes (the Trust

II Securities and the Trust III Securities), these Trust Securities are automatically exchangeable into shares of PNC preferred stock (Series I and Series J, respectively) in each case under
certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank, N.A. and upon the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Series preferred stock of PNC REIT Corp. is also automatically exchangeable
under similar conditions into shares of PNC Series H preferred stock. As a part of the National City transaction, we established the PNC
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series M (the Series M Preferred Stock), which mirrored in all material respects the former National City Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E. On December 10, 2012, PNC issued 500.1
million (5,001 shares) of the Series M Preferred Stock as required under a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement between PNC and National City Preferred Capital Trust I (the Trust dated January 30, 2008. PNC immediately redeemed all
 500.1 million of the Series M Preferred Stock from the Trust and the Trust in turn redeemed all 500.0 million outstanding of its 12 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal APEX and all .1 million of its Common Securities. 
 The replacement capital covenants with respect to the Normal APEX Securities, our Series M shares and our 6,000,000 of Depositary Shares (each
representing 1/4,000th of an interest in a share of our 9.875 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series L) were terminated on November 5, 2010 as a result of a successful consent solicitation. 
 In connection with the redemption of the Series N Preferred Stock, we accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series N
Preferred Stock, recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of 250 million during the first quarter of 2010 and paid dividends of 89 million to the US Treasury. This resulted in a noncash reduction in net income attributable to common
shareholders and related basic and diluted earnings per share. 

W ARRANTS We have outstanding 16,885,192 warrants, each to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise price of 67.33 per share. These warrants were sold by the US Treasury in a secondary public offering
that closed on May 5, 2010 after the US Treasury exchanged its TARP Warrant (issued on December 31, 2008 under the TARP Capital Purchase Program in relation to the Series N preferred stock referred to above) for 16,885,192 warrants. These
warrants expire December 31, 2018. O THER S HAREHOLDERS E QUITY 
M ATTERS We have a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Holders of preferred stock and PNC common stock may
participate in the plan, which provides that additional shares of common stock may be purchased at market value with reinvested dividends and voluntary cash payments. Common shares issued pursuant to this plan were: 422,642 shares in 2012, 379,459
shares in 2011 and 149,088 shares in 2010. At December 31, 2012, we had reserved approximately 108.4 million common shares to be
issued in connection with certain stock plans and the conversion of certain debt and equity securities. Effective October 4, 2007, our
Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. A maximum of 21.551 million shares remained available for repurchase
under this program at December 31, 2012. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. We repurchased 3.2 million shares in 2012 and did not repurchase any shares during 2011 or 2010
under this program.

 The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2027 to 2032. The state net operating loss carryforwards will
expire from 2013 to 2031. The majority of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2032. The federal net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards above are substantially from the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and are subject to a federal annual Section 382 limitation of 119 million under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and acquired state operating
loss carryforwards of 1.3 billion are subject to similar limitations that exist for state tax purposes. The company also has built-in-loss carryforwards remaining at December 31, 2012 of approximately 277 million from that same acquisition
which are subject to the same annual limitation. It is anticipated that the company will be able to fully utilize its carryforwards for federal tax purposes, but a valuation allowance has been recorded against certain state tax carryforwards as
reflected above. 

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no undistributed earnings of non-US subsidiaries for which
deferred US income taxes had not been provided. Retained earnings at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 included 117 million in
allocations for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. Under current law, if certain subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be
subject to Federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of 176 million at
December 31, 2012 and 209 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, 98 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax rate. 
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

 It is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease in the next twelve
months due to completion of tax authorities exams or the expiration of statutes of limitations. Management estimates that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by 110 million within the next twelve months. 
 Examinations are substantially completed for PNC s consolidated federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 and there are no outstanding unresolved
issues. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently examining PNC s 2009 and 2010 returns. National City s consolidated federal income tax returns through 2008 have been audited by the IRS. Certain adjustments remain under review by
the IRS Appeals Division for years 2003 through 2008.

PNC files tax returns in most states and some non-U.S. jurisdictions each year and is under continuous
examination by various state taxing authorities. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local and non-U.S. income tax examinations by taxing authorities for periods before 2003. For all open audits, any potential adjustments have
been considered in establishing our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2012. Our policy is to classify interest
and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense. For 2012, we had expense of 4 million of gross interest and penalties increasing income tax expense. The total accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011 was 93 million and 81 million, respectively. 
 N OTE 22 R EGULATORY M ATTERS 
 We are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such regulatory
authorities. The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business
initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution s
capital strength. The minimum US regulatory capital ratios under Basel I are 4 for Tier 1 risk-based, 8 for total risk-based and 4 for leverage. To qualify as well capitalized, regulators require banks to maintain capital ratios of at
least 6 for Tier 1 risk-based, 10 for total risk-based and 5 for leverage. To be well capitalized, a bank holding company must maintain capital ratios of at least 6 Tier 1 risk-based and 10 for total risk-based. At December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2011, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. met the well capitalized capital ratio requirements based on US regulatory capital ratio requirements under Basel I.

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank,
which may be impacted by the following: 

Capital needs, 

Laws and regulations, 

Corporate policies, 

Contractual restrictions, and 

Other factors. Also,
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory
approval was approximately 1.5 billion at December 31, 2012. Under federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend credit to,
or engage in other types of covered transactions (including the purchase of assets) with, the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not substantially the same as comparable transactions with
nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not extend credit to, or engage in a covered transaction with, the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the
parent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds 10 of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the bank s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company and all non-bank
subsidiaries exceeds 20 of the capital and surplus of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the thresholds
varying based on the type of assets serving as collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations. Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). At December 31, 2012, the balance outstanding at the FRB was 3.5
billion. 
 N OTE 23 L EGAL P ROCEEDINGS 
 We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when
information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed
circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings Disclosed Matters, which are those matters disclosed in this Note 23). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or

Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K 219 

Table of Contents 

ranges of possible losses, as of December 31, 2012, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in an aggregate amount of up to approximately 450 million. The
estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to
the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our
exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount. The aggregate
estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter, as we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that it is reasonably possible that we could incur or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the
matters disclosed for one or more of the following reasons. In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. In many legal proceedings, various factors exacerbate this inherent unpredictability, including, among others, one or more
of the following: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a
class action, how the class will be defined; the plaintiff is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages; the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful
settlement discussions; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be
shared among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we
could incur. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters.
The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under Other. We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff s pleadings or
other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment
as to any currently appropriate accrual. 
 
 Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not
consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any
estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses. Interchange Litigation 
 Beginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were filed against Visa , MasterCard , and several
major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into PNC) and its subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC Bank, N.A.). The cases have been
consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master File
No. 1:05-md-1720-JG-JO). Those cases naming National City were brought as class actions on behalf of all persons or business entities who have accepted Visa or Master Card . The
plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S. and trade associations, allege, among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the prices for general purpose card network services and otherwise imposed
unreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange fees, in violation of the antitrust laws. In January 2009, the plaintiffs filed amended and supplemental complaints adding, among other things, allegations that the
restructuring of Visa and MasterCard, each of which included an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws. In their complaints, the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust
laws) and attorneys fees. In July 2012, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding with the class plaintiffs and an
agreement in principle with certain individual plaintiffs with respect to a settlement of these cases, under which the defendants will collectively pay approximately 6.6 billion to the class and individual settling plaintiffs and have agreed to
changes in the terms applicable to their respective card networks (including an eight-month reduction in default credit interchange rates). The parties entered into a definitive agreement with respect to this settlement in October 2012. The court
granted preliminary approval of this settlement in November 2012. The settlement remains subject to, among other things, final court approval. As a result of the previously funded litigation escrow (described in Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees),
which will cover substantially all of our share of the Visa portion, we anticipate no material financial impact from the monetary amount of this settlement. National City and National City Bank entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. All of the

Table of Contents 

litigation against Visa is also subject to the indemnification obligations described in Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees. PNC Bank, N.A. is not named a defendant in any of the Visa or
MasterCard related antitrust litigation nor was it initially a party to the judgment or loss sharing agreements, but it has been subject to these indemnification obligations and became responsible for National City Bank s position in the
litigation and responsibilities under the agreements upon completion of the merger of National City Bank into PNC Bank, N.A. In March 2011, we entered into a MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with MasterCard and other financial
institution defendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa, MasterCard and other financial institution defendants. If there is a resolution of all claims against all defendants, the
Omnibus Agreement, in substance, apportions that resolution into a Visa portion and a MasterCard portion, with the Visa portion being two-thirds and the MasterCard portion being one-third. This apportionment only applies in the case of either a
global settlement involving all defendants or an adverse judgment against the defendants, to the extent that damages either are related to the merchants inter-network conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific MasterCard or
Visa conduct or damages. The MasterCard portion (or any MasterCard-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement among MasterCard and PNC and the other
financial institution defendants that are parties to this agreement. The responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under the pre-existing indemnification
responsibilities and judgment and loss sharing agreements. CBNV Mortgage Litigation 
 Between 2001 and 2003, on behalf of either individual plaintiffs or proposed classes of plaintiffs, several separate lawsuits were filed in state and
federal courts against Community Bank of Northern Virginia (CBNV) and other defendants asserting claims arising from second mortgage loans made to the plaintiffs. CBNV was merged into one of Mercantile Bankshares Corporation s banks before PNC
acquired Mercantile in 2007. The state lawsuits were removed to federal court and, with the lawsuits that had been filed in federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, currently under the caption In re: Community Bank of Northern Virginia Lending Practices Litigation (No. 03-0425 (W.D. Pa.), MDL No. 1674). In January 2008, the Pennsylvania
district court issued an order sending back to the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, for Wake County, North Carolina the claims of two proposed class members. These claims are asserted in a case originally filed in 2001 and
captioned Bumpers, et al. v. Community Bank of Northern Virginia (01-CVS-011342).

MDL Proceedings in Pennsylvania . In October 2011, the plaintiffs filed a joint consolidated amended
class action complaint covering all of the class action lawsuits pending in this proceeding. The amended complaint names CBNV, another bank, and purchasers of loans originated by CBNV and the other bank (including the Residential Funding Company,
LLC) as defendants. (In May 2012, the Residential Funding Company, LLC filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.) The principal allegations in the amended complaint are that a group of persons and entities collectively characterized as the
 Shumway/Bapst Organization referred prospective second residential mortgage loan borrowers to CBNV and the other bank, that CBNV and the other bank charged these borrowers improper title and loan fees at loan closings, that the
disclosures provided to the borrowers at loan closings were inaccurate, and that CBNV and the other bank paid some of the loan fees to the Shumway/Bapst Organization as purported kickbacks for the referrals. The amended complaint asserts
claims for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as amended by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
 The amended complaint seeks to certify a class of all borrowers who obtained a second residential non-purchase money mortgage loan, secured
by their principal dwelling, from either CBNV or the other defendant bank, the terms of which made the loan subject to HOEPA. The plaintiffs allege that there are approximately 50,000 members of this class. They seek, among other things, unspecified
damages (including treble damages under RICO and RESPA), rescission of loans, declaratory and injunctive relief, interest, and attorneys fees. In November 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was argued
in October 2012. The court has not yet ruled on this motion. North Carolina Proceedings . The plaintiffs in Bumpers make similar
allegations to those included in the amended complaint in the MDL proceedings. Following the remand to North Carolina state court, the plaintiffs in Bumpers sought to represent a class of North Carolina borrowers in state court proceedings in
North Carolina. The plaintiffs claim that this class consists of approximately 650 borrowers. The district court in Pennsylvania handling the MDL proceedings enjoined class proceedings in Bumpers in March 2008. In April 2008, the North
Carolina superior court granted the Bumpers plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on their individual claims and awarded them approximately 11,000 each plus interest. CBNV appealed the grant of the motion for summary judgment. In
September 2011, the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the granting of the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the judgment on the plaintiffs claim that they paid a loan discount
fee but were not provided a loan discount. It reversed the judgment on the plaintiffs claim that they were overcharged for settlement services and remanded that claim

for trial. The court also held that, in light of the Pennsylvania district court s injunction against class proceedings having been vacated in September 2010, the trial court may on remand
consider the issue of class certification. In August 2012, the North Carolina Supreme Court granted our petition for discretionary review of the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals. The appeal was argued in January 2013. The court has
not yet decided the appeal. Overdraft Litigation Beginning in October 2009, PNC Bank, National City Bank and RBC Bank (USA) have been named in lawsuits brought as class actions relating to the manner in which they charged overdraft fees on ATM and debit
transactions to customers and related matters. Status of MDL Cases. Three pending lawsuits naming PNC Bank, one naming National City
Bank and two naming RBC Bank (USA), along with similar lawsuits against numerous other banks, have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the MDL Court under
the caption In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation (MDL No. 2036, Case No. 1:09-MD-02036-JLK ). A consolidated amended complaint was filed in December 2010 that consolidated all of the claims in these four MDL Court cases. The
first case against RBC Bank (USA) pending in the MDL Court Dasher v. RBC Bank (10-cv-22190-JLK)) was filed in July 2010 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The other case against RBC Bank (USA) Avery
v. RBC Bank (Case No. 10-cv-329)) was originally filed in North Carolina state court in July 2010 and was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina before being transferred to the MDL Court. An
amended complaint was filed in Avery in August 2010. All of the cases now pending in the MDL Court seek to certify multi-state classes
of customers for the common law claims described below (covering all states in which PNC Bank, National City Bank and RBC Bank (USA) had retail branch operations during the class periods), and subclasses of PNC Bank customers with accounts in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey branches, of National City Bank customers with accounts in Illinois branches, and of RBC Bank (USA) customers with accounts in North Carolina branches, with each subclass being asserted for purposes of claims under those
states consumer protection statutes. No class periods are stated in any of the complaints, other than for the applicable statutes of limitations, which vary by state and claim. PNC Bank s motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint with respect to the cases pending against it and National City Bank in the MDL Court was denied in March 2011. In December 2011, the
plaintiffs in cases pending against PNC Bank and National City Bank in the MDL Court moved for class certification. In light of the settlement of a

separate lawsuit on behalf of National City Bank customers, the National City Bank plaintiffs did not move for class certification on behalf of National City Bank customers. As to PNC Bank, the
plaintiffs moved for class certification in accordance with their consolidated amended complaint, except that they did not seek a class as to the conversion claims described below. In May 2012, the court granted plaintiffs motion for class
certification. In June 2012, PNC Bank reached an agreement to settle the three cases pending against it in the MDL Court for 90 million.
This settlement received preliminary approval of the court in January 2013, and remains subject to, among other things, notice to the class and final court approval. The customer agreements with the RBC Bank (USA) plaintiffs contain arbitration provisions. RBC Bank (USA) s original motion in Dasher to compel arbitration under these provisions was denied by
the MDL Court. This denial was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. While this appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in AT T Mobility v. Concepcion , following which the
court of appeals vacated the MDL Court s denial of the arbitration motion and remanded to the MDL Court for further consideration in light of the Concepcion decision. RBC Bank (USA) s motion to compel arbitration, now covering both
 Dasher and Avery , was denied in January 2013. We have appealed the denial of the motion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Status of Non-MDL Case. In December 2010, an additional lawsuit Henry v. PNC Bank, National Association (No. GD-10-022974)) was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania on behalf of all current citizens of Pennsylvania who are domiciled in Pennsylvania who had or have a PNC checking or debit account used primarily for personal, family or household purposes and who incurred overdraft and related fees on
transactions resulting from the methodology of posting transactions from December 8, 2004 through August 14, 2010. We filed preliminary objections seeking dismissal of each of the claims in this lawsuit in March 2011. In January 2012, the
court ruled on our preliminary objections, dismissing several claims but overruling our objections with respect to claims for breach of contract and the duty of good faith and fair dealing and for violation of Pennsylvania s consumer protection
statute. Nature of Claims. The complaints in each of these lawsuits allege that the banks engaged in unlawful practices in assessing
overdraft fees arising from electronic point-of-sale and ATM debits. The principal practice challenged in these lawsuits is the banks purportedly common policy of posting debit transactions on a daily basis from highest amount to lowest
amount, thereby allegedly inflating the number of overdraft fees assessed. Other practices challenged include the failure to decline to honor debit card transactions where the account has insufficient funds to cover the transactions.

In the consolidated amended complaint against PNC Bank in the MDL Court, the plaintiffs asserted claims for
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; unconscionability; conversion; unjust enrichment; and violation of the consumer protection statutes of Pennsylvania, Illinois and New Jersey. In the Dasher and Avery complaints ,
 the plaintiffs assert the same claims, except the state consumer protection statutory claims relate to the North Carolina statute and the Avery complaint does not make claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing or
for conversion. In the Henry case, the remaining claims are for breach of contract and the duty of good faith and fair dealing and for violation of Pennsylvania s consumer protection statute. In their complaints, the plaintiffs seek,
among other things, restitution of overdraft fees paid, unspecified actual and punitive damages (with actual damages, in some cases, trebled under state law), pre-judgment interest, attorneys fees, and declaratory relief finding the overdraft
policies to be unfair and unconscionable. Fulton Financial In 2009, Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. filed lawsuits against PNC Capital Markets, LLC and NatCity Investments, Inc. in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania arising out of
Fulton s purchase of auction rate certificates (ARCs) through PNC and NatCity. Each of the lawsuits alleges violations of the Pennsylvania Securities Act, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, common law fraud, and
aiding and abetting common law fraud in connection with the purchase of the ARCs by Fulton. Specifically, Fulton alleges that, as a result of the decline of financial markets in 2007 and 2008, the market for ARCs became illiquid; that PNC and
NatCity knew or should have known of the increasing threat of the ARC market becoming illiquid; and that PNC and NatCity did not inform Fulton of this increasing threat, but allowed Fulton to continue to purchase ARCs, to Fulton s detriment. In
its complaints, Fulton alleges that it then held ARCs purchased through PNC for a price of more than 123 million and purchased through NatCity for a price of more than 175 million. In each complaint, Fulton seeks, among other things, unspecified
actual and punitive damages, rescission, attorneys fees and interest. In the case against PNC Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. v.
PNC Capital Markets, LLC (CI 09-10838)), PNC filed preliminary objections to Fulton s complaint, which were denied. NatCity removed the case against it to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Fulton
Financial Advisors, N.A. v. NatCity Investments, Inc . (No. 5:09-cv-04855)), and in November 2009 filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The court has not yet ruled on this motion. FHLB In October 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago brought a lawsuit in
the Circuit Court of Cook County,

Illinois, against numerous financial companies, including The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as successor in interest to National City Corporation, and PNC Investments LLC, as successor in
interest to NatCity Investments, Inc. Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Bank of America Funding Corp., et al. (Case No. 10CH45033)). The complaint alleges that the defendants have liability to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in
a variety of capacities (in the case of the National City entities, as underwriters) under Illinois state securities law and common law in connection with the alleged purchase of private-label mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Home Loan
Bank. According to the complaint, the Federal Home Loan Bank purchased approximately 3.3 billion in mortgage-backed securities in total in transactions addressed by the complaint, approximately 345 million of which was allegedly in transactions
involving the National City entities. The complaint alleges misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the sales of the mortgage-backed securities in question. In its complaint, the Federal Home Loan Bank seeks, among other things,
rescission, unspecified damages, interest, and attorneys fees. In November 2010, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In January 2011, the district court remanded the case
to the Circuit Court of Cook County. The plaintiff amended its complaint in March 2011 and filed a corrected amended complaint in April 2011. The corrected amended complaint does not identify any additional transaction for which the plaintiff seeks
recovery from PNC nor does it add any additional substantive allegations. In May 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the corrected amended complaint. The motion was denied in September 2012. 
 Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund 
 In July 2010, PNC completed the sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing PNC GIS to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BNY
Mellon ), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated February 1, 2010. In July 2009, the liquidators of the Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited Weavering issued a Plenary Summons in the High Court, Dublin, Ireland, in
connection with a European subsidiary of PNC GIS s provision of administration services to Weavering. The Plenary Summons was served on the PNC GIS subsidiary (GIS Europe) on or about June 30, 2010. In May 2011, the liquidator served a
Notice of Intention to Proceed and Statement of Claim, which alleges, among other things, that GIS Europe breached its contractual duties to Weavering as well as an alleged duty of care to Weavering, and investors in Weavering, and makes claims of
breach of the administration and accounting services agreement, negligence, gross negligence, breach of duty, misrepresentation and negligent misstatement. The statement of claim further alleges that investors in Weavering lost approximately
 282,000,000 and that, in addition, expended approximately 98,000,000 in brokerage and exchange commissions, interest, and fees as a result of the transactions at issue. The statement of claim seeks, among other things, damages, costs,
and interest. In

January 2012, upon application by GIS Europe, the court issued a judgment ordering a hearing on certain preliminary issues (a modular trial ). In March 2012, the plaintiff appealed
this judgment to the Supreme Court of Ireland. In December 2012, the Supreme Court reversed the order of the High Court and directed that no modular trial take place at this stage of the proceedings. We now expect that the matter will proceed with
full discovery and various pre-trial steps, after which it will be set for trial. In May 2011, BNY Mellon provided notice to PNC of an
indemnification claim pursuant to the stock purchase agreement related to this litigation. PNC s responsibility for this litigation is subject to the terms and limitations included in the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase
agreement. 365/360 Litigation In December 2008, a lawsuit was filed as a class action against National City Bank in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio DK D Properties, LLC v. National City Bank (Case no. 08
cv 680078)) alleging breach of contract arising from the use of the 365/360 method of interest computation in certain commercial promissory notes. The plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of certain Ohio commercial borrowers of National
City Bank. The plaintiffs alleged that they obtained fixed or variable rate commercial loans from National City Bank pursuant to promissory notes or loan agreements setting forth annual or per annum interest rates, that the bank s use of the
365/360 method of calculation of interest caused the borrower to pay interest over a calendar year at a higher rate than the per annum rate stated in the promissory notes, and that this was a breach of the terms of the promissory notes. The
plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, and attorneys fees. In December 2011,
the court granted National City Bank s motion to stay the case pending the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in JNT Properties, LLC v. KeyBank National Association (Case No. 11-1392), which, although neither PNC Bank nor National
City Bank were parties, presented many of the same issues as those in DK D Properties . In November 2012, following the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in JNT Properties , the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint
without prejudice. False Claims Act Lawsuit PNC Bank was named as a defendant, along with other lenders, in a qui tam lawsuit brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by two individuals on behalf of the United States
under the federal False Claims Act United States ex rel. Bibby Donnelly v. Wells Fargo, et al . (1:06-CV-0547-AT)). The lawsuit was originally filed under seal, with a second amended complaint filed in June 2011. The second amended
complaint was unsealed by the district court in October 2011. In the second amended complaint, the

plaintiffs, who alleged that they are officers of a mortgage broker, allege that several mortgage originators, including entities affiliated with PNC Bank s predecessor, National City Bank,
made false statements to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in order to obtain loan guarantees by the VA under its Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRL) program. Under that program, the VA guarantees refinancing loans made to
veterans if the loans meet program requirements, one of which limits the type and amount of fees that can be charged to borrowers by lenders. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the defendants charged impermissible fees to borrowers
under the VA program and then made false statements to the VA concerning such fees in violation of the civil False Claims Act. The plaintiffs alleged that, by doing so, National City Bank and the other defendants caused the VA to pay, among other
costs, amounts in respect of the loan guarantees to which the defendants were not entitled. On their behalf and on behalf of the United States, the plaintiffs sought, among other things, unspecified damages equal to the loss the defendants allegedly
caused the United States (including treble damages under the False Claims Act), statutory civil penalties between 5,500 and 11,000 per false claim made by the defendants, injunctive relief against submission of false claims to the United States
and imposing unallowable charges against veterans participating in the IRRRL program, and attorneys fees. In April 2012, PNC Bank reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle this lawsuit. In October 2012, the United States provided its
consent to the settlement. The settlement became final in December 2012. The amount of the settlement was not material to PNC and had been previously fully accrued. Captive Mortgage Reinsurance Litigation In December 2011, a lawsuit White, et
al. v. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 11-7928)) was filed against PNC (as successor in interest to National City Corporation and several of its subsidiaries) and several mortgage insurance companies in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit, which was brought as a class action, alleges that National City structured its program of reinsurance of private mortgage insurance in such a way as to avoid a true
transfer of risk from the mortgage insurers to National City s captive reinsurer. The plaintiffs allege that the payments from the mortgage insurers to the captive reinsurer constitute kickbacks, referral payments, or unearned fee splits
prohibited under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), as well as common law unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs claim, among other things, that from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2010 National City s captive reinsurer
collected from the mortgage insurance company defendants at least 219 million as its share of borrowers private mortgage insurance premiums and that its share of paid claims during this period was approximately 12 million. The plaintiffs
seek to certify a nationwide class of all persons who obtained residential mortgage loans originated, funded or originated through correspondent lending by National City or any of its

subsidiaries or affiliates between January 1, 2004 and the present and, in connection with these mortgage loans, purchased private mortgage insurance and whose residential 
 mortgage loans were included within National City s captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, statutory damages
under RESPA (which include treble damages), restitution of reinsurance premiums collected, disgorgement of profits, and attorneys fees. In August 2012, the district court directed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which the
plaintiffs filed in September 2012. In November 2012, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Residential Mortgage-Backed
Securities Indemnification Demands We have received indemnification demands from several entities sponsoring residential
mortgage-backed securities and their affiliates where purchasers of the securities have brought litigation against the sponsors and other parties involved in the securitization transactions. National City Mortgage had sold whole loans to the
sponsors or their affiliates that were allegedly included in certain of these securitization transactions. According to the indemnification demands, the plaintiffs claims in these lawsuits are based on alleged misstatements and omissions in
the offering documents for these transactions. The indemnification demands assert that agreements governing the sale of these loans or the securitization transactions to which National City Mortgage is a party require us to indemnify the sponsors
and their affiliates for losses suffered in connection with these lawsuits. At present, there has been no determination that the parties seeking indemnification have any liability to the plaintiffs in these lawsuits. 
 Other Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries PNC is the subject of investigations, audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our banking, securities and other financial services businesses, in
some cases as part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants. Over the last few years, we have experienced an increase in regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries. Areas of current regulatory
or governmental inquiry with respect to PNC include consumer financial protection, fair lending, mortgage origination and servicing, mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance, municipal finance activities, and participation in government insurance
or guarantee programs, some of which are described below. These inquiries, including those described below, may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs. 

One area of significant regulatory and governmental focus has been mortgage lending and servicing. Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative

and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in this area. PNC has received inquiries from, or is the subject of investigations by, a broad range of governmental, legislative and
regulatory authorities relating to our activities in this area and is cooperating with these investigations and inquiries. As a result of the number and range of authorities conducting the investigations and inquiries, as well as the nature of these
types of investigations and inquiries, among other factors, PNC cannot at this time predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect on PNC from potential governmental, legislative or regulatory actions arising out of these investigations and
inquiries. 

In April 2011, as a result of a publicly-disclosed interagency horizontal review of residential mortgage servicing operations at fourteen federally
regulated mortgage servicers, PNC entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and PNC Bank entered into a consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Collectively, these consent orders
describe certain foreclosure-related practices and controls that the regulators found to be deficient and require PNC and PNC Bank to, among other things, develop and implement plans and programs to enhance PNC s residential mortgage servicing
and foreclosure processes, retain an independent consultant to review certain residential mortgage foreclosure actions, take certain remedial actions, and oversee compliance with the orders and the new plans and programs. The two orders do not
foreclose the potential for civil money penalties from either of these regulators, although the range of potential penalties communicated to PNC by the regulators in connection with the agreements described below is not material to PNC.
 In connection with these orders, PNC established a Compliance Committee of the Boards of PNC and PNC Bank
to monitor and coordinate PNC s and PNC Bank s implementation of the commitments under the orders. PNC and PNC Bank are executing Action Plans designed to meet the requirements of the orders. Consistent with the orders, PNC also engaged an
independent consultant to conduct a review of certain residential foreclosure actions, including those identified through borrower complaints, and identify whether any remedial actions for borrowers are necessary. This review was on-going throughout
2012.

In early 2013, PNC and PNC Bank, along with twelve other residential mortgage servicers,
reached agreements with the OCC and the Federal Reserve to amend these consent orders. Pursuant to the amended consent orders, in order to accelerate the remediation process, PNC agreed to make a payment of approximately 70 million for distribution
to potentially affected borrowers in the review population and to provide approximately 111 million in additional loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention relief, which may be satisfied pursuant to the amended consent orders by a variety of
borrower relief actions or by additional cash payments or resource commitments to borrower counseling or education. Fulfillment of these commitments will satisfy all of PNC s and PNC Bank s obligations under the consent orders in
connection with the independent foreclosure review. We do not expect any additional financial charges related to the amendment to the consent orders to be material. PNC s and PNC Bank s obligations to comply with the remaining provisions
of the consent orders remain. 

On February 9, 2012, the Department of Justice, other federal regulators and 49 state attorneys general announced agreements with the five largest
mortgage servicers. Written agreements were filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in March 2012. Under these agreements, the mortgage servicers will make cash payments to federal and state governments, provide
various forms of financial relief to borrowers, and implement new mortgage servicing standards. These governmental authorities are continuing their review of, and have engaged in discussions with, other mortgage servicers, including PNC, that were
subject to the interagency horizontal review, which could result in the imposition of substantial payments and other forms of relief (similar to that agreed to by the five largest servicers) on some or all of these mortgage servicers, including PNC.
Whether and to what extent any such relief may be imposed on PNC and other smaller servicers is not yet known. 

PNC has received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York concerning National City Bank s lending
practices in connection with loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as certain non-FHA-insured loan origination, sale and securitization practices. The U.S. Attorney s Office inquiry is in its early stage and PNC is
cooperating with the investigation. 

The SEC previously commenced investigations of activities of National City prior to its acquisition by PNC. The SEC has requested, and we have provided
to the SEC, documents concerning, among other things, National City s capital-raising activities, loan underwriting experience, allowance for loan losses, marketing practices, dividends, bank regulatory matters and the sale of First Franklin
Financial Corporation. In February 2013, the SEC staff informed PNC that it had completed its investigation and does not intend to recommend enforcement action. Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in this Note 23. 
 Other In addition to the
proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we
cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period. 
 See Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees for additional information regarding the Visa indemnification and our other obligations to provide
indemnification, including to current and former officers, directors, employees and agents of PNC and companies we have acquired, including National City.

 If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a
remarketing program, then upon the request of the guaranteed party, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit and risk participations in standby letters of credit and
bankers acceptances outstanding on December 31, 2012 had terms ranging from less than 1 year to 7 years. The aggregate maximum amount of future payments PNC could be required to make under outstanding standby letters of credit and risk
participations in standby letters of credit and bankers acceptances was 14.7 billion at December 31, 2012, of which 7.5 billion support remarketing programs. As of December 31, 2012, assets of 1.8 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. Recourse provisions from third parties of 3.2 billion were also available for this
purpose as of December 31, 2012. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit and letter of credit risk participations issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the
customers other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and risk participations in standby letters of credit and bankers acceptances was 247 million at
December 31, 2012. S TANDBY B OND P URCHASE A GREEMENTS AND 
O THER L IQUIDITY F ACILITIES We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support
municipal bond obligations. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate of our commitments under these facilities was 587 million. We also enter into certain other liquidity facilities to support individual pools of receivables acquired by commercial
paper conduits. At December 31, 2012, our total commitments under these facilities were 145 million. 
 I NDEMNIFICATIONS 
 We are a party to numerous acquisition or divestiture agreements under which we have purchased or sold, or agreed to purchase or sell, various types of
assets. These agreements can cover the purchase or sale of: 

Entire businesses, 

Loan portfolios,

Branch banks, 

Partial interests in companies, or 

Other types of assets. 
 These agreements generally include indemnification provisions under which we indemnify the third parties to these agreements against a variety of risks
to the indemnified parties as a result of the transaction in question. When PNC is the seller, the indemnification provisions will generally also provide the buyer with protection relating to the quality of the assets we are selling and the extent
of any liabilities being assumed by the buyer. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them. We provide indemnification in connection with securities offering transactions in which we are involved. When we are the issuer of the securities, we provide indemnification to the underwriters or
placement agents analogous to the indemnification provided to the purchasers of businesses from us, as described above. When we are an underwriter or placement agent, we provide a limited indemnification to the issuer related to our actions in
connection with the offering and, if there are other underwriters, indemnification to the other underwriters intended to result in an appropriate sharing of the risk of participating in the offering. Due to the nature of these indemnification
provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
certain types of agreements that include provisions for indemnifying third parties. We also enter into certain types of agreements, including leases, assignments of leases, and subleases, in which we agree to indemnify third parties for acts by our
agents, assignees and/or sublessees, and employees. We also enter into contracts for the delivery of technology service in which we indemnify the other party against claims of patent and copyright infringement by third parties. Due to the nature of
these indemnification provisions, we cannot calculate our aggregate potential exposure under them. In the ordinary course of business, we
enter into contracts with third parties under which the third parties provide services on behalf of PNC. In many of these contracts, we agree to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnity vary
from contract to contract and the amount of the indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined. We are a general or limited partner
in certain asset management and investment limited partnerships, many of which contain indemnification provisions that would require us to make payments in excess of our remaining unfunded commitments. While in certain of these partnerships the
maximum liability to us is limited to the sum of our unfunded commitments and partnership distributions received by us, in the others the indemnification liability is unlimited. As a result, we cannot determine our aggregate potential exposure for
these indemnifications.

In some cases, indemnification obligations of the types described above arise under arrangements entered
into by predecessor companies for which we become responsible as a result of the acquisition. Pursuant to their bylaws, PNC and its
subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors, officers and, in some cases, employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of or at the request of PNC and its subsidiaries. PNC and its
subsidiaries also advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings, subject to written undertakings by each such individual to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the
individual is not entitled to indemnification. We generally are responsible for similar indemnifications and advancement obligations that companies we acquire had to their officers, directors and sometimes employees and agents at the time of
acquisition. We advanced such costs on behalf of several such individuals with respect to pending litigation or investigations during 2012. It is not possible for us to determine the aggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to
provide this indemnity or to advance such costs. V ISA I NDEMNIFICATION 
 Our payment services business issues and acquires credit and debit card transactions through Visa U.S.A. Inc. card association or its affiliates (Visa).
 In October 2007, Visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its financial institution members (Visa
Reorganization) in contemplation of its initial public offering (IPO). As part of the Visa Reorganization, we received our proportionate share of a class of Visa Inc. common stock allocated to the US members. Prior to the IPO, the US members, which
included PNC, were obligated to indemnify Visa for judgments and settlements related to the specified litigation. As a result of the
acquisition of National City, we became party to judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks. The judgment and loss sharing agreements were designed to apportion financial responsibilities arising from any potential
adverse judgment or negotiated settlements related to the specified litigation. In July 2012, Visa funded 150 million into their litigation
escrow account and reduced the conversion rate of Visa B to A shares. We continue to have an obligation to indemnify Visa for judgments and settlements for the remaining specified litigation, therefore we may have additional exposure to the
specified Visa litigation. R ECOURSE AND R EPURCHASE O BLIGATIONS 
 As discussed in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities, PNC has sold commercial mortgage,
residential mortgage and home equity loans directly

or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase
obligations associated with the transferred assets. C OMMERCIAL M ORTGAGE L OAN 
R ECOURSE O BLIGATIONS We originate, close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans
which are sold to FNMA under FNMA s DUS program. We participated in a similar program with the FHLMC. Under these programs, we generally
assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these
programs was 12.8 billion and 13.0 billion, respectively. The potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was 3.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 4.0 billion at December 31, 2011. 
 We maintain a reserve for estimated losses based upon our exposure. The reserve for losses under these programs totaled 43 million and 47 million as of
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. If payment is required under these programs, we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral
underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred, although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses. Our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the
Corporate Institutional Banking segment. Table 154: Analysis of Commercial Mortgage Recourse

E QUITY R EPURCHASE O BLIGATIONS While residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse
basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where PNC is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and
representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. Residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through
Agency securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. As discussed in Note 3 Loans Sale and Servicing Activities and

Variable Interest Entities, Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with FNMA, FHLMC, and the GNMA program, while Non-agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan
sale transactions with private investors. Mortgage loan sale transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve FNMA, FHLMC or private investors. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase
obligations has primarily been related to transactions with FNMA and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with FHA and VA-insured and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. Repurchase
obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. PNC s repurchase
obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by National City prior to our acquisition of National City. PNC is no longer engaged in the
brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines is reported in the
Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment. Loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with
various investors to provide assurance that PNC has sold loans that are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria
established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery

of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these
contractual obligations, investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. Indemnification
and repurchase liabilities are initially recognized when loans are sold to investors and are subsequently evaluated by management. Initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification and repurchase liability for the sold
residential mortgage portfolio are recognized in Residential mortgage revenue on the Consolidated Income Statement. Since PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, only subsequent adjustments are recognized to the home
equity loans/lines indemnification and repurchase liability. These adjustments are recognized in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. Management s subsequent evaluation of these indemnification and repurchase liabilities is based upon trends in indemnification and repurchase requests, actual loss experience, risks in the underlying
serviced loan portfolios, and current economic conditions. As part of its evaluation, management considers estimated loss projections over the life of the subject loan portfolio. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total
indemnification and repurchase liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims totaled 672 million and 130 million, respectively, and was included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. An analysis of the
changes in this liability during 2012 and 2011 follows:

Management believes our indemnification and repurchase liabilities appropriately reflect the estimated
probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all loans sold and outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. In making these estimates, we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. While
management seeks to obtain all relevant information in estimating the indemnification and repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise, and, accordingly, it is reasonably possible that future indemnification and
repurchase losses could be more or less than our established liability. Factors that could affect our estimate include the volume of valid claims driven by investor strategies and behavior, our ability to successfully negotiate claims with
investors, housing prices, and other economic conditions. At December 31, 2012, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses in excess of our accrued indemnification and repurchase liability of up to
approximately 332 million for our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold. At December 31, 2012, the reasonably possible loss above our accrual for our portfolio of home equity loans/lines sold was not material. This estimate of potential
additional losses in excess of our liability is based on assumed higher repurchase claims and lower claim rescissions than our current assumptions. Reinsurance Agreements We have two wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries
which provide reinsurance to third-party insurers related to insurance sold to our customers. These subsidiaries enter into various types of reinsurance agreements with third-party insurers where the subsidiary assumes the risk of loss through
either an excess of loss or quota share agreement up to 100 reinsurance. In excess of loss agreements, these subsidiaries assume the risk of loss for an excess layer of coverage up to specified limits, once a defined first loss percentage is met.
In quota share agreements, the subsidiaries and third-party insurers share the responsibility for payment of all claims. These subsidiaries
provide reinsurance for accidental death dismemberment, credit life, accident health, lender placed hazard, and borrower and lender paid mortgage insurance with an aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits for all
reinsurance contracts as follows:

 Through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance connected to the Lender Placed Hazard Exposure, should a catastrophic event occur, PNC will benefit from this
reinsurance. No credit for the catastrophe reinsurance protection is applied to the aggregate exposure figure. A rollforward of

 There were no changes to the terms of existing agreements, nor were any new relationships entered into or existing
relationships exited. There is a reasonable possibility that losses could be more than or less than the amount reserved due to ongoing
uncertainty in various economic, social and other factors that could impact the frequency and severity of claims covered by these reinsurance agreements. At December 31, 2012, the reasonably possible loss above our accrual was not material.
 Repurchase and Resale Agreements We enter into repurchase and resale agreements where we transfer investment securities to/from a third party with the agreement to repurchase/resell those investment securities at a future date for a
specified price. These transactions are accounted for as collateralized borrowings/financings.

N OTE 26 S EGMENT R EPORTING 
 We have six reportable business segments: 

Retail Banking 

Corporate Institutional Banking 

Asset Management Group 

Residential Mortgage Banking 

BlackRock 

Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP;
therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the
extent practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability to the current period presentation to reflect any such refinements. 
 Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the
results for corporate support functions within Other for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and
liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. During the second quarter of 2012, enhancements were made to the funds transfer pricing
methodology. Retrospective application of our new funds transfer pricing methodology has been made to the prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability to the current period presentation, which we believe
is more meaningful to readers of our financial statements. A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our
business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill and other intangible assets at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments. 
 We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk in
each business segment s loan portfolio. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Key reserve assumptions and estimation
processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated. During the third quarter of 2012,
PNC 

increased the amount of internally observed data used in estimating the key commercial lending assumptions of PDs and LGDs. Prior periods are not presented on a comparable basis as it is not
practicable to do so. Total business segment financial results differ from consolidated income from continuing operations before
noncontrolling interests, which itself excludes the earnings and revenue attributable to GIS through June 30, 2010 and the related third quarter 2010 after-tax gain on the sale of GIS that are reflected in discontinued operations. The impact of
these differences is reflected in the Other category in the business segment tables. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses
related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses,
alternative investments including private equity, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement
reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable
to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparative purposes. B USINESS 
S EGMENT P RODUCTS AND S ERVICES Retail Banking provides
deposit, lending, brokerage, investment management, and cash management services to consumer and small business customers within our primary geographic markets. Our customers are serviced through our branch network, call centers, online banking and

technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Corporate Institutional Banking provides products and services generally within our primary geographic markets,
with certain products and services offered nationally and internationally. Asset Management Group includes personal wealth
management for high net worth and ultra high net worth clients and institutional asset management. Wealth management products and services include investment and retirement planning, customized investment management, private banking, tailored credit
solutions and trust management and administration for individuals and their families. Institutional asset management provides investment management, custody and retirement administration services. Institutional clients include corporations, unions,
municipalities, non-profits, foundations and endowments, primarily located in our geographic footprint. Residential Mortgage
Banking directly originates primarily first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis with a significant presence within the retail banking footprint, and also originates loans through majority owned affiliates. Mortgage loans
represent loans collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate. These loans are typically underwritten to government agency and/or third-party standards, and sold, servicing retained, to secondary mortgage conduits of FNMA, FHLMC,
Federal Home Loan Banks and third-party investors, or are securitized and issued under the GNMA program. The mortgage servicing operation performs all functions related to servicing mortgage loans, primarily those in first lien position, for various
investors and for loans owned by PNC. Certain loan applications are brokered by majority owned affiliates to others.

BlackRock is a leader in investment management, risk management and
advisory services for institutional and retail clients worldwide. BlackRock provides diversified investment management services to institutional clients, intermediary and individual investors through various investment vehicles. Investment
management services primarily consist of the management of equity, fixed income, multi-asset class, alternative investment and cash management products. BlackRock offers its investment products in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and
closed-end mutual funds, iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs), collective investment trusts and separate
accounts. In addition, BlackRock provides market risk management, financial markets advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation services relating to illiquid
securities, dispositions and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), risk management and strategic planning and execution. We hold an equity investment in BlackRock, which is a key component of our diversified revenue strategy. BlackRock is a publicly traded company, and additional information regarding its business is
available in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At December 31, 2012, our economic interest in BlackRock was 22 . PNC received cash dividends from BlackRock of 225 million during 2012, 212 million during 2011, and 178 million during 2010. Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio (formerly, Distressed Assets Portfolio) includes a consumer portfolio of mainly residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans and a small commercial loan
and lease portfolio. We obtained a significant portion of these non-strategic assets through acquisitions of other companies.

 Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in
interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing
liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value, with
changes in fair value recorded in trading noninterest income, are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. The interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve are included in the Other 
interest-earning assets category. Loan fees for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were 217 million, 175 million, and
 154 million, respectively. Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a marginal federal income tax rate
of 35 to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to interest income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were 144 million, 104 million, and 81 million,
respectively.

(a) 
 Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on
nonperforming status. 

(b) 
 In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted a policy stating that Home equity loans past due 90 days or more would be placed on nonaccrual status. Prior policy required
that these loans be past due 180 days before being placed on nonaccrual status. 

(c) 
 Nonperforming residential real estate excludes loans of 69 million and 61 million accounted for under the fair value option as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively. The comparable balances for prior periods presented were not material. 

(d) 
 Effective in the second quarter 2011, the commercial nonaccrual policy was applied to certain small business credit card balances. This change resulted in loans being
placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due. We continue to charge off these loans at 180 days past due. 

(e) 
 Pursuant to regulatory guidance, issued in the third quarter of 2012, nonperforming consumer loans, primarily home equity and residential mortgage,
increased 288 million in 2012 related to changes in treatment of certain loans classified as TDRs, net of charge-offs, resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and

240 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-K

therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability. Charge-offs have been taken where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded
investment of the loan and were 128.1 million. Of these loans, approximately 78 were current on their payments at December 31, 2012. 

(f) 
 Includes TDRs of 1,589 million at December 31, 2012, 1,141 million at December 31, 2011, 784 million at December 31, 2010, 440 million at
December 31, 2009, and zero at December 31, 2008, respectively. Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans.

(g) 
 OREO excludes 380 million, 280 million, 178 million, 112 million and 81 million at December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, December 31,
2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, related to residential real estate that was acquired by us upon foreclosure of serviced loans because they are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or
guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

(h) 
 Amounts include certain government insured or guaranteed consumer loans totaling 2,236 million, 2,474 million, 2,167 million, 1,814 million and 926 million at
December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans as they are considered current loans due
to the accretion of interest income. 

(i) 
 Amounts include certain government insured or guaranteed consumer loans held for sale totaling zero, 15 million, 22 million, 27 million and zero at December 31,
2012, December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

 The following table presents the assignment of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the categories of
loans as a percentage of total loans. Changes in the allocation over time reflect the changes in loan portfolio composition, risk profile and refinements to reserve methodologies. For purposes of this presentation, a portion of the allowance for
loan and lease losses has been assigned to loan categories based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and
measurement factors. At December 31, 2012, the portion of the reserves for these factors was 42 million. A LLOCATION

 ITEM 9A C ONTROLS AND P ROCEDURES 

(a) 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (PNC) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PNC s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. This assessment
was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management concluded that PNC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Report, has also audited the effectiveness of PNC s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is included
under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(b) 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As of December 31, 2012, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design

and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective as of December 31, 2012, and that there has been no change in PNC s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1 After shareholder approval of the 2006 Incentive Award Plan at the 2006 annual meeting of
PNC s shareholders on April 25, 2006 (see Note 2 below), no further grants were permitted under the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Award Plan, other than for the exercise of options still subject to a reload feature. As of December 31,
2012, the number of remaining shares reserved under this plan for that purpose was 1,945,317. Note 2 The 2006 Incentive Award Plan was
adopted by the Board on February 15, 2006 and approved by the PNC shareholders at the 2006 annual meeting on April 25, 2006. The plan initially authorized up to 40,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the plan, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances. If and to the extent that stock options and stock appreciation rights SARs granted under the plan, or granted under the prior plan and outstanding on the approval date of the plan, terminate, expire
or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered after the effective date of the plan without being exercised or if any share awards, share units, dividend equivalents or other share-based awards are forfeited or terminated, or otherwise not
paid in full, after the effective date of the plan, the shares subject to such grants become available again for purposes of the plan. Shares available for issuance under this plan are also reduced by the number of any shares used in payment of
bonuses under the 1996 Executive Incentive Award Plan. The plan was most recently amended and restated incorporating amendments adopted by
the Board and approved by PNC s shareholders at the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, effective as of March 11, 2011. These amendments incorporate, among other things, an increase to the overall limit on the number of shares that may be
awarded under the plan to 46,000,000, and a new requirement that each award of a share (other than pursuant to a stock option or SAR) granted after that effective date will reduce the aggregate plan limit by 2.5 shares, while each award of a share
pursuant to a stock option or SAR will reduce the aggregate plan limit by one share. Note 3 Under the 2006 Incentive Award Plan,
awards or portions of awards that, by their terms, are payable only in cash do not reduce the number of shares that remain available for issuance under the plan (the number in column (c)). During 2012, a total of 543,959 cash-payable share units
plus cash-payable dividend equivalents with respect to 418,665 of those share units were granted under the plan. This number includes an incremental change in the cash-payable portion of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 incentive performance unit award
grants described in Note 4 below (net of forfeitures), a separate 2012 incentive performance unit award grant payable solely in cash, and 2012 grants of share units (all of which include rights to cash dividend equivalents) payable solely in cash.
Payments are subject to the conditions of the individual grants, including, where applicable, the achievement of any performance goals or service requirement established for such

grants. The comparable amount for 2010 was 367,365 cash-payable share units plus cash-payable dividend equivalents with respect to 211,573 cash-payable restricted share units, and the comparable
amount for 2011 was 560,544 cash-payable share units plus cash-payable dividend equivalents with respect to 505,866 cash-payable restricted share units. Note 4 These incentive performance unit awards provide for the issuance of shares of common stock (up to a target number of shares) based on the degree to which corporate performance goals
established by the Personnel and Compensation Committee have been achieved, subject to potential negative adjustment based on certain risk-related performance metrics, and, if a premium level of such performance is achieved, for further payment in
cash. The numbers in column (a) of this table for these awards reflect the maximum number of shares that could be issued pursuant to grants outstanding at December 31, 2012 upon achievement of the performance goals and other conditions of
the grants. At the premium level of performance, a further maximum payout of cash equivalents for the same number of share units, plus the incremental change described in Note 3, could also be payable subject to the other conditions of the grants.
Grants under the 2006 Incentive Award Plan were made in the first quarter of 2010, 2011, and 2012. Note 5 These stock-payable
restricted stock units include 2011 and 2012 grants of performance-based restricted share units (with the units payable solely in stock and related dividend equivalents payable solely in cash) that have a service condition, an internal risk-related
performance condition and a market condition and also include grants of other stock-payable restricted share units, some of which are time-based and some of which also include related dividend equivalents payable solely in cash. The number in column
(a) includes the maximum number of shares that could be issued pursuant to grants of this type of award outstanding at December 31, 2012 upon achievement of the performance and market conditions, where applicable, and other conditions of
the grants. Cash-payable dividend equivalents were granted with respect to most of these stock-payable restricted stock units. Where stock-payable restricted share units include a fractional share interest, such fractional share interest is payable
only in cash share equivalents. During 2012, a total of 21 cash share equivalents were paid in the aggregate for fractional share interests. 
 Note 6 The 1996 Executive Incentive Award Plan is a shareholder-approved plan that enables PNC to pay annual bonuses to its senior executive
officers based upon the achievement of specified levels of performance. The plan as amended and restated as of January 1, 2007 was adopted by the Board on February 14, 2007 and approved by the PNC shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting on
April 24, 2007. The plan does not specify a fixed share amount for awards under the plan. Rather, it provides for maximum bonus awards

for a given period (generally a year) for each individual plan participant of 0.2 of incentive income for that period. Incentive income is based on PNC s consolidated pre-tax net income as
further adjusted for the impact of changes in tax law, extraordinary items, discontinued operations, acquisition and merger integration costs, and for the impact of PNC s obligation to fund certain BlackRock long-term incentive programs.
Although the size of awards under the plan is dollar-denominated, payment may be made in cash, in stock, or in a combination of cash and stock. 
 Note 7 The purchase price for shares sold under the plan represents 95 of the fair market value on the last day of each six-month offering
period. Note 8 The plans in this section of the table reflect awards under pre-acquisition plans of National City Corporation and
Sterling Financial Corporation, respectively. National City was merged into PNC on December 31, 2008 and Sterling was merged into PNC on April 4, 2008. Pursuant to the respective merger agreements for these acquisitions, common shares of
National City or Sterling, as the case may be, issuable upon the exercise or settlement of various equity awards granted under the National City or Sterling plans were converted into corresponding awards covering PNC common stock. Additional
information is included in Note 16 Stock-Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and in Note 16 Stock-Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in

 2.1 Type of Option . The Option is intended to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 2.2 Option Period . Except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.3, the Option is exercisable in whole or in part as to any Covered Shares as to which it is outstanding and has become exercisable
at any time and from time to time through the Expiration Date as defined in Section 7.18, including and subject to the early termination and forfeiture provisions set forth in said definition. 
 To the extent that the Option or relevant portion thereof is then outstanding and the Expiration Date has not yet occurred, the Option will become
exercisable as to Covered Shares as set forth in this Section 2.2. 

(a) Unless the Option has previously become exercisable pursuant to another subsection of this
Section 2.2, the Option will become exercisable as follows: (i) as to one-third (1/3 rd of the Covered Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
Share), commencing on the first (1 st anniversary
date of the Grant Date provided that Optionee is still an employee of the Corporation on such anniversary date or is a Retiree whose Retirement date occurred on or after the six (6) month anniversary date of the Grant Date;

(2 nd anniversary date of the Grant Date provided
that Optionee is still an employee of the Corporation on such anniversary date or is a Retiree whose Retirement date occurred on or after the first (1 st anniversary date of the Grant Date; and 
 (iii) as to the remaining Covered Shares, commencing on the third (3 rd anniversary date of the Grant Date provided that Optionee is still an employee of the Corporation on such
anniversary date or is a Retiree whose Retirement date occurred on or after the first (1 st anniversary date of the Grant Date. (b) If Optionee s employment is terminated by
the Corporation by reason of Disability and not for Cause, the Option will become exercisable as to all outstanding Covered Shares as to which it has not otherwise become exercisable commencing on Optionee s Termination Date. 
 (c) If Optionee s employment with the Corporation is terminated by reason of Optionee s death, the Option will immediately become exercisable
as to all outstanding Covered Shares as to which it has not otherwise become exercisable, and the Option may be exercised by Optionee s properly designated beneficiary, by the person or persons entitled to do so under Optionee s will, or
by the person or persons entitled to do so under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. (d) If, after the occurrence of a Change of
Control Triggering Event but prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Failure or of the Change of Control triggered by the Change of Control Triggering Event, Optionee s employment with the Corporation is terminated by the Corporation
without Cause or by Optionee with Good Reason, the Option will become exercisable as to all outstanding Covered Shares as to which it has not otherwise become exercisable commencing on Optionee s Termination Date. 
 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.2, to the extent that the Option is outstanding but has not yet become fully exercisable
at the time a Change of Control occurs, the Option will become exercisable as to all then outstanding Covered Shares as to which it has not otherwise become exercisable, effective as of the day immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of
Control, provided that, at the time the Change of Control occurs, Optionee is either (i) an employee of the Corporation or (ii) a former employee of the Corporation whose Option, or portion thereof, has not yet become exercisable but is
then outstanding and continues to qualify for becoming exercisable pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii) and/or (iii). 
 (f) The Compensation Committee or other PNC Designated Person as defined in Section 7.31 may in their sole discretion, but need not, accelerate the
date as of which all or any portion of the Option first becomes exercisable subject, if applicable, to such limitations as may be set forth in the Plan. If Optionee is employed by a Consolidated Subsidiary that ceases to be a subsidiary of PNC or ceases to be a consolidated subsidiary of PNC under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and Optionee
does not continue to be employed by PNC or a Consolidated Subsidiary, then for purposes of the Agreement, Optionee s employment with the Corporation terminates effective at the time this occurs. 
 2.3 Judicial Criminal Proceedings . If any criminal charges are brought against Optionee, in an indictment or in other analogous formal charges
commencing judicial criminal proceedings, alleging the commission of a felony that relates to or arises out of Optionee s employment or other service relationship with the Corporation, then to the extent that the Option is then outstanding and
exercisable or would otherwise 

become exercisable, the Compensation Committee or other PNC Designated Person may determine to suspend the exercisability of the Option or to require the escrow of the proceeds of any exercise of
the Option. Any such suspension or escrow is subject to the following restrictions: (a) It may last only until the earliest to occur of the following: (i) resolution of the criminal
proceedings in a manner that results in a conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) of Optionee for, or any entry by Optionee into a pre-trial disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony that relates to or arises out
of Optionee s employment or other service relationship with the Corporation; (ii) resolution of the criminal proceedings in one of the
following ways: (A) the charges as they relate to such alleged felony have been dismissed (with or without prejudice); (B) Optionee has been acquitted of such alleged felony; or (C) a criminal proceeding relating to such alleged
felony has been completed without resolution (for example, as a result of a mistrial) and the relevant time period for recommencing criminal proceedings relating to such alleged felony has expired without any such recommencement; 
 (iii) Optionee s death; (iv) the
occurrence of a Change of Control; or (v) termination of the suspension or escrow in the discretion of the Compensation Committee or other
PNC Designated Person, as applicable; and (b) It may be imposed only if the Compensation Committee or other PNC Designated Person, as
applicable, makes reasonable provision for the retention or realization of the value of the Option to Optionee as if no suspension or escrow had been imposed upon any termination of the suspension or escrow under clauses (a)(ii) or (a)(v) above.
 2.4 Nontransferability; Designation of Beneficiary; Payment to Legal Representative . 
 (a) The Option is not transferable or assignable by Optionee. (b) During Optionee s lifetime, the Option may be exercised only by Optionee or, in the event of Optionee s legal incapacity, by his or her legal representative, as determined in good faith by
PNC. (c) During Optionee s lifetime, Optionee may file with PNC, at such address and in such manner as PNC may from time to time direct,
on a form to be provided by PNC on request, a designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries (a properly designated beneficiary to hold and exercise Optionee s stock options, to the extent outstanding and exercisable, in accordance
with their respective stock option agreements and the Plan in the event of Optionee s death. (d) If Optionee dies prior to the full
exercise or expiration of the Option and has not filed a designation of beneficiary form as specified above, the Option, to the extent outstanding and exercisable, will be held and may be exercised by the person or persons entitled to do so under
Optionee s will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution, as to which PNC will be entitled to rely in good faith on instructions from Optionee s executor, administrator, or other legal representative. 
 (e) Any delivery of shares or other payment made or action taken hereunder by PNC in good faith to or on the instructions of Optionee s executor,
administrator, or other legal representative shall extinguish all right to payment hereunder. 3. Capital Adjustments . If corporate
transactions, such as stock dividends, stock splits, spin-offs, split-offs, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations or reorganizations of or by PNC Corporate Transactions occur, the Compensation Committee or its delegate shall make
those adjustments, if any, in the number, class or kind of Covered Shares as to which the Option is outstanding and has not yet been exercised and in 

the Option Price that it deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect Corporate Transactions such that the rights of Optionee are neither enlarged nor diminished as a result of such Corporate
Transactions, including without limitation cancellation of the Option immediately prior to the effective time of such Corporate Transaction and payment, in cash, in consideration therefor, of an amount equal to the product of (a) the excess, if
any, of the per share value of the consideration payable to a PNC common shareholder in connection with such Corporate Transaction over the Option Price and (b) the total number of Covered Shares subject to the Option that were outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of such Corporate Transaction. All determinations hereunder shall be made by the
Compensation Committee or its delegate in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties, including without limitation the holder of the Option. 
 No fractional shares will be issued on exercise of the Option. PNC shall determine the manner in which any fractional shares will be treated. 
 4. Exercise of Option . 4.1 Notice
and Effective Date . The Option, to the extent outstanding and exercisable, may be exercised, in whole or in part, by delivering to PNC written notice of such exercise, in such form as PNC may from time to time prescribe, and by paying in full
the aggregate Option Price with respect to that portion of the Option being exercised and satisfying any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to applicable tax laws in connection with such exercise. 
 In addition, notwithstanding Sections 4.2 and 4.3, Optionee may elect to complete his or her Option exercise through a brokerage service/margin account
pursuant to the broker-assisted cashless option exercise procedure under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or successor regulation and in such manner as may be permitted by PNC from time to time consistent with
said Regulation T or successor regulation. The form or forms that shall be used to exercise the Option and to make tax payment elections will
be prescribed from time to time by those persons responsible for performing administrative functions under the Plan. The effective date of
such exercise will be the Exercise Date. In the event that the Option is exercised, pursuant to Section 2.4, by any person or persons
other than Optionee, such notice of exercise must be accompanied by appropriate proof of the derivative right of such person or persons to exercise the Option. 4.2 Payment of Option Price . Upon exercise of the Option, in whole or in part, Optionee may pay the aggregate Option Price (a) in cash or (b) if and to the extent then permitted by PNC,
using whole shares of PNC common stock (either by physical delivery to PNC of certificates for the shares or through PNC s share attestation procedure) having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date not exceeding that portion of the

 Restricted Share Units and Dividend Equivalents are not transferable. The Restricted Share Units, and, to the extent not yet paid, the
related Dividend Equivalents, are subject to forfeiture pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement until vesting of the Restricted Share Units in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 
 Restricted Share Units that are not forfeited in accordance with the terms of Section 5 and that vest in accordance with the terms
of Section 6 will be settled and paid out pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6. Restricted Share Units that are forfeited by Grantee pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 5 will be cancelled
without payment of any consideration by PNC. 

The right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents is granted in connection with the Restricted Share
Units to which they relate and therefore shall terminate, without payment of any consideration by PNC, upon the cancellation or settlement, whichever is applicable, of the Restricted Share Units to which they relate. 
 4. Dividend Equivalents . Dividend Equivalents . These Dividend Equivalents are related to the Restricted Share Units, and Dividend Equivalents payments are applicable for the period during which the Restricted Share Units
to which they relate are outstanding. Dividend Equivalents apply to the period from and after the Award Grant Date until such time as the Restricted Share Units granted in connection with the Dividend Equivalents either (i) vest pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of Section 6 or (ii) are cancelled upon forfeiture in accordance with the terms of Section 5. At the end of such period (either the vesting date in accordance with Section 6 or cancellation date in
accordance with Section 5), the Dividend Equivalents terminate. Once the Agreement is effective in accordance with
Section 15 and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4, the Corporation will make Dividend Equivalents payments to Grantee, where applicable, of cash equivalent to the amounts of the quarterly cash dividends Grantee would
have received, if any, had the Restricted Share Units to which such Dividend Equivalents relate been shares of PNC common stock issued and outstanding on the record dates for cash dividends on PNC common stock that occur during the Dividend
Equivalents period. Payment . The Corporation will make Dividend Equivalents payments to Grantee where applicable
pursuant to this Section 4 each quarter following the dividend payment date that relates to such record date, if any. Such amounts shall be paid in cash in accordance with applicable regular payroll practice as in effect from time to time for
similarly situated employees within 30 days after the applicable dividend payment date. Dividend Equivalents payments are subject to the additional conditions set forth below, and except as otherwise provided below, Dividend Equivalents will
 not be payable with respect to a dividend unless the Restricted Share Units to which the Dividend Equivalents relate were outstanding on both the dividend record date and dividend payment date for such dividend. 
 Additional Conditions . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.4(b) and 12.11, termination or cancellation of the right to
ongoing Dividend Equivalents will have no effect on cash payments made pursuant to this Section 4 prior to such termination or cancellation. If the termination of the right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents occurs because the related Restricted Share Units vest pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6 and if such
termination occurs after the dividend record date for a quarter but before the related dividend payment date, the Corporation will nonetheless make such a quarterly dividend equivalent payment to Grantee with respect to that record date, if any.
 However, if the termination of the right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents occurs because the related Restricted Share Units
are cancelled upon forfeiture in accordance with the terms of Section 5, Grantee will not receive any dividend equivalent payments on or after such forfeiture date, whether or not a dividend record date had occurred prior to such date.
 Where payment of Dividend Equivalents that would otherwise be made is suspended pursuant to Section 5.3 or
Section 5.5 pending resolution of a potential forfeiture of the Restricted Share Units, then such payment will be made only if and when the suspension is terminated for reasons favorable to Grantee and the Restricted Share Units are not
forfeited. No interest shall be paid with respect to any suspended payments. If the suspension is terminated for reasons adverse to Grantee, both the Restricted Share Units and any suspended Dividend Equivalents payments will be forfeited without
payment. 5. Forfeiture Provisions; Termination of Award Upon Failure to Meet Applicable Conditions .

additional withholding may be made. 11. Employment . Neither the granting of the Restricted Share Units and related

elsewhere in the Agreement, and such definitions shall apply except where the context otherwise indicates. In the Agreement,
 PNC means The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Corporation means PNC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, and Plan means The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 2006 Incentive Award Plan as amended from time to
time. 2. Restricted Share Units with Dividend Equivalents Award . Pursuant to the Plan and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, PNC grants to the Grantee named above Grantee a Share-denominated award opportunity of restricted share units Restricted Share Units or RSUs of the number of share units set forth
above, together with the opportunity to receive related Dividend Equivalents Dividend Equivalents with respect to those share units (together, the Award ). The Award is subject to acceptance by Grantee in accordance with
Section 15 and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Plan. 3. Terms of Award . For
purposes of determining the service, conduct, and other conditions and provisions applicable to each portion of the RSUs and related Dividend Equivalents under the Agreement, the Award is divided into three installments or tranches. This includes
the conditions set forth in Section 4 related to Dividend Equivalents and the conditions set forth in Sections 5 and 6 relating to specified service conditions and service related forfeiture provisions for each tranche, conduct-related
provisions, and vesting and settlement provisions for each tranche. The three Restricted Share Units and related Dividend
Equivalents Tranches are set forth below: 

one-fourth of the Share Units (rounded down to the nearest whole unit) are in the first tranche 1 st Tranche 

one-third of the remaining Share Units (rounded down to the nearest whole unit) are in the second tranche 2 nd Tranche and 

the remainder of the Share Units are in the third tranche 3 rd Tranche ). Restricted Share Units and Dividend Equivalents are not transferable. The Restricted Share Units, and, to the extent not yet paid, the related Dividend Equivalents, are subject to forfeiture pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Agreement until vesting of the Restricted Share Units in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Provided that a Restricted Share Units Tranche is not forfeited in accordance with the terms of Section 5 and vests in accordance with the terms of Section 6, that Tranche of RSUs will be
settled and paid out, generally in shares of PNC common stock, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6. Restricted Share Units that are forfeited by Grantee pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the service or
conduct provisions of Section 5 will be cancelled without payment of any consideration by PNC. The right to ongoing
Dividend Equivalents is granted in connection with the Tranche of Restricted Share Units to which they relate and therefore shall terminate, without payment of any consideration by PNC, upon the cancellation or settlement, whichever is applicable,
of the Tranche of Restricted Share Units to which they relate. 4. Dividend Equivalents . 
 Dividend Equivalents . These Dividend Equivalents are related to the Restricted Share Units, and Dividend Equivalents payments are
applicable for the period during which the Tranche of Restricted Share Units to which they relate is outstanding. Dividend Equivalents apply to the period from and after the Award Grant Date until such time as the applicable Tranche of Restricted
Share Units granted in connection with the Dividend Equivalents either (i) vests pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6 or (ii) is cancelled upon forfeiture in accordance with the terms of Section 5. At the end
of such period (either the vesting date in accordance with Section 6 or cancellation date in accordance with Section 5), the related Dividend Equivalents terminate. Once the Agreement is effective in accordance with Section 15 and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4, the Corporation will make Dividend Equivalents payments to Grantee, where
applicable, of cash equivalent to the amounts of the quarterly cash dividends Grantee would have received, if any, had the Restricted Share Units to which such Dividend Equivalents relate been shares of PNC common stock issued and outstanding on the
record dates for cash dividends on PNC common stock that occur during the Dividend Equivalents period. Payment . The
Corporation will make Dividend Equivalents payments to Grantee where applicable pursuant to this Section 4 each quarter following the dividend payment date that relates to such record date, if any. Such amounts shall be paid in cash in
accordance with applicable regular payroll practice as in effect from time to time for similarly situated employees within 30 days after the applicable dividend payment date. Dividend Equivalents payments are subject to the additional conditions set
forth below, and except as otherwise provided below, Dividend Equivalents will not be payable with respect to a dividend unless the Restricted Share Units to which the Dividend Equivalents relate were outstanding on both the dividend
record date and dividend payment date for such dividend. Additional Conditions . Except as otherwise provided in
Sections 5.4(b) and 12.11, termination or cancellation of the right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents will have no effect on cash payments made pursuant to this Section 4 prior to such termination or cancellation. 
 If the termination of the right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents occurs because the related Restricted Share Units vest pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 6 and if such termination occurs after the dividend record date for a quarter but before the related dividend payment date, 

the Corporation will nonetheless make such a quarterly dividend equivalent payment to Grantee with respect to that record date, if any. 
 However, if the termination of the right to ongoing Dividend Equivalents occurs because the related Restricted Share Units are cancelled
upon forfeiture in accordance with the terms of Section 5, Grantee will not receive any dividend equivalent payments on or after such forfeiture date, whether or not a dividend record date had occurred prior to such date. 
 Where payment of Dividend Equivalents that would otherwise be made is suspended pursuant to Section 5.3 or Section 5.5 pending
resolution of a potential forfeiture of the Restricted Share Units, then such payment will be made only if and when the suspension is terminated for reasons favorable to Grantee and the Restricted Share Units are not forfeited. No interest shall be
paid with respect to any suspended payments. If the suspension is terminated for reasons adverse to Grantee, both the Restricted Share Units and any suspended Dividend Equivalents payments will be forfeited without payment.

of this Section 5, the Award will terminate with respect to such Tranche or Tranches of RSUs and related Dividend Equivalents, and neither Grantee nor any successors, heirs, assigns or legal representatives of Grantee will thereafter have any

without payment of any consideration by PNC effective as of Grantee s Termination Date. If such suspension is resolved

after the date that would have been the scheduled vesting date for such Restricted Share Units had they vested pursuant to Section 6.1(i) rather than pursuant to Section 6.1(iii) pursuant to clause (2) above but Grantee dies prior to
that scheduled payout date, payment will be made no later than December 31 st of the calendar year in which Grantee s death occurred or, if later (but not beyond the end of the calendar year in which the vesting would have occurred had such RSUs vested pursuant to
Section 6.1(i) rather than pursuant to Section 6.1(iii)), the 15 th day of the
3 rd calendar month following the date of Grantee s
death. Delivery of shares and/or other payment pursuant to the Award will not be made unless and until all
applicable tax withholding requirements have been satisfied. 7. No Rights as Shareholder Until Issuance of Shares .
Grantee will have no rights as a shareholder of PNC by virtue of this Award unless and until shares are issued and delivered in settlement of vested outstanding Restricted Share Units pursuant to Section 6. 
 8. Capital Adjustments . 8.1 Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2, if applicable, if corporate transactions such as stock dividends, stock splits, spin-offs, split-offs, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations or
reorganizations of or by PNC Corporate Transactions occur prior to the time, if any, that outstanding vested Restricted Share Units are settled and paid, the Compensation Committee or its delegate shall make those adjustments, if any,
in the number, class or kind of Restricted Share Units and related Dividend Equivalents then outstanding under the Award that it deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect Corporate Transactions such that the rights of Grantee are neither
enlarged nor diminished as a result of such Corporate Transactions, including without limitation (a) measuring the value per Share Unit of any share-denominated award amount authorized for payment to Grantee pursuant to Section 6 by
reference to the per share value of the consideration payable to a PNC common shareholder in connection with such Corporate Transactions and (b) authorizing payment of the entire value of any award amount authorized for payment to Grantee
pursuant to Section 6 to be paid in cash at the applicable time specified in Section 6. All determinations
hereunder shall be made by the Compensation Committee or its delegate in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties, including without limitation Grantee. 
 8.2 Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, (a) the number, class and kind of Restricted Share Units and related Dividend
Equivalents then outstanding under the Award will automatically be adjusted to reflect the same changes as are made to outstanding shares of PNC common stock generally, (b) the value per Share Unit will be measured by reference to the per share
value of the consideration payable 

to a PNC common shareholder in connection with such Corporate Transaction or Transactions if applicable, and (c) if the effect of the Corporate Transaction or Transactions on a PNC common
shareholder is to convert that shareholder s holdings into consideration that does not consist solely (other than as to a minimal amount) of shares of PNC common stock, then the entire value of any payment to be made to Grantee pursuant to
Section 6 will be made solely in cash at the applicable time specified by Section 6. 9. Prohibitions Against
Sale, Assignment, etc.; Payment to Legal Representative . (a) Restricted Share Units and related Dividend Equivalents may
not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated. (b) If Grantee is deceased at

other legal representative as determined in good faith by PNC. (c) Any delivery of shares or other payment made in good faith
by PNC to Grantee s executor, administrator or other legal representative shall extinguish all right to payment hereunder. 
 10. Withholding Taxes . Where all applicable withholding tax obligations have not previously been satisfied, PNC will, at the time
any such obligation arises in connection herewith, retain an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount of taxes then required to be withheld by the Corporation in connection therewith from any amounts then payable hereunder to Grantee or, if
none, from other compensation then payable to Grantee or as otherwise determined by PNC. Unless the Compensation Committee or
other PNC Designated Person determines otherwise, where amounts are then payable hereunder to Grantee in the form of shares of PNC common stock, the Corporation will retain whole shares from any such amounts until such withholdings in the aggregate
are sufficient to satisfy such minimum required withholding obligation. In the event that amounts are not then payable hereunder to Grantee in the form of shares or that such withholdings are otherwise not sufficient to meet the minimum amount of
taxes then required to be withheld, withholding will be made from any amounts then payable hereunder to Grantee that are settled in cash until such withholdings in the aggregate are sufficient to satisfy such minimum required withholding obligation.
 If any withholding is required prior to the time amounts are payable to Grantee hereunder or if such amounts are not
sufficient to satisfy such obligation in full, the withholding will be taken from other compensation then payable to Grantee or as otherwise determined by PNC. For purposes of this Section 10, shares of PNC common stock retained to satisfy applicable withholding tax requirements will be valued at their Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 12) on
the date the tax withholding obligation arises. If Grantee desires to have an additional amount withheld above the required
minimum, up to Grantee s W-4 obligation if higher, and if PNC so permits, Grantee may elect to satisfy this additional withholding by payment of cash. PNC will not retain Shares for this purpose. If Grantee s W-4 obligation does not exceed
the required minimum withholding in connection herewith, no additional withholding may be made. 11. Employment .
Neither the granting of the Restricted Share Units and related Dividend Equivalents award nor any payment with respect to such Award authorized hereunder nor any term or provision of the Agreement shall constitute or be evidence of any
understanding, expressed or implied, on the part of PNC or any subsidiary to employ Grantee for any period or in any way alter Grantee s status as an employee at will.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.: We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLP New York, New York February 28, 2013

secondary offering of 26,211,335 shares of common stock held by Barclays Bank PLC Barclays at a price of 160.00 per share, which included 23,211,335 shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of Series B Convertible
Participating Preferred Stock Series B Preferred by a subsidiary of Barclays. Upon completion of this offering, BlackRock repurchased 6,377,552 shares directly from Barclays at a price of 156.80 per share (consisting of 6,346,036
shares of Series B Preferred and 31,516 shares of common stock). The total transactions, including the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase 2,621,134 additional shares in the secondary offering, amounted to 35,210,021 shares,
resulting in Barclays exiting its entire ownership position in BlackRock. On December 31, 2012, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC held 20.8 of the Company s voting common stock and 21.9 of the Company s capital stock, which includes outstanding common and non-voting preferred stock. See Note 17, Capital Stock, for more information on the equity ownership of BlackRock. Basis of Presentation.
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries.
Non-controlling interests

on the consolidated statements of financial condition include the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Significant
accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation. 
 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the
consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated sponsored investment funds are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial
condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VIEs are included in assets of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities . BlackRock holds debt and
marketable equity investments, which pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 320-10, Investments Debt and Equity Securities, are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the
Company s intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Company s intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity. 
 Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair
value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change.

F-11 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
 Held-to-maturity debt securities are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held to maturity and are
recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Available-for-sale securities are those securities that are not
classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
component of stockholders equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to non-operating
income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. Equity Method . For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee,
and where it is not the primary beneficiary PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323,
 Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock s share of the investee s underlying net income or loss is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within non-operating income
(expense) and as other revenue for operating advisory company investments since such companies are considered to be an extension of BlackRock s core business. BlackRock s share of net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most
current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Company s carrying value of the investee. 
 Cost Method . For non-marketable equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee, the investments are
accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within non-operating income (expense). Impairments of Investments . The Company s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate
that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company s carrying value of the
investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.

When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the securities to
determine whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company
considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security s issuer and
the Company s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating
income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it
has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend
to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the
remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Consolidation 
 For investment products in which BlackRock s voting interest is less than 50 , an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a
voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the PB of the investment product, which would require consolidation. 
 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . Pursuant to ASC 810-10, Consolidation ASC 810-10 certain investment products for
which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected
residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. 
 Accounting Standards Update ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds ASU 2010-10 defers the
application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 

F-12 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that is not subject to ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The PB of a VIE that meets the
conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses, receives a majority of the
entity s expected residual returns, or both. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities . To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over
the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. 
 The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or
limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities ASC 810-20 ), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether
other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or to otherwise remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member
without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle.
 Retention of Specialized Accounting Principles. Upon consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized
accounting principles of the underlying funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments fair values
reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another
accounting method if the Company still maintains an investment.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities . Separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The separate account assets are not subject to
general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These separate account assets and the related equal and offsetting liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial
condition in accordance with the ASC 944-80, Financial Services Separate Accounts. The net investment income attributable to separate
account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrue directly to the contract owner and are not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these separate account assets and
liabilities, BlackRock earns policy administration and management fees associated with these products, which are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.
 Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements . The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements
whereby securities held by separate account assets maintained by BlackRock s life insurance company are lent to third parties. In exchange, the Company receives collateral with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the
value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. Under the Company s securities lending arrangements, the Company can resell or re-pledge the collateral and the borrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned securities. The
securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales under ASC
860, Transfers and Servicing. As a result of the Company s ability to resell or re-pledge the collateral, the Company records on the
consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under these arrangements (both cash and non-cash) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate account assets was approximately 21.0 billion and 19.5 billion, respectively, and the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately
 23.0 billion and 20.9 billion, respectively. During 2012 and 2011, the Company had not sold or re-pledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements.

F-13 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
 Deferred Sales Commissions . The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored
mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge back-end load shares ). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees
from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions CDSCs upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares that are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs,
the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of
deferred commission assets to determine whether a significant decline in the equity or bond markets or other events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. If indicators of a potential impairment exist, the Company compares
the carrying value of the asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. If such assessments indicate that the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the recorded carrying
value, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. No such impairments were recorded for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Property and
Equipment . Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally determined by cost less any estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software that is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. In accordance with
ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software ASC 350-40 ), the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and
equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized, beginning when the software project is complete and put into production, over the estimated useful life of the software of approximately three years. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In its
assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the

book value and market capitalization of the Company. On a quarterly basis, the Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a potential goodwill impairment. If a
triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which include reviews of all significant valuation assumptions, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an impairment assessment of its goodwill at least
annually, as of July 31st. Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a
business combination. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds, closed-end funds and collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as
indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii) the
Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation;
(iv) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered
indefinite-lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles 
Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of contracts for separately managed accounts and certain funds, which have finite lives, are amortized over the expected lives
of the management contracts. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and
whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. The carrying value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may
indicate a potential impairment. The Company performs such impairment assessments of its intangible assets including indefinite-lived management contracts and trade names/trademarks, at least annually, as of July 31 st . In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant
factors including assets under management AUM ), revenue basis points,

F-14 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration
in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in
which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific
events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs. If
potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the
impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. 
 Non-controlling Interests. According to the requirements within ASC 810-10, the Company reports non-controlling interests as equity, separate from
the parent s equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Company s consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest
holders of the Company s consolidated sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations CLOs ). Income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests is not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated sponsored
investment funds and CLOs that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes. Classification and Measurement of Redeemable
Securities. The Company includes redeemable non-controlling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment funds in temporary equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 Appropriated Retained Earnings . Upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest
Entities ASU 2009-17 on January 1, 2010, BlackRock consolidated three CLOs and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statement of financial condition equal to the
difference

between the fair value of the CLOs assets and the fair value of their liabilities. Such amounts are recorded as appropriated retained earnings as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock,
ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2009-17, the net change in the fair value of the CLOs assets and liabilities has been recorded as
net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests and as an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings. In addition, in 2011, BlackRock consolidated additional CLOs, resulting in 19 million of additional appropriated
retained earnings upon the initial consolidation. Treasury Stock . The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the
date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock using the average cost method. Revenue Recognition
 Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue . Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as
the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, committed capital, or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties.
Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment
funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third
parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In
certain cases, the fund (primarily international funds) takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance
with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations, and has recorded its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 793 million, 928 million and 831 million, respectively, and
were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.

F-15 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
 The Company also earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage
institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. 
 Investment Advisory Performance Fees . The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or an incentive allocation from certain actively managed
investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies
by product or account. The Company may receive carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock
may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash on the consolidated statements
of financial condition to the extent that it is distributed. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically
improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the
Company had 97 million and 33 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory . BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension
funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation
assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all,
of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform,

(ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are recorded in BlackRock 
 Solutions and advisory on the consolidated statements of income. Other Revenue . The Company earns fees for transition management services
comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Company s customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities
transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns commissions revenue upon the sale of
unit trusts and Class A mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product. Other revenue also includes
equity method investment earnings related to operating advisory company investments and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath products, which are
exchange-traded notes issued by Barclays. Stock-based Compensation . The Company applies ASC 718-10, Compensation Stock
Compensation ASC 718-10 ), which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting
period) in exchange for the stock-based award. The Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units RSUs using the
Company s share price on the date of grant. For employee share options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for
an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Company s stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods.
Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of
awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

F-16 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
 The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement-eligible
employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period, if applicable. 
 Distribution and Servicing Costs . Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties and related parties, including Bank of
America/Merrill Lynch Co., Inc. Merrill Lynch ), PNC and Barclays, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when
incurred. Direct Fund Expenses . Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, primarily consist of third-party non-advisory
expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services,
audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. Leases .
The Company accounts for its operating leases, which may include escalation clauses, in accordance with ASC 840-10, Leases . The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including
rent-free periods) commencing when the Company obtains control over the leased property. Foreign Exchange . Monetary assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having
non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into
U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions of (8) million, (1) million and 6 million, respectively. 
 Income Taxes . The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC

740-10, Income Taxes ASC 740-10 ). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management periodically assesses the
recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is
not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This
allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position. Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not
have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit, or shortfall, between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December 31,
2012 and 2011, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential future deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits. Earnings per Share EPS . EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share ASC 260-10 ), which specifies that all
outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The
dilutive effect of outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that are considered non-participating securities are calculated under the treasury stock method. The Company presents both basic and diluted EPS amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to shareholders, excluding participating securities, by the

F-17 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

weighted-average number of shares outstanding. The Company s participating securities consist of its unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or
dividend equivalents. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the impact of other potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated under
the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or the two-class method. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 0.2 million of participating securities. The majority of these participating securities vested on
January 31, 2013. Due to the similarities in terms among each series of BlackRock s non-voting participating preferred stock and the
Company s common stock, the Company considers each series of its non-voting participating preferred stock to be common stock equivalents for purposes of EPS calculations. Business Segments . The Company s management directs BlackRock s operations as one business, the asset management business. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in
ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting ASC 280-10 ). Business Combinations . The Company accounts for business
combinations in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ). The fundamental requirement of ASC 805 is that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business
combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The provisions of ASC 805 define the acquirer, establish the acquisition date and define transactions that qualify as business combinations. 
 Additionally, the requirements of ASC 805 provide guidance for measuring the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in
the acquiree, provide guidance for the measurement of fair value in a step acquisition, provide guidance for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed subject to contingencies, provide guidance on recognition and measurement of contingent
consideration and require that acquisition-related costs of the acquirer generally be expensed as incurred. Reversal of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to
tax positions assumed in business combinations subsequent to the adoption of the requirements of ASC 805, will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal or change.

Fair Value Measurements. Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs . The provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ), establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities
measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs:
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. 

Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment
companies that have publicly available net asset values NAVs ), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain
exchange-traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can
determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a
practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. 

Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge
funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted
public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and

F-18 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data. 
 Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs
for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
Certain investments that are valued using a NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. 

Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and
funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bank loans and bonds. 

Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon non-binding single-broker quotes. 

Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real
estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. Significance of Inputs .
The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 
 Valuation Techniques. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including
NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party
pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment and other analytical procedures. As a practical expedient, the Company
relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real
estate and private equity funds, which may be

adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies
established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third-party sources. However, in some instances,
current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are
not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments. 
 A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices
obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually,
BlackRock s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In
addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors processes. In addition,
quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the
Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Fair Value Option . ASC
825-10, Financial Instruments ASC 825-10 ), provides a fair value option election that allows companies an irrevocable election to use fair value as the initial and subsequent accounting measurement attribute for certain financial
assets and liabilities. ASC 825-10 permits entities to elect to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an ongoing basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported
in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis, must be applied to an entire instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to ASC
825-10 are required to be reported 

F-19 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

separately from those instruments measured using another accounting method. Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities . ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815-10 ), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts
and for hedging activities. ASC 815-10 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and to measure those investments at fair value. 
 The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for
purposes of hedging: (i) exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities, (ii) market exposures for certain seed investments and (iii) future cash flows on floating rate notes. The
Company may also use derivatives within separate account assets, which are segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in
derivatives as a part of their investment strategy. Changes in the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments are generally
recognized in current earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income. 
 Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2012 
 Amendments to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted the applicable provisions of ASU 2011-04, Fair
Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ASU 2011-04 ). Among other things, ASU 2011-04 clarified existing fair value measurement guidance and required
enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not materially impact the consolidated financial statements.

Amendments on Testing Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. On July 27, 2012, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment ASU 2012-02 ), which amends the guidance in ASC 350-30 on testing indefinite-lived intangible
assets, other than goodwill, for impairment. Under ASU 2012-02, an entity testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset. If the entity
determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) impaired, the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of
the asset. The Company s adoption of ASU 2012-02 during 2012 did not impact its consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. On December 16, 2011, the FASB
issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ASU 2011-11 ), which creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with
its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The provisions of ASU 2011-11 are effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013 with retrospective application required. On January 31, 2013, the FASB
issued ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ASU 2013-01 that provides clarification about which instruments and transactions are subject to ASU 2011-11. The adoption of ASU
2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are not expected to materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive Income. On
February 5, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ASU 2013-02 ). ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirement for reporting net income or
other comprehensive income but requires additional disclosures about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2013 and is not expected
to have a material impact on the consolidated statements.

Consolidated sponsored investment funds include third-party private equity funds, direct investments in private companies and
third-party hedge funds held by BlackRock sponsored investment funds. Equity method investments primarily include BlackRock s direct investment in
certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds. Cost method investments include non-marketable securities, including Federal Reserve Bank FRB stock, which is held for regulatory purposes and is restricted from sale. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no indicators of impairment on these investments. The decrease in cost method investments from
December 31, 2011 was primarily due to a lower holding requirement of FRB stock held by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Carried interest
represents allocations to BlackRock general partner capital accounts for certain funds. These balances are subject to change upon cash distributions, additional allocations, or reallocations back to limited partners within the respective funds.

4. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds 
 The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds in accordance with GAAP. The
investments owned by these consolidated sponsored investment funds are classified as trading or other investments. The following table presents the balances related to these consolidated funds that were included on the consolidated statements of
financial condition as well as BlackRock s net interest in these funds:

BlackRock s total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment funds of 430 million and 475 million at

December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, represents the value of the Company s economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with these
consolidated investment funds are reflected in non-operating income (expense) and partially offset in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the portion not attributable to BlackRock. 
 In addition, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, several consolidated CLOs and one investment fund, which were deemed to be VIEs, were excluded from the balances
in the table above as the balances for these investment products are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6, Variable Interest Entities, for further discussion on these consolidated funds. 
 The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In
addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company s operations.

5. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) 
 
 Level 3 Assets. Level 3 assets recorded within investments of 679 million at December 31, 2012 primarily
related to equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds. Level 3 assets within investments, except for direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds described below, were primarily valued based
upon NAVs received from internal as well as third-party fund managers. Direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds
totaled 56 million at December 31, 2012. Direct investments in private equity companies may be valued using the market approach or the income approach, or a combination thereof, and were valued based on an assessment of each underlying
investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third-party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies, market indices, assumptions relating to appropriate risk adjustments
for nonperformance and legal restrictions on disposition, among other factors. The fair value derived from the methods used are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated. Under the market
approach, fair value may be determined by reference to multiples of market-comparable companies or transactions, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples. Under the income approach, fair
value may be determined by discounting the cash flows to a single present amount using current market expectations about those future amounts.

Unobservable inputs used in a discounted cash flow model may include projections of operating performance generally covering a five-year period and a terminal value of the private equity direct
investment. For securities utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate, risk premium or discount for lack of marketability in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher)
fair value measurement. For securities utilizing the market comparable companies valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple in isolation could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
 Level 3 assets recorded within separate account assets include single-broker non-binding quotes for fixed income securities and equity securities that
have unobservable inputs due to certain corporate actions. Level 3 assets of consolidated VIEs include bank loans and bonds valued based on
single-broker non-binding quotes and direct private equity investments and private equity funds valued based upon valuations received from internal as well as third-party fund managers, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market
indices. Level 3 Liabilities. Level 3 liabilities recorded as borrowings of consolidated VIEs include CLO borrowings valued based upon
single-broker non-binding quotes.

 Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains
(losses) recorded for Level 3 assets and liabilities are reported in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated investments and all of the net income (loss) for
consolidated VIEs are allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company. Transfers in and/or out
of Levels. Transfers in and/or out of levels are reflected when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable / unobservable, or when the Company determines it has
the ability, or no longer has the ability, to redeem, in the near term, certain investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account), or when the book value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as
determined under fair value methodologies. Separate Account Assets . In 2012, there were 48 million of transfers of equity securities
from Level 1 into Level 3. These transfers into Level 3 were primarily due to market inputs no longer being considered observable. In 2012, there were
 9 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 1 related to equity securities held within separate accounts. The transfers out of Level 3 were due to availability of observable market inputs. 
 In 2011, there were 87 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to debt securities held within separate account assets. In addition, there were 9
million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 1 related to equity securities. The transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/ unavailability of market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers.

In 2011, there were 38 million of transfers of equity securities into Level 3 from Level 1. The transfers into Level
3 were primarily due to market inputs no longer being considered observable. Assets of Consolidated VIEs . In 2012, there were 113
million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to bank loans. In addition, in 2012, there were 101 million of transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 related to bank loans. The transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/
unavailability of observable market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers. In 2011, there were 51 million of transfers out of
Level 3 to Level 2 related to loans. In addition, in 2011, there were 85 million and 39 million of transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 related to loans and bonds, respectively. The transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/
unavailability of observable market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers. Significant Other Settlements. For 2012 and 2011,
there were 89 million and 38 million of distributions from equity method investees categorized in Level 3, respectively. During 2012, other
settlements included 1,011 million of proceeds from borrowings of consolidated CLOs. During 2011, other settlements included 412 million of
borrowings of consolidated VIEs related to the consolidation of one additional CLO.

 Cash and cash equivalents are carried at either cost or amortized cost that approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. At December 31, 2012
and December 31, 2011, approximately 133 million and 196 million, respectively, related to cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds. Money market funds are valued through the use of quoted market prices, or
 1.00, which generally is the NAV of the fund. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, approximately 98 million and 123 million, respectively, of money market funds were recorded within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated
statements of financial condition. 

(2) 
 The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, due from related parties, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and short-term borrowings
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 

(3) 
 Long-term borrowings are recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of the long-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term borrowings, is
estimated using market prices at the end of December 2012 and December 2011, respectively. See Note 11, Borrowings, for the fair value of the Company s long-term borrowings. 
 Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share
 As a practical expedient to value certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and have attributes of an investment
company, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The following table lists information regarding all investments that use a fair value measurement to account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities in
their calculation of a NAV per share (or its equivalent).

 Comprised of equity method investments, which include investment companies, which in accordance with GAAP account for both their financial assets and financial
liabilities under fair value measures; therefore, the Company s investment in such equity method investees approximates fair value. 

(a) 
 This category includes consolidated offshore feeder funds that invest in master funds with multiple equity strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments in
this category have been estimated using the NAV of master offshore funds held by the feeder funds. Investments in this category can be redeemed at any time, as long as there are no restrictions in place by the underlying master funds.
 
 F-32 

5. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) 

(b) 
 This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity funds of funds. The fair values of the investments
in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for
certain funds, the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are
received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately seven and eight years at December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively. The total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were 32 million and 44 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The Company was contractually obligated to
fund 30 million and 33 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 to the consolidated funds, while the remaining unfunded balances in the tables above are required to be funded by capital contributions from non-controlling
interest holders. 

(c) 
 This category includes consolidated funds of hedge funds that invest in multiple strategies to diversify risks. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using the
NAV of the fund s ownership interest in partners capital of each fund in the portfolio. The majority of the underlying funds can be redeemed as long as there are no restrictions in place. At December 31, 2012, the underlying funds
that are currently restricted from redemptions within one year will be redeemable in approximately 12 to 24 months. This category also includes a consolidated offshore feeder fund that invests in a master fund with multiple alternative investment
strategies. The fair value of this investment in this category has been estimated using the NAV of the master offshore fund held by the feeder fund. The investment is currently subject to restrictions in place by the underlying master fund.

(d) 
 This category includes hedge funds and funds of hedge funds that invest primarily in equities, fixed income securities, distressed credit and mortgage instruments and other
third-party hedge funds. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using the NAV of the Company s ownership interest in partners capital. It was estimated that the investments in the funds that are not subject to redemption
will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately five and six years at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. 

(e) 
 This category includes several private equity funds that initially invest in non-marketable securities of private companies, which ultimately may become public in the future. The
fair values of these investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company s ownership interest in the funds as well as other performance inputs. The Company s investment in each fund is not subject to redemption
and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the private equity funds. It was estimated that the investments in these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of
approximately five and six years at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. 

(f) 
 This category includes several real estate funds that invest directly in real estate and real estate related assets. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using
capital accounts representing the Company s ownership interest in the funds. The majority of the Company s investments are not subject to redemption or is not currently redeemable and is normally returned through distributions as a result
of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the real estate funds. It was estimated that the investments in these funds not subject to redemptions will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately eight and seven years at
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. 

(g) 
 This category includes investments in certain hedge funds that invest in energy and health science related equity securities. The fair values of the investments have been
estimated using capital accounts representing the Company s ownership interest in partners capital as well as performance inputs. The investments in these funds will be liquidated upon settlement of certain deferred compensation
liabilities. 

(h) 
 This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within one consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity fund of funds. The fair values of the
investments in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption;
however, for certain funds the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying third-party funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment
by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately three and four years at
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were 1 million and 2 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, which commitments are
required to be funded by capital contributions from non-controlling interest holders. 
 F-33 

5. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) 
 
 Fair Value Option. Upon initial consolidation of CLOs, the Company elects to adopt the fair value
option provisions for eligible assets and liabilities, including bank loans and borrowings of the CLOs to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities and to achieve operational simplification. To the
extent there is a difference between the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities, the difference will be reflected as net income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income and
offset by a change in appropriated retained earnings on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The following table summarizes information
related to those assets and liabilities selected for fair value accounting as of December 31, 2012 and 2011: 

(Dollar amounts in millions)

 At December 31, 2012, the principal amounts outstanding of the borrowings issued by the CLOs mature between 2016 and 2025.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the change in fair value of the bank loans and bonds held by the CLOs resulted in a 154
million gain, a 57 million gain and a 148 million gain, respectively, which were offset by a 166 million loss, a 68 million loss and a 175 million loss, respectively, from the change in fair value of the CLO borrowings. 
 The net gains (losses) were recorded in net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of income. 
 The change in fair value of the assets and liabilities included interest income and expense, respectively. 
 6. Variable Interest Entities 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including CDOs/CLOs and sponsored
investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. The Company receives advisory fees and/or other incentive-related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of
which are considered variable interests. The Company enters into these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by equity and debt
holders. The Company s involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is generally limited to its equity interests. In order to determine
whether the Company is the PB of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows of the VIEs. Assumptions made in such analyses may include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market
interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, pre-payments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain
other outcomes. See Note 2 for more information. 

F-34 

6. Variable Interest Entities (continued) 
 
 Consolidated VIEs . Consolidated VIEs included CLOs in which BlackRock did not have an investment;
however, BlackRock, as the collateral manager, was deemed to have both the power to control the activities of the CLOs and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs. In addition, BlackRock was the PB of one
investment fund, which absorbed the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in
these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the following balances related to VIEs were consolidated on the consolidated statements of financial condition: 

(Dollar amounts in millions)

nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. During 2011, the Company recorded an 18 million non-operating loss offset by an 18 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the
consolidated statements of income. During 2010, the Company recorded a 35 million non-operating loss offset by a 35 million net loss attributable to nonredeemable non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. 
 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the weighted-average maturity of the bank loans and bonds was approximately 4.5 years and 4.2 years, respectively.

 At both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, BlackRock s maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily related to:
(i) advisory fee receivables; (ii) BlackRock s investments; and (iii) 17 million of credit protection sold by BlackRock to a third party in a synthetic CDO transaction. 

The net assets related to the above CDOs/CLOs and other sponsored investment funds, including collective trusts, that
the Company does not consolidate were as follows: CDOs/CLOs

at December 31, 2012 and 1.2 trillion to 1.3 trillion at December 31, 2011. Net assets included 1.3 trillion and 1.0 trillion of collective trusts at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Each collective
trust has been aggregated separately and may include collective trusts that invest in other collective trusts. The net assets of these VIEs primarily are comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investments offset by liabilities primarily
comprised of various accruals for the sponsored investment vehicles.

7. Derivatives and Hedging 
 In May 2011, the Company entered into a designated cash flow hedge consisting of a 750 million interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge
future cash flows on the Company s floating rate notes due in 2013. Interest on this swap is at a fixed rate of 1.03 payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year and commenced November 24, 2011. See Note 11,
Borrowings, for more information. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was not material. The Company
maintains a program to enter into total return swaps to hedge against market price exposures with respect to certain seed investments in sponsored investment products. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had 21 and six outstanding total
return swaps, respectively, with an aggregate notional value of approximately 206 million and 43 million, respectively. The fair value of the outstanding total return swaps as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was not material. 
 Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange
rates. The Company manages certain exposure to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degrees of market risk that may be undertaken. At December 31,
2012, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts

F-36 

7. Derivatives and Hedging (continued) 

with an aggregate notional value of approximately 79 million. The fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts as of December 31, 2012 was not material. At
December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company entered into a credit default
swap, providing credit protection to the counterparty of approximately 17 million, representing the Company s maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. The Company carries the credit default swap at fair
value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement.

On behalf of clients of the Company s registered life insurance company, which maintains separate accounts
representing segregated funds held for the purpose of funding individual and group pension contracts, the Company invests in various derivative instruments, which may include futures, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps
and inflation rate swaps. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to derivatives held by separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owners and are not reported in the consolidated statements of income.

The following table presents the carrying value
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments:

The fair value of the derivatives held by separate account assets is equal and offset by a separate account
liability. Gains (losses) on total return swaps are recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income and were (23)
million, 4 million and (2) million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Gains (losses) on the interest rate swap entered into in 2011 were not
material for 2012 and 2011. Gains (losses) on the forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not material for 2012 and 2011, and were 5 million for 2010. Gains (losses) on the credit default swap were not material for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds, which may utilize derivative instruments as a part of
the fund s investment strategy. The fair value of such derivatives at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was not material. The change in fair value of such derivatives, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense), was not material for
2012, 2011 and 2010.

(1) 
 Amount represents goodwill resulting from the Company s acquisition of the Canadian exchange-traded products ETP provider, Claymore
Investments, Inc. (the Claymore Transaction on March 7, 2012 for approximately 212 million. 

(2) 
 Amount represents goodwill resulting from the Company s acquisition of the European private equity and infrastructure funds of funds of Swiss Re Private
Equity Partners (the SRPEP Transaction on September 4, 2012. 

(3) 
 The decrease in goodwill during 2012 and 2011 primarily resulted from a decline related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book
goodwill from the acquisition of the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (the Quellos Transaction ). Goodwill related to the Quellos Transaction will continue to be reduced in future periods by the amount of tax benefits realized
from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction. The balance of the Quellos tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill was approximately 324 million and 355 million as of December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively. In 2012, the decrease in Quellos goodwill was partially offset by a 10 million increase related to the release of the remaining common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction.

The impairment tests performed for goodwill as of July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 indicated that no impairment
charges were required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with

closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. As of December 31, 2012 the Company s common stock closed at 206.71, which exceeded its book value per share
of approximately 148.20 after excluding appropriated retained earnings.

11. Borrowings 
 Short-Term Borrowings The carrying
value of short-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 and 2011, included 100 million under the 2012 revolving credit facility and 100 million under the 2011 revolving credit facility, respectively. 
 2012 Revolving Credit Facility . In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year 3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2011 credit
facility ). In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to 3.785 billion (the 2012 credit
facility ). The 2012 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional 1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2012 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed 4.785 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2012 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of
net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2012.

The 2012 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and

million. During 2012, 500 million of 2.25 Notes were repaid. 2015 and 2022 Notes. In May 2012, the Company issued 1.5 billion in aggregate
principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including 750 million of 1.375 notes maturing in June 2015 (the 2015 Notes and 750 million of 3.375 
notes maturing in June 2022 (the 2022 Notes ). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015
Notes and the 2022 Notes of approximately 10 million and 25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be
redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make-whole redemption price. The make-whole redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022
Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security.
The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes were issued at a discount of 5 million that is being amortized over the term of the notes. The Company incurred approximately 7 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over the respective terms of
the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2012, 6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt
securities including 750 million of 4.25 notes and 750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock s Series B Preferred from
affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25 notes due in 2021 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011, and is approximately 32 million per
year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 2013 Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to
maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company

at a make-whole redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Company s option before maturity. The 2021 Notes were issued at a discount of 4 million
that is being amortized over the term of the notes. The Company incurred approximately 7 million of debt issuance costs for the 1.5 billion note issuances, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes. As of December 31,
2012, 4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition. In May 2011, in
conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a 750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03 payable semi-annually on
May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced on November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25 senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the 2017

the Company at a make-whole redemption price. The 2017 Notes were issued at a discount of 6 million, which is being amortized over their ten-year term. The Company incurred approximately 4 million of debt issuance costs, which are
being amortized over ten years. As of December 31, 2012, 2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes.

used to repay borrowings under the CP Program, which was used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors BGI from Barclays on December 1, 2009 (the BGI Transaction ), and for general corporate
purposes. In 2012, approximately 96 million of interest was paid. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately 35 million and 50 million per

Rent expense and certain office equipment expense under agreements amounted to 133 million, 154 million and 158 million in 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively. Investment Commitments . At December 31, 2012, the Company had 235 million of various capital
commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds
as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at
any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which
are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.

Contingencies Contingent Payments. The Company acts as the portfolio manager in a series of credit default swap transactions and has a maximum potential exposure of 17 million under a credit default swap between the
Company and counterparty. See Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging, for further discussion of this transaction and the related commitment. Legal
Proceedings. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other
investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation
arising in connection with BlackRock s activities. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in
the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that
the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or
threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock s results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot
reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of
business, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot
be determined. In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients
against potential loss resulting from a borrower s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the
borrower s obligation under the securities lending agreement. As part of the BGI

F-42 

12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) 

acquisition, Barclays was contractually obligated to continue providing counterparty default indemnification to several BlackRock securities lending clients through December 1, 2012.
BlackRock assumed these indemnification obligations prior to or upon the expiration of Barclays indemnification obligation. As of December 31, 2012, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for loan balances of approximately
 99.5 billion. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material to the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2012. The Company expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time. 
 Under the transaction agreement in the BGI Transaction, the Company agreed to indemnify Barclays for losses it may incur arising from (1) breach by the
Company of certain representations, (2) breach by the Company of any covenant in the agreement, (3) liabilities of the entities acquired in the transaction other than liabilities assumed by Barclays or for which it is providing
indemnification, and (4) certain taxes. Management believes that the likelihood of any liability arising under the BGI Transaction indemnification
provisions is remote. Management cannot estimate any potential maximum exposure due both to the remoteness of any potential claims and the fact that items that would be included within any such calculated claim would be beyond
the control of BlackRock. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Stock Award and Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the BlackRock, Inc. 1999 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the Award
Plan ), options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price not less than the market value of BlackRock s common stock on

the date of grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock or RSUs may be granted to employees and non-employee directors. A maximum of 27,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized for
issuance under the Award Plan. Of this amount, 5,447,427 shares remain available for future awards at December 31, 2012. Upon exercise of employee stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the vesting of RSUs, the Company issues shares
out of treasury to the extent available. Restricted Stock and RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, restricted stock grants and RSUs may be
granted to certain employees. Substantially all restricted stock and RSUs vest over periods ranging from one to five years and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the
award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. Prior to 2009, the Company awarded restricted stock and RSUs with nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights. Restricted stock and RSUs awarded beginning in 2009 are not considered
participating securities for purposes of calculating EPS as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.

13. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) 
 
 The awards granted under the Award Plan primarily related to the following: 
 2010 

846,884 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; 

455,288 RSUs to employees that cliff vested on January 31, 2012, the end of the service condition, as BlackRock had actual GAAP EPS in excess of 6.13 in
2010. The RSUs may not be sold before the one-year anniversary of the vesting date; 

1,497,222 RSUs to employees that vest 50 on both January 31, 2013 and 2014, the end of the service condition, as BlackRock had actual GAAP EPS in excess of
 6.13 in 2010; and 

124,575 shares of restricted common stock to employees that vested in tranches on January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The restricted common stock may not be
sold before the one-year anniversary of each vesting date. 2011 

1,594,259 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and 

609,733 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100 on January 31, 2014. 2012 

1,365,691 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and 

418,038 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100 on January 31, 2015. At December 31, 2012, there was 291 million in total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining
weighted-average period of 0.9 years. 2013 In January 2013, the Company granted the following awards under the Award Plan: 

1,172,381 RSUs to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and 

370,812 RSUs to employees that cliff vest 100 on January 31, 2016.

Market Performance-based RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, market performance-based RSUs may be granted
to certain employees. The market performance-based RSUs require that separate 15 , 25 and 35 share price appreciation targets be achieved during the six-year term of the awards. The awards are split into three tranches and each tranche may vest if
the specified target increase in share price is met. Eligible delivery dates for each tranche are the fourth, fifth or sixth anniversaries of the grant date and the awards are generally forfeited if the employee leaves BlackRock before the vesting
date. These awards are amortized over a service period of four years, which is the longer of the explicit service period or the period in which the market target is expected to be met. Market performance-based RSUs are not considered participating
securities as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award. In 2012, the Company granted 616,117 market performance-based RSUs, which will primarily be funded by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term
Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below). Market performance-based RSU activity for 2012 is summarized below:

 At December 31, 2012, there was 51 million in total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested market performance-based awards. The
unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 3.1 years. The fair value of the
market-performance-based awards at the grant date was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions:

13. Stock-Based Compensation (continued) 
 
 The Company s expected stock volatility assumption was based upon an average of the historical stock price
fluctuations of BlackRock s common stock and an implied volatility at the grant date. The dividend yield assumption was derived using estimated dividends over the expected term and the stock price at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at date of grant. In January 2013, the Company granted 556,581 market performance-based RSUs under the Award
Plan, which will primarily be funded by shares currently held by PNC (see Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC below). Long-Term
Incentive Plans Funded by PNC. Under a share surrender agreement, PNC committed to provide up to 4 million shares of BlackRock stock, held by PNC, to fund certain BlackRock long-term incentive plans LTIP ). The current share
surrender agreement commits PNC to provide BlackRock series C non-voting participating preferred stock to fund the remaining committed shares. During 2007 through 2011, approximately 2.5 million shares were surrendered by PNC. 
 At December 31, 2012, the remaining shares committed by PNC of approximately 1.5 million were available to fund future long-term incentive awards,
including approximately 1.2 million RSU s with market conditions granted in January 2012 and January 2013. In January 2013, approximately
0.2 million shares, which were committed as of December 31, 2012, vested and were funded by PNC. Stock Options. Stock option
grants were made to certain employees pursuant to the Award Plan in 1999 through 2007. Options granted have a ten-year life, vested ratably over periods ranging from two to five years and became exercisable upon vesting. The Company has not granted
any stock options subsequent to the January 2007 grant, which vested on September 29, 2011. Stock option activity for 2012 is summarized below:

 As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock
options. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ). The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company s common stock
at 95 of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month offering period. In accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation, the Company does not record compensation expense related to employees purchasing
shares under the ESPP. 
 14. Employee Benefit Plans 
 Deferred Compensation Plans 
 Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan VDCP that allows participants to elect to
defer between 1 and 100 of their annual cash incentive compensation. The participants must specify a deferral period of one, three, five or ten years. The Company funds the obligation through the establishment of a rabbi trust on behalf of the
plan s participants. Rabbi Trust. The rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with assets totaling 59 million as of both December 31,
2012 and 2011, is reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading and other investments. The corresponding liability balance of 60 million and 59 million as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as
non-operating income (expense) and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income. Other Deferred Compensation Plans. The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of

F-45 

14. Employee Benefit Plans (continued) 

providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. For these plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed in cash upon vesting is associated with
investment returns of certain investment funds. The liabilities for these plans were 77 million and 34 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued
compensation and benefits. In January 2013, the Company granted approximately 66 million of additional deferred compensation that will fluctuate with investment returns and will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant. 
 Defined Contribution Plans BlackRock Retirement
Savings Plan. Certain of the Company s employees participate in the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan BRSP ). Two predecessor plans assumed in connection with the BGI Transaction were merged with the BRSP on January 1,
2011. Employee contributions of up to 8 of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code IRC limitations, are matched by the Company at 50 . In addition, the Company will continue to make an annual retirement contribution to eligible participants equal to 3-5 of eligible compensation. 
 Prior to January 1, 2011, employee contributions of up to 6 of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to IRC limitations, were matched by
the Company at 50 . As part of the BRSP, the Company also made an annual retirement contribution on behalf of each eligible participant equal to no less than 3 of eligible compensation, plus an additional amount, determined at the discretion of the
Company, not to exceed 2 of eligible compensation for a total contribution of no more than 5 of eligible compensation. Contributions to the BRSP are made in cash and no new investments in BlackRock stock or matching contributions of stock are
available in the BRSP. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company s expense related to the BRSP was 59 million, 43 million and 35 million,
respectively. In addition, the Company s expense related to the two predecessor plans was 25 million in 2010.

BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan. BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited BIM ), a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, contributes to the BlackRock Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan for all employees of BIM. BIM contributes between 6 and 15 of each employee s eligible compensation. The expense for
this plan was 27 million, 26 million and 22 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Defined Benefit Plans. The Company has
several defined benefit pension plans in Japan and Germany. All accrued benefits under these defined benefit plans are currently frozen and the plans are closed to new participants. The participant benefits under the plans will not change with
salary increases or additional years of service. In conjunction with the BGI Transaction, the Company assumed defined benefit pension plans in Japan

approximately 21 million for both periods and the unfunded obligations were less than 3 million for both periods, which were recorded in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Benefit payments for
the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material. Defined benefit plan assets for the Japan Plan of
approximately 18 million are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve the target investment return
benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities and the funded status of the plan. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. The current target
allocations for the plan assets are 45-50 for U.S. and international equity securities, 50-55 for U.S. and international fixed income securities and 0-5 for cash and cash equivalents.

15. Related Party Transactions (continued) 

and their affiliates to acquire additional shares of BlackRock common stock and preferred stock and to certain other restrictions. The Barclays Stockholder Agreement was terminated on May 29,
2012. In addition, Barclays and certain of its affiliates have been engaged by the Company to provide the use of certain indices for certain BlackRock
investment funds and for a fee to provide indemnification to clients related to potential losses in connection with lending of client securities. For the five months ended May 31, 2012, and the full years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
fees incurred for these agreements were 9 million, 18 million and 14 million and were recorded within direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, respectively. Certain Agreements and Arrangements with PNC and Merrill Lynch PNC. On February 27, 2009,
BlackRock entered into an amended and restated implementation and stockholder agreement with PNC, and a third amendment to the share surrender agreement with PNC. See Note 17, Capital Stock, for further discussion. 
 The changes contained in the amended and restated stockholder agreement with PNC, in relation to the prior agreement, among other things, (i) revised the
definitions of Fair Market Value, Ownership Cap, Ownership Percentage, Ownership Threshold and Significant Stockholder and (ii) amended or supplemented certain other provisions
therein to incorporate series B preferred stock and series C preferred stock, respectively. The amendment to the share surrender agreement with PNC
provided for the substitution of series C preferred stock for the shares of common stock subject to the share surrender agreement. In June 2009, in
connection with the BGI Transaction, certain additional amendments were made to the amended and restated stockholder agreement with PNC. The amended
and restated stockholder agreement with PNC was changed to, among other things, (i) revise the definitions of Ownership Cap and Ownership Threshold, (ii) amend or supplement certain other definitions and provisions
therein to incorporate series D participating preferred stock, (iii) provide that none of the transfer restriction provisions set forth in the amended and restated stockholder agreement with PNC apply to the shares purchased by PNC as part of
the financing for the BGI Transaction, (iv) amend the provision relating to the

composition of BlackRock s Board of Directors and (v) provide that the amended and restated stockholder agreement with PNC shall terminate upon the later of (A) the five year
anniversary of the amended and restated stockholder agreement with PNC and (B) the first date on which PNC and its affiliates beneficially own less than 5 of the outstanding BlackRock capital stock, subject to certain other conditions
specified therein. Merrill Lynch. In November 2010, in connection with the secondary offering by Bank of America of shares of BlackRock s
common stock, the Company entered into an amended and restated stockholder agreement and an amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch. The changes to the stockholder agreement with Merrill Lynch provide, among other things, for the following: (i) a reduction in the number of directors Merrill Lynch is entitled to designate upon its holding
falling below 10 and 5 thresholds, (ii) a reduction of the cap on total ownership of BlackRock capital stock, (iii) restrictions on Merrill Lynch transferring any shares until November 15, 2011 and (iv) the setting of a
termination date of the agreement to July 31, 2013. The global distribution agreement provides a framework under which Merrill Lynch provides
distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock investment advisory products. The amendment to the global distribution agreement clarifies certain economic arrangements with respect to revenue neutrality across BlackRock
products distributed by Merrill Lynch. During 2010, the total amount of related party transactions expensed by BlackRock through November 2010 related
to Merrill Lynch distribution and servicing of products covered by the global distribution agreement, including mutual funds, separate accounts, liquidity funds, alternative investments and insurance products, was approximately 210 million.

awards issued to former MLIM employees who became BlackRock employees subsequent to the MLIM Transaction. Reimbursements amounted to 50 of the total amount of awards to former MLIM employees between 100 million and 200 million. The Company
invoiced Merrill Lynch following its determination of the portion of awards entitled to reimbursement for a given calendar year. Through January 2007, the Company had issued total eligible incentive compensation to qualified employees in excess of
 200 million. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, Merrill Lynch

 16. Net Capital Requirements 
 The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained
by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents.
Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.

Banking Regulatory Requirements. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. BTC ), a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum
capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines
and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, BTC must meet specific capital guidelines that invoke quantitative measures of BTC s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory
accounting practices. BTC s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require BTC to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios. Based on
BTC s calculations as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, it exceeded the applicable capital adequacy requirements.

18. Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reduced its workforce globally by approximately 3.4 . This action was the result of a cost cutting initiative designed to streamline operations, enhance
competitiveness and better position the Company in the asset management marketplace. The Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately 32 million 22 million after-tax) during 2011. This charge was comprised of 24
million of severance and associated outplacement costs and 8 million of expenses related to the accelerated amortization of previously granted equity-based compensation awards. The following table presents a rollforward of the Company s restructuring liability, which is included within other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition:

Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or
liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are shown below:

(5,317) 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2012,
the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of 4 million and 5,293 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Company
recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of 6 million and 5,323 million, respectively.

During 2012, tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from
changes in the Company s organizational structure primarily resulted in a 50 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. In 2011, an enacted state tax law and a state tax election went into effect, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets, which
resulted in a 52 million and 91 million tax benefit, respectively. In addition, the United Kingdom and Japan enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities
primarily related to acquired intangible assets, which resulted in a 60 million and 13 million tax benefit, respectively. The Company had a
deferred income tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately 71 million and 110 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, reflecting the Company s conclusion that based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The
Company expects to hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. 
 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had available state net operating loss carryforwards of 842 million and 388 million, respectively, which will
expire on or before 2032. At December 31, 2012, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 152 million of which 36 million expires on or before 2021 and the balance will carry forward indefinitely. In addition, at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had U.S. 

F-54 

19. Income Taxes (continued) 

capital loss carryforwards of 69 million and 90 million, which were acquired in the BGI Transaction and will expire on or before 2013. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had 95 million and 95 million of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
The year-over-year increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to certain foreign deferred income tax assets. Goodwill recorded in connection
with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 9, Goodwill, for further discussion. Current income taxes are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had current income taxes receivable
and payable of 102 million and 121 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of 108
million and 102 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. The Company does not
provide deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over tax basis on its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The excess totaled 2,125 million and 1,516 million as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred income taxes on the excess has not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are 250
million, 226 million and 194 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and
penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of 3 million during 2012 and in total, as of December 31, 2012, had
recognized a liability for interest and penalties of 69 million. The Company accrued interest and penalties of 10 million during 2011 and in total, as of December 31, 2011, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of 66 million.
The Company accrued interest and penalties of 8 million during 2010 and in total, as of December 31, 2010, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of 56 million. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, the
Company has been indemnified by Barclays for 73 million and Guggenheim for 6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. BlackRock is subject to U.S.
federal income tax, state and local income tax, and foreign income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Tax years after 2007 remain open to U.S. federal income tax examination, tax years after 2005 remain open to state and local income tax examination,
and tax years after 2006 remain open to income tax examination in the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2012, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for
years before 2006. The Internal Revenue Service IRS completed its examination of BlackRock s 2006 and 2007 tax years in March 2011.
In November 2011, the IRS commenced its examination of BlackRock s 2008 and 2009 tax years, and while the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material. 
 In July 2011, the IRS commenced its federal income tax audit of the BGI group, which BlackRock acquired in December 2009. The tax years under examination are 2007
through December 1, 2009, and while the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material. The
Company is currently under audit in several state and local jurisdictions. The significant state and local income tax examinations are in California for tax years 2004 through 2006, New York City for tax years 2007 through 2008, and New Jersey for
tax years 2003 through 2009. No state and local income tax audits cover years earlier than 2007 except for California, New Jersey and New York City. No state and local income tax audits are expected to result in an assessment material to the
consolidated financial statements. 

F-55 

19. Income Taxes (continued) 

In December 2009, Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs HMRC commenced its United Kingdom income tax
audit of BlackRock s 2007 through 2010 tax years. While the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material. As of December 31, 2012, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or

decrease within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain
tax positions could decrease by approximately 5 million to 15 million within the next twelve months. The Company does not anticipate that any possible adjustments resulting from these audits would result in a material change to its consolidated
financial statements.

(a) 
 Allocation to common stockholders is based on the total of common and participating security stockholders (which represent unvested RSUs that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends). For 2012, 2011 and 2010, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million, 1.8 million and 2.8 million, respectively. 

Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock non-voting participating preferred stock and the Company s
common stock, the Company considers participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding non-voting participating preferred stock in the calculation of
average basic and diluted shares outstanding. 
 
 For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 449, 5,125 and 1,198,856 RSUs, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted
EPS because to include them would have an anti-dilutive effect. In addition, there were no anti-dilutive stock options for 2012, 2011 and 2010.
