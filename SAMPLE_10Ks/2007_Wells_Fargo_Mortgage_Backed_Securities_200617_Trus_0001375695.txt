Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

1. Pursuant to Subpart 229.1100 - Asset Backed Securities, 17 C.F.R. section
 229. 1100-229.1123 ("Regulation AB"), Regulus Group LLC, for itself and its
 wholly-owned subsidiaries (individually and collectively "Regulus"), is
 responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing criteria
 applicable to the remittance processing services it provides to customers who
 are issuers or servicers of asset backed securities transactions and who have
 requested confirmation of Regulus' compliance in connection with loan and/or
 receivables portfolios that include pool assets for asset backed securities
 transactions (the "Platform"). Remittance processing is a service whereby
 check payments that are remitted by mail to a post office box are collected,
 processed through a highly automated data capture system, and prepared for
 deposit to a bank account held by the beneficiary of the payment.

2. The servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB were used
 in Regulus' assessment of compliance. Regulus has concluded that the
 servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) of
 Regulation AB are applicable to the servicing activities it performs with
 respect to the Platform (such criteria the "Applicable Servicing Criteria").
 Regulus has concluded that the remainder of the servicing criteria set forth
 in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB are inapplicable to the activities it
 performs with respect to the Platform because Regulus does not participate in
 the servicing activities referenced by such servicing criteria.

3. As of and for the year ending December 31, 2006, Regulus has complied in all
 material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth in Item
 1122(d) of Regulation AB.

4. KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
 report on Regulus' assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing
 Criteria as of and for the year ending December 31, 2006. A copy of that
 attestation report is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

EXHIBIT B
to
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s
2006 Certification Regarding Compliance With Applicable Servicing Criteria

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") acknowledges the following material
instances of noncompliance with the applicable servicing criteria:

1. 1122(d)(3)(i) - Delinquency Reporting - For certain loans sub-serviced by
 Wells Fargo or for which servicing rights were acquired on a bulk-acquisition
 basis, Wells Fargo determined that it provided incomplete data to some third
 parties who use such data to calculate delinquency ratios and determine the
 status of loans with respect to bankruptcy, foreclosure or real estate owned.
 The incomplete reporting only affected securitizations that included
 delinquent loans. Instead of the actual due date being provided for use in
 calculating delinquencies, the date of the first payment due to the security
 was provided. Wells Fargo subsequently included additional data in the
 monthly remittance reports, providing the actual borrower due date and unpaid
 principal balance, together with instructions to use these new fields if such
 monthly remittance reports are used to calculate delinquency ratios.

2. 1122(d)(4)(vii) - Notification of Intent to Foreclose - Wells Fargo
 determined that, as required by certain servicing agreements, it did not
 provide investors with prior notification of intent to foreclose. While
 investors received monthly delinquency status reports that listed loans in
 foreclosure, such reports were received after such loans had been referred to
 an attorney. A new process is being implemented to send such notifications if
 contractually required, unless an investor opts out in writing.

Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding
transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or
any government sponsored entity (the "Platform").

Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d),
to the extent required in the related transaction agreements or required by the
Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the

determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with
respect to the Platform (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria").

Period: Twelve months ended December 31, 2006 (the "Period").

Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criteria ("vendors").
The Company has determined that none of the vendors is a "servicer" as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations
("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and procedures in place to
provide reasonable assurance that each vendor's activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.

2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria,
including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on
Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the Period. In performing
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3. Other than as identified on Schedule A hereto, as of and for the Period, the
Company was in material compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Any
material instances of noncompliance by a vendor of which the Company is aware
and any material deficiency in the Company's policies and procedures to monitor
vendors' compliance that the Company has identified is specified on Schedule A
hereto.

KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report with respect to the Company's foregoing assessment of compliance as of
and for the Period.

Commission's Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

For the calendar year ending December 31 2006, or portion thereof (the
"Period"), ZC Sterling Insurance Agency, Inc. ("ZCSIA") has been a subcontractor
for Servicers identified in Appendix A.

The undersigned are Senior Vice Presidents of ZCSIA, have sufficient authority
to make the statements contained in this Assertion and are responsible for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to ZCSIA. ZCSIA has
used the servicing criteria communicated to ZCSIA by the Servicer to assess
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Accordingly, servicing
criteria 1122 (d) 1(iv), 1122 (d) 2(vi), 1122 (d) 4(xi), 1122 (d) 4(xii), and
1122 (d) 4(xiii) are applicable to the activities performed by ZCSIA with
respect to the Platforms covered by this report. The remaining servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB are not applicable to the activities performed by ZCSIA with
respect to the Platform covered by this report. As a subcontractor for Servicer,
ZCSIA has determined that it complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria listed below. ZCSIA engaged Ernst & Young, LLP ("E&Y"), a
registered public accounting firm, to review ZCSIA's assessment, and E&Y has
issued an attestation report on ZCSIA's assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria for the Period.

1. ZCSIA maintained a fidelity bond and errors & omissions policy in effect on
ZCSIA throughout the reporting period in the amount of coverage required by the
transaction agreements between the Servicer and ZCSIA (1122(d)((1)(iv)).

2. To the extent that ZCSIA prints checks for Servicer or otherwise has
Servicer's checks or check stock, unissued checks are safeguarded so as to
prevent unauthorized access (1122(d)(2)(vi)). [AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THIS
PROVISION WILL APPLY ONLY FOR THE FOLLOWING SERVICERS: ABN Amro Mortgage Group,
Inc, Option One Mortgage Corporation, Sun Trust Mortgage, Inc., HomEq Servicing

been received by the Servicer at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to these
dates, or such other number of days specified in the transaction agreements
between Servicer and ZCSIA (1122(d)(4)(xi)).

4. Any late payment penalties in connection with any payment for insurance to be
made on behalf of Servicer's obligor are paid from the Servicer's funds or
ZCSIA's funds and not charged to Servicer's obligor, unless the late payment was
due to the obligor's error or omission (1122(d)(4)(xii)).

5. File(s) provided to Servicer from which Servicer may make disbursements made
on behalf of Servicer's obligor are provided to Servicer on an accurate and

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
HSBC Bank USA N.A.:

We have examined management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report on
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that HSBC Bank USA N.A. (the
Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(1)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for certain mortgage-backed securities, as of and for
the period from April 27, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Appendix A identifies the
individual asset-backed transactions and securities (the Control Transactions)
defined by management as part of their assessment. All other criteria set forth
in Item 1122 of Regulation AB are not applicable to the Company because the
Company does not perform activities with respect to the Control Transactions
relating to those criteria. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Control Transactions, testing of less than all of the servicing
activities related to the Control Transactions, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the period from April 27, 2006
to December 31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

management has informed us have requested confirmation of compliance, included
in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB
Servicing Criteria, that Regulus Group LLC complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for remittance processing services to those
issuers of asset backed securities and servicers of loan and/or receivables
portfolios that include pool assets for asset backed securities transactions
(the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. Regulus Group LLC
has determined that the remainder of the servicing criteria are not applicable
to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and
securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing
activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company
processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited
to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.:

We have examined Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s (the Company) compliance with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for its primary servicing of residential mortgage
loans by its Wells Fargo Home Mortgage division, other than the servicing of
such loans for Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, state and local government
bond programs, or a Federal Home Loan Bank (the Platform), except for servicing
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined
are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for
the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with
the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether
errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.

Our examination disclosed the following instances of material noncompliance with
certain servicing criteria applicable to the Company during the year ended
December 31, 2006:

1. 1122(d)(3)(i) - Delinquency Reporting - The Company provided incomplete data
 to some third parties who use such data to calculate delinquency ratios and
 determine the status of loans with respect to bankruptcy, foreclosure or real
 estate owned. Instead of the actual due date being provided for use in
 calculating delinquencies, the date of the first payment due to the security
 was provided.

2. 1122(d)(4)(vii) - Notification of Intent to Foreclose - The Company, as
 required by certain servicing agreements, did not provide investors with
 prior notification of intent to foreclose.

As described in the accompanying 2006 Certification Regarding Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered "servicers" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"), with the exception of those
vendors who have provided their own reports on assessment of compliance with
servicing criteria to the Company, for which the Company does not take such
responsibility. As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible
for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06
for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we
performed no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply
Interpretation 17.06.

In our opinion, except for the instances of material noncompliance described
above, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the

Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these

as applicable to the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Certain monthly investor or remittance reports included errors in the

Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing
criteria, including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based
on Interpretation 17.06 as discussed above, as of and for the twelve months
