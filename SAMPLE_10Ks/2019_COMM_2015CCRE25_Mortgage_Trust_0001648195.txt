EXPLANATORY NOTES 

 The Heartland Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which constituted
approximately 10.6 of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part
of a loan combination that includes the Heartland Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan which is an asset of the issuing entity and
two other pari passu loans, which are not assets of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the Heartland
Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which
is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the
master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The responsibilities of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
primary servicer of the loan combination with respect to the issuing entity, are subsumed within its responsibilities as master
servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Thus, the servicer compliance statement provided by Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, encompasses its roles as both master servicer and primary
servicer with respect to the loan combination. 

 The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in
their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Pearlridge Center Mortgage Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter
Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 4.3 and 2.5 , respectively, of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off
date. The Pearlridge Center Mortgage Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan are each an asset of the issuing entity
and are each part of a loan combination that includes the Pearlridge Center Mortgage Loan or the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan
and two other pari passu loans and two subordinate companion loans, which are not assets of the issuing entity. A pari
passu portion of each loan combination was securitized in the WP Glimcher Mall Trust 2015-WPG transaction (the JPM
2015-WPG Transaction ). These loan combinations, including the Pearlridge Center Mortgage Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter
Mortgage Loan, are being serviced and administered pursuant to the trust and servicing agreement for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction,
which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KeyBank National Association is the master
servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction. The responsibilities of KeyBank National Association,
as primary servicer of these loan combinations with respect to the issuing entity, are subsumed within its responsibilities as
master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction. Thus, the servicer compliance statement
provided by KeyBank National Association, as master servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement, encompasses its roles
as both master servicer and primary servicer with respect to these loan combinations. 

 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the master servicer of the
mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the certificate administrator of the Pearlridge Center Mortgage
Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is a servicer 
as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans
that constituted 10 or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable
servicing criteria, accountants attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the trustee and custodian
of the Pearlridge Center Mortgage Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
is a servicing function participant in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted
5 or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing
criteria and accountants attestation reports delivered by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association in the capacities described
above are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

 Wilmington Trust, National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage
loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the trustee is required
to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation
AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees
charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, during the reporting
period, the trustee did not perform any servicing function with respect to the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d)(2)(iii)
of Regulation AB. The master servicer or the special servicer, to the extent required, performed the servicing function identified
with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, and each such party included Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB in the
assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant s attestation report for the subject transaction. 
As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of
the trustee. One or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement have delivered
one or more assessments of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. 

 This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc.
and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
(except with respect to those mortgage loans for which KeyBank National Association is the primary servicer) to remit tax payments
received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information,
and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These servicing functions are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items
1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) of Regulation AB. Therefore, under the principles-based definition of servicer 
set forth in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are servicers 
for the purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item
1101(j)). 

 With respect to the pari passu loan combinations that includes
the Scottsdale Quarter Loan, (i) the report on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria and attestation report on assessment
of compliance with servicing criteria of Pacific Life Insurance Company, as special servicer of the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage
Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index is omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is not required to be included on this
Annual Report on Form 10-K per Instruction 3 to Item 1122 of Regulation AB because it is a party performing activities that address
servicing criteria relating to 5 or less of the assets of the issuing entity; and (ii) the servicer compliance statement of Pacific
Life Insurance Company, as special servicer of the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index is omitted from
this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is not required by Item 1123 of Regulation AB to be included on this Annual Report on Form
10-K because it is an unaffiliated party that is not a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through
(iii) of Regulation AB.

 The Heartland Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan (Loan Number 1 on
Annex A-1 of the prospectus supplement of the registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on August 25, 2015 pursuant to Rule
424(b)(5)) constitutes a significant obligor within the meaning of Item 1101(k)(2) of Regulation AB as disclosed in the prospectus
supplement. In accordance with Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB, the most recent unaudited net operating income of the significant
obligor was 21,072,679 for the twelve- month period ended December 31, 2018. 

 Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB, Significant Enhancement Provider

entities provides any external credit enhancement or other support for the certificates within this transaction as described under
Item 1114(a) of Regulation AB.

(Financial Information). 

 No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any derivative
instruments or other support for the certificates within this transaction as described under Item 1115 of Regulation AB. 

 Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

 The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving
the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties,
and the following, with respect to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as certificate administrator and custodian, and Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and custodian: 

 Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees
of certain RMBS trusts. 

 On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by
Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court
alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches
of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage
loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State
Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock
SDNY Case and the other in the Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ).
Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018 and the BlackRock California
Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 

 On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought
by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue.
On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves
as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third
amended complaint brings claims for violation of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence; violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant
of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court
dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the
covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these
claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November
13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for
summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below),
filed a motion for partial summary judgment. 

 On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought
by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank
previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank
filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50
trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings
claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach
of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added
to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as
well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to
preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds
of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January
29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion
for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial
summary judgment. 

 On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016,
IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of
interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and
DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and
June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven trusts. As of March 1, 2019, DBNTC and DBTCA s
motion to dismiss has been briefed and is awaiting decision by the court. 

 It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings
(including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially
affect its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement for this transaction. 

 Since June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors have filed
civil complaints in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and later the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank in its capacity as trustee for certain residential
mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints against Wells Fargo Bank alleged that the trustee caused
losses to investors and asserted causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to: (i) notify
and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify
investors of alleged events of default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief
sought included money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Wells Fargo Bank has reached
an agreement, in which it denies any wrongdoing, to resolve these claims on a classwide basis for the 271 RMBS trusts currently
at issue. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval. Separate lawsuits against Wells Fargo Bank making similar allegations
filed by certain other institutional investors concerning 57 RMBS trusts in New York federal and state court are not covered by
the agreement. With respect to the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends
to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of
the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the RMBS trusts. 

 Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions. 

 The information regarding this Item has been previously provided in
a prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on August 25, 2015 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). 

 Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 

 The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria
for asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the mortgage loans
are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Schedule II to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in
a servicing function for the transaction responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d). 

 The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria
for asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the Pearlridge Center
Mortgage Loan and the Scottsdale Quarter Mortgage Loan, which are being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing
agreement for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction, are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Exhibit
M to the pooling and servicing agreement for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual
Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in a servicing function for the JPM 2015-WPG Transaction
responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d). 

 The report on assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria
furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by CWCapital Asset Management LLC CWCAM discloses that
a material instance of noncompliance occurred, as described below: 

 Material Instance of Noncompliance: 

 1122(d)(2)(vii): Reconciliations are prepared on a monthly
basis for all asset-backed securities related bank accounts, including custodial accounts and related bank clearing accounts. These
reconciliations: (A) are mathematically accurate; (B) are prepared within 30 calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date,
or such other number of days specified in the transaction agreements; (C) are reviewed and approved by someone other than the person
who prepared the reconciling items; and (D) contain explanations for reconciling items. These reconciling items are resolved within
90 calendar days of their original identification, or such other number of days specified in the transaction agreements. 

 The instance of material noncompliance, for the reporting period
included a failure to complete the required bank reconciliations within 30 calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date.
In five of the twelve months related to the reporting period, the required reconciliations were not completed within the 30 calendar
days requirement as follows:

 Steps Taken to Remedy the Material Instance of Noncompliance 

 In response to the lack of adherence to company policy and procedures,
CWCAM s Compliance Committee reviewed the reasons for noncompliance and added two additional procedures to supplement its
existing procedures: 

 1) the accounting department has added
the completion of bank account reconciliations within 30 calendar days to its monthly closing checklist, which is reviewed and
signed off by a CWCAM officer; and 

 2) the Chief Financial Officer has set up a monthly electronic
reminder requiring that the completed bank reconciliations be forwarded to the CFO for an additional layer of review.

2018 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria 

Management of Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the Company - is responsible for assessing
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1 122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to the servicing of commercial and multifamily loans (the Platform - ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities
it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Appendix A to this letter identifies
the commercial mortgage and multifamily pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily loans constituting
the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 

 With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform,
except the Company has engaged various vendors to perform certain tax payment activities. Such vendors have provided separate Regulation
AB Item 1122 management assessments and attestations for such activities. 

 With respect to applicable servicing
criterion 1 122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to the Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 

 With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company's management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI')
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations
17.06). The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company's management is solely responsible
for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

The Company's management has assessed

assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation
AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has complied
in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

 The Company has not identified
and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December
31, 2018, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

 The Company has not identified
any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria

Management s
Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 

Re: Assessment of Compliance for services provided pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreements
entered into by CWCapital Asset Management LLC beginning January 1, 2006 for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2018. 

CWCapital Asset Management LLC CWCAM is responsible for assessing compliance with applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the securitizations issued beginning January 1, 2006, as listed on Appendix A Applicable
Servicing Criteria ). 

 CWCAM has assessed its compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of December 31, 2018 and for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (the Reporting
Period ). In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(b), (d)(3)(i)(c),
(d)(3)(i)(d), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv),
and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which CWCAM has concluded are not applicable to the activities it performs (collectively, the
 Not Applicable Criteria ). With respect to applicable servicing criteria (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(iii),
and (d)(4)(iv), CWCAM has determined that there were no occurrences of events that would require CWCAM to perform such activities.
The securitizations covered by this report include all securitizations wherein CWCAM is named as the Special Servicer for securitizations
issued beginning January 1, 2006, as listed in Appendix B (the Platform ). 

 Based on such assessment, management
believes, as of December 31, 2018 and for the Reporting Period, the following: 

 1) CWCAM has
determined that the Not Applicable Criteria are in fact not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 

2) CWCAM has
complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d), with the exception of the Not Applicable
Criteria and any material instance of noncompliance described in Schedule A hereto. 

Schedule B hereto includes Management s
Discussion of the Material Instance of Noncompliance noted in Schedule A. 

CohnReznick LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on CWCAM s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
as of December 31, 2018 and for the Reporting Period.

Material Instance of Noncompliance 

CWCAM s assessment of compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB
as of December 31, 2018 and for the Reporting Period, disclosed a material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to the
servicing criterion set forth in 1122(d)(2)(vii), as follows: 

With respect to compliance 1122(d)(2)(vii), CWCAM s
policies and procedures were not properly followed with respect to timely completion of bank reconciliations.

Schedule B 

Management s Discussion on Material Instance
of Noncompliance 

1122(d)(2)(vii), Reconciliations are prepared
on a monthly basis for all asset-backed securities related bank accounts, including custodial accounts and related bank clearing
accounts. These reconciliations (A) are mathematically accurate; (B) are prepared within 30 calendar days after the bank statement
cutoff date, or such other number of days specified in the transaction agreements; (C) are reviewed and approved by someone other
than the person who prepared the reconciling items; and (D) contain explanations for reconciling items. These reconciling items
are resolved within 90 calendar days of their original identification, or such other number of days specified in the transaction
agreements. 

Noncompliance 

 The instance of material noncompliance, for the
Reporting Period included a failure to complete the required bank reconciliations within 30 calendar days after the bank statement
cutoff date. In five of the twelve months related to the Reporting Period, the required reconciliations were not completed within
the 30 calendar days requirement as follows: 

 February 2018: bank reconciliations were
prepared on June 22, 2018 

 March 2018: bank reconciliations were prepared
on May 1, 2018 

 September 2018: bank reconciliations were
prepared on November 6, 2018 

 November 2018: bank reconciliations were
prepared on February 19, 2019 

 December 2018: bank reconciliations were
prepared on February 6, 2019 

Remediation 

 In response to the lack of adherence to company
policy and procedures, the Compliance Committee reviewed the reasons for noncompliance and added two additional procedures to supplement
its existing procedures: 

 1) the accounting department has added
the completion of bank account reconciliations within 30 calendar days to its monthly closing checklist, which is reviewed and
signed off by a CWCAM officer; and 

 2) the Chief Financial Officer has set
up a monthly electronic reminder requiring that the completed bank reconciliations be forwarded to the CFO for an additional layer
of review.

provides trustee, securities administration and/or paying agent services and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities
for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration
and the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions (i) for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored
entity, and (ii) for which the offered securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and

Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the servicing
criterion. Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion
applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements
to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criterion. 

 With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management provides the

 3. With respect to applicable servicing
criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period
with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 

 4. Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 

 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the
accompanying Management s Assessment, that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform) except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities
it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company
has determined that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are applicable to the activities the Company performs
with respect to the Platform, except for certain tax payment activities which the Company has engaged various vendors to perform.
With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed
during the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require
the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s Assessment identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise
the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the 

 Company during the period covered by this
report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment, for
servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors
to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is considered
a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the 

confidential 

confidential 

SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06 . 

In our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo
Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, complied with the aforementioned Servicing
Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which compliance is
determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing
of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers 
(C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with Item 1122(d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company
during the year ended December 31, 2018 that required these servicing criteria. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

As described in management s assertion, for
servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi)), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects
with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

 In our opinion, management s assertion that
the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation
AB, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi)) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above,
as of and for the ended December 31, 2018 for the commercial real estate mortgage loans platform is fairly stated, in all material

 LNR Partners, LLC 
Miami Beach, Florida 

 We have examined management s assertion, included
in the accompanying Management Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria included on Appendix
A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged-backed securities transactions for which the Company
served as special servicer and that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the Platform ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(c),

has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated,
in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed
to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 As described in management s assertion,
for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(2)( Vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06,
Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that
it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide

reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply
in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion,
and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company
complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the commercial mortgage-backed
securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration and/or
paying agent services and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered
pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such
CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable Servicing Criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions (i) for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and (ii) for which the offered
securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the CMBS Platform) as of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2018. Management has determined that all the Servicing Criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to the Company s
obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2018, except for the following Servicing Criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),

removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria). With
respect to applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the
CMBS Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on
