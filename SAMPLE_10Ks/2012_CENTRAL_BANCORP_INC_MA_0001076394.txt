PART I Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This
document, as well as other written communications made from time to time by Central Bancorp, Inc. (the Company and subsidiaries and oral communications made from time to time by authorized officers of the Company, may contain statements
relating to the future results of the Company (including certain projections, such as earnings projections, necessary tax provisions, and business trends) that are considered forward looking statements as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA ). Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as intend, believe, expect, should, planned, 
 estimated, and potential. For these statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the PSLRA. The Company s ability to predict future results is inherently
uncertain and the Company cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to: the risk that
the Company s strategic initiatives and business plans, including its prospective business combination with Independent Bank Corp., may not be satisfactorily completed or executed, if at all; recent and future bail-out actions by the
government; a further slowdown in the national and Massachusetts economies; a further deterioration in asset values locally and nationwide; the volatility of rate-sensitive deposits; changes in the regulatory environment; increasing competitive
pressure in the banking industry; operational risks including data processing system failures or fraud; asset/liability matching risks and liquidity risks; continued access to liquidity sources; changes in our borrowers performance on loans;
changes in critical accounting policies and judgments; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies; changes in the equity and debt securities markets;
governmental action as a result of our inability to comply with regulatory orders and agreements; the effect of additional provision for loan losses; the effect of an impairment charge on our deferred tax asset; fluctuations of our stock price; the
success and timing of our business strategies; the impact of reputation risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity; the impact of regulatory restrictions on our ability to receive
dividends from our subsidiaries; and political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities or otherwise affect economic conditions. 
 The Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to
reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. 
 Item 1. Business General 
 The Company. Central Bancorp, Inc. (the Company ), a Massachusetts corporation, was
organized by Central Co-operative Bank (the Bank on September 30, 1998, to acquire all of the capital stock of the Bank as part of its reorganization into the holding company form of ownership, which was completed on
January 8, 1999. Upon completion of the holding company reorganization, the Company s common stock, par value 1.00 per share (the Common Stock ), became registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ). The Company is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board ). The Company has no significant assets
or liabilities other than loans to the Central Co-operative Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP and subordinated debentures as well as common stock of the Bank and various other liquid assets in which it invests in the ordinary
course of business. For that reason, substantially all of the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates to the operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries. 
 The Bank. Central Co-operative Bank was organized as a Massachusetts chartered co-operative bank in 1915
and converted from mutual to stock form of ownership in 1986. The primary business of the Bank is to 
 1 

generate funds in the form of deposits and use the funds to make mortgage loans for the purchase, refinancing, and construction of residential properties and to make loans on commercial real
estate in its market area. In addition, the Bank makes a limited amount of consumer loans including secured and unsecured personal loans, and commercial and industrial loans. The Bank sells some of its residential mortgage loan production in the
secondary mortgage market. The Bank also maintains an investment portfolio of various types of debt securities, including corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and common and preferred equity securities. The Bank also offers investment
services (including annuities) to its customers through a third party broker-dealer. The Bank is
headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts and its operations are conducted through nine full-service office facilities located in Somerville, Arlington, Burlington, Chestnut Hill, Malden, Medford, Melrose and Woburn, Massachusetts, a limited
service high school branch in Woburn, Massachusetts, a stand-alone 24-hour automated teller machine ATM in Somerville, Massachusetts, as well as over the Internet. Each full-service branch office also has a 24-hour ATM. The Bank is a
member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Boston and its deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Due to issues associated with the
recent economic downturn, FDIC deposit insurance costs have increased considerably. See Regulation and Supervision of the Bank Insurance of Deposit Accounts for additional information regarding deposit insurance premiums.
 All Massachusetts chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the Share Insurance Fund. The
Share Insurance Fund maintains a deposit insurance fund which insures all deposits in member banks which are not covered by federal insurance. In past years, a premium of 1/24 of 1 of insured deposits had been assessed annually on member banks such
as the Bank for this deposit insurance. However, no premium has been assessed in recent years. The main
offices of the Company and Bank are located at 399 Highland Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144 and their telephone number is (617) 628-4000. The Bank also maintains a website at www.centralbk.com . Information on the
Bank s website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The operations of the
Bank are generally influenced by overall economic conditions, the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of financial institution regulatory authorities, including the Massachusetts Commissioner of
Banks (the Commissioner ), the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Proposed Merger.
 On April 30, 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Independent Bank Corp. Independent ), the parent company of Rockland Trust Company Rockland ), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Independent. As part of the transaction, the Bank will also merge with and into Rockland. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Company common stock,
other than shares held by Independent, will convert into the right to receive either (i) 32.00 in cash or (ii) such number of shares of Independent common stock as determined by the exchange ratio provided for in the Merger Agreement, all
as more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The Merger Agreement provides that 40 of the aggregate merger consideration must consist of cash and 60 of the aggregate merger
consideration must consist of shares of Independent common stock. Following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors of Independent and Rockland will each consist of its respective directors
immediately prior to the merger and John J. Morrissey, a current director of the Company and the Bank. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and approval of the merger by the
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of the Company. If the merger is not consummated under certain circumstances, the Company has agreed to reimburse Independent up to 750,000 for its reasonably documented fees and
expenses and to pay Independent a termination fee of 2.2 million; provided however, that any amounts paid in reimbursement will be credited against the termination fee payable. Currently, the merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
of 2012.

Market Area All of the Bank s offices are located in the northwestern suburbs of Boston, which are its principal market area for deposits. The majority of the properties securing the Bank s loans are
located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The Bank s market area consists of established suburban areas and includes portions of the Route 128 high-technology corridor. Competition The Bank s competition for savings
deposits has historically come from other co-operative banks, savings banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations and commercial banks located in Massachusetts generally, and in the Boston metropolitan area, specifically. With the advent of
interstate banking, the Bank also faces competition from out-of-state banking organizations. In the past, during times of high interest rates, the Bank has also experienced additional significant competition for deposits from short-term money market
funds and other corporate and government securities. The Bank has faced continuing competition for deposits from other financial intermediaries, including those operating over the Internet. 
 The Bank competes for deposits principally by offering depositors a wide variety of savings programs, convenient branch
locations, 24-hour automated teller machines, Internet banking, preauthorized payment and withdrawal systems, tax-deferred retirement programs and other miscellaneous services such as money orders, travelers checks and safe deposit boxes. The
Bank usually does not rely upon any individual, group or entity for a material portion of its deposits. The
Bank s competition for real estate loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies, co-operative banks and savings banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutional
lenders. The Bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers, real estate brokers and builders. The competition for loans encountered
by the Bank, as well as the types of institutions with which the Bank competes, varies from time to time depending upon certain factors, including the general availability of lendable funds and credit, general and local economic conditions, current
interest rate levels, volatility in the mortgage markets and other factors which are not readily predictable. 
 Changes in bank regulation, such as changes in the products and services banks can offer and involvement in non-banking
activities by bank holding companies, as well as bank mergers and acquisitions, can affect the Bank s ability to compete successfully. Legislation and regulations have also expanded the activities in which depository institutions may engage.
The ability of the Bank to compete successfully will depend upon how successfully it can respond to the evolving competitive, regulatory, technological and demographic developments affecting its operations. 
 Lending Activities The Bank s lending focus is concentrated in real estate secured transactions, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans. For the year
ended March 31, 2012, the Bank originated loans totaling 170.7 million. Of the total loans originated during fiscal 2012, 165.7 million, or 97 , were residential mortgage and home equity loans; 3.9 million, or 2 , were commercial real estate
loans; and 1.8 million, or 1 , were commercial and industrial, and other loans. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank sold 11.1 million and 21.2 million, respectively, of residential mortgage loan originations. The sale of
loans in the secondary market allows the Bank to continue to make loans during periods when savings deposit flows decline or funds are not otherwise available for lending purposes and to manage interest rate risk. 
 The Bank s loan portfolio increased by 54.7 million, or 13.9 , to 448.9 million at March 31, 2012 from 394.2
million at March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to increases in residential real estate loans and 
 3 

decreases in the commercial real estate, land and construction loan portfolios. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, management de-emphasized higher-risk commercial real estate and construction and land
lending in accordance with the Company s business plan. Land and construction loans totaled 937 thousand at March 31, 2012 compared to 456 thousand at March 31 2011. Commercial and industrial loans decreased primarily due to
the repayment of such loans. During fiscal 2012 management focused on increasing the residential real estate portfolios as these loans generally have less risk compared to commercial and construction lending

Residential Lending. Residential mortgage loans at March 31,
2012 totaled 270.3 million, or 60.2 , of the total loan portfolio. Fixed-rate residential mortgages totaled 234.3 million, or 86.7 , of the residential loan portfolio and adjustable-rate loans totaled 36.0 million, or 13.3 , of the residential
loan portfolio. In recent years the Bank has sought to increase its origination of residential mortgage loans
and to generate additional noninterest income via loan sale gains, management regularly assesses the desirability of holding or selling newly- 
 4 

originated long-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. A number of factors are evaluated to determine whether or not to hold such loans including, current and projected liquidity, current
and projected interest rate risk profile, projected growth in other interest-earning assets, e.g., commercial real estate loans, and projected interest rates and economic conditions. During fiscal 2012, the market values in select communities
within the Bank s market area increased but overall the Boston area residential property values decreased approximately 1.3 while they decreased less than 1 during fiscal 2011. The combination of two years of declines in residential values
overall reversed what appeared to be a turnaround in the housing market in the bank s market area. 
 Also, during fiscal 2012 and 2011, management strategically increased its emphasis on residential lending to
reduce credit risk and increase regulatory capital levels. Due to the emphasis on increasing residential lending along with the relatively low interest rate environment, the residential loan portfolio increased by 87.2 million or 47.6 
during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The Bank s adjustable-rate residential mortgage
loans have a maximum term of 30 years, and allow for periodic interest rate adjustments. The Bank prices the initial rate competitively, but generally avoids initial deep discounts from contracted indices and margins. The Bank has adopted the U.S.
Treasury Securities Index, adjusted to a constant maturity of one to three years, as its primary index. The margin at which adjustable-rate loans is generally set is 2.875 percentage points over the stated index. Interest rate adjustments on
adjustable mortgage loans are capped at two percentage points per adjustment and six percentage points over the life of the loan. Residential loans may be granted as construction loans or permanent loans on residential properties. Construction loans on owner-occupied residential properties may convert to residential loans at fixed
or adjustable rates upon completion of construction. Loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties are typically written in amounts up to 80 of the appraised value of the residential property. The Bank generally requires private
mortgage insurance for loans in excess of 80 of appraised value. The maximum loan-to-value ratio on owner occupied residential properties is 95 . The maximum loan-to-value ratio on non-owner-occupied residential properties is 80 . 
 Commercial Real Estate and Construction Lending . The Bank originates permanent commercial
mortgages and construction loans on commercial and residential real estate projects. Commercial real estate loans are typically secured by income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial buildings and various
retail properties and are written with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Commercial real estate loans with fixed interest rates have terms generally ranging from one to five years while the interest rate on adjustable rate loans is
generally set to the five-year FHLB classic advance rate plus a margin of 175 to 300 basis points. As of March 31, 2012, the Bank s commercial mortgage portfolio totaled 167.2 million and constituted 37.3 of the total loan portfolio,
compared to a balance of 199.1 million, or 50.5 , of total loans at March 31, 2011. The decline in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio during fiscal 2012, which totaled 31.9 million, or 16.0 , is attributable to management s decreased
emphasis on this type of lending in the current economic environment. Commercial real estate loans
are generally made for up to 75 of the appraised value of the property. Commercial real estate loans currently offered by the Bank can have amortization periods of up to 20 to 25 years. Title insurance, fire insurance, casualty insurance and flood
insurance are required in amounts sufficient to protect the Bank s interest, where applicable. In some cases, commercial real estate loans are granted in participation with other lenders. 
 The Bank s land and construction loans totaled 937 thousand, or 0.21 , of the Bank s loan portfolio at
March 31, 2012, compared to a land and construction loan balance of 456 thousand or 0.11 of total loans at March 31, 2011. The decline in these loans is attributable to management s decreased emphasis on this type of lending in the
current economic environment. Construction loans are generally short-term in nature and have maturities of up to two years. The Bank grants loans to construct residential dwellings and commercial real estate

projects. The Bank also originates loans for the construction of single-family homes for resale by professional builders. Construction loans are made for up to 75 of the projected value of the
completed property, based on independent appraisals. Funds are disbursed based on a schedule of completed work presented to the Bank and confirmed by physical inspection of the property by a construction consultant and after receipt of title
updates. Home Equity Lines of Credit . The Bank offers home equity lines of credit that
are secured by the borrower s equity in his or her primary residence and may take the form of a first or second mortgage. Equity loans are made in amounts up to 80 of the appraised value less any first mortgage. Payment of interest is required
monthly and the rate is adjusted monthly based on changes in the prime rate, as quoted in The Wall Street Journal . Loans are not contingent upon proceeds being used for home improvement. Generally, the loan term is 20 years with interest only
due during the first 10 years, and then principal and interest due for the remaining 10 years. The Bank s home equity loans outstanding totaled 8.5 million, or 1.9 of total loans at March 31, 2012. 
 Commercial and Industrial, Consumer and Other Loans . The Bank s commercial and industrial,
consumer, and other loans totaled 2.0 million, or 0.44 of the total loan portfolio on March 31, 2012. The commercial and industrial portfolio consists primarily of time, demand and line-of-credit loans to a variety of local small businesses
that are generally made on a secured basis. The decrease in commercial and industrial loans in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the repayment of loans. The Bank engages in consumer lending primarily as an accommodation to existing
customers. Risks of Residential and Commercial Real Estate, Construction and Land, and Commercial and
Industrial Lending . Declining home values and default risk are the primary risks associated with residential lending. However, commercial real estate, construction and land, and commercial and industrial lending entail significant
additional risks compared to residential mortgage lending. The repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the properties and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse
conditions in the local real estate market or in the economy generally. Construction loans involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved occupied real estate because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating
construction costs, delays arising from labor problems, material shortages, and other unpredictable contingencies. Commercial and industrial loans are generally not secured by real estate and may involve greater risks than other types of lending.
Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. For more information see Nonperforming
Assets below. Origination Fees and Other Fees . The Bank currently collects
origination fees on some of the real estate and commercial loan products it offers. Fees to cover the cost of appraisals, credit reports and other direct costs are also collected. Loan origination fees collected vary in proportion to the level of
lending activity, as well as competitive and economic conditions. The Bank imposes late charges on all loan
products it offers with the exception of equity lines of credit and loans secured by deposits. The Bank also collects prepayment premiums and partial release fees on commercial real estate and construction loans where such items are negotiated as
part of the loan agreement. Loan Solicitation and Processing . Loan originations come
from a number of sources and are attributable to walk-in customers, existing customers, real estate brokers and builders, as well as the purchase of residential and commercial loans from other financial institutions. The Bank also utilizes in-house
originators in the origination of residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are originated by the Bank s team of commercial loan officers. Consumer loans result from both walk-in and existing customers. 
 Each loan originated by the Bank is underwritten by lending personnel of the Bank or, in the case of certain residential
mortgage loans to be sold, qualified independent contract underwriters. Individual lending officers, a committee of loan officers and the Bank s Security Committee have the authority to approve loans up to various
 
 6 

limits. Bank-approved independent certified and licensed appraisers are used to appraise the property intended to secure real estate loans. The Bank s underwriting criteria are designed to
minimize the risks of each loan. There are detailed guidelines concerning the types of loans that may be made, the nature of the collateral, the information that must be obtained concerning the loan applicant and follow-up inspections of collateral
after the loan is made. Nonperforming Assets . The Bank notifies a borrower of a
delinquency when any payment becomes 15 days past due. Repeated contacts are made if the loan remains delinquent for 30 days or more. The Bank will consider working out a payment schedule with a borrower to clear a delinquency, if necessary. If,
however, a borrower is unwilling or unable to resolve such a default after 90 days, the Bank will generally proceed to foreclose and liquidate the property to satisfy the debt. 
 Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Accrual of interest on
loans and amortization of net deferred loan fees or costs are discontinued either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full and timely collection of interest or principal, or when a loan becomes contractually past due 90 days with respect to
interest or principal. The accrual on some loans, however, may continue even though they are more than 90 days past due if management deems it appropriate, provided that the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is
placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and
principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectable as to both principal and interest. For some nonaccrual loans that are generally well-secured, cash interest payments that are received are treated as
interest income on cash basis as long as the remaining recorded investment is determined by management to be fully collectible. The Bank has instituted additional procedures to closely monitor loans and bring potential problems to management s attention early in the collection process. The Bank prepares a monthly watch list
of potential problem loans including currently performing loans, and the Bank s Senior Loan Officer reviews delinquencies with the Security Committee of the Board of Directors at least monthly. Due to the high priority given to monitoring asset
quality, senior management is involved in the early detection and resolution of problem loans. Additionally, the Bank has a workout committee comprised of the Bank s Senior Loan Officer and other lending and Bank personnel that meets regularly
to discuss the ongoing resolution of any loans identified for special review. The following table sets forth
information with respect to the Bank s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:

 At March 31, 2012, nonperforming assets totaled 9.2 million, or 1.75 of total
assets, compared to nonperforming assets of 9.7 million, or 1.99 of total assets, at March 31, 2011. The 532 thousand net decline 
 7 

in nonperforming assets was primarily due to the settlement of two commercial real estate relationships which totaled 3.5 million and the removal of another commercial real estate loan which
totaled 769 thousand and was removed from the nonperforming category due to its timely payment performance. Offsetting these reductions were the addition of five commercial real estate relationships which totaled 5.6 million, half of which were
less than 30 days past due at March 31, 2012. These nonperforming loans were placed on nonaccrual status due to their declining financial condition or payment performance and are being closely monitored to ensure continued progress in their
resolution. Nonperforming assets increased by 3.4 million, from 6.3 million at March 31, 2010 to 9.7
million at March 31, 2011 primarily due to the addition of three commercial real estate customer relationships which totaled 2.3 million and residential loans which totaled 1.5 million, partially offset by the removal of three loans totaling
 400 thousand. At March 31, 2011, impaired accruing loans totaled 7.2 million and were primarily
comprised of a 4.6 million commercial real estate relationship which was restructured in fiscal 2010 and totaled 4.5 million at March 31, 2011, and a 1.4 million commercial real estate loan added during fiscal 2011. The 4.5 million
commercial real estate relationship s TDR was renewed during fiscal 2011 as the customer exercised a six month interest only option. The 1.4 million relationship added during fiscal 2011 was experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties and
the restructuring included the advancement of funds to pay past due real estate taxes and six months of interest only payments. At March 31, 2011, TDRs which were accruing interest totaled 7.2 million compared to 5.7 million at March 31, 2010. While bankruptcy filings have extended the time required to resolve some
situations involving nonperforming assets, management continues to work with borrowers and bankruptcy trustees to resolve these situations as soon as possible. Management believes there are adequate reserves and collateral securing these loans to
cover losses that may result from nonperforming loans. At March 31, 2011, there were no loans that are not listed on the table above where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious doubts as
to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms. Impaired loans which were
accruing interest at March 31, 2010 totaled 10.6 million, comprised of 16 commercial loans to seven borrowers which totaled 9.7 million, and four residential loans to four borrowers which totaled 898 thousand. Two customer relationships
which totaled 7.0 million comprised most of the impaired but accruing commercial real estate loans at March 31, 2010. One relationship which totaled 4.6 million was a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), and for which this customer s loans
were accruing interest prior to the restructuring. Management s conclusion that it was appropriate for this relationship to continue to accrue interest subsequent to the restructuring was based on the customer s satisfactory repayment
performance prior to the restructuring and management s analysis which determined that the remaining contractual principal and interest are expected to be collected. The other impaired but accruing commercial real estate loan relationship at
March 31, 2010 was comprised of five loans which totaled 2.4 million. As of March 31, 2011, this customer has paid-in-full four of the five loans. The remaining loan which totaled 764 thousand was placed on nonaccrual status during
fiscal 2011, however, management expects to collect the outstanding principal balance. For more information
regarding non-performing loans, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Provision for Loan Losses. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . The Company provides for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance
for loan losses at a level that management estimates is adequate to absorb probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, management
considers past and anticipated loss experience, evaluations of underlying collateral, financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and the levels of non performing and other
classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly 
 8 

basis and provides for loan losses monthly when appropriate to maintain the adequacy of the allowance. The Company uses a process of portfolio segmentation to calculate the appropriate reserve
level at the end of each quarter. Management analyzes required reserve allocations for loans considered impaired under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 310 Receivables ASC 310 and the allocation percentages
used when calculating potential losses under ASC 450 Contingencies ASC 450 ). Although management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, future additions or reductions to
the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in loan composition or volume, changes in economic market area conditions or other factors. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be
sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company s operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. During
fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, a 1.4 million provision was recorded based upon management s quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio. Certain loan loss factor ratios were increased during fiscal 2012 due to the continued
recessionary economic conditions. Management currently believes that there are adequate reserves and collateral securing non-performing loans to cover losses that may result from these loans at March 31, 2012. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses. The following table presents activity in the allowance for loan losses during the years indicated:

Investment Activities The primary objectives of the investment portfolio are to achieve a competitive rate of return over a reasonable period of time and to provide liquidity. As a Massachusetts chartered bank, the Bank is
authorized to invest in various obligations of federal and state governmental agencies, corporate bonds and other obligations and, within certain limits, common and preferred stocks. The Bank s investment policy requires that corporate debt
securities be rated as investment grade at the time of purchase. A security that is downgraded below investment grade will require additional analysis relative to perceived credit quality, market price, and overall impact on
capital/earnings before a decision is made as to hold or sell. For all sub-investment grade corporate holdings, additional analysis of creditworthiness is required. The Bank s investment in common and preferred stock is generally limited to
large, well-known corporations whose shares are actively traded. The size of the Bank s holdings in an individual company s stock is also limited by policy. A portion of the Bank s investment portfolio consists of mortgage-backed
securities which represent interests in pools of residential mortgages. Such securities include securities issued and guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC and the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA as well as collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs issued primarily by FNMA and FHLMC. 
 Investments are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading. 
Investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, all of the Bank s marketable investments were classified as available for sale.

Deposits, Borrowed Funds, and Other Sources of Funds 
 General . Savings accounts and other types of deposits have traditionally been an important source of the
Bank s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, loan sales, borrowings and from other operations. The availability of funds is influenced by the
general level of interest rates and other market conditions. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows and outflows vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates and market conditions.
Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities. 
 Deposits . Consumer, business and municipal deposits are attracted principally from within the
Bank s market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments including demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, regular savings accounts, term deposit accounts and retirement savings plans.
The Bank has historically not actively solicited or advertised for deposits outside of its market area or solicited brokered deposits. 
 11 

The Bank attracts deposits through its branch office network, automated teller machines, the Internet and by paying rates competitive with other financial institutions in its market area. From
time to time, the Bank bids on short-term certificates of deposit from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which periodically awards deposits to financial institution bidders throughout Massachusetts.

Borrowings . From time to time, the Bank borrows funds from the FHLB
of Boston. All advances from the FHLB of Boston are secured by a blanket lien on residential first mortgage loans, certain investment securities and commercial real estate loans, and all of the Bank s stock in the FHLB of Boston. At
March 31, 2012, the Bank had advances outstanding from the FHLB of Boston of 117.2 million and unused borrowing capacity, based on available collateral, of approximately 84 million. Proceeds from these advances were primarily used to fund the
Bank s loan growth. Additional sources of borrowed funds include The Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund, the Federal Reserve Bank, and a line of credit with a correspondent bank.

Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program 
 On August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a letter agreement (the Repurchase Letter with the United States Department of the Treasury Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company redeemed, out of the proceeds of its issuance of 10,000 shares of its Series B Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, all 10,000
outstanding shares of its Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, liquidation amount 1,000 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), for a redemption price of 10,013,889, including accrued but unpaid dividends to
the date of redemption. On December 5, 2008, the Company sold 10.0 million in the Series A Preferred Stock to the Treasury as a participant in the federal government s Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP Capital Purchase
Program. This represented approximately 2.6 of the Company s risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2008. In connection with the investment, the Company had entered into a Letter Agreement and the related Securities Purchase Agreement
with the Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued the 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant (the Warrant to purchase 234,742 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10.0
million in cash. The Company subsequently repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury on October 19, 2011
for an aggregate purchase price of 2.5 million. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. U.S. Treasury Department Small Business Lending Fund On
August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued 10,000 shares of the
Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock ), having a liquidation amount per share equal to 1,000, for a total purchase price of 10,000,000. The Purchase
Agreement was entered into, and the Series B Preferred Stock was issued, pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund SBLF program, a fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, that encourages lending to small
businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than 10 billion. The Company used the 10 million in SBLF funds to redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock issued under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. For
additional information, see Note 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. Subsidiaries
 In September 2004, the Company established Central Bancorp Capital Trust I (the Trust ), a
Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued and sold 5.1 million of trust preferred securities in a private placement and issued 158,000 of trust common securities to the Company. The Trust used the proceeds of these issuances to purchase 5.3
million of the Company s floating rate junior subordinated debentures due September 16, 2034 (the Trust I Debentures ). The interest rates on the Trust I Debentures and trust preferred securities are variable and adjustable
quarterly at 2.44 over the three month LIBOR. At March 31, 2012, the interest rate was 2.91 . On
January 31, 2007, the Company completed a trust preferred securities financing in the amount of 5.9 million. In the transaction, the Company formed a Connecticut statutory trust, known as Central Bancorp Statutory Trust II Trust
II ). Trust II issued and sold 5.9 million of trust preferred securities in a private placement and issued 183,000 of trust common securities to the Company. Trust II used the proceeds of these issuances to purchase 6.1 million of the
Company s floating rate junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2037 (the Trust II Debentures ). From January 31, 2007 until March 15, 2017 (the Fixed Rate Period ), the interest rate on the Trust II
Debentures and the trust preferred securities is fixed at 7.015 per annum. Upon the expiration of the Fixed Rate Period, the interest rate on the Trust II Debentures and the trust preferred securities will be at a variable per annum rate,
reset quarterly, equal to three month LIBOR plus 1.65 . The Trust II Debentures are the sole assets of Trust II. The Trust II Debentures and the trust preferred securities each have 30-year lives. The trust preferred securities and the Trust II
Debentures will each be callable by the Company or 
 13 

Trust II, at their respective option, after ten years, and sooner in certain specific events, including in the event that the securities are not eligible for treatment as Tier 1 capital, subject
to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board, if then required. Interest on the trust preferred securities and the Trust II Debentures may be deferred at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly
payments (five years), provided there is no event of default. The Trust I Debentures and the Trust II
Debentures are the sole assets of Trust I and Trust II, respectively, and are subordinate to all of the Company s existing and future obligations for borrowed money. 
 The trust preferred securities generally rank equal to the trust common securities in priority of payment, but will rank
prior to the trust common securities if and so long as the Company fails to make principal or interest payments on the Trust I Debentures and the Trust II Debentures. Concurrently with the issuance of the Trust I and Trust II Debentures and the
trust preferred securities, the Company issued guarantees related to each trust s securities for the benefit of the holders of Trust I and Trust II. In April 1998 and July 2003, the Bank established Central Securities Corporation and Central Securities Corporation II, respectively, Massachusetts corporations, as wholly-owned subsidiaries of the
Bank for the purpose of engaging exclusively in buying, selling and holding, on their own behalf, securities that may be held directly by the Bank. From time to time these subsidiaries hold securities such as government agency obligations, corporate
bonds, mortgage-backed securities, preferred stocks, and trust preferred securities, and qualify under Section 38B of Chapter 63 of the Massachusetts General Laws as Massachusetts securities corporations. 
 During January 2009, the Bank established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Metro Real Estate Holdings, LLC. The subsidiary was
formed to, among other things, hold, maintain, and dispose of certain foreclosed properties acquired from the Bank.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, a
Massachusetts corporation and registered bank holding company. The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and by the Share Insurance Fund of Massachusetts for amounts in excess of the
FDIC insurance limits. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports
with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not
limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of
activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the
regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, the classification of
assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal
Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank. Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and
regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank. Regulatory Reform The Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), which was enacted on July 21, 2010, will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating
activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act will eliminate the Office of Thrift Supervision and require that federal savings associations be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(the primary federal regulator for national banks). The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are
as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. In
addition, the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than 15 billion of assets. The
legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18
months. These new leverage and capital requirements must take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce
consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair,
deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10.0 billion in assets. Banks and savings
institutions with 10.0 billion or less in assets will be 
 15 

examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives the state
attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. Regulation and Supervision of the Company
 General . The Company is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal
Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA ). As a result, the activities of the Company are subject to certain limitations, which are described below. In addition, as a bank holding company, the
Company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve Board and to furnish such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Company is also subject to regular examination by
and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities. With certain
exceptions, the BHCA prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in
activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board
regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the BHCA and the related Federal Reserve Board regulations.
Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve Board s prior approval of specific nonbanking activities, the Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or
control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding
company. Effective with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the G-L-B Act on
November 12, 1999, bank holding companies whose financial institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed and have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act CRA records can elect to become financial holding
companies which are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than are permitted to bank holding companies, including investment banking and insurance companies. Financial holding companies are authorized to engage in,
directly or indirectly, financial activities. A financial activity is an activity that is: (i) financial in nature; (ii) incidental to an activity that is financial in nature; or (iii) complementary to a financial activity and that
does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The G-L-B Act includes a list of activities that are deemed to be financial in nature. Other activities also may be decided by the Federal Reserve Board to be financial in nature or incidental thereto if
they meet specified criteria. A financial holding company that intends to engage in a new activity or to acquire a company to engage in such an activity is required to give prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board. If the activity is not either
specified in the G-L-B Act as being a financial activity or one that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by rule or regulation to be financial in nature, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required. 
 Acquisitions. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve
Board before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of such
shares; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Satisfactory financial condition, particularly with regard to capital
adequacy, and satisfactory CRA ratings generally are prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. Under the BHCA, any company must obtain approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For purposes of the BHCA, control is defined as ownership
of more than 25 of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company. In addition,
the 
 16 

Change in Bank Control Act and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve Board require any person or persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the
BHCA) to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve Board before such person or persons may acquire control of the Company. The Change in Bank Control Act defines control as the power, directly or indirectly, to vote 25 or more of
any voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. There is a presumption of control where the acquiring person will own, control or hold with power to vote 10 or more of any
class of voting security of a bank holding company or insured bank if, like the Company, the company involved has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Under Massachusetts banking law, prior approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks is also required before any person
may acquire control of a Massachusetts bank or bank holding company. Massachusetts law generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of an additional bank if the bank to be acquired has been in existence for less than three years
or, if after such acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 30 of the FDIC-insured deposits in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified
minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See Regulation and Supervision of the Bank Capital Requirements. 
 Dividends . The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies
if their actions are believed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board s view that a
bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital
needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt
corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA ), the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any
dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized or worse. See Regulation and Supervision of the Bank Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. 
 Stock Repurchases. Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written
notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months,
is equal to 10 or more of the Company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, directive
or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. This requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well-capitalized, received one of the two highest examination ratings at their last
examination and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 implemented legislative reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act restricts the scope of services that may be provided by accounting firms to their public company audit clients and any non-audit
services being provided to a public company audit client will require pre-approval by the company s audit committee. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to
certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willingly violate this certification requirement. 
 Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, bonuses issued to top executives before restatement of a company s financial
statements are now subject to disgorgement if such restatement was due to corporate misconduct. 
 17 

Executives are also prohibited from insider trading during retirement plan blackout periods and loans to company executives (other than loans by financial institutions permitted by
federal rules and regulations) are restricted. The legislation accelerates the time frame for disclosures by public companies of changes in ownership in a company s securities by directors and executive officers. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also increases the oversight of, and codifies certain requirements relating to audit committees of
public companies and how they interact with the company s registered public accounting firm. Among other requirements, companies must disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert (as
such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) and if not, why not. Although the Company has incurred additional expense in complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations, management does not
believe that such compliance has had a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to report on our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2012 in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have performed reviews regarding our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, and we believe that such internal controls are adequate. The
Company is currently considered a smaller reporting company with the SEC and is not required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requirements regarding external auditor attestation of internal controls over financial
reporting. Regulation and Supervision of the Bank 
 General . The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks Commissioner and the FDIC. The lending activities and other investments of the Bank must comply with various regulatory requirements. The Commissioner and FDIC periodically examine the Bank for compliance with these requirements. The
Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC describing its activities and financial condition. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board. This supervision and regulation is
intended primarily for the protection of depositors. Massachusetts State Law . As a
Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank, the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of Massachusetts law and the regulations of the Commissioner. The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from these laws, and is subject to periodic
examination and reporting requirements by and of the Commissioner. Certain powers granted under Massachusetts law may be constrained by federal regulation. In addition, the Bank is required to make periodic reports to the Co-operative Central Bank.
The approval of the Commissioner is required prior to any merger or consolidation, or the establishment or relocation of any branch office. Massachusetts co-operative banks are subject to the enforcement authority of the Commissioner who may suspend
or remove directors or officers, issue cease and desist orders and appoint conservators or receivers in appropriate circumstances. Co-operative banks are required to pay fees and assessments to the Commissioner to fund that office s operations.
The cost of state examination fees and assessments for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 totaled 52 thousand. Capital Requirements . Under FDIC regulations, state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement
consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 if the FDIC determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well-diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent
asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings and, in general, a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (the CAMELS rating system) established by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council. For all but the most highly-rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above, the minimum leverage capital ratio is not less than 4 . Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholders equity, noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus) and minority interests in 
 18 

consolidated subsidiaries, minus all intangible assets (other than certain mortgage and non-mortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships) minus identified losses, disallowed
deferred tax assets, investments in financial subsidiaries and certain non-financial equity investments. In
addition to the leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets), state-chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8 , of which at least half must be Tier 1
capital. Qualifying total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items. Tier 2 capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and
preferred stock with a maturity of over 20 years, term subordinated debt, certain other capital instruments, and up to 45 of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities. The includable amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the
institution s Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes, reciprocal cross-holdings of
capital securities issued by other banks, most intangible assets and certain other deductions. Under the FDIC risk-weighting system, all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items are
assigned to one of five broad risk weight categories from 0 to 200 , based on the risks inherent in the type of assets or item. The aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category. The sum of
these weighted values equals the bank s risk-weighted assets. At March 31, 2012, the Bank s
ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets was 8.81 , its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.53 and its ratio of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.83 . 
 Dividend Limitations . The Bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital
would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the Bank at the time of its conversion to stock form. The approval of the Commissioner is necessary for the
payment of any dividend which exceeds the total net profits for the year combined with retained net profits for the prior two years. Earnings of the Bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for Federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment
of taxes at the then current tax rate by the Bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions. The Bank intends to make full use of this favorable tax treatment and does not contemplate use of any earnings in a manner
which would limit the Bank s bad debt deduction or create federal tax liabilities. Under FDIC
regulations, the Bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if, after making the distribution, the Bank would be undercapitalized within the meaning of the Prompt Corrective Action regulations. See Regulation and
Supervision of the Bank Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Investment
Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks have generally been limited to activities as principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the FDIC permit exceptions to these limitations. For example, state chartered banks, such as the Bank, may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise grandfathered state authority to invest in
common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under federal law. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit institutions that meet all
applicable capital requirements to engage in state authorized activities or investments that do not meet this standard (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant
risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. All non-subsidiary equity investments, unless otherwise authorized or approved by the FDIC, must have been divested by December 19, 1996, under a FDIC-approved divestiture plan, unless such investments were
grandfathered by the FDIC. The Bank has received grandfathering authority from the FDIC to invest in listed stocks and/or registered shares. The maximum permissible investment is 100 of Tier 1 capital, as specified by the FDIC s regulations,
or the maximum amount permitted by 
 19 

Massachusetts Banking Law, whichever is less. Such grandfathering authority may be terminated upon the FDIC s determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk to the Bank
or if the Bank converts its charter or undergoes a change in control. Insurance of Deposit
Accounts. The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Deposit Insurance Fund is the successor to the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which
were merged in 2006. Under the FDIC s previous risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were
assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to
which it is assigned and assessment rates ranged from seven to 77.5 basis points. On February 7, 2011, however, the FDIC approved a final rule that implemented changes to the deposit insurance assessment system mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
The final rule, which took effect for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011, requires that the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average
consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Under the final rule, insured depository institutions are required to report their average consolidated total assets on a daily basis, using the regulatory accounting methodology established
for reporting total assets. For purposes of the final rule, tangible equity is defined as Tier 1 capital. The
FDIC may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next, except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the FDIC
assessment. The FDIC imposed on all insured institutions a special emergency assessment of five basis points
of total assets minus Tier 1 capital, as of June 30, 2009 (capped at ten basis points of an institution s deposit assessment base), in order to cover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. That special assessment was collected on
September 30, 2009. The FDIC provided for similar assessments during the final two quarters of 2009, if deemed necessary. However, in lieu of further special assessments, the FDIC required insured institutions to prepay estimated quarterly
risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2012. The estimated assessments, which include an assumed annual assessment base increase of 5 , were recorded as a prepaid expense asset as of December 30,
2009. As of December 31, 2009, and each quarter thereafter, a charge to earnings will be recorded for each regular assessment with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset. 
 Due to the recent difficult economic conditions, deposit insurance per account owner has been raised to 250,000 for all
types of accounts until January 1, 2014. In addition, the FDIC adopted an optional Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program TLGP under which, for a fee, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance
coverage until June 30, 2010, subsequently extended to December 31, 2012. The TLGP also included a debt component under which certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies between October 13, 2008
and October 31, 2009 would be guaranteed by the FDIC through June 30, 2012, or in some cases, December 31, 2012. The Bank opted to participate in the unlimited noninterest-bearing transaction account coverage and the Bank and Company
also opted to participate in the unsecured debt guarantee program. In addition to the assessment for deposit
insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and during the calendar year ended
March 31, 2012 averaged 8 basis points of average consolidated total assets. The FDIC has authority to
increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in
the future. 
 20 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The
management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. All Massachusetts chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the Share Insurance Fund. The Share Insurance Fund maintains a deposit insurance fund which insures all deposits in member
banks which are not covered by federal insurance. In past years, a premium of 1/24 of 1 of insured deposits has been assessed annually on member banks such as the Bank for this deposit insurance. However, no premium has been assessed in recent
years. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action . Federal banking regulators are required to
take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements, including a leverage limit, a risk-based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking
regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would
thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements. An institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure (an undercapitalized institution may be: (i) subject to
increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (ii) required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within 45 days; (iii) subject to asset growth limits; and (iv) required to obtain prior regulatory
approval for acquisitions, branching and new lines of businesses. The capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized
on average for four consecutive quarters, under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of 5 of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed
to comply with its capital restoration plan. A significantly undercapitalized institution, as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, may be subject to regulatory demands for
recapitalization, broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates, limitations on interest rates paid on deposits, asset growth and other activities, possible replacement of directors and officers, and restrictions on capital
distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution. Any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries. The senior executive officers
of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt. In their
discretion, the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions.
 Under the implementing regulations, the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s
capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of its total capital to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of its core capital to risk-weighted assets) and leverage ratio (the ratio of
its core capital to adjusted total assets). The following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories: 

Well Capitalized 

Adequately Capitalized 

Undercapitalized 

Significantly Undercapitalized 

Total risk-based capital ratio 

10.0 or more 

8.0 or more 

Less than 8.0 

Less than 6.0 

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 

6.0 or more 

4.0 or more 

Less than 4.0 

Less than 3.0 

Leverage ratio 

5.0 or more 

4.0 or more 

Less than 4.0 

Less than 3.0 

3.0 if the institution has a composite 1 CAMELS rating. 
 If an institution s capital falls below the critically undercapitalized level, it is subject to
conservatorship or receivership within specified time frames. A critically undercapitalized institution is defined as an institution 
 21 

that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than 2.0 . Tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and related surplus) less
all intangible assets other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights. The FDIC may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to
comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category (but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) if the FDIC determines, after notice and an
opportunity for a hearing, that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any CAMELS rating category. 
 Loans to Executive Officers, Directors and Principal Stockholders . Loans to directors, executive
officers and principal stockholders of a state non-member bank like the Bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders
or employees of the Bank unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not favor insiders. Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder, together with all
other outstanding loans to such person and related interests, generally may not exceed 15 of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus, and aggregate loans to all such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and
unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective related interests, in excess of the greater of 25,000 or 5 of capital and surplus (and any loans or loans aggregating 500,000 or more)
must be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any interested director not participating in the voting. State non-member banks are generally prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their
executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written, pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the bank. Loans to executive
officers are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit. Massachusetts law also contains restrictions on lending to directors and officers which are, in some cases, stricter than federal law. In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of
credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution, unless such extension of credit is on substantially
the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
 Transactions with Affiliates . A state non-member bank or its subsidiaries may not engage in
 covered transactions with any one affiliate in an amount greater than 10 of such bank s capital stock and surplus, and for all such transactions with all affiliates a state non-member bank is limited to an amount equal to 20 of
capital stock and surplus. All such transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of
loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. Specified collateral requirements apply to certain covered transactions such as loans and guarantees issued on behalf of an affiliate. An affiliate of a
state non-member bank is any company or entity which controls or is under common control with the state non-member bank and, for purposes of the aggregate limit on transactions with affiliates, any subsidiary that would be deemed a financial
subsidiary of a national bank. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state non-member bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the state non-member
bank. Federal law further prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some
additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured non-member banks, including the
Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to
violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 22 

The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or
receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was critically undercapitalized on average
during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized. See Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or
receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of
assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all
of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain
noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for
that portion of transaction accounts aggregating 71.0 million less an exemption of 11.5 million (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3 ; and for accounts greater than 71.0 million, the reserve
requirement is 10 (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8 and 14 of the portion in excess of 11.5 million. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, as implemented by FDIC
regulations, a state non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Community
Reinvestment Act neither establishes specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor limits an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular
community. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of an institution, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider such record when it evaluates
applications made by such institution. The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of an institution s Community Reinvestment Act rating. The Bank s latest Community Reinvestment Act rating received from the FDIC was
 Satisfactory . The Bank is also subject to similar obligations under
Massachusetts Law. The Massachusetts Community Reinvestment Act requires the Massachusetts Banking Commissioner to consider a bank s Massachusetts Community Reinvestment Act rating when reviewing a bank s application to engage in certain
transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices or automated teller machines, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of such application. The Bank s latest Massachusetts
Community Reinvestment Act rating received from the Massachusetts Division of Banks was High Satisfactory. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a
central credit facility primarily for member institutions, and provide funds for certain other purposes including affordable housing programs. The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston FHLB of Boston ), is required to
acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Boston. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Boston stock at March 31, 2012 of 8.2 million. 
 During February 2012, the FHLB of Boston declared a dividend based upon average stock outstanding for the fourth
quarter of 2011. The FHLB of Boston s board of directors anticipates that it will continue to declare modest cash dividends through 2012, but cautioned that adverse events such as negative trend in credit losses on the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Boston s private label mortgage backed securities or mortgage portfolio, a meaningful decline in income, or regulatory disapproval could lead to reconsideration of this plan. 
 23 

For the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash dividends from
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to the Bank amounted to 29 thousand, 6 thousand and 0 respectively. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of economic events or recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks will not
also cause a decrease in the value of the Federal Home Loan Bank stock held by the Bank. Employees 
 At March 31, 2012, the Company and the Bank employed 89 full-time and 33 part-time employees. The Company s and
Bank s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company and Bank considers its relations with its employees to be good. Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and information incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and
you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. 
 Our pending merger with Independent is not guaranteed to occur. Compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement in the interim could adversely
affect our business. If the merger does not occur, it could have a material and adverse affect on our business, results of operations and our stock price. 
 On April 30, 2012, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement and related agreements with Independent and
Rockland, pursuant to which (i) the Company would be merged with and into Independent, (ii) the Bank would be merged with and into Rockland and (iii) each share of the Company s common stock would be converted into the right to
receive either (i) 32.00 in cash or (ii) such number of shares of Independent common stock as determined by the exchange ratio provided for in the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of
conditions, including but not limited to (i) approval of the merger by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock; (ii) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, without
significant adverse or burdensome conditions; and (iii) the absence of a material adverse change with respect to the Company, as well as other conditions to closing as are customary in transactions such as the merger. 
 As a result of the pending merger: (i) the attention of management and employees may be diverted from day to day
operations as they focus on matters relating to preparation for integrating the Company s operations with those of Independent; (ii) the restrictions and limitations on the conduct of the Company s business pending the merger may
disrupt or otherwise adversely affect its business and our relationships with its customers, and may not be in the best interests of the Company if it were to have to act as an independent entity following a termination of the Merger Agreement;
(iii) the Company s ability to retain its existing employees may be adversely affected due to the uncertainties created by the merger; and (iv) the Company s ability to maintain existing customer relationships, or to establish
new ones, may be adversely affected. Any delay in consummating the merger may exacerbate these issues. There
can be no assurance that all of the conditions to closing will be satisfied, or where possible, waived, or that the merger will become effective. If the merger does not become effective because all conditions to closing are not satisfied, or because
one of the parties, or all of the parties mutually, terminate the Merger Agreement, then, among other possible adverse effects: (i) the Company s shareholders will not receive the consideration which
 
 24 

Independent has agreed to pay; (ii) the Company s stock price may decline significantly; (iii) the Company s business may have been adversely affected; (iv) the Company
will have incurred significant transaction costs; and (v) under certain circumstances, the Company may have to pay Independent a termination fee of 2.2 million Our nonresidential real estate, land and construction lending may expose us to a greater risk of loss and hurt our earnings and profitability. 
 Our business strategy centers, in part, on offering nonresidential real estate and construction loans in order to expand
our net interest margin. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than traditional one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. At March 31, 2012, nonresidential real estate and land loans
totaled 168.1 million, which represented 37.5 of total loans. If we increase the level of our nonresidential real estate and construction and land loans, we will increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have
higher concentrations of one to four-family residential mortgage loans. Loans secured by commercial, land or
nonresidential real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Payments on loans secured by nonresidential real estate buildings generally are dependent
on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local
economy. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including limiting the size of our nonresidential real estate loans, generally restricting such loans to our primary market area and attempting to employ conservative underwriting
criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses. 
 Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved,
owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of
construction. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate,
the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported
by the appraisal. Although management believes that the Bank s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will safeguard against material
delinquencies and losses to our operations. Severe, adverse and precipitous economic and market conditions have adversely affected us
and our industry. The recent negative events in the housing market, including significant and
continuing home price reductions coupled with the upward trends in delinquencies and foreclosures, have resulted and will likely continue to result in poor performance of mortgage and construction loans and in significant asset write-downs by many
financial institutions. Reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment further contribute to deteriorating credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Financial market and
economic instability have caused financial institutions to severely restrict their lending to customers and each other. This market turmoil and credit tightening has exacerbated commercial and consumer deficiencies, the lack of consumer confidence,
market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. Financial institutions also have experienced decreased access to deposits and borrowings. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence
in the financial markets has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near
future. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events: 

We potentially face increased regulation of our industry including heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements or expectations imposed in
connection with recent and anticipated legislation. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. 
 25 

The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of
economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn,
impact the reliability of the process. 

We may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC
and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits, also our current risk profile may cause us to pay higher premiums. 

The number of our borrowers that may be unable to make timely repayments of their loans, or the decrease in value of real estate collateral securing
the payment of such loans could continue to escalate and result in significant credit losses, increased delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, may result
in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or on any terms from other financial institutions. 

Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions, the conversion
of certain investment banks to bank holding companies and the favorable governmental treatment afforded to the largest of the financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services and continue to obtain market
share. U.S. and international financial markets and economic conditions, particularly in our market area, could
adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Recent turmoil and
downward economic trends have been particularly acute in the financial sector. We are considered well-capitalized under the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations. While our management has taken aggressive measures to maintain
and increase our liquidity, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and the demand for our products and services may decline as our borrowers and customers experience the impact of an economic slowdown
and recession. In view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in the metropolitan Boston area, we may be particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the metropolitan Boston area, where
our business is concentrated. In addition, the severity and duration of these adverse conditions is unknown and may exacerbate our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending
arrangements with us. In addition, the severity and duration of these adverse conditions is unknown and may exacerbate our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements
with us. Accordingly, continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economy may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and profitability. Financial reform legislation enacted by Congress will, among other things, tighten capital standards, create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and result in new laws and regulations that
are expected to increase our costs of operations. The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to
capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect
today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and
derivatives. 
 26 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the
Bank, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10.0
billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with 10.0 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act will increase shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring certain public companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and
so-called golden parachute payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate and solicit votes for their own candidates using a company s proxy
materials. Our business is subject to the success of the local economy in which we operate. 
 Because the majority of our borrowers and depositors are individuals and businesses located and doing business in the
northwestern suburbs of Boston, our success depends to a significant extent upon economic conditions in that market area. Adverse economic conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their
loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, short money supply, scarce natural resources, international disorders, terrorism and other
factors beyond our control may adversely affect our profitability. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Any sustained period of
increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts could adversely affect the value of our assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Moreover, we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas. 
 A significant amount of the Company s loans are concentrated in the Bank s geographic footprint and adverse conditions in this area could
negatively impact operations. With most of our loans concentrated in the northern and western suburbs
of Boston, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. Generally, it appears that the local commercial real estate and residential real estate markets remain weak,
although values appear to have stabilized. Breaking down the commercial real estate portfolio into subcategories by property class, prices appreciated 2 during calendar year 2011 for apartments and multi-family properties after experiencing flat
values in 2010 and declines in 2008 and 2009. It appears that the values for industrial and office space remained flat in calendar year 2011 after experiencing significant declines in 2009 and 2010. These asset classes represent the majority of the
Company s collateral for its commercial real estate loan portfolio. Boston area residential property
values decreased about 1.3 in calendar year 2011 and less than 1 in calendar year 2010, reversing what had appeared to be a turnaround in the housing market. Housing prices increased slightly during 2009 compared to declines of over 8 during
calendar 2008. Further declines in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans
by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Additionally, a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan
losses, which would hurt our profits. Also, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more
geographically diverse. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural
disasters. 
 27 

Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that
capital may not be available when it is needed. We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain
adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support our continued
growth. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, it could dilute the ownership interests of current investors and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors
may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current stockholders, which may adversely impact our current shareholders. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially
impaired. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our growth and
profitability. The banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in each of our
markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds,
and other mutual funds, as well as other super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making
loans. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our
deposits, which reduces net interest income. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, smaller
resources and smaller lending limits, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market. Although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local
advertisements, personal contacts, and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers, we can give no assurance this strategy will be successful. Future FDIC assessments may reduce our earnings. 
 On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted an Amended Restoration Plan to enable the Deposit Insurance Fund to return to
its minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 over eight years. Under this plan, the FDIC did not impose a previously-planned second special assessment (on September 30, 2009, the Bank paid the first special assessment which totaled 270 thousand). Also,
the plan calls for deposit insurance premiums to increase by 3 basis points effective January 1, 2011. Additionally, to meet bank failure cash flow needs, the FDIC assessed a three year insurance premium prepayment, which was paid by banks in
December 2009 covers the period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. The FDIC estimates that bank failures will total approximately 100 billion during the period, but only projects revenues of approximately 60 billion. The
shortfall will be met through the collection of the prepaid premiums, which is estimated to be 45 billion. The Bank s prepaid premium totaled 2.3 million and was paid during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, and it is being amortized
monthly over the three year period. This prepaid deposit premium is carried on the balance sheet in the other assets category and amounted to 1.2 million at March 31, 2012. Any additional emergency special assessment imposed by the FDIC will
further reduce the Company s earnings. Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our
assets. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of
income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on 
 28 

deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities and the relationships of various interest rates
to each other. Over any defined period of time, our interest-earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa. In addition, the individual market interest rates underlying
our loan and deposit products e.g. , prime) may not change to the same degree over a given time period. In any event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, our earnings may be negatively affected. In addition, loan
volume and quality and deposit volume and mix can be affected by market interest rates. Changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, origination volume and overall
profitability. During fiscal 2006, short-term market interest rates (which we use as a guide to price our
deposits) had risen from historically low levels, while longer-term market interest rates (which we use as a guide to price our longer-term loans) did not. This flattening of the market yield curve existed during fiscal 2007 and for part
of 2008 and had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin as rates on our deposits repriced upwards faster than the rates on our longer-term loans and investments. For fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our
interest rate spread was 2.06 , 2.63 , 2.92 , 3.25 , and 3.10 respectively. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve has decreased the federal funds target rate from 5.25 in September 2007 to a rate of 0.25 at March 31, 2012. However, decreases
in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such
loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which might also negatively impact our income. We
principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. In a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If we are unable to manage interest rate
risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. 
 Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value
of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. For more information on how changes in interest rates could impact us, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. 
 Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may
not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our allowance for loan
losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous quantitative factors, including our historical charge-off experience, growth of our loan portfolio, changes in the
composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and
amount of loss for those borrowers. Finally, we also consider many qualitative factors, including general and economic business conditions, duration of the current business cycle, quality of underwriting standards, current general market collateral
valuations, trends apparent in loan concentrations, loan to value ratios, lenders experience, past due and nonaccrual loans, and other matters, which are by nature more subjective and fluid. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss
on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. Because of the
degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary from our current estimates. 
 29 

At March 31, 2012, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of
total loans was 0.95 . The FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged
to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon the services of our management team.
 Our future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management and banking
abilities of our senior executives. We believe that our future results will also depend in part upon our attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management. We are especially dependent on a limited number of key management personnel
and the loss of our chief executive officer or other senior executive officers could have a material adverse impact on our operations because other officers may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Competition
for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to continue to recruit and retain qualified loan
originators could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully and affect our profitability. 
 Our continued success and future growth depend heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated
loan originators and other banking professionals. We compete against many institutions with greater financial resources, both within our industry and in other industries, to attract these qualified individuals. Our failure to recruit and retain
adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability. We operate in a
highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The
Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a co-operative bank and its holding
company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and for the depositors of Central Co-operative Bank and are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock. Regulatory
authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any
change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and
regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ that are applicable to us, have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, including the costs of completing our
audit and maintaining our internal controls. We are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that
could damage our reputation and our business. Security breaches in our Internet banking activities
could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard
internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may 
 30 

not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures that could result in damage to our reputation and our business. Additionally, we outsource our data processing to
third parties. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third parties, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would
significantly affect our business operations. We may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological
improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent
introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our
ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have
substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. 
 Our ability to service our debt, pay dividends and otherwise pay our obligations as they come due is substantially dependent on capital
distributions from Central Co-operative Bank, and these distributions are subject to regulatory limits and other restrictions. A substantial source of our income from which we service our debt, pay our obligations and from which we can pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from Central Co-operative Bank. The availability of
dividends from Central Co-operative Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is also possible, depending upon the financial condition of Central Co-operative Bank, and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could
assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that Central Co-operative Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our
common stock. The inability to receive dividends from Central Co-operative Bank would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations General The operations of the Company and its subsidiary, the Bank, are generally influenced by overall economic conditions, the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory
policies of financial institution regulatory authorities, including the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The Bank monitors its exposure to earnings fluctuations resulting from market interest rate changes. Historically, the Bank s earnings have been vulnerable to changing interest rates due to
differences in the terms 
 36 

to maturity or repricing of its assets and liabilities. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, the Bank s net interest income and net income could be negatively affected as
interest-sensitive liabilities (deposits and borrowings) could adjust more quickly to rising interest rates than the Bank s interest-sensitive assets (loans and investments). 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of the Company s results of operations for the last two fiscal years and
its financial condition at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based on
the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for loan
losses, fair value of investments and other-than-temporary impairment, income taxes, impairment of goodwill, valuation of other real estate owned and valuation of stock options under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation and other
equity based instruments. Accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact income, are considered critical accounting
policies. The Company considers the allowance for loan losses, fair value of other real estate owned, fair value of investments and other-than-temporary impairment, income taxes, accounting for goodwill and impairment, and stock-based compensation
to be its critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in the accounting policies that require material estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from the amount derived from
management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for
Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. This allowance is increased by
provisions charged to operating expense and by recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and reduced by charge-offs on loans or reductions in the provision credited to operating expense. 
 The Bank provides for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that management estimates
is adequate to absorb probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers past and anticipated loss experience, evaluations
of underlying collateral, financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and the levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates
and ultimate losses may vary from such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and provides for loan losses monthly when appropriate to maintain the adequacy of the allowance. 
 Regarding impaired loans, the Bank individually evaluates each loan and documents what management believes to be an
appropriate reserve level in accordance with ASC 310. If management does not believe that any separate reserve for such loan is deemed necessary at the evaluation date, it would continue to be evaluated separately and will not be returned to be
included in the normal ASC 450 Contingencies ASC 450 formula based reserve calculation. In evaluating impaired loans, all related management discounts of appraised values, selling and resolution costs are taken into
consideration in determining the level of reserves required when appropriate. The methodology employed in
calculating the allowance for loan losses is portfolio segmentation. For the commercial real estate CRE portfolio, this is further refined through stratification within each segment based
 
 37 

on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. The CRE portfolio is further segmented by type of properties securing those loans. This approach allows the Bank to take into consideration the fact that the
various sectors of the real estate market change value at differing rates and thereby present different risk levels. CRE loans are segmented into the following categories: 

Apartments 

Offices 

Retail 

Mixed Use 

Industrial/Other CRE loans are segmented using the above collateral-types and three LTV ratio categories: 60 . While these ranges are subjective, management feels that each category represents a
significantly different degree of risk from the other. CRE loans carrying higher LTV ratios are assigned incrementally higher ASC 450 reserve rates. Annually, for the CRE portfolio, management adjusts the appraised values which are used to calculate
LTV ratios in our allowance for loan losses calculation. The data is provided by an independent appraiser and it indicates annual changes in value for each property type in the Bank s market area for the last ten years. Management then adjusts
the appraised or most recent appraised values based on the year the appraisal was made. These adjustments are believed to be appropriate based on the Bank s own experience with collateral values in its market area in recent years. Based on the
Company s allowance for loan loss methodology with respect to CRE, unfavorable trends in the value of real estate will increase the level of the Company s ASC 450 allowance for loan losses. 
 In developing ASC 450 reserve levels, recent regulatory guidance focuses on the Bank s charge-off history as a
starting point. The Bank s charge-off history in recent years has been minimal; therefore, management continues to utilize more conservative historical loss ratios which are believed to be appropriate. Those ratios are then adjusted based on
trends in delinquent and impaired loans, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit concentrations. There is a
concentration in CRE loans, but the concentration is decreasing. Management s efforts to reduce the levels of commercial real estate and construction loans are reflected in changes in the Bank s commercial real estate concentration ratio,
which is calculated as total non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction loans divided by the Bank s risk-based capital. At March 31, 2012, the commercial real estate concentration ratio was 286 , compared to a ratio of 330 
at March 31, 2011, and 466 at March 31, 2010. Residential loans, home equity loans and consumer
loans, other than trouble debt restructuring TDRs and loans in the process of foreclosure or repossession, are collectively evaluated for impairment. Factors considered in determining the appropriate ASC 450 reserve levels are trends
in delinquent and impaired loans, changes in the value of collateral, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit
concentrations. TDRs and loans that are in the process of foreclosure or repossession are evaluated under ASC 310. Commercial and industrial and construction loans that are not impaired are evaluated under ASC 450 and factors considered in determining the appropriate reserve levels include trends in delinquent and
impaired loans, changes in the value of collateral, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit concentrations.
Those loans that are individually reviewed for impairment are evaluated according to ASC 310. During the year
ended March 31, 2012, management changed the various ASC 450 loss factors, specifically as it related to trends in delinquencies and impaired loans, changes in collateral values, charge-offs and recoveries, and trends and conditions related to
economic conditions among the different loan types. As a result of these factor changes, the impact to the allowance for loan losses were increases in ASC 450 reserves of approximately 372 thousand. 
 38 

Although management uses available information to establish the appropriate
level of the allowance for loan losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in loan composition or volume, changes in economic market area
conditions or other factors. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company s operating results. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments
about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management currently believes that there are adequate reserves and collateral securing nonperforming loans to cover losses that may result from these loans at March 31, 2012.
 In the ordinary course of business, the Bank enters into commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of
credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the allowance for
loan losses. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities in the balance sheet. At March 31, 2012, the reserve for unfunded commitments was not significant. 
 Loans. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at
the principal amount outstanding, adjusted by unamortized discounts, premiums, and net deferred loan origination costs and fees. Loans classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Fair value is estimated based on outstanding investor commitments. Net unrealized losses, if any, are provided
for in a valuation allowance by charges to operations. The Company enters into forward commitments (generally on a best efforts delivery basis) to sell loans held for sale in order to reduce market risk associated with the origination of such loans.
Loans held for sale are sold on a servicing released basis. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011 there were no loans held for sale. Mortgage loan commitments that relate to the origination of a mortgage that will be held for sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments. Loan commitments that are derivatives are recognized
at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in noninterest income. The Company carefully evaluates all loan sales agreements to determine whether they meet the definition of a derivative as facts and circumstances may differ significantly. If agreements qualify, to
protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, the Company generally uses best efforts forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loans that would result from the
exercise of the derivative loan commitments. Forward loan sale commitments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other assets and liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in other noninterest income. At
March 31, 2012, the fair value of forward loan sale commitments was not material. Loan origination fees,
net of certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and are amortized into interest income over the contractual loan term using the level-yield method. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, net deferred loan fees of 91 thousand and net deferred
loan costs of 23 thousand, respectively, were included with the related loan balances for financial presentation purposes. Interest income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the simple interest method only if deemed collectible. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as
nonaccrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans and amortization of net deferred loan fees or costs are discontinued either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full and timely collection of interest or principal, or when a loan becomes
contractually past due 90 days with respect to interest or principal. The accrual on some loans, however, may 
 39 

continue even though they are more than 90 days past due if management deems it appropriate, provided that the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and
when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. The Bank records interest income on nonaccrual and impaired loans on the cash basis of accounting. 
 Loans are classified as impaired when it is probable that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due in
accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans, except those loans that are accounted for at fair value or at lower of cost or fair value such as loans held for sale, are accounted for at the present value of the
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or as a practical expedient in the case of collateral dependent loans, the lower of the fair value of the collateral less selling and other costs, or the recorded
amount of the loan. In evaluating collateral values for impaired loans, management obtains new appraisals or opinions of value when deemed necessary and may discount those appraisals depending on the likelihood of foreclosure. Other factors
considered by management when discounting appraisals are the age of the appraisal, availability of comparable properties, geographic considerations, and property type. Management considers the payment status, net worth and earnings potential of the
borrower, and the value and cash flow of the collateral as factors to determine if a loan will be paid in accordance with its contractual terms. Management does not set any minimum delay of payments as a factor in reviewing for impairment
classification. For all loans, charge-offs occur when management believes that the collectability of a portion or all of the loan s principal balance is remote. Management considers nonaccrual loans, except for certain nonaccrual residential
and consumer loans, to be impaired. However, all TDRs are considered to be impaired. A TDR occurs when the Bank grants a concession to a borrower with financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider. The majority of TDRs involve a
modification in loan terms such as a temporary reduction in the interest rate or a temporary period of interest only, and escrow (if required). TDRs are accounted for as set forth in ASC 310 Receivables ASC 310 ). A TDR is
typically on non-accrual until the borrower successfully performs under the new terms for at least six consecutive months. However, a TDR may be kept on accrual immediately following the restructuring in those instances where a borrower s
payments are current prior to the modification and management determines that principal and interest under the new terms are fully collectible. Existing performing loan customers who request a non-TDR loan modification and who meet the Bank s underwriting standards may, usually for a fee, modify their original loan terms to terms currently
offered. The modified terms of these loans are similar to the terms offered to new customers with similar credit, income, and collateral. The fee assessed for modifying the loan is deferred and amortized over the life of the modified loan using the
level-yield method and is reflected as an adjustment to interest income. Each modification is examined on a loan-by-loan basis and if the modification of terms represents more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized balance of the
pre-modification deferred fees or costs associated with the mortgage loan are recognized in interest income at the time of the modification. If the modification of terms does not represent more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized
balance of the pre-modification deferred fees or costs continue to be deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank s
assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Bank s deferred
tax asset is reviewed periodically and adjustments to such asset are recognized as deferred income tax expense or benefit based on management s judgments relating to the realizability of such an asset. 
 Accounting for Goodwill and Impairment. ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, ASC
350 addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite lives acquired in a business combination, eliminates further amortization of goodwill and requires periodic impairment
 
 40 

evaluations of goodwill using a fair value methodology prescribed in ASC 350. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize the goodwill balance of 2.2 million and the Company
consists of a single reporting unit. Impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently as a result of an event or change in circumstances e.g ., recurring operating losses by the acquired entity) that would indicate an
impairment adjustment may be necessary. The Company adopted December 31 as its assessment date. Annual impairment testing was performed during each year and in each analysis, it was determined that an impairment charge was not required. The
most recent testing was performed as of December 31, 2011 utilizing average earnings and average book and tangible book multiples of sales transactions of banks considered to be comparable to the Company, and management determined that no
impairment existed at that date. Management utilized 2011 sales transaction data of financial institutions in the New England area of similar size, credit quality, net income, and return on average assets levels and management feels that the overall
assumptions utilized in the testing process were reasonable. During the December 31, 2011 impairment testing, management also considered utilizing market capitalization, but ultimately concluded that it was not an appropriate measure of the
Company s value due to the overall depressed valuations in the financial sector and the significance of the Company s insider ownership and the lack of volume in trading in the Company s shares of common stock. Management also does
not believe that this measure generally reflects the premium that a buyer would typically pay for a controlling interest. No events have occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2012 which indicate that the impairment test would need to
be re-performed. Investments. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, both computed by a method that approximates the effective yield method. Debt and equity securities
that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not classified as either
held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses determined by management to be temporary excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders 
equity and comprehensive income. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the Bank s investment securities were classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized when realized with the cost basis of investments sold determined on a specific-identification basis. Premiums and discounts on investment and
mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted to interest income over the actual or expected lives of the securities using the level-yield method. If a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis. For
debt securities, when the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and it is more-likely-than-not that the Bank will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary
impairment loss in earnings, and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the
security as estimated based on the cash flows projections discounted at the applicable original yield of the security. Stock-Based Compensation . The Company accounts for stock based compensation pursuant to ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC
718 ). The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of stock option grants. The Company has previously adopted two qualified stock option plans for the benefit of officers and other employees
under which an aggregate of 281,500 shares have been reserved for issuance. One of these plans expired in 1997 and the other plan expired in 2009. Awards outstanding at the time the plans expire will continue to remain outstanding according to their
terms. On July 31, 2006, the Company s stockholders approved the Central Bancorp, Inc. 2006
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan ). Under the Incentive Plan, 150,000 shares have been reserved for issuance 
 41 

as options to purchase stock, restricted stock, or other stock awards, however, a maximum of 100,000 restricted shares may be granted under the plan. The exercise price of an option may not be
less than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant of the option and may not be exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. However, awards may become available again if participants forfeit awards
under the plan prior to its expiration. As of March 31, 2012, no shares remain available for issue under the Incentive Plan. Forfeitures of awards granted under the Incentive Plan are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to
derive the Company s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option and are typically estimated based on historical experience. Based on an analysis of the
Company s historical data, the Company applied a forfeiture rate of 0 to stock options outstanding in determining stock compensation expense for each of the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. 
 Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program On August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a letter agreement (the Repurchase Letter with the United States Department of the Treasury Treasury ), pursuant
to which the Company redeemed, out of the proceeds of its issuance of 10,000 shares of its Series B Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, all 10,000 outstanding shares of its Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,
liquidation amount 1,000 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), for a redemption price of 10,013,889, including accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. On December 5, 2008, the Company sold 10.0 million in
the Series A Preferred Stock to the Treasury as a participant in the federal government s Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP Capital Purchase Program. This represented approximately 2.6 of the Company s risk-weighted assets
as of September 30, 2008. In connection with the investment, the Company had entered into a Letter Agreement and the related Securities Purchase Agreement with the Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued the 10,000 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and a warrant (the Warrant to purchase 234,742 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10.0 million in cash. 
 The Company subsequently repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury on October 19, 2011 for an aggregate purchase
price of 2.5 million. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. U.S. Treasury Department Small Business Lending Fund On
August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued 10,000 shares of the
Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock ), having a liquidation amount per share equal to 1,000, for a total purchase price of 10,000,000. The Purchase
Agreement was entered into, and the Series B Preferred Stock was issued, pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund SBLF program, a fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, that encourages lending to small
businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than 10 billion. The Company used the 10 million in SBLF funds to redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock issued under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. For
additional information, see Note 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. Results of
Operations Overview. Net income for the twelve months ended March 31, 2012 was 851
thousand and the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended March 31, 2012 was (15) thousand, or (0.01) per diluted common share, as compared to net income of 1.7 million and net income available to common
 
 42 

stockholders of 1.1 million, or 0.68 per diluted common share, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2011. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2012, the Company experienced a 874
thousand decline in net income as compared to fiscal 2011. The decline was primarily attributable to the combination of the decrease in net interest and dividend income of 1.3 million, an increase in non-interest expenses of 418 thousand and an
increase in the provision for loan losses of 300 thousand, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for income taxes of 855 thousand and an increase in non-interest income of 268 thousand. 
 Net interest and dividend income decreased by 1.3 million, or 7.4 , to 16.1 million for the year ended March 31,
2012 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011 due to the combined effect of a general decline in market interest rates on loans and a strategic decision to decrease higher-yielding commercial real estate loan balances. 
 The provision for loan losses increased by 300 thousand to 1.4 million during fiscal 2012 from 1.1 million in fiscal
2011. The increase was primarily due to increased loan charge offs which totaled 1.1 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to 250 thousand in fiscal 2011. Noninterest income totaled 2.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to 2.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to an increase in investment gains and reduced
impairment charges in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Noninterest expenses totaled 16.1 million for
the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to 15.7 million in fiscal 2011. Total noninterest expenses increased by 418 thousand in fiscal 2012 primarily due to a 787 thousand increase in salaries and benefits along with merger expenses of 122
thousand which were not incurred in fiscal 2011. The foregoing increase in non-interest expenses were partially offset by declines during the twelve months ended March 31 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, in professional fees of 293 thousand,
office occupancy and equipment expenses of 83 thousand, data processing costs of 65 thousand and marketing and advertising expenses of 49 thousand. The Company recognized an income tax expense of 91 thousand during fiscal 2012 compared to 946 thousand in fiscal 2011 for an effective tax rate of 9.7 in fiscal 2012 and 35.4 in fiscal 2011.
 Net Interest Rate Spread and Net Interest Margin. The Company s and the Bank s
operating results are significantly affected by the net interest rate spread, which is the difference between the yield on loans and investments and the interest cost of deposits and borrowings. The net interest rate spread is affected by economic
conditions and market factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows. The net interest margin reflects the relationship of net interest income to interest earning assets and it is calculated by dividing net interest income
before the provision for loan losses by average interest earning assets. The net interest spread and net interest margin declined from 3.25 and 3.50 , respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 to 3.10 and 3.34 , respectively, for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 due to several factors. The cost of funds decreased by 24 basis points during fiscal 2012 mainly due to decreases in the average rates paid on deposits resulting from aggressive liability management as some
maturing certificates of deposit were either not renewed or were replaced with lower cost deposits. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, the yield on interest-earning assets declined by 39 basis points primarily due to a 52 basis point
reduction in interest income on mortgage loans. Contributing to the reduced yield on mortgage loans were decreases in commercial real estate and construction loans as management refocused its lending emphasis in the current market environment in an
effort to reduce risk and increase regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Company s business plan, and a general decline in the market interest rates on loans.

Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income decreased by
 2.6 million, or 10.2 , to 22.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to 25.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to decreases in the average yields and average loan balances. The average balance of loans
decreased primarily due to decreases in the average balances of commercial real estate and construction loans as the Bank continued to shift its focus from those loan types to originating residential real estate loans. The average balance of
residential loans decreased due to higher than expected residential loan payoffs. The average balance of investment securities decreased as maturities and principal repayments were used to fund deposit withdrawals and repayment of borrowings. The
yield on short-term investments was 0.24 during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 0.26 for the year ended March 31, 2011 as the average yields on these investments are closely tied to the federal funds target rate, which
averaged approximately 0.25 during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. Interest
Expense. Interest expense decreased by 1.3 million, or 16.5 , to 6.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to 7.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2011. The cost of deposits decreased by 24 basis points from
0.83 during the year ended March 31, 2011 to 0.59 during the year ended March 31, 2012, as some higher-cost certificates of deposit were replaced by lower-costing deposits. The average balance of lower-costing non-maturity deposits
decreased by 5.4 million to 199.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to an average balance of 204.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2011. The average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston borrowings
decreased by 12.3 million, from 129.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 to 117.3 million for the same period of 2012. The decrease in the average cost of these funds was the result of a decrease in market interest rates. The
average cost of total borrowings decreased as a portion of these borrowings are adjustable and declined as a result of a decline in market rates, as well as a reduction in average balance, the combination of which lowered the average rate paid for
the year ended March 31, 2012 to 3.74 from the average rate of 3.83 for the year ended March 31, 2011.

Provision for Loan Losses. The Company provides for
loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that management estimates is adequate to absorb probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. In determining the appropriate level of
the allowance for loan losses, management considers past and anticipated loss experience, evaluations of underlying collateral, financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and the
levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and provides for loan
losses monthly when appropriate to maintain the adequacy of the allowance. The Company uses a process of portfolio segmentation to calculate the appropriate allowance level at the end of each quarter. Periodically, the Company evaluates the
allocations used in these calculations. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, management performed a thorough analysis of the loan portfolio as well as the required allowance allocations for loans considered impaired under ASC 310 and
the allocation percentages used when calculating potential losses under ASC 450. During the year ended March 31, 2012, management changed the various ASC 450 loss factors, specifically as it related to trends in delinquencies and impaired
loans, changes in collateral values, charge-offs and recoveries, and trends and conditions related to economic conditions among the different loan types. As a result of these loss factor changes, increases in ASC 450 reserves of approximately 372
thousand were made to the allowance for loan losses. Based on these analyses, the Company recorded a provision of 1.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to a provision for loan losses of 1.1 million for the year ended
March 31, 2011. Management continues to give high priority to monitoring and managing the Company s
asset quality. At March 31, 2012, nonperforming loans totaled 9.0 million as compared to 9.6 million at March 31, 2011. Of the twenty loans constituting this category at March 31, 2012, all are secured by real estate collateral that
is predominantly located in the Bank s market area. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income
increased by 268 thousand from 2.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 to 2.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to investment gains and reduced impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and
totaled 541 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 136 thousand in fiscal 2011. Net investment gains were 588 thousand in fiscal 2012 as compared to 480 thousand in fiscal 2011 while other than temporary impairments
totaled 47 thousand in fiscal 2012 as compared to 344 thousand in fiscal 2011. In addition, gains on the sale of other real estate owned totaled 38 thousand in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2 thousand in fiscal 2011. Partially offsetting the
aforementioned increases were decreases in gains on sales of loans of 108 thousand due to decreased loan sale activity and reduced deposit fees of 44 thousand. 
 Noninterest Expenses. Noninterest expense increased by 418 thousand, or 2.7 to 16.1 million during the
year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 15.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2011. This increase is due to increases in salaries and other benefits of 787 thousand along with merger expenses of 122 thousand which were not
incurred in fiscal 2011. The foregoing increases were partially offset by a 83 thousand decrease in occupancy and equipment costs, a 65 thousand decrease in data processing costs, a 293 thousand decrease in other professional fees, a 147
thousand decrease in FDIC insurance premiums and a 49 thousand decrease in marketing expenses. Salaries and
employee benefits increased by 787 thousand, or 8.6 , to 9.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 9.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2011, primarily due to increases of 607 thousand in commissions paid
for residential loan origination costs (primarily due to the high level of residential closings) and non-deposit investment product sales and 289 thousand for salaries due to staffing increases, increases in certain retirement and health benefits.
 Office occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by 83 thousand, or 3.9 , to 2.1 million during the year
ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 2.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to decreases in the amortization of leasehold improvements, depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment and decreases for other bank
building expenses, partially offset by increases in computer/network maintenance costs and other security expenses. 
 46 

Data processing costs decreased by 65 thousand, or 7.7 , to 779 thousand
during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 844 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2011 due to decreases in certain processing costs. Professional fees decreased by 293 thousand, or 28.1 , to 751 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 1.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to
decreases in loan workout-related expenses and compliance-related costs, partially offset by higher legal fees. 
 Merger expenses of 122 thousand were incurred during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to none being
incurred during fiscal 2011 as a result of the pending merger with Independent Bank Corp, Inc. announced on May 1, 2012. FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased by 147 thousand to 414 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to 561 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2011. This decrease was
primarily due to a change in the calculation methodology implemented by the FDIC in April 2011 and lower deposit insurance costs due to declining average balances of deposits. 
 Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 49 thousand to 144 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2012
as compared to 193 thousand during the year ended March 31, 2011 as management strategically decided to deemphasize advertising and marketing efforts. Other expenses increased by 191 thousand, or 11.2 , to 1.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 1.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 primarily as a result
of an increase in other telephone expense of 69 thousand and ATM expenses of 38 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of 147 thousand for FDIC insurance assessment and 16 thousand for recruiting expense. 
 Income Taxes . The effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2012 was 9.7 as
compared to an effective income tax rate of 35.4 for the year ended March 31, 2011. The difference in the effective tax rate for the two periods was due to the reversal of certain prior year uncertain tax positions and the realization of other
deferred tax assets from the sale of investments for both capital and ordinary losses. In addition, the proportion of non-taxable income sources to total pre-taxable income from bank-owned life insurance and dividend received deductions were greater
in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. For further information, see Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 Total assets were 523.4 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 487.6 million at March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 35.8 million, or 7.3 . The increase in total assets reflected
strategic actions taken by management to reduce risk, which included increasing the residential loan portfolio by 87.2 million and continuing to de-emphasize commercial real estate lending in accordance with the Company s business plan. Total
loans (excluding loans held for sale) were 448.9 million at March 31, 2012, compared to 394.2 million at March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 54.7 million, or 13.9 . This increase was primarily due to increases in residential
loans of 87.2 million, offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans of 31.9 million. Residential and home equity loans increased from 191.6 million at March 31, 2011 to 278.8 million at March 31, 2012. Commercial and industrial
loans decreased from 2.2 million at March 31, 2011 to 1.1 million at March 31, 2012 primarily due to the scheduled repayments of principal. Management s efforts to reduce the levels of commercial real estate and land and
construction loans are reflected in changes in the Bank s commercial real estate concentration ratio, which is calculated as total non-owner occupied commercial real estate and land and construction loans divided by the Bank s risk-based
capital. At March 31, 2012, the commercial real estate concentration ratio was 286 , compared to a ratio of 330 at March 31, 2011. The allowance for loan losses totaled 4.3 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 3.9 million at March 31, 2011, representing a net increase of 380 thousand, or 9.8 . This net increase was
primarily due to a provision 
 47 

of 1.4 million resulting from management s review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Based upon management s regular analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses, management considered the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at both March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011. See Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 
Provision for Loan Losses. Management regularly assesses the desirability of holding newly
originated residential mortgage loans in the Bank s portfolio or selling such loans in the secondary market. A number of factors are evaluated to determine whether or not to hold such loans in the Bank s portfolio including current and
projected liquidity, current and projected interest rates, projected growth in other interest-earning assets and the current and projected interest rate risk profile. Based on its consideration of these factors, management determined that most
long-term residential mortgage loans originated during the year ended March 31, 2012 should be retained in the Bank s portfolio rather than being sold in the secondary market. Originations of loans held for sale totaled 10.9 million in
fiscal 2012 as compared to 20.8 million in fiscal 2011. The decision to sell or hold loans is made at the time the loan commitment is issued. Upon making a determination not to retain a loan, the Bank simultaneously enters into a best efforts
forward commitment to sell the loan to manage the interest rate risk associated with the decision to sell the loan. Loans are sold servicing released and totaled 11.1 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to 21.4 million in fiscal 2011. 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 7.3 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 40.9 million at March 31, 2011,
representing a decrease of 33.6 million, or 82.1 . During the year ended March 31, 2012, proceeds from cash and cash equivalents, commercial real estate payoffs and increases in certificates of deposit were generally utilized to fund the
growth in the residential loan portfolio. Investment securities totaled 48.8 million at March 31, 2012
compared to 35.3 million at March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 13.6 million, or 38.4 . The increase in investment securities is primarily due to the purchase of 23.4 million in mortgage-backed securities and 2.2 million in common
stock, offset by the sale of 5.6 million in mortgage-backed securities and the repayment of 5.3 million of principal on mortgage-backed securities. Stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston totaled 8.2 million at March 31, 2012 compared
to 8.5 million at March 31, 2011. Banking premises and equipment, net, totaled 2.7 million at
March 31, 2012 and 2.7 million at March 31, 2011, respectively. Other real estate owned totaled
 133 thousand at March 31, 2012 compared to 132 thousand at March 31, 2011 as two new residential properties were added and two residential properties were sold during the year. 
 Deferred tax assets totaled 3.3 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 3.6 million at March 31, 2011 due to
the reversal of certain prior year tax benefits and the realization of other deferred tax assets from the sale of investments for both capital and ordinary losses. 
 The cash surrender value of a bank-owned life insurance policy on two executives is carried as an asset titled
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance and totaled approximately 9.6 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 7.3 million at March 31, 2011. During the 2012 fiscal year, the Bank purchased an additional 2.1 million life insurance
policy. Total deposits amounted to 344.5 million at March 31, 2012 compared to 309.1 million at
March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 35.5 million, or 11.5 . The increase was a result of the combined effect of a 32.8 million increase in certificates of deposit and a net increase in core deposits of 2.6 million (consisting of all
non-certificate accounts). Growth in certificates of deposit during fiscal 2012 included 28.6 million obtained through a non-broker listing service. During the year ended March 31, 2012, management utilized increases in deposits to fund the
residential loan growth in accordance with the Company s business plan. 
 48 

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances amounted to 117.2 million at
March 31, 2012 and 117.4 million at March 31, 2011. The net decrease in stockholders 
equity from 47.1 million at March 31, 2011 to 45.3 million at March 31, 2012 was primarily due to the Company s 2.5 million negotiated repurchase of the warrant associated with the Company s participation in the U.S.
Department of Treasury s TARP Capital Purchase Program. The Company repurchased the warrant from the U.S. Department of Treasury on October 19, 2011. Other items contributing to the net decrease in stockholders equity during the year
were 803 thousand of dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders, partially offset by net income of 851 thousand, stock-based compensation of 441 thousand and amortization of unearned ESOP compensation of 395 thousand. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Bank s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits, short-term investments, repayments
of loans, FHLB of Boston advances, maturities and repayments of various other investments, and funds from operations. These various sources of liquidity, as well as the Bank s ability to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market,
are used to fund deposit withdrawals, loan originations and investment purchases and funds from operations. In addition, the Company has access to the capital markets to raise additional equity. On August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and
consummated the Purchase Agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued 10,000 shares of the Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B having a liquidation
amount per share equal to 1,000, for a total purchase price of 10,000,000 pursuant to the SBLF program, a fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified
community banks with assets of less than 10 billion. The Company used the 10 million in SBLF funds to redeem shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock issued to treasury in December 2008 under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. On
October 19, 2011, the Company repurchased the warrant it previously issued to treasury on December 8, 2008 in connection with the Company s participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The warrant, which had a ten-year term,
had entitled Treasury to purchase up to 234,742 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 6.39 per share. The Company paid Treasury a negotiated total of 2.5 million to repurchase the warrant. See Troubled
Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program and U.S. Treasury Department Small Business Lending Fund above. During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Bank increased deposits by 34.5 million, or 11.5 . The increase in deposits reflected strategic actions taken by management to reduce risk and increase
capital ratios in accordance with the Company s business plan, which included the use of proceeds from loan repayments and investment maturities and repayments to fund certain maturing deposits and borrowings. Differences in deposit levels are
primarily the result of management s decision to focus at various times on the use of deposits instead of FHLB of Boston advances to fund growth. These decisions are based on the relative interest rates of the various sources of funds at any
particular time. On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted an Amended Restoration Plan
to enable the Deposit Insurance Fund to return to its minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 over eight years. Under this plan, the FDIC did not impose a previously-planned second special assessment. On June 30, 2009, the Bank accrued the first special
assessment which totaled 270 thousand and was paid on September 30, 2009. Also, the plan calls for deposit insurance premiums to increase by 3 basis points effective January 1, 2011. Additionally, to meet bank failure cash flow needs, the
FDIC assessed a three year insurance premium prepayment, which was paid by banks in December 2009 and will cover the period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. The FDIC estimates that bank failures will cost the fund
approximately 100 billion during the next three years, but only projects revenues of approximately 60 billion. The shortfall will be met through the collection of prepaid premiums, which is estimated to be 45 billion. The Bank s prepaid
premium totaled 2.3 million and was paid during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. This prepaid deposit premium is carried on the consolidated balance sheet in the other assets category and totaled 1.2 million at March 31, 2012.
 
 49 

At March 31, 2012, the Company had commitments to originate loans,
unused outstanding lines of credit, letters of credit and undisbursed proceeds of loans totaling 40.0 million. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. At March 31, 2012, the Company believes it has sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments. The Bank is a voluntary member of the FHLB of Boston and has the ability to borrow up to the value of its qualified collateral that has not been pledged to others. Qualified collateral generally consists
of FHLB of Boston stock, residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, U.S. Government and agencies securities, mortgage-backed securities and funds on deposit at the FHLB of Boston. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank had
outstanding FHLB of Boston advances of 117.2 and 117.4 million, respectively. At March 31, 2012, the Bank had approximately 84 million in unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Boston. 
 The Bank also may obtain funds from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund and
through a retail CD brokerage agreement with a major brokerage firm. The Bank views these borrowing facilities as secondary sources of liquidity and has had no immediate need to use them. Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Risk In
the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in its consolidated financial statements. These transactions involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. 
 For the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to
have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Commitments to
originate new loans or to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Loan commitments generally expire within 30 to 45 days. Most home equity line commitments are
for a term of 15 years, and commercial lines of credit are generally renewable on an annual basis. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. At March 31, 2012, the Company
had commitments to originate loans, unused outstanding lines of credit, letters of credit and undisbursed proceeds of loans totaling 40.0 million. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is
based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Commitments to sell loans held for sale are
agreements to sell loans on a best efforts delivery basis to a third party at an agreed upon price. Additionally, these loans are sold servicing released and without recourse. 
 On September 16, 2004 the Company completed a 5.1 million trust preferred securities financing through
Central Bancorp Capital Trust I. On January 31, 2007, the Company completed a trust preferred securities financing in the amount of 5.9 million through Central Bancorp Statutory Trust II. Central Bancorp Capital Trust I and Central Bancorp
Statutory Trust II are the Company s only special purpose subsidiaries. The Company, within the financing transactions and concurrent with the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities, issued guarantees
related to the trust securities of both trusts for the benefit of their respective holders. For additional information, see Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 
 Management believes that, at March 31, 2012, the Company and Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to fund these
commitments.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative
purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the assts and liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bank s
performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation. Capital Resources The Company and the Bank are required to
maintain minimum capital ratios pursuant to the federal prompt corrective action regulations. These regulations establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet obligations. Two
categories of capital are defined: Tier 1 or core capital (stockholders equity) and Tier 2 or supplementary capital. Total capital is the sum of both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. According to the federal prompt corrective action regulations,
Tier 1 capital must represent at least 50 of qualifying total capital. At March 31, 2012, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio required to be well-capitalized was 10.00 . The Company s and the Bank s total risk-based capital
ratios at March 31, 2012 were 16.39 and 14.83 , respectively. To complement the risk-based standards,
the FDIC has also adopted a leverage ratio (adjusted stockholders equity divided by total average assets) of 3.00 for the most highly rated banks and 4.00 for all others. The leverage ratio is to be used in tandem with the risk-based capital
ratios as the minimum standards for banks. The Company s and the Bank s leverage ratios were 9.83 and 8.81 , respectively, at March 31, 2012. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between the yield on
interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, or market risk, through active monitoring and management of its interest-rate risk exposure. The policies
and procedures for managing both on- and off-balance sheet activities are established by the Bank s asset/liability management committee ALCO ). The Board of Directors reviews and approves the ALCO policy annually and monitors
related activities on an ongoing basis. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices
and rates. The Company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, borrowing and deposit taking activities. The main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank s net interest income and preserve capital, while adjusting the
Bank s asset/liability structure to control interest-rate risk. However, a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not
change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. The Company quantifies its interest-rate
risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model. Simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specific time horizon. Simulation analysis involves projecting future interest
income and expense under various rate scenarios. The simulation is based on forecasted cash flows and assumptions of management about the future changes in interest rates and levels of activity (loan originations, loan prepayments, deposit flows,
etc). The assumptions are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies. The net interest
income projection resulting from the use of forecasted cash flows and management s assumptions is compared to net 
 51 

interest income projections based on immediate shifts of 300 basis points upward and 50 basis points downward for fiscal 2012 and 2011. Internal guidelines on interest rate risk state that for
every 100 basis points immediate shift in interest rates, estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by no more than 5 . The following table indicates the projected change in net interest income, and sets forth such change as a percentage of estimated net interest income, for the twelve-month period following the date
indicated assuming an immediate and parallel shift for all market rates with other rates adjusting to varying degrees in each scenario based on both historical and expected spread relationships:

 As noted, this policy provides broad, visionary guidance for managing the Bank s
balance sheet, not absolute limits. When the simulation results indicate a variance from stated parameters, ALCO will intensify its scrutiny of the reasons for the variance and take whatever actions are deemed appropriate under the circumstances.

CENTRAL BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 AND 2011 
 Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central Bancorp, Inc. (the
 Company ), a Massachusetts corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Central Co-operative Bank (the Bank ), as well as the wholly owned subsidiaries of the Bank, Central Securities Corporation, Central Securities
Corporation II, and Metro Real Estate Holdings, LLC. The Company was organized at the direction of the Bank
in September 1998 to acquire all of the capital stock of the Bank upon the consummation of the reorganization of the Bank into the holding company form of ownership. This reorganization was completed in January 1999. The Bank was organized as a
Massachusetts chartered co-operative bank in 1915 and converted from mutual to stock form of ownership in 1986. The primary business of the Bank is to generate funds in the form of deposits and use the funds to make mortgage loans for the
construction, purchase and refinancing of residential properties, and to make loans on commercial real estate in its market area. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions. The Company is subject to the regulations of, and
periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve Bank FRB ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks. The Bank s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC
for deposits up to 250,000 for most accounts and up to 250,000 for retirement accounts and the Share Insurance Fund SIF for deposits in excess of the FDIC limits. Additionally, during 2010, amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act were enacted, providing unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts beginning December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012. 
 The Company conducts its business through one operating segment, the Bank. Most of the Bank s activities are with
customers located in eastern Massachusetts. As set forth in Note 3 herein, the Bank concentrates in real estate lending. Management believes that the Bank does not have any significant concentrations in any one customer or industry. 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and income and expenses for the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change relate
to the allowance for loan losses, fair value of other real estate owned, fair value of investments and other-than-temporary impairment, income taxes, accounting for goodwill and impairment, and stock-based compensation. 
 The Company owns 100 of the common stock of Central Bancorp Capital Trust I Trust I and Central Bancorp
Statutory Trust II Trust II ), which have issued trust preferred securities to the public in private placement offerings. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing , neither
Trust I nor Trust II are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements (See Subordinated Debentures below). The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Company and the Bank: Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, money market mutual fund investments, federal funds sold and other short-term investments having an original maturity at date of purchase of 90 days or less. 
 59 

The Bank is required to maintain cash and reserve balances with the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston. Such required reserves are calculated based upon deposit levels and amounted to approximately 1.9 million at March 31, 2012. Investments Debt securities that management has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, both computed by a method that approximates the effective yield method. Debt
and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not
classified as either held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses determined by management to be temporary excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component
of stockholders equity and comprehensive income. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the Bank s investment securities were classified as available for sale. 
 Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized when realized with the cost basis of investments sold determined
on a specific-identification basis. Premiums and discounts on investment and mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted to interest income over the actual or expected lives of the securities using the level-yield method. 
 If a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary, the cost
basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis. For debt securities, when the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and it is more-likely-than-not that the Bank will not have to sell the security before recovery of
its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment loss in earnings, and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of
principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as estimated based on the cash flow projections discounted at the applicable original yield of the security. 
 The Company s investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund are
accounted for at cost. Such investments are reviewed for impairment when impairment indications are present. Factors considered in determining impairment include a current financial analysis of the issuer and an assessment of future financial
performance. Loans Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at the principal amount outstanding, adjusted by unamortized discounts, premiums, and net deferred loan
origination costs and fees. Loans classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
fair value. Fair value is estimated based on outstanding investor commitments. Net unrealized losses, if any, are provided for in a valuation allowance by charges to operations. The Company enters into forward commitments (generally on a best
efforts delivery basis) to sell loans held for sale in order to reduce market risk associated with the origination of such loans. Loans held for sale are sold on a servicing released basis. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no loans
held for sale. Mortgage loan commitments that relate to the origination of a mortgage that will be held for
sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments. Loan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in
noninterest income. The Company carefully evaluates all loan sales agreements to determine whether they meet
the definition of a derivative as facts and circumstances may differ significantly. If agreements qualify, to protect against the price 
 60 

risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, the Company generally uses best efforts forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loans
that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments. Mandatory delivery contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments. Accordingly, forward loan sale commitments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance
sheet in other assets and liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in other noninterest income. 
 Loan origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and are amortized into interest income
over the contractual loan term using the level-yield method. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, net deferred loan costs of 91 thousand and net deferred loan fees of 23 thousand, respectively, were included with the related loan balances for
financial presentation purposes. Interest income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the simple
interest method only if deemed collectible. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans and amortization of net deferred loan fees or costs are discontinued either
when reasonable doubt exists as to the full and timely collection of interest or principal, or when a loan becomes contractually past due 90 days with respect to interest or principal. The accrual on some loans, however, may continue even though
they are more than 90 days past due if management deems it appropriate, provided that the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is
reversed against current period interest income. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully
collectible as to both principal and interest. Loans are classified as impaired when it is probable that the
Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans, except those loans that are accounted for at fair value or at lower of cost or fair value such as loans held for sale,
are accounted for at the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient in the case of collateral dependent loans, the lower of the fair value of the collateral less
selling and other costs, or the recorded amount of the loan. In evaluating collateral values for impaired loans, management obtains new appraisals or opinions of value when deemed necessary and may discount those appraisals depending on the
likelihood of foreclosure. Other factors considered by management when discounting appraisals are the age of the appraisal, availability of comparable properties, geographic considerations, and property type. Management considers the payment status,
net worth and earnings potential of the borrower, and the value and cash flow of the collateral as factors to determine if a loan will be paid in accordance with its contractual terms. Management does not set any minimum delay of payments as a
factor in reviewing for impairment classification. For all loans, charge-offs occur when management believes that the collectibility of a portion or all of the loan s principal balance is remote. Management considers nonaccrual loans, except
for certain nonaccrual residential and consumer loans, to be impaired. However, all troubled debt restructurings TDRs are considered to be impaired. A TDR occurs when the Bank grants a concession to a borrower with financial
difficulties that it would not otherwise consider. The majority of TDRs involve a modification in loan terms such as a temporary reduction in the interest rate or a temporary period of interest only, and escrow (if required). TDRs are accounted for
as set forth in ASC 310 Receivables ASC 310 ). A TDR is typically on non-accrual until the borrower successfully performs under the new terms for at least six consecutive months. However, a TDR may be kept on accrual immediately
following the restructuring in those instances where a borrower s payments are current prior to the modification and management determines that principal and interest under the new terms are fully collectible. 
 Existing performing loan customers who request a non-TDR loan modification and who meet the Bank s underwriting
standards may, usually for a fee, modify their original loan terms to terms currently offered. The modified terms of these loans are similar to the terms offered to new customers with similar credit, income, and collateral. Each modification is
examined on a loan-by-loan basis and if the modification of terms represents more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized balance of the pre-modification deferred fees or costs associated with the mortgage loan are recognized in
interest income at the time of the modification. If the 
 61 

modification of terms does not represent more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized balance of the pre-modification deferred fees or costs continue to be deferred and amortized
over the remaining life of the loan. Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses
based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. This allowance is increased by provisions charged to operating expense and by recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and reduced by charge-offs on loans or reductions in the
provision credited to operating expense. The Bank provides for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance
for loan losses at a level that management estimates is adequate to absorb probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, management
considers past and anticipated loss experience, evaluations of underlying collateral, financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and the levels of non-performing and other
classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and provides for loan losses monthly when appropriate to
maintain the adequacy of the allowance. Regarding impaired loans, the Bank individually evaluates each loan
and documents what management believes to be an appropriate reserve level in accordance with ASC 310. If management does not believe that any separate reserves for such loans are deemed necessary at the evaluation date in accordance with ASC 310,
such loans would continue to be evaluated separately and will not be returned to be included in the general ASC 450 Contingencies ASC 450 formula based reserve calculation. In evaluating impaired loans, all related management
discounts of appraised values, selling and resolution costs are taken into consideration in determining the level of reserves required when appropriate. The methodology employed in calculating the allowance for loan losses is portfolio segmentation. For the commercial real estate CRE portfolio, this is further refined through stratification
within each segment based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. The CRE portfolio is further segmented by type of properties securing those loans. This approach allows the Bank to take into consideration the fact that the various sectors of the real estate
market change value at differing rates and thereby present different risk levels. CRE loans are segmented into the following categories: 

Apartments 

Offices 

Retail 

Mixed Use 

Industrial/Other Monthly, CRE loans are segmented using the above collateral-types and three LTV ratio categories: 60 . While these ranges are subjective, management feels that each category
represents a significantly different degree of risk from the other. CRE loans carrying higher LTV ratios are assigned incrementally higher ASC 450 reserve rates. Annually, for the CRE portfolio, management adjusts the appraised values which are used
to calculate LTV ratios in our allowance for loan losses calculation. The data is provided by an independent appraiser and it indicates annual changes in value for each property type in the Bank s market area for the last ten years. Management
then adjusts the appraised or most recent appraised values based on the year the appraisal was made. These adjustments are believed to be appropriate based on the Bank s own experience with collateral values in its market area in recent years.
Based on the Bank s allowance for loan loss methodology with respect to CRE, unfavorable trends in the value of real estate will increase the level of the Bank s ASC 450 allowance for loan losses. 
 62 

In developing ASC 450 reserve levels, regulatory guidance suggests using the
Bank s charge-off history as a starting point. The Bank s charge-off history in recent years has been minimal. The charge-off ratios are then adjusted based on trends in delinquent and impaired loans, trends in charge-offs and recoveries,
trends in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit concentrations. There is a concentration in CRE loans, but the concentration is decreasing. Management s
efforts to reduce the levels of commercial real estate and construction loans are reflected in changes in the Bank s commercial real estate concentration ratio, which is calculated as total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and
construction loans divided by the Bank s risk-based capital. At March 31, 2012, the commercial real estate concentration ratio was 286 , compared to a ratio of 330 at March 31, 2011, and 466 at March 31, 2010. 
 Residential loans, home equity loans and consumer loans, other than TDRs and loans in the process of foreclosure or
repossession, are collectively evaluated for impairment. In addition to our charge-off experience, factors considered in determining the appropriate ASC 450 reserve levels are trends in delinquent and impaired loans, changes in the value of
collateral, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit concentrations. TDRs and loans that are in the process of
foreclosure or repossession are evaluated under ASC 310. Commercial and industrial and construction loans
that are not impaired are evaluated under ASC 450 and factors considered in determining the appropriate reserve levels include trends in delinquent and impaired loans, changes in the value of collateral, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends
in underwriting practices, experience of loan staff, national and local economic trends, industry conditions, and changes in credit concentrations. Those loans that are individually reviewed for impairment are evaluated according to ASC 310.
 During the year ended March 31, 2012, management changed the various ASC 450 loss factors, specifically
as it related to trends in delinquencies and impaired loans, changes in collateral values, charge-offs and recoveries, and trends and conditions related to economic conditions among the different loan types. As a result of these loss factor changes,
increases in ASC 450 reserves of approximately 372 thousand were made to the allowance for loan losses. 
 Although management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses,
future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in loan composition or volume, changes in economic market area conditions or other factors. As a result, our
allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company s operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part
of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time
of their examination. Management currently believes that there are adequate reserves and collateral securing non-performing loans to cover losses that may result from these loans at March 31, 2012. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Bank enters into commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and
standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the allowance for loan
losses. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities in the balance sheet. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, the reserve for unfunded commitments was not significant. 
 Subordinated Debentures On September 16, 2004, the Company completed a trust preferred securities financing in the amount of 5.1 million. In the transaction, the Company formed a Delaware statutory trust, known as Central
Bancorp Capital Trust I Trust I ). Trust I issued and sold 5.1 million of trust preferred securities in a private placement and 
 63 

issued 158,000 of trust common securities to the Company. Trust I used the proceeds of these issuances to purchase 5.3 million of the Company s floating rate junior subordinated debentures
due December 15, 2034 (the Trust I Debentures ). The interest rate on the Trust I Debentures and the trust preferred securities is variable and adjustable quarterly at 2.44 over three-month LIBOR. At March 31, 2012 the interest
rate was 2.91 . The Trust I Debentures are the sole assets of Trust I and are subordinate to all of the Company s existing and future obligations for borrowed money. With respect to Capital Trust I, the trust preferred securities and debentures
each have 30-year lives and may be callable by the Company or the Trust, at their respective option, subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board, if then required. Interest on the trust preferred securities and the
debentures may be deferred at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods (five years), provided there is no event of default. 
 On January 31, 2007, the Company completed a trust preferred securities financing in the amount of 5.9 million. In
the transaction, the Company formed a Connecticut statutory trust, known as Central Bancorp Statutory Trust II Trust II ). Trust II issued and sold 5.9 million of trust preferred securities in a private placement and issued 183,000 of
trust common securities to the Company. Trust II used the proceeds of these issuances to purchase 6.1 million of the Company s floating rate junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2037 (the Trust II Debentures ). From
January 31, 2007 until March 15, 2017 (the Fixed Rate Period ), the interest rate on the Trust II Debentures and the trust preferred securities is fixed at 7.015 per annum. Upon the expiration of the Fixed Rate Period, the
interest rate on the Trust II Debentures and the trust preferred securities will be at a variable per annum rate, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.65 . The Trust II Debentures are the sole assets of Trust II. The Trust II
Debentures and the trust preferred securities each have 30-year lives. The trust preferred securities and the Trust II Debentures will each be callable by the Company or Trust II, at their respective option, after ten years, and sooner in certain
specific events, including in the event that the securities are not eligible for treatment as Tier 1 capital, subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board, if then required. Interest on the trust preferred securities and the Trust II
Debentures may be deferred at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly payments (five years), provided there is no event of default. 
 The trust preferred securities generally rank equal to the trust common securities in priority of payment, but will rank
prior to the trust common securities if and so long as the Company fails to make principal or interest payments on the Trust I and/or the Trust II Debentures. Concurrently with the issuance of the Trust I and the Trust II Debentures and the trust
preferred securities, the Company issued guarantees related to each trust s securities for the benefit of the respective holders of Trust I and Trust II. Income Taxes The Company recognizes income taxes
under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank s assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Bank s deferred tax asset is reviewed periodically
and adjustments to such asset are recognized as deferred income tax expense or benefit based on management s judgments relating to the realizability of such asset. 
 When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the
taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements
in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions
taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax 
 64 

benefit that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the
amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with
unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the statement of income. 
 Banking Premises and Equipment Land is stated at cost. Buildings, leasehold improvements and equipment are stated at cost, less allowances for depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or terms of the leases, if shorter. Rental payments under long-term leases are charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 
 Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned OREO is recorded at fair market value less estimated selling costs. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and asset values
are adjusted downward if necessary. Accounting for Goodwill and Impairment 
 ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , ASC 350 addresses the method of identifying and
measuring goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite lives acquired in a business combination, eliminates further amortization of goodwill and requires periodic impairment evaluations of goodwill using a fair value methodology prescribed
in ASC 350. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize the goodwill balance of 2.2 million. The Company consists of a single reporting unit. Impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently as a result of an event
or change in circumstances e.g ., recurring operating losses by the acquired entity) that would indicate an impairment adjustment may be necessary. The Company adopted December 31 as its assessment date. Annual impairment testing was
performed during each year and in each analysis, it was determined that an impairment charge was not required. The most recent testing was performed as of December 31, 2011 utilizing average earnings and average book and tangible book multiples
of sales transactions of banks considered to be comparable to the Company, and management determined that no impairment existed at that date. Management utilized 2011 sales transaction data of financial institutions in the New England area of
similar size, credit quality, net income, and return on average assets levels and management believes that the overall assumptions utilized in the testing process were reasonable. During the December 31, 2011 impairment testing, management also
considered utilizing market capitalization, but ultimately concluded that it was not an appropriate measure of the Company s fair value due to the overall depressed valuations in the financial sector and the significance of the Company s
insider ownership and the lack of volume in trading in the Company s shares of common stock. Management also does not believe that this measure generally reflects the premium that a buyer would typically pay for a controlling interest. No
events have occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2012 which would indicate that the impairment test would need to be re-performed. Pension Benefits and Other Post-Retirement Benefits 
 The Bank provides pension benefits for its employees in a multi-employer pension plan through membership in the
Co-operative Banks Employees Retirement Association. Pension costs are funded as they are accrued and are accounted for on a defined contribution plan basis. The Bank maintains supplemental retirement plans SERP for two highly compensated employees designed to offset the impact of regulatory limits on benefits under qualified pension plans. The
Bank recognizes retirement expense based upon an annual analysis performed by a benefits administrator. Annual SERP expense can vary based upon changes in factors such as changes in salaries or estimated retirement ages. 
 65 

The Bank also maintains a post-retirement medical insurance plan and life
insurance plan for certain individuals. The Bank recognizes the over funded or under funded status of the plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial condition and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the
changes occur through other comprehensive income as set forth by ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits ASC 715 ). Related Party Transactions Directors and officers
of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Bank, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans,
services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other
customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risks of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features.
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company accounts for stock based compensation pursuant to ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation
 ASC 718 ). The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of stock option grants. The Company has previously adopted two qualified stock option plans for the benefit of officers and
other employees under which an aggregate of 281,500 shares have been reserved for issuance. One of these plans expired in 1997 and the other plan expired in 2009. All awards under the plan that expired in 2009 were granted by the end of 2005. Awards
outstanding at the time the plans expire will continue to remain outstanding according to their terms. On
July 31, 2006, the Company s stockholders approved the Central Bancorp, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan ). Under the Incentive Plan, 150,000 shares have been reserved for issuance as options to purchase
stock, restricted stock, or other stock awards. However, a maximum of 100,000 restricted shares may be granted under the plan. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date
of grant of the option and may not be exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. However, awards may become available again if participants forfeit awards under the plan prior to their expiration. As of March 31, 2012, no shares
remained unissued and available for award under the Incentive Plan. Forfeitures of awards granted under the
incentive plan are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the Company s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest. Estimated
forfeiture rates represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option and are typically estimated based on historical experience. Based on an analysis of the Company s historical data, the Company applied a forfeiture rate of 0 to stock
options outstanding in determining stock compensation expense for each of the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, 9,880 restricted shares were issued under the Incentive Plan. Of these shares, 2,000 shares vested immediately and 7,880 shares vest over a five-year life. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company also granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of 40,000 shares. Of these stock options, 8,267 options vested immediately and 31,733 options vest over a five-year life. During fiscal 2011, 13,920
shares were issued under the Incentive Plan. Of these shares, 5,871 shares vested immediately and 8,049 shares vest over a five-year life. Stock-based compensation totaled 441 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2012 and 512 thousand for
the year ended March 31, 2011 for all options and restricted shares based on their respective vesting schedules.

Regarding the stock awards, 9,880 shares of restricted and unrestricted stock grants were
issued during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and the stock-based compensation expense associated with those shares totaled 35 thousand. In total, 100,000 shares have been issued under the Incentive Plan since fiscal
2007 with total outstanding vested shares of 84,071 at a weighted average grant price of 21.81 per share as of March 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2012, the total expected future compensation costs related to options and stock award vesting is 560 thousand; 311 thousand on stock options and 249 thousand on stock awards. The
projected annual expense is 123 thousand per year for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2016 and 68 thousand for fiscal 2017. 
 Earnings Per Share Regarding earnings per share, the Company adheres to guidance as set forth by ASC 360 , Earnings Per Share ASC 360 ). Basic earnings per share EPS is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock, such as stock options, were exercised or converted into common stock. Unallocated shares of common stock held by the Central Co-operative Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan Trust (the ESOP are not treated as being outstanding in
the computation of either basic or diluted EPS. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, there were approximately 133,000 and 154,000 unallocated ESOP shares, respectively, with fair values of 2.4 million and 2.9 million, respectively.

 The Bank follows ASC 325 Investments Other ASC 325 in accounting for this asset and covers two
executive officers. Increases in the cash value are recognized in other noninterest income and are not subject to income taxes while purchases increase the cash surrender value. Prior to the purchase of the policies, the Bank reviewed the financial
strength of the respective insurance carrier and continues to conduct such reviews on an annual basis. Bank-owned life insurance totaled 9.6 million at March 31, 2012 and 7.3 million at March 31, 2011. 
 Other Comprehensive Income The Company has established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes to equity except investments by, and distributions to, shareholders. Net income is

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In April 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860):
Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. The main provisions in this amendment remove from the assessment of effective control (1) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the
financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. Eliminating the transferor s ability criterion and
related implementation guidance from an entity s assessment of effective control should improve the accounting for repos and other similar transactions. The guidance in this update is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning
on or after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a
material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The amendments in this update are a result of the
work by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs ). The amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value
measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for these amendments to result in a change in the application of the requirements of Topic 820. The amendments are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):
Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The objective of this update is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The
amendments in this update require that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments are to be applied
retrospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles
 Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The objective of this update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in this update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350. The
more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. The amendments are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-09, C ompensation Retirement
Benefits Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic 715-80), Disclosures about an Employer s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan. The ASU requires new and expanded disclosures for individually material multi-employer pension plans. The changes
are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the amendments relate only to
disclosures in the financial statements. 
 70 

In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): De-recognition of In Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification. Under the amendments in this update, when a parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a
subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt, the reporting entity should apply the guidance in Subtopic 360-20 to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate.
The amendments are to be applied prospectively to deconsolidation events occurring after the effective date. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012. The Company
does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. Under the amendments in this
update, entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar
to a master netting arrangement. This scope includes derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements. An entity is required to apply the amendments
for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by the amendment retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The
Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of
Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. The objective of this update is to allow the FASB to reconsider whether it is necessary to require entities to present
reclassification adjustments by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements. All other requirements in Update 2011-05
are not affected by this Update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The amendments are effective during interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

During the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2012, one common stock holding was
determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and its book value was reduced through an impairment charge of 47 thousand. This impairment charge is reflected in Net gain from sales and write-downs of investment securities in the
Company s consolidated statements of operations. Temporarily impaired securities as of March 31,
2012 are presented in the following table and are aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position.

As of March 31, 2012, the Company has nine government agency mortgage-backed
securities which have been in a continuous loss position for a period greater than twelve months and five which have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months. These debt securities have a total fair value of 372 thousand and
unrealized losses of 11 thousand as of March 31, 2012. Management currently does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely that it will not have to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. Based on
management s analysis of these securities, it has been determined that none of the securities are other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2012. 
 The Company has one preferred stock security which has been in a continuous loss position for greater than twelve months
as of March 31, 2012. This security has a fair value of 991 thousand and an unrealized loss of 25 thousand at March 31, 2012. The preferred stock had a loss to book value ratio of 2.5 at March 31, 2012 compared to a loss to book
value ratio of 7.8 at March 31, 2011. Due to the long-term nature of preferred stocks, management considers these securities to be similar to debt securities for analysis purposes. Based on available information, management has determined that
the unrealized losses on the Company s investment in this preferred stock is not other-than-temporary as of March 31, 2012. The Company has eight equity securities with a fair value of 687 thousand and unrealized losses of 85 thousand which were temporarily impaired at March 31, 2012. The total unrealized losses
relating to these equity 
 72 

securities represent 11.0 of book value. This is an increase when compared to the ratio of unrealized losses to book value of 6.3 at March 31, 2011. Of these eight securities, none have
been in a continuous loss position for greater than twelve months. Data indicates that, due to current economic conditions, the time for many stocks to recover may be substantially lengthened. Management s investment approach is to be a
long-term investor. As of March 31, 2012, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses associated with these securities are not other-than-temporary based on the projected recovery of the unrealized losses, and management s intent
and ability hold until recovery of cost. The maturity distribution (based on contractual maturities) and
annual yields of debt securities at March 31, 2012 are as follows:

 Mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of 381 thousand and a fair value of
 426 thousand at March 31, 2012, were pledged to provide collateral for certain customers. Investment securities carried at 2.1 million were pledged under a blanket lien to partially secure the Bank s advances from the FHLB of Boston.
Additionally, investment securities carried at 2.4 million were pledged to maintain borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. As a member of the FHLB of Boston, the Company is required to invest in 100 par value stock of the FHLB of Boston. The FHLB of Boston capital structure mandates that members must own stock as determined
by their total stock investment requirement which is the sum of a member s membership stock investment 
 73 

requirement and activity-based stock investment requirement. The membership stock investment requirement is calculated as 0.35 of the member s stock investment base, subject to a minimum
investment of 10 thousand and a maximum investment of 25 million. The stock investment base is an amount calculated based on certain assets held by a member that are reflected on call reports submitted to applicable regulatory authorities. The
activity-based stock investment requirement is calculated as 4.5 of a member s outstanding principal balances of FHLB advances plus a percentage of advance commitments, 4.5 of standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB of Boston and 4.5 of
the value of intermediated derivative contracts. The Company views its investment in the FHLB of Boston stock
as a long-term investment. Accordingly, when evaluating for impairment, the value is determined based on the ultimate recovery of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline
affects the ultimate recovery is influenced by criteria such as: (1) the significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB of Boston as compared to the capital stock amount and length of time a decline has persisted; (2) impact of
legislative and regulatory changes on the FHLB of Boston and (3) the liquidity position of the FHLB of Boston. On August 8, 2011, Standard Poor s Ratings Services cut the credit ratings for many government-related entities to AA+ from AAA reflecting their dependence on the recently downgraded
U.S. Government. Included in those downgrades were ten of twelve Federal Home Loan Banks, including the FHLB of Boston. The other two Federal Home Loan Banks previously had been downgraded to AA+. 
 The Company does not believe that its investment in the FHLB of Boston is impaired as of March 31,
2012. However, this estimate could change in the near term in the event that: (1) additional significant impairment losses are incurred on the mortgage-backed securities causing a significant decline in the FHLB of Boston s regulatory
capital status; (2) the economic losses resulting from credit deterioration on the mortgage-backed securities increases significantly; or (3) capital preservation strategies being utilized by the FHLB of Boston become ineffective.
 The Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund (the Fund was established for liquidity purposes and
consists of deposits required of all insured co-operative banks in Massachusetts. The Fund is used by The Co-operative Central Bank to advance funds to member banks or to make other investments.

There were no loans which were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest as of March 31,
2012 and March 31, 2011. Credit Quality Indicators. Management regularly reviews the problem
loans in the Bank s portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with Bank policy and applicable regulations. The following tables sets forth the balance of loans classified as pass, special mention,
substandard or doubtful at March 31, 2012 and 2011 by loan class. Pass are those loans not classified as special mention or lower risk rating. Special mention loans are performing loans on which known information about the collateral pledged or
the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the non-performing loan
categories. A loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility
the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent as those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or
liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts and conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as loans without the
establishment of specific loss allowance is not warranted. Loans classified as substandard, doubtful or loss are individually evaluated for impairment. The following tables display the loan portfolio by credit quality indicators as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 (in thousands):

At March 31, 2012, advances totaling 87 million are callable during fiscal 2013
prior to their scheduled maturity. The Bank is subject to a substantial penalty in the event it elects to prepay any of its FHLB of Boston advances. The FHLB of Boston is authorized to make advances to its members subject to such regulations and limitations as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may prescribe. The advances are secured by FHLB of Boston
stock and a blanket lien on certain qualified collateral, defined principally as 90 of the fair value of U.S. Government and federal agency obligations and 75 of the carrying value of first mortgage loans on owner-occupied residential property. In
addition, certain multi-family property loans are pledged to secure FHLB of Boston advances. The Bank s unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Boston was approximately 84 million at March 31, 2012.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets due to
uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets. The valuation allowance is related to certain capital loss carryforwards that are only allowed to be utilized against capital gains. Due to the uncertainty surrounding future capital gains,
management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. The unrecaptured base
year tax bad debt reserves will not be subject to recapture as long as the Company continues to carry on the business of banking. In addition, the balance of the pre-1988 bad debt reserves continues to be subject to provisions of present law that
require recapture in the case of certain excess distributions to shareholders. The tax effect of pre-1988 bad debt reserves subject to recapture in the case of certain excess distributions is approximately 1.3 million. 
 82 

As of March 31, 2012, the Company provided a liability of 11 thousand
of unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal and state income tax matters as compared to 155 thousand as of March 31, 2011. During the year ending March 31, 2012, the Company reversed 144 thousand of the prior year
unrecognized tax benefits and the amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would impact the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized, is 11 thousand. In general, the tax years ended March 31, 2009 through March 31, 2012 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. 
 Note 9. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk (In Thousands) 
 The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of
business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include unused lines of credit, unadvanced portions of commercial and construction loans, and commitments to originate loans. The instruments involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheets. The amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the Bank s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.
 The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to its financial
instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 included the following: 

At March 31, 

2012 

2011 

Unused lines and letters of credit 

14,566 

15,940 

Unadvanced portions of commercial and construction loans 

533 

459 

Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans 

24,942 

11,232 

Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans 

595 

Total off-balance sheet commitments 

40,041 

28,226 

Commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of
commercial and construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
 The Bank is also a party to lease commitments related to premises used to conduct its business. A summary of minimum
rentals of banking premises for future periods under non-cancelable operating leases follows:

Certain leases contain renewal options, the potential impact of which is not
included above. Rental expense for each of the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 totaled 372 thousand and 365 thousand, respectively, and is included in occupancy and equipment expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. 
 Note 10. Stockholders Equity (Dollars in Thousands) 
 The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material
effect on the Company s and the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve
quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the
regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. The minimum core (leverage) capital ratio required for banks with the highest overall rating from bank
regulatory agencies is 3.00 and is 4.00 for all others. The Bank must also have a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00 (of which 4.00 must be Tier I capital, consisting of common stockholders equity). As of March 31, 2012,
the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. As of March 31, 2012, the most recent
notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based,
Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category.

Note 11. Employee Benefits (Dollars in Thousands) 
 Pension and Savings Plans As a participating employer in the Cooperative Banks Employees Retirement Association CBERA ), a multi-employer plan, the Bank has in effect a non-contributory defined benefit plan Pension Plan and a defined contribution plan Savings Plan covering substantially all eligible employees. Benefits under the Pension Plan are determined at the rate of 1 and 1.5 of certain elements of final average pay times years of credited service and are generally provided at age 65 based on years of
service and the average of the participants three highest consecutive years of compensation from the Bank. Employee contributions are made to a Savings Plan which qualifies under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Bank matches 50 of an eligible deferral contribution on the first 5 of the deferral amount subject to the maximum allowable under federal regulations. Pension benefits and employer contributions to the Savings Plan become vested over six
years. The Pension Plan is sponsored by the Cooperative Banks Employees Retirement Association under the name
CBERA Plan C with a plan Employer Identification Number of 04-6035593 and a plan number of 334. The actuarial valuation was completed as of January 1, 2011 for the plan year ending December 31, 2011 with a 94.7 funded target attainment
percentage. The Bank s plan year contributions totaled 390 thousand and did not exceed 5 of the total contributions received by the 45 participating employers in the plan. The Bank was not subject to any specific minimum contributions other
than amounts, determined by the Trustees of the Plan, that maintain the funded status of the Plan in accordance with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA) and ERISA. 
 Expenses for the Pension Plan and the Savings Plan were 535 thousand and 527 thousand, for the years ended
March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Forfeitures are used to reduce expenses of the plans. Employee Stock Ownership Plan
 The Bank established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP in November 1989 that is
authorized to purchase shares of outstanding common stock of the Company from time to time in the open market or in negotiated transactions. The ESOP is a tax-qualified retirement plan for the exclusive benefit of the Bank s employees. All
full-time employees who have completed one year of service with the Bank are eligible to participate in the ESOP and vest at a rate of 20 annually commencing in the year of eligibility or immediately if service is terminated due to death,
disability, retirement or change in control. The ESOP purchased Company common shares using the proceeds of
borrowings in 2004 and 2007 and holds the stock in a trust established under the Plan. The loans from the Company to the ESOP are collateralized by the unallocated shares of common stock. The outstanding balance of the three loans at March 31,
2012 and 2011 was 5.087 million and 5.676 million, respectively, and are eliminated in consolidation. As
set forth by ASC 718, compensation expense is recognized as the shares are allocated to participants based upon the fair value of the shares at the time they are allocated. As a result, changes in the market value of the Company s stock have an
effect on the Company s results of operations but have no effect on stockholders equity. ESOP compensation expense for fiscal 2012 and 2011 amounted to 373 thousand and 260 thousand, respectively, based on the release to eligible
employees of 21,506 shares in fiscal 2012 and 21,436 shares in fiscal 2011. Company common stock dividends
received by the ESOP on allocated shares that are not associated with financing are allocated to plan participants. Company common stock dividends received by the ESOP for allocated shares that are associated with financing provided by the Company
are returned to the Bank for the purpose of reducing expenses.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans 
 The Bank maintains supplemental retirement plans SERP for two highly compensated employees designed to
offset the impact of regulatory limits on benefits under qualified pension plans. The Bank s obligation is unfunded. The Bank recognizes retirement expense based upon an annual analysis performed by a benefits administrator. Annual SERP expense
can vary based upon changes in factors such as changes in salaries or estimated retirement ages. SERP expense totaled 249 thousand for fiscal 2012 and 227 thousand for fiscal 2011. The SERP liability balance totaled 904 thousand at March 31,
2012 and 655 thousand at March 31, 2011. Employment Agreements 
 The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers. The employment agreements are
generally for initial terms of five years, with automatic extensions made annually thereafter. The agreements include stipulations for termination, including termination made with and without just cause, and provide for base salaries,
discretionary bonuses, and severance benefits. The agreements also provide for insurance and various other benefits. The employment agreements also include Change of Control provisions, providing that in the event of a Change in Control,
as defined, compensation be paid to the officer in amounts up to approximately three times the officer s base salary in the form of one lump sum payment following a Change of Control event. 
 Severance Agreement The Bank has entered into a severance agreement (the Severance Agreement with an executive officer. The Severance Agreement provides for a term of three years, with an automatic extension
annually thereafter. The Severance Agreement provides that, in the event the Bank terminates the executive s employment in connection with or within one year after any change in control, as such term is defined in the Severance Agreement, or
the executive voluntarily terminates employment within that same time period following the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a constructive termination, the Bank will pay the executive a lump sum severance benefit equal to two times
his annual base salary at the rate in effect just prior to the change in control. 
 Note 12. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company from time to time is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions incident
to its business. None of these actions are believed to be material, either individually or collectively, to the results of operations and financial condition of the Company or any subsidiary. 
 Note 13. Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program 
 On August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a letter agreement (the
 Repurchase Letter with the United States Department of the Treasury Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company redeemed, out of the proceeds of its issuance of 10,000 shares of its Series B Senior Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock, all 10,000 outstanding shares of its Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, liquidation amount 1,000 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), for a redemption price of 10,013,889,
including accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. On December 5, 2008, the Company sold 10.0 million in Series A Preferred Stock to the Treasury as a participant in the federal government s Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP Capital Purchase Program. This represented approximately 2.6 of the Company s risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2008. In connection with the investment, the Company had entered into a Letter Agreement and the
related Securities Purchase Agreement with the Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued the 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant (the Warrant to purchase 234,742 shares of the Company s common stock for an
aggregate purchase price of 10.0 million in cash. The Company subsequently repurchased the Warrant from the
Treasury on October 19, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of 2.5 million. 
 88 

Note 14. U.S. Treasury Department Small Business Lending Fund 
 On August 25, 2011, the Company entered into and consummated a Securities Purchase Agreement (the
 Purchase Agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued 10,000 shares of the Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the
 Series B Preferred Stock ), having a liquidation amount per share equal to 1,000, for a total purchase price of 10,000,000. The Purchase Agreement was entered into, and the Series B Preferred Stock was issued, pursuant to
the Small Business Lending Fund SBLF program, a fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than 10
billion. The Company used the 10 million in SBLF funds to redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock issued under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning October 1,
2011. The dividend rate, as a percentage of the liquidation amount, can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first ten quarters during which the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding, based upon changes in the level of
 Qualified Small Business Lending or QSBL (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) by the Company s wholly owned subsidiary Central Co-operative Bank. Based upon the increase in the Bank s level of QSBL over the
baseline level calculated under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the dividend rate for the initial dividend period has been set at five percent (5 ). For the second through ninth calendar quarters, the dividend rate may be adjusted to
between one percent (1 and five percent (5 per annum, to reflect the amount of change in the Bank s level of QSBL. If the level of the Bank s qualified small business loans declines so that the percentage increase in QSBL as
compared to the baseline level is less than 10 , then the dividend rate payable on the Series B Preferred Stock would increase. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance, the dividend rate will be fixed
at between one percent (1 and seven percent (7 based upon the increase in QSBL as compared to the baseline. After four and one half years from issuance, the dividend rate will increase to 9 (including a quarterly lending
incentive fee of 0.5 ). In addition, beginning on January 1, 2014, and on all Series B Preferred Stock dividend payment dates thereafter ending on April 1, 2016, the Company will be required to pay to the Secretary, on each share of Series
B Preferred Stock, but only out of assets legally available therefore, a fee equal to 0.5 of the liquidation amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting, except in limited circumstances. In the event that the Company misses five dividend payments, whether or not consecutive, the holder of the
Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, but not the obligation, to appoint a representative as an observer on the Company s Board of Directors. In the event that the Company misses six dividend payments, whether or not
consecutive, and if the then outstanding aggregate liquidation amount of the Series B Preferred Stock is at least 25,000,000, then the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to designate two directors to the Board of
Directors of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time at the Company s
option, at a redemption price of 100 of the liquidation amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption for the current period, subject to the approval of its federal banking regulator. 
 Note 15. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (In Thousands) 
 The Company follows ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ), which
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. In addition, ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have the following fair value hierarchy: 

Level 1 - 
 
 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
 89 

Level 2 - 
 
 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active or non-active markets and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable in active
markets 

Level 3 - 
 
 Valuation derived from significant unobservable inputs 
 The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain assets at fair value on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower-of-cost-or market value accounting or
write-downs of individual assets. The only assets of the Company recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 were securities available for sale. The assets of the Company recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 were impaired loans and other real estate
owned OREO ). The following table presents the level of valuation assumptions used to determine the fair values of such securities and loans:

 The Company s impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying
collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based upon appraisals of similar properties obtained from a third party. For Level 3 inputs, fair value is based upon
management s estimates of the value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows. At March 31, 2012, impaired loans measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs amounted to 5.1 million, which represents nine
customer relationships, compared to ten customer relationships which totaled 5.0 million March 31, 2011. 
 90 

OREO is measured at fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is
based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, or management s estimation of value of the collateral. At March 31, 2012, OREO was comprised of one residential condominium totaling 133 thousand. OREO at
March 31, 2011 consisted of one residential condominium which totaled 132 thousand. Both observable and
unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions classified as Level 3 assets. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for these assets presented in the table above may include changes in fair value that were
attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following methods and assumptions were used by
the Bank in estimating fair values of financial assets and liabilities: Cash and Due from Banks 
The carrying values reported in the balance sheet for cash and due from banks approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Short-Term Investments The carrying values reported in the balance sheet for short-term investments approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these investments. 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities
are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include publicly traded common and preferred stocks. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (i.e., matrix
pricing) and market interest rates and credit assumptions or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency and government
sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, as well as certain preferred and trust preferred stocks. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to
measure similar assets during the period. Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no Level 3 securities at March 31, 2012 or at March 31, 2011. The Company did not have any sales or
purchases of Level 3 available for sale securities during the periods. Loans The fair values of
loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates, estimated using local market data, of which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. The incremental credit risk for nonperforming
loans has been considered in the determination of the fair value of loans. Regular reviews of the loan portfolio are performed to identify impaired loans for which specific allowance allocations are considered prudent. Valuations of impaired loans
are made based on evaluations that we believe to be appropriate in accordance with ASC 310, and such valuations are determined by reviewing current collateral values, financial information, cash flows, payment histories and trends and other relevant
facts surrounding the particular credits. Accrued Interest Receivable The carrying amount
reported in the balance sheet for accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value due to the short maturity of these accounts. Stock in FHLB of Boston The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for FHLB of Boston stock approximates its fair value based on the redemption features of the stock. 
 The Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for the
Co-operative Central Bank Reserve Fund approximates its fair value. Deposits The fair values of
deposits (excluding term deposit certificates) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for term deposit certificates are estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest
rates estimated using local market data currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated monthly maturities on time deposits with similar remaining maturities. 
 91 

Advances from FHLB of Boston Fair values of non-callable
advances from the FHLB of Boston are estimated based on the discounted cash flows of scheduled future payments using the respective quarter-end published rates for advances with similar terms and remaining maturities. Fair values of callable
advances from the FHLB of Boston are estimated using indicative pricing provided by the FHLB of Boston. 
 Subordinated Debentures The fair value of one subordinated debenture totaling 5.3 million whose interest
rate is adjustable quarterly is estimated to be equal to its book value. The other subordinated debenture totaling 6.1 million has a fixed rate until March 15, 2017, at which time it will convert to an adjustable rate which will adjust
quarterly. The maturity date is March 15, 2037. The fair value of this subordinated debenture is estimated based on the discounted cash flows of scheduled future payments utilizing a discount rate derived from instruments with similar terms and
remaining maturities. Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance and Accrued Interest Payable
 The carrying values reported in the balance sheet for advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance and accrued interest payable approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of these accounts. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Instruments The Bank s commitments to lend for unused lines of credit and unadvanced
portions of loans have short remaining disbursement periods or variable interest rates, and, therefore, no fair value adjustment has been made. The estimated carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:

Note 17. Subsequent Events 
 On April 30, 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
 Merger Agreement with Independent Bank Corp. Independent ), the parent company of Rockland Trust Company Rockland ), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Independent. As part of the transaction,
the Bank will also merge with and into Rockland. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Company common stock, other than shares held by Independent, will convert into the right to receive either (i) 32.00 in cash or
(ii) such number of shares of Independent common stock as determined by the exchange ratio provided for in the Merger Agreement, all as more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The
Merger Agreement provides that 40 of the aggregate merger consideration must consist of cash and 60 of the aggregate merger consideration must consist of shares of Independent common stock. Following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors of Independent and Rockland will each consist of its respective directors immediately prior to the merger and John J. Morrissey, a current director of the Company and the Bank. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and approval of the merger by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of the Company. If the merger is not consummated
under certain circumstances, the Company has agreed to reimburse Independent up to 750,000 for its reasonably documented fees and expenses and to pay Independent a termination fee of 2.2 million; provided however, that any amounts paid in
reimbursement will be credited against the termination fee payable. Currently, the merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Central Bancorp, Inc. Somerville, Massachusetts 
 We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Central Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of March 31, 2012 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Central Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of March 31, 2011 were audited by other auditors whose report
dated June 17, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the 2012 consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Central Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of
March 31, 2012 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

agreements (the Employment Agreements with John D. Doherty, Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, and William P. Morrissey, President of the Bank. The Employment Agreements each provide for a five-year term, with an automatic extension
for one additional year on each anniversary, unless either party provides the other party with written notice of his or its intent not to renew to the term of the Employment Agreement. The Employment Agreements currently expire on December 20,
2016. Under the Employment Agreements, Mr. Doherty and Mr. Morrissey are entitled to an annual base salary of 425,000 and 350,000, respectively. Each Employment Agreement requires the Board of Directors of the Bank to review the
executive s salary annually. The Employment Agreements also provide for the executives participation in discretionary bonuses, as authorized and declared by the Board, as well as participation in retirement and medical plans of the Bank
and certain fringe benefits. In the event that the Bank terminates the employment of either Mr. Doherty or Mr. Morrissey without just cause, as such term is defined in the Employment Agreements, the Bank will continue to pay
the executive s salary for the remaining term of the Employment Agreement. If the Bank terminates either Messrs. Doherty or Morrissey for just cause, the Bank shall be obligated to pay only the salary earned through the
executive s date of termination. Under the Employment Agreements, if the Bank terminates the employment of Mr. Doherty or Mr. Morrissey, in connection with or within three years after any change in control, as such term is defined in
the Employment Agreements, or if either Mr. Doherty or Mr. Morrissey voluntarily terminates employment within that same time period following the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a constructive termination, the Bank will
pay the executive a lump sum severance benefit equal to 2.99 times his base amount as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Each Employment Agreement also provides that if the executive receives any benefits
from the Bank in connection with a change in control that are subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Bank will pay the executive an additional gross-up payment to ensure that the executive
remains in the same financial position had the excise tax not been imposed. Executive Salary Continuation Agreements 
 The Bank has entered into Executive Salary Continuation Agreements (the Salary Continuation Agreements with
Messrs. Doherty and Morrissey. Under the Salary Continuation Agreements, upon his retirement date (the later of age 65 for Mr. Doherty and age 85 for Mr. Morrissey, or the executive s separation
 
 104

from service), each executive is entitled to an annual benefit payable in monthly installments until death equal to 60 for Mr. Doherty and 40 for Mr. Morrissey, of the average high
three years of his base salary, offset by: (i) the amount available to the executive under the Bank s pension plan; (ii) the Bank s annuitized 401(k) plan contribution to the executive; and (iii) 50 of the executive s
age 65 social security benefit for Mr. Doherty and a 9,480 social security benefit for Mr. Morrissey. The Salary Continuation Agreements each provide for a three percent annual cost of living increase with respect to the benefit payable
under the Salary Continuation Agreements. Under each Salary Continuation Agreement, in the event of the executive s death, his beneficiary is entitled to a pre-retirement death benefit of an amount equal to the executive s Accrued
Liability Retirement Account, as defined under each Salary Continuation Agreement and intended to reflect the amount of benefit liability required to be accrued by the Bank from time to time, and in the event the executive dies after his separation
from service but before 180 monthly installments have been paid, the Bank will continue payments to the executive s beneficiary of the installments until 180 installments have been paid. If the executive terminates his employment prior to the
retirement date voluntarily or is discharged without cause, the executive is entitled to a benefit equal to the balance of his Accrued Liability Retirement Account on the date of termination, which shall be paid in one lump sum with 60 days of his
separation from service. If the Bank terminates the executive s employment for cause, the Salary Continuation Agreement will terminate with no further benefit obligation. In the event of a change in control, the executive is
entitled to 100 of the Accrued Liability Retirement Account, which shall be paid in one lump sum within 60 days of the date of the change in control. Severance Agreement The Bank has entered into a severance
agreement (the Severance Agreement with Paul S. Feeley, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company and the Bank. The Severance Agreement provides for a term of three years, with an automatic extension
for one additional year on each anniversary, unless either the Bank or Mr. Feeley gives written notice to the other of his or its intention not to renew the term of the Severance Agreement. The Severance Agreement provides that, in the event
the Bank terminates the employment of Mr. Feeley in connection with or within one year after any change in control, as such term is defined in the Severance Agreement, or Mr. Feeley voluntarily terminates employment within that same time
period following the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a constructive termination, the Bank will pay Mr. Feeley a lump sum severance benefit equal to two times his annual base salary at the rate in effect just prior to the
change in control provided, however, the payment may not exceed the difference between (i) 2.99 times Mr. Feeley s base amount, as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (ii) the sum of
any other parachute payments, as defined under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, that he receives on account of the change in control. Senior Management Incentive Compensation Plan The Bank has
established a short-term cash-based incentive program designed to reward senior management with a bonus based on the attainment of certain performance targets, specifically with respect to the Bank s return on average assets ROAA ).
For fiscal 2012, potential incentive distributions under the plan ranged from 0 of base salary to 24 of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and the President and 0 of base salary to 18 of base salary for Senior Vice Presidents. Pursuant
to the plan, and subject to the Board of Directors discretion, the Chief Executive Officer and the President were each eligible to receive an award equal to 4 of salary if the Bank achieved an ROAA level of 0.40 for fiscal 2012, with the
award increasing 5.0 for each 0.05 increase in ROAA above the 0.40 threshold, subject to a maximum bonus of 24 of base salary. Senior Vice Presidents were eligible to receive an award equal to 4 of salary if the Bank achieved an ROAA level of
0.40 for fiscal 2012, with the award increasing 2.5 for each 0.05 increase in ROAA above the 0.40 threshold, subject to a maximum bonus of 18 of base salary. The Compensation Committee sets incentive awards. Awards are subject to the discretion
of the Board of Directors. Because the Bank s ROAA fell below the target levels set by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2012, the Board of Directors determined not to award bonuses under this program in fiscal 2012. 
 105

Executive Health Insurance Plan Agreements 
 The Bank has also entered into Executive Health Insurance Plan Agreements (the Health Insurance Plan
Agreements with Messrs. Doherty and Morrissey. Under the terms of each Health Insurance Plan Agreement, the Bank will make an annual contribution of 10,000 for Mr. Doherty and 25,000 for Mr. Morrissey into each executive s
Liability Reserve Account, as defined under each Health Insurance Plan Agreement. Following termination of employment, the Bank will use the account to make premium payments for post-retirement health care insurance for the executive and his spouse
until the Liability Reserve Account for each executive reaches a balance of zero dollars. Under the Health Insurance Plan Agreements, an executive forfeits his benefits if he is discharged for cause as specified in his Health Insurance Plan
Agreement. Life Insurance Endorsement Method Split Dollar Plan Agreement 
 The Bank maintains a Life Insurance Endorsement Method Split Dollar Plan Agreement (the Split Dollar Plan
Agreement with Mr. Morrissey. Under the terms of the Split Dollar Plan Agreement, the Bank is the owner of the life insurance policy under which Mr. Morrissey and his spouse, Donna C. Morrissey, are insureds. The Bank pays an amount
equal to the planned premiums and any other premium payments that may be necessary to keep the policy in force. Upon the death of the second insured to die, the insured s designated beneficiary is entitled to one million dollars and the Bank is

 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
 Transactions with Related Parties The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for
loans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations. Federal regulations require that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors of insured financial institutions must
be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable
features. The Bank is therefore prohibited from making any new loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors at different rates or terms than those offered to the general public. Notwithstanding this rule, federal regulations
permit the Bank to make loans to executive officers and directors at reduced interest rates if the loan is made under a benefit program generally available to all other employees and does not give preference to any executive officer or director over
any other employee, although the Bank does not currently have such a program in place. In addition,
Massachusetts law provides that co-operative banks are limited in the amount of money that they may lend to their officers. These limits are 500,000 for a mortgage on a primary residence, 150,000 for loans for educational purposes and 35,000 for
all other types of loans in total. These restrictions do not apply to non-officer employees of a co-operative bank or to a co-operative bank s outside directors. 
 The Company also maintains a comprehensive written policy for the review, approval and ratification of certain
transactions with related persons. In accordance with banking regulations and its policy, the Board of Directors reviews all loans made to a director, executive officer or principal shareholder or to any related interest of any such person in an
amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other loans to such person and his or her related interests, exceed the greater of 25,000 or 5 of the Company s capital and surplus (up to a maximum of 500,000) and such loans must be
approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Company s Audit Committee also reviews all related party transactions i.e. , transactions required to be disclosed under SEC
Regulation S-K, Item 404) for potential conflicts of interest situations on an ongoing basis and determines whether to approve such transactions. Pursuant 
 111

to the Company s Code of Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees, all executive officers and directors of the Company must disclose any existing or potential conflicts of interest. Such
potential conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) personally benefiting from opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company property, contacts, information or position; and (ii) accepting
employment or engaging in a business (including consulting or similar arrangements) that may conflict with the performance of the director s or executive officer s duties or the Company s interests. 
 Director Independence The Company s Board of Directors is currently composed of eight members, all of whom are independent under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market, except John D. Doherty, William P.
Morrissey and John J. Morrissey. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services
