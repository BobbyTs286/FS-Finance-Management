 General

 The Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-A (the "II-A
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-B (the "II-B
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-C (the "II-C
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-D (the "II-D
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-E (the "II-E
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-F (the "II-F
Partnership"), Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-G (the "II-G
Partnership"), and Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-H (the "II-H
Partnership") (collectively, the "Partnerships") are limited partnerships formed
under the Oklahoma Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Each Partnership is
composed of Geodyne Resources, Inc. ("Geodyne"), a Delaware corporation, as the
general partner, Geodyne Depositary Company, a Delaware corporation, as the sole
initial limited partner, and public investors as substitute limited partners
(the "Limited Partners"). The Partnerships commenced operations on the dates set
forth below.

 Date of
 Partnership Activation
 ----------- -----------------

 II-A July 22, 1987
 II-B October 14, 1987
 II-C January 14, 1988
 II-D May 10, 1988
 II-E September 27, 1988
 II-F January 5, 1989
 II-G April 10, 1989
 II-H May 17, 1989

 Immediately following activation, each Partnership invested as a general
partner in a separate Oklahoma general partnership which actually conducts the
Partnerships' operations. Geodyne serves as managing partner of such general
partnerships. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to any
single Partnership or all of the Partnerships in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
(the "Annual Report") are references to the Partnership and its related general
partnership, collectively. In addition, unless the context indicates otherwise,
all references to the "General Partner" in this Annual Report are references to
Geodyne as the general partner of the limited partnerships and as the managing
partner of the related general partnerships.

 The General Partner currently serves as general partner of 26 limited
partnerships including the Partnerships, and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Samson Investment Company. Samson

-4-

Investment Company and its various corporate subsidiaries, including the General
Partner (collectively "Samson"), are primarily engaged in the production and
development of and exploration for oil and gas reserves and the acquisition and
operation of producing properties. At December 31, 2005, Samson owned interests
in approximately 18,000 oil and gas wells located in 18 states of the United
States and the countries of Canada and Venezuela. At December 31, 2005, Samson
operated approximately 5,700 oil and gas wells located in 14 states of the
United States, as well as Canada and Venezuela.

 The Partnerships are currently engaged in the business of owning interests
in producing oil and gas properties located in the continental United States.
The Partnerships may also engage to a limited extent in development drilling on
producing oil and gas properties as required for the prudent management of the
Partnerships.

 As limited partnerships, the Partnerships have no officers, directors, or
employees. They rely instead on the personnel of the General Partner and Samson.
As of February 15, 2006, Samson employed approximately 1,300 persons. No
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management
believes that Samson provides a sound employee relations environment. For
information regarding the executive officers of the General Partner, see "Item
10. Directors and Executive Officers of the General Partner."

 The General Partner's and the Partnerships' principal place of business is
located at Samson Plaza, Two West Second Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103, and
their telephone number is (918) 583-1791, or (888) 436-3963 [(888) GEODYNE].

 Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements for the Partnerships
(the "Partnership Agreements") the Partnerships would have terminated on
December 31, 2001. However, the Partnership Agreements provide that the General
Partner may extend the term of each Partnership for up to five periods of two
years each. The General Partner has extended the terms of the Partnerships for
their third two-year extension thereby extending their termination date to
December 31, 2007. As of the date of this Annual Report, the General Partner has
not determined whether to further extend the term of any Partnership.

Funding

 Although the Partnership Agreements permit the Partnerships to incur
borrowings, the Partnerships' operations and expenses are currently funded out
of each Partnership's revenues from oil and gas sales. The General Partner may,
but is not required to, advance funds to a Partnership for the same purposes for
which Partnership borrowings are authorized.

-5-

Principal Products Produced and Services Rendered

 The Partnerships' sole business is the production of, and related
incidental development of, oil and gas. The Partnerships do not refine or
otherwise process crude oil and condensate. The Partnerships do not hold any
patents, trademarks, licenses, or concessions and are not a party to any
government contracts. The Partnerships have no backlog of orders and do not
participate in research and development activities. The Partnerships are not
presently encountering shortages of oilfield tubular goods, compressors,
production material, or other equipment. However, substantial increases in the
global price of steel as well as increases in the prices for oil and gas
supplies and services will further increase the costs of any future workover,
recompletion or drilling activities conducted by the Partnerships.

Competition and Marketing

 The primary source of liquidity and Partnership cash distributions comes
from the net revenues generated from the sale of oil and gas produced from the
Partnerships' oil and gas properties. The level of net revenues is highly
dependent upon the total volumes of oil and natural gas sold. Oil and gas
reserves are depleting assets and will experience production declines over time,
thereby likely resulting in reduced net revenues. The level of net revenues is
also highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and gas sales, which
prices have historically been very volatile and may continue to be so.
Additionally, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and
gas that is economic to produce and reduce the Partnerships' revenues and cash
flow. Various factors beyond the Partnerships' control will affect prices for
oil and natural gas, such as:

 Worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;
 The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries ("OPEC") to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production
 quotas;
 Political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions or
 around major shipping areas;
 The level of consumer demand and overall economic activity;
 The competitiveness of alternative fuels;
 Weather conditions and the impact of weather-related events;
 The availability of pipelines for transportation;
 Domestic and foreign government regulations and taxes; and
 Market expectations.

-6-

It is not possible to predict the future direction of oil or natural
gas prices or whether the above discussed trends will remain. Operating costs,
including General and Administrative Expenses, may not decline over time, may
increase, or may experience only a gradual decline, thus adversely affecting net
revenues as either production or oil and natural gas prices decline. In any
particular period, net revenues may also be affected by either the receipt of
proceeds from property sales or the incursion of additional costs as a result of
well workovers, recompletions, new well drilling, and other events.

Significant Customers

 The following customers accounted for ten percent or more of the
Partnerships' oil and gas sales during the year ended December 31, 2005:

 In the event of interruption of purchases by one or more of the
Partnerships' significant customers or the cessation or material change in
availability of open access transportation by the Partnerships' pipeline
transporters, the Partnerships may encounter difficulty in marketing their gas
and in maintaining historic sales levels. Management does not expect any of its
open access transporters to seek authorization to terminate their transportation
services. Even if the services were terminated, management believes that
alternatives would be available whereby the Partnerships would be able to
continue to market their gas.

-7-

The Partnerships' principal customers for crude oil production are
refiners and other companies which have pipeline facilities near the producing
properties of the Partnerships. In the event pipeline facilities are not
conveniently available to production areas, crude oil is usually trucked by
purchasers to storage facilities.

Oil, Gas, and Environmental Control Regulations

 Regulation of Production Operations -- The production of oil and gas is
subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations governing a wide
variety of matters, including the drilling and spacing of wells, allowable rates
of production, prevention of waste and pollution, and protection of the
environment. In addition to the direct costs borne in complying with such
regulations, operations and revenues may be impacted to the extent that certain
regulations limit oil and gas production to below economic levels.

 Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Oil and Gas -- Sales of crude
oil and condensate are made by the Partnerships at market prices and are not
subject to price controls. The sale of gas may be subject to both federal and
state laws and regulations. The provisions of these laws and regulations are
complex and affect all who produce, resell, transport, or purchase gas,
including the Partnerships. Although virtually all of the Partnerships' gas
production is not subject to price regulation, other regulations affect the
availability of gas transportation services and the ability of gas consumers to
continue to purchase or use gas at current levels. Accordingly, such regulations
may have a material effect on the Partnerships' operations and projections of
future oil and gas production and revenues.

 Future Legislation -- Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is
under constant review for amendment or expansion. Because such laws and
regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, management is unable to
predict what additional energy legislation may be proposed or enacted or the
future cost and impact of complying with existing or future regulations.

 Regulation of the Environment -- The Partnerships' operations are subject
to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Compliance with
such laws and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from
noncompliance, may increase the cost of the Partnerships' operations or may
affect the Partnerships' ability to timely complete existing or future
activities. Management anticipates that various local, state, and federal
environmental control agencies will have an increasing impact on oil and gas
operations.

-8-

Insurance Coverage

 The Partnerships are subject to all of the risks inherent in the
exploration for and production of oil and gas including blowouts, pollution,
fires, and other casualties. The Partnerships maintain insurance coverage as is
customary for entities of a similar size engaged in operations similar to that
of the Partnerships, but losses can occur from uninsurable risks or in amounts
in excess of existing insurance coverage. For example, many types of pollution
and contamination can exist, undiscovered, for long periods of time and can
result in substantial environmental liabilities which are not insured. The
occurrence of an event which is not fully covered by insurance could have a
material adverse effect on the Partnerships' financial condition and results of
operations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this
report and presented elsewhere from time to time. Such factors, among others,
may have a material adverse effect upon the Partnerships' business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

 The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction
with the combined financial statements and related notes included herein.
Because of these and other factors, past financial performance should not be
considered an indication of future performance.

Oil and Natural Gas Prices Fluctuate Due to a Number of
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Uncontrollable Factors, and Any Decline Will Adversely
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Affect the Partnerships' Financial Condition.
 ---------------------------------------------

 The Partnerships' results of operations depend upon the prices they
receive for their oil and natural gas. We sell most of the Partnerships' oil and
natural gas liquids at current market prices rather than through fixed-price
contracts. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile
and are likely to remain so. The prices we receive depend upon factors beyond
our control, including:

 political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;
 weather conditions;
 the supply of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas;

-9-

the ability of members of OPEC to agree upon and maintain prices and
 production levels;
 the level of consumer demand and overall economic activity;
 worldwide economic demand;
 the price and availability of alternative fuels;
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;
 the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities; and
 the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.

 Government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation
and price controls, can affect product prices in the long term. These external
factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to
reliably estimate future prices of oil and natural gas.

 Any decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely affects the
Partnerships' financial condition. If the oil and gas industry experiences
significant price declines, the Partnerships may not be able to maintain their
current level of cash distributions. See "Item 1 - Business - Competition and
Marketing" and "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations".

Reserve Estimates Depend on Many Assumptions That May Turn
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Out to be Inaccurate. Any Material Inaccuracies in the
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Partnerships' Reserve Estimates or Underlying Assumptions
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Could Cause the Quantities and Net Present Value of Their
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Reserves to be Overstated.
 --------------------------

 Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex
process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various
assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant
inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of condition
could cause the quantities and net present value of the Partnerships' reserves
to be overstated.

 To prepare estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas
reserves and future net cash flows, we analyze many variable factors, such as
historical production from the area compared with production rates from other
producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production
and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can
vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity
prices, production costs, severance and

-10-

excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs. Actual
results most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could
reduce the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this
annual report.

 You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from
the Partnerships' proved reserves shown in this Annual Report is the current
market value of their estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, the Partnerships base the
estimated discounted future net cash flows from their proved reserves on prices
and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future prices and
costs may differ materially from those used in the earlier net present value
estimate, and as a result, net present value estimates using current prices and
costs may be significantly less than the earlier estimate which is provided in
this annual report. See "Item 2 - Properties-Proved Reserves and Net Present
Value".

 Drilling Oil and Natural Gas Wells is a High-Risk Activity
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 and Subjects Us to a Variety of Factors That We Cannot
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Control.
 --------

 Drilling oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves
numerous risks, including the risk that the Partnerships may not encounter
commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs. While the Partnerships
do not expend a significant portion of their capital on drilling activities, to
the extent they do drill wells this can be a significant risk factor to them.
They may not recover all or any portion of their investment in new wells. The
presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations,
miscalculations or accidents may cause their drilling activities to be
unsuccessful and result in a total loss of investment. Further, drilling
operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
factors, including:

 unexpected drilling conditions;
 title problems;
 restricted access to land for drilling or laying pipeline;
 pressure or irregularities in formations;
 equipment failure or accidents;
 adverse weather conditions; and
 costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling
 rigs, tubular materials and equipment.

-11-

The Marketability of the Partnerships' Production is
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Dependent upon Transportation and Processing Facilities Over
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Which We Have No Control.
 -------------------------

 The marketability of the Partnerships' production depends in part upon the
availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems
and processing facilities. Any significant change in market factors affecting
these infrastructure facilities could harm their business. The Partnerships
deliver oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that they do
not own. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market
conditions or mechanical reasons, or may not be available to us in the future.

Reliance on Third Party Operators
 ---------------------------------

 A substantial portion of the Partnerships' properties are operated by
third parties. The Partnerships have little, if any, control over the
operational decisions and costs associated with these properties. In addition,
the Partnerships are totally reliant on the third party operators' internal
controls associated with the operators' accounting for revenues and expenses.

No Market for Units
 -------------------

 The Partnerships' Units are not listed on any exchange or national market
system, and there is no established public trading market for the Units. You may
only sell your Units via (i) the General Partner's annual Repurchase Offer; (ii)
transfers facilitated by secondary trading firms and matching services; and
(iii) occasional "4.9 tender offers" which are made for the Units. Secondary
market activity for the Units has been limited and varies among the
Partnerships. See "Item 5 - Market for Units and Related Limited Partner
Matters".

Limited Life
 ------------

 The Partnerships are currently scheduled to terminate on December 31,
2007. Even if the General Partner exercises its right to extend the
Partnerships' terms for two additional two-year periods, the Partnerships will
terminate no later than December 31, 2011. Upon termination the Partnerships'
assets will be sold. There is no assurance that the market for the sale of the
Partnerships' assets will be favorable at such time.

-12-

The Partnerships are Subject to Complex Federal, State and
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Local Laws and Regulations that Could Adversely Affect Their
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Business
 --------

 Extensive federal, state and local regulation of the oil and gas industry
significantly affects the Partnerships' operations. In particular, they are
subject to stringent environmental regulations. These regulations increase the
costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning oil
and natural gas wells and other related facilities. These regulations may become
more demanding in the future. Matters subject to regulation include:

 discharge permits for drilling operations;
 drilling bonds;
 spacing of wells;
 unitization and pooling of properties;
 environmental protection;
 reports concerning operations; and
 taxation.

 Under these laws and regulations, the Partnerships could be liable for:

 personal injuries;
 property damage;
 oil spills;
 discharge of hazardous materials;
 reclamation costs;
 remediation and clean-up costs; and
 other environmental damages.

 While the Partnerships maintain insurance coverage customary for companies
similar to their size and operations, losses can occur from uninsurable risks or
in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. See "Item 1 - Business".

-13-

Conflicts of Interest
 ---------------------

 Direct and indirect conflicts of interests exist among the Partnerships
and among a Partnership and the General Partner and its affiliates. The General
Partner and its affiliates engage in many aspects of the oil and gas business,
including acting as a general partner of a number of affiliated oil and gas
limited partnerships. The General Partner and its affiliates may engage in
transactions with a Partnership, and Partnerships will frequently engage in
transactions with other oil and gas limited partnerships. These conflicts could
relate to the sale of oil and gas properties, the determination of the
Partnerships' Repurchase Prices, and the determination of whether to continue
the Partnerships past their scheduled termination date of December 31, 2007. See
"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions".

Payments to the General Partner
 -------------------------------

 The General Partner receives reimbursements for General and Administrative
Expenses. The General Partner also receives a share of Partnership cash
distributions. See "Item 11 - Executive Compensation" and "Item 8 - Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data".

 Financial Capability of General Partner
 ---------------------------------------

 The General Partner has limited financial resources. Contingencies may
arise which will require funding beyond its financial resources. Even if such
financial resources are available, the General Partner is not required to lend
money or to fund any financial obligations of the Partnerships.

Liability and Indemnification of General Partner and Related
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Parties
 -------

 Although the General Partner generally will be liable for the obligations
of the Partnerships, the Partnership Agreements provide that the claims of third
parties will be initially satisfied from Partnership assets. The Partnership
Agreements also provide, subject to certain conditions, that the Partnerships
will reimburse (i.e. "indemnify") the General Partner and its affiliates for
certain costs, claims and expenses.

(1) The designation of a well as an oil well or gas well is made by the
 General Partner based on the relative amount of oil and gas reserves
 for the well. Regardless of a well's oil or gas designation, it may
 produce oil, gas, or both oil and gas.
(2) As used in this Annual Report, "gross well" refers to a well in which a
 working interest is owned; accordingly, the number of gross wells is
 the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned.
(3) As used in this Annual Report, "net well" refers to the sum of the
 fractional working interests owned in gross wells. For example, a 15 
 working interest in a well represents one gross well, but 0.15 net
 well.

Oil and Gas Production, Revenue, and Price History

 The following tables set forth certain historical information concerning
the oil (including condensates) and gas production, net of all royalties,
overriding royalties, and other third party interests, of the Partnerships,
revenues attributable to such production, and certain price and cost
information. As used in the tables, direct operating expenses include lease
operating expenses and production taxes. In addition, gas production is
converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf per barrel, representing the
estimated relative energy content of gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily
indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. The respective prices of
oil and gas are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative
energy content.

Proved Reserves and Net Present Value

 The following table sets forth each Partnership's estimated proved oil and
gas reserves and net present value therefrom as of December 31, 2005. The
schedule of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves was prepared by the
General Partner in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain reserve information was reviewed by
Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), an independent petroleum engineering
firm. As used throughout this Annual Report, "proved reserves" refers to those
estimated quantities of crude oil, gas, and gas liquids which geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions.

 Net present value represents estimated future gross cash flow from the
production and sale of proved reserves, net of estimated oil and gas production
costs (including production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and operating expenses) and
estimated future development costs, discounted at 10 per annum. Net present
value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves was calculated on the
basis of current costs and prices at December 31, 2005. Such prices were not
escalated except in certain circumstances where escalations were fixed and
readily determinable in accordance with applicable contract provisions. Oil and
gas prices at December 31, 2005 61.06 per barrel and 10.08 per Mcf,
respectively) were substantially higher than the prices in effect on December
31, 2004( 43.36 per barrel and 6.02 per Mcf, respectively). This increase in
oil and gas prices has caused the estimates of remaining economically
recoverable reserves, as well as the values placed on said reserves, at December
31, 2005 to be higher than the previous estimates and values at December 31,
2004. The prices used in calculating the net present value attributable to the
Partnerships' proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil
and gas production subsequent to December 31, 2005. In fact, as of the date of
this Annual Report natural gas prices have declined significantly from the
December 31, 2005 price. There can be no assurance that the prices used in
calculating the net present value of the Partnerships' proved reserves at
December 31, 2005 will actually be realized for such production.

 The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring
significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological,
engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given
reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things,
additional development activity, production history, and viability of production
under varying economic conditions; consequently, it is reasonably possible that
material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the near future.
Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that these reserve
estimates represent the most accurate assessment

-30-

possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in
available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less
precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement
disclosures.

Title to Oil and Gas Properties

 Management believes that the Partnerships have satisfactory title to their
oil and gas properties. Record title to all of the Partnerships' properties is
held by either the Partnerships or Geodyne Nominee Corporation, an affiliate of
the General Partner.

 Title to the Partnerships' properties is subject to customary royalty,
overriding royalty, carried, working, and other similar interests and
contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for
current taxes not yet due, and to other encumbrances. Management believes that
such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from
the Partnerships' interest therein or materially interfere with their use in the
operation of the Partnerships' business.

R.W. Scott Investments, LLC v. Samson Resources Company, Case No. C-01-385, was
filed in the District Court of Sweetwater County, Wyoming on June 29, 2001. The
lawsuit seeks class action certification and alleges that Samson deducted from
its payments to royalty and overriding royalty owners certain charges which were
improper under the Wyoming royalty payment statutes. A number of these royalty
and overriding royalty payments burdened the interests of the II-C and II-D
Partnerships. In February 2003, Samson made a supplemental payment to the
royalty and overriding royalty interest owners who were potential class members
of amounts which were then thought to have been improperly deducted plus
statutory interest thereon. The applicable portions of these payments, 2,548.31
and 26,768.96, respectively, were recouped from the II-C and II-D Partnerships
in the first quarter of 2003. The lawsuit also alleges that Samson's check stubs
did not fully comply with the Wyoming Royalty Payment Act. Samson intends to
vigorously defend this claim. On May 13, 2005 the trial court certified this
lawsuit as a class action and denied Samson's motion for summary judgment. On
June 25, 2005 the Wyoming Supreme Court denied Samson's request for it to review
these decisions.

 Except as described above, to the knowledge of the General Partner,
neither the General Partner nor the Partnerships or their properties are subject
to any litigation, the results of which would have a material effect on the
Partnerships' or the General Partner's financial condition or operations.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR UNITS AND RELATED LIMITED PARTNER MATTERS

 As of March 1, 2006, the number of Units outstanding and the approximate
number of Limited Partners of record in the Partnerships were as follows:

 Number of Numbers of
 Partnership Units Limited Partners
 ----------- --------- ----------------

 II-A 484,283 3,122
 II-B 361,719 1,939
 II-C 154,621 1,041
 II-D 314,878 2,149
 II-E 228,821 1,629
 II-F 171,400 1,313
 II-G 372,189 2,000
 II-H 91,711 942

 Units were initially sold for a price of 100. The Units are not traded on
any exchange and there is no public trading market for them. The General Partner
is aware of certain transfers of Units between unrelated parties, some of which
are facilitated by secondary trading firms and matching services. In addition,
as further described below, the General Partner is aware of certain "4.9 tender
offers" which have been made for the Units. The General Partner believes that
the transfers between unrelated parties have been limited and sporadic in number
and volume. Other than trades facilitated by certain secondary trading firms and
matching services, no organized trading market for Units exists and none is
expected to develop. Due to the nature of these transactions, the General
Partner has no verifiable information regarding prices at which Units have been
transferred. Further, a transferee may not become a substitute Limited Partner
without the consent of the General Partner.

 Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreements, the General Partner
is obligated to annually issue a repurchase offer which is based on the
estimated future net revenues from the Partnerships' reserves and is calculated
pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreements. Such repurchase offer is
recalculated monthly in order to reflect cash distributions to the Limited
Partners and extraordinary events. The following table sets forth the General
Partner's repurchase offer per Unit as of the periods indicated. For purposes of
this Annual Report, a Unit represents an initial subscription of 100 to the
Partnership.

In addition to this repurchase offer, some of the Partnerships have been
subject to "4.9 tender offers" from several third parties. The General Partner
does not know the terms of these offers or the prices received by the Limited
Partners who accepted these offers.

Cash Distributions

 Cash distributions are primarily dependent upon a Partnership's cash
receipts from the sale of oil and gas production and cash requirements of the
Partnership. Distributable cash is determined by the General Partner at the end
of each calendar quarter and distributed to the Limited Partners within 45 days
after the end of the quarter. Distributions are restricted to cash on hand less
amounts required to be retained out of such cash as determined in the sole
judgment of the General Partner to pay costs, expenses, or other Partnership
obligations whether accrued or anticipated to accrue. In certain instances, the
General Partner may not distribute the full amount of cash receipts which might
otherwise be available for distribution in an effort to equalize or stabilize
the amounts of quarterly distributions. Any available amounts not distributed
are invested and the interest or income thereon is for the accounts of the
Limited Partners.

The following is a summary of cash distributions paid to the Limited
Partners during 2004 and 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Use of Forward-Looking Statements and Estimates

 This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements. The words
"anticipate," "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "project,"
"could," "may," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Such statements reflect management's current views with respect to
future events and financial performance. This Annual Report also includes
certain information which is, or is based upon, estimates and assumptions. Such
estimates and assumptions are management's efforts to accurately reflect the
condition and operation of the Partnerships.

 Use of forward-looking statements and estimates and assumptions involve
risks and uncertainties which include, but are not limited to, the volatility of
oil and gas prices, the uncertainty of reserve information, the operating risk
associated with oil and gas properties (including the risk of personal injury,
death, property damage, damage to the well or producing reservoir, environmental
contamination, and other operating risks), the prospect of changing tax and
regulatory laws, the availability and capacity of processing and transportation
facilities, the accuracy of third party payments and billings, the general
economic climate, the supply and price of foreign imports of oil and gas, the
level of consumer product demand, and the price and availability of alternative
fuels. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur or should
estimates or underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual conditions or
results may vary materially and adversely from those stated, anticipated,
believed, estimated, or otherwise indicated.

General Discussion

 The following general discussion should be read in conjunction with the
analysis of results of operations provided below. The primary source of
liquidity and Partnership cash distributions comes from the net revenues
generated from the sale of oil and gas produced from the Partnerships' oil and
gas properties. The level of net revenues is highly dependent upon the prices
received for oil and gas sales, which prices have historically been very
volatile and may continue to be so. Additionally, lower oil and natural gas
prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that is economic to produce and
reduce the Partnerships' revenues and cash flow. Various factors beyond the
Partnerships' control will affect prices for oil and natural gas, such as:

-48-

Worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;
 The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries ("OPEC") to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production
 quotas;
 Political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions or
 around major shipping areas;
 The level of consumer demand and overall economic activity;
 The competitiveness of alternative fuels;
 Weather conditions and the impact of weather-related events;
 The availability of pipelines for transportation;
 Domestic and foreign government regulations and taxes; and
 Market expectations.

 It is not possible to predict the future direction of oil or natural
gas prices or whether the above discussed trends will remain. Operating costs,
including General and Administrative Expenses, may not decline over time, may
increase, or may experience only a gradual decline, thus adversely affecting net
revenues as either production or oil and natural gas prices decline. In any
particular period, net revenues may also be affected by either the receipt of
proceeds from property sales or the incursion of additional costs as a result of
well workovers, recompletions, new well drilling, and other events.

 In addition to pricing, the level of net revenues is also highly dependent
upon the total volumes of oil and natural gas sold. Oil and gas reserves are
depleting assets and will experience production declines over time, thereby
likely resulting in reduced net revenues. Despite this general trend of
declining production, several factors can cause the volumes of oil and gas sold
to increase, remain relatively constant, or decrease at an even greater rate
over a given period. These factors include, but are not limited to:

 Geophysical conditions which cause an acceleration of the decline in
 production;
 The shutting in of wells (or the opening of previously shut-in wells)
 due to low oil and gas prices (or high oil and gas prices), mechanical
 difficulties, loss of a market or transportation, or performance of
 workovers, recompletions, or other operations in the well;
 Prior period volume adjustments (either positive or negative) made by
 operators of the properties;
 Adjustments in ownership or rights to production in accordance with
 agreements governing the operation or ownership of the well (such as
 adjustments that occur at payout or due to gas balancing); and
 Completion of enhanced recovery projects which increase production for
 the well.

-49-

Many of these factors are very significant as related to a single well or as
related to many wells over a short period of time. However, due to the large
number of wells owned by the Partnerships, these factors are generally not
material as compared to the normal decline in production experienced on all
remaining wells.

 Results of Operations

 An analysis of the change in net oil and gas operations (oil and gas
sales, less lease operating expenses and production taxes), is presented in the
tables following "Results of Operations" under the heading "Average Sales
Prices, Production Volumes, and Average Production Costs." Following is a
discussion of each Partnership's results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the
year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.

 Total oil and gas sales increased 1,793,000 (30.2 in 2005 as compared
to 2004. Of this increase (i) 912,000 and 1,145,000, respectively, were
related to increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold and (ii) 30,000
was related to an increase in volumes of gas sold. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of 294,000 related to a decrease in volumes of
oil sold. Volumes of oil sold decreased 7,752 barrels, while volumes of gas sold
increased 5,598 Mcf in 2005 as compared to 2004.

 The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to (i) normal
declines in production and (ii) a negative prior period volume adjustment made
in 2005 by the operator on one significant well. The increase in volumes of gas
sold was primarily due to (i) positive prior period volume adjustments made in
2005 by the operators on several wells; (ii) one significant well returning to
production during mid 2005 following the resolution of transportation problems
associated with line pressure; and (iii) the successful completion of several
wells during late 2004 and early to mid 2005. These increases in volumes sold
were substantially offset by normal declines in production.

 Average oil and gas prices increased to 53.66 per barrel and 7.10 per
Mcf, respectively, in 2005 from 37.89 per barrel and 5.35 per Mcf,
respectively, in 2004.

-50-

Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 166,000 (10.8 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to the following 2005 activities: (i) workover
expenses incurred on several wells; (ii) an increase in production taxes
associated with the increase in oil and gas sales; and (iii) positive prior
period lease operating expense adjustments. These increases were partially
offset by (i) workover expenses incurred on several other wells during 2004 and
(ii) a 2005 reversal of 27,000 of a charge previously accrued for a judgment.
As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased to 22.1 in 2005
from 25.9 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas
properties increased 185,000 (85.6 in 2005 as compared to 2004. Of this
increase (i) 112,000 was due to the depletion of additional capitalized costs
of oil and gas properties as a result of the upward revision in the estimate of
the asset retirement obligations, of which 71,000 was related to previously
fully depleted wells, and (ii) 24,000 was due to accretion of these additional
asset retirement obligations. This increase was also due to downward revisions
in the estimates of remaining oil and gas reserves after an unsuccessful 2005
recompletion attempt on one significant well. As a percentage of oil and gas
sales, this expense increased to 5.2 in 2005 from 3.6 in 2004, primarily due
to the dollar increase in DD&A of oil and gas properties.

 General and administrative expenses remained relatively constant in 2005
and 2004. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased to 7.3 
in 2005 from 9.4 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales.

 The Limited Partners have received cash distributions through December 31,
2005 totaling 64,908,357 or 134.03 of Limited Partners' capital contributions.

 Total oil and gas sales increased 361,000 (6.5 in 2004 as compared to
2003. Of this increase 650,000 and 300,000, respectively, were related to
increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold. These increases were
partially offset by decreases of 245,000 and 344,000, respectively, related to
decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold. Volumes of oil and gas sold decreased
8,748 barrels and 70,505 Mcf, respectively, in 2004 as compared to 2003.

 The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to (i) normal
declines in production and (ii) a positive prior period

-51-

volume adjustment made by the operator on one significant well during 2003. The
decrease in volumes of gas sold was primarily due to (i) normal declines in
production and (ii) downward revisions in the estimates of remaining gas
reserves on one significant well resulting in the II-A Partnership becoming over
produced in excess of estimated ultimate reserves thereby increasing gas
imbalance payable.

 Average oil and gas prices increased to 37.89 per barrel and 5.35 per
Mcf, respectively, in 2004 from 27.97 per barrel and 4.88 per Mcf,
respectively, in 2003.

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 132,000 (9.4 in 2004 as compared to 2003. This
increase was primarily due to: (i) workover expenses incurred on several wells
during 2004; (ii) an increase in production taxes associated with the increase
in oil and gas sales; and (iii) an increase in salt water disposal expenses on
one significant well during 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in lease operating expenses associated with the
decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold. As a percentage of oil and gas sales,
these expenses increased to 25.9 in 2004 from 25.2 in 2003.

 DD&A of oil and gas properties increased 5,000 (2.5 in 2004 as compared
to 2003. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, this expense decreased to 3.6 in
2004 from 3.8 in 2003.

 General and administrative expenses remained relatively constant in 2004
and 2003. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased to 9.4

increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold. Volumes of oil and gas sold
decreased 2,462 barrels and 18,826 Mcf, respectively, in 2005 as compared to
2004. Average oil and gas prices increased to 53.37 per barrel and 6.96 per
Mcf, respectively, in 2005 from 38.97 per barrel and 5.10 per Mcf,
respectively, in 2004.

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 151,000 (13.3 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to: (i) 2005 workover expenses incurred on two
significant wells and (ii) an increase in production taxes associated with the
increase in

-52-

oil and gas sales. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses
decreased to 22.6 in 2005 from 26.0 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in
oil and gas sales.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas
properties increased 162,000 (104.7 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to downward revisions in the estimates of remaining
oil and gas reserves following an unsuccessful 2005 recompletion attempt on one
significant well. This increase was also due to increases of (i) 52,000 due to
the depletion of additional capitalized costs of oil and gas properties as a
result of the upward revision in the estimate of the asset retirement
obligations, of which 37,000 was related to previously fully depleted wells,
and (ii) 8,000 due to accretion of these additional asset retirement
obligations. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, this expense increased to
5.5 in 2005 from 3.5 in 2004, primarily due to the dollar increase in DD&A of
oil and gas properties.

 General and administrative expenses increased 6,000 (1.3 in 2005 as
compared to 2004. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased
to 7.5 in 2005 from 9.6 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in oil and gas
sales.

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 142,000 (14.2 in 2004 as compared to 2003. This
increase was primarily due to: (i) an increase in salt water disposal expenses
on one significant well during 2004 as compared to 2003; (ii) an increase in
production taxes associated with the increase in oil and gas sales; and (iii)
workover expenses incurred on one significant well during 2004. These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in lease operating expenses associated with
the decreases in volumes

 Total oil and gas sales increased 911,000 (43.0 in 2005 as compared to
2004. Of this increase (i) 214,000 and 603,000, respectively, were related to
increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold and (ii) 115,000 was
related to an increase in volumes of gas sold. Volumes of oil sold decreased 548
barrels, while volumes of gas sold increased 22,782 Mcf.

 The increase in volumes of gas sold in 2005 was primarily due to: (i) the
first receipt of revenues on one significant well; (ii) an increase in
production on several wells following the successful workovers of those wells;
and (iii) an increase in production on one significant well after its return to
production following the resolution of transportation problems associated with
line pressure. These increases were partially offset by normal declines in
production.

 Average oil and gas prices increased to 53.36 per barrel and 6.92 per

respectively, in 2004.

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 85,000 (16.3 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in production taxes associated

oil sold. Volumes of oil sold decreased 3,453 barrels, while volumes of gas sold
increased 75,445 Mcf in 2005 as compared to 2004.

 The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to normal declines
in production. The increase in volumes of gas sold was primarily due to: (i) an
increase in production on several wells following the successful workovers of
those wells; (ii) one significant well returning to production during mid 2005
following the resolution of transportation problems associated with line

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 103,000 (8.8 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in production taxes associated
with the increase in oil and gas sales and (ii) workover expenses incurred on

primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas
properties increased 66,000 (37.8 in 2005 as compared to 2004. Of this
increase (i) 65,000 was due to the depletion of additional capitalized costs of
oil and gas properties as a

result of the upward revision in the estimate of the asset retirement
obligations, of which 42,000 was related to previously fully depleted wells and
(ii) 13,000 was due to accretion of these additional asset retirement
obligations. The DD&A increase was also due to one significant well being fully
depleted during 2005 due to the lack of remaining reserves. All of these
increases were partially offset by (i) the receipt in 2005 of equipment credits
on an abandoned well and (ii) two significant wells being substantially depleted
during 2004 due to the lack of remaining reserves. As a percentage of oil and

to an increase in volumes of oil sold. These increases were partially offset by
a decrease of 225,000 related to a decrease in volumes of gas sold. Volumes of
oil sold increased 1,830 barrels, while volumes of gas sold decreased 50,655 Mcf
in 2004 as compared to 2003.

 The increase in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to an increase in
production on one significant well following successful repairs of its

that the salt water disposal expenses on this unit will remain at 2005 levels.
As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased to 19.9 in 2005
from 24.5 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas
properties increased 3,000 (1.4 in 2005 as compared to 2004. Of this increase
(i) 37,000 was due to the depletion of additional capitalized costs of oil and

 Total oil and gas sales increased 42,000 (1.5 in 2004 as compared to
2003. Of this increase 155,000 and 185,000,

-59-

respectively, were related to increases in the average prices of oil and gas
sold. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 29,000 and
 269,000, respectively, related to decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold.

 Volumes of oil and gas sold decreased 996 barrels and 57,609 Mcf,
respectively, in 2004 as compared to 2003. The decrease in volumes of oil sold
was primarily due to (i) normal declines in production and (ii) a negative prior
period volume adjustment made by the operator on one significant well during
2004. These decreases were partially offset by (i) positive prior period volume
adjustments made by the operators during 2004 on two significant wells and (ii)
a similar negative prior period volume adjustment made during 2003 on another
significant well.

 The decrease in volumes of gas sold was primarily due to: (i) normal
declines in production; (ii) the shutting-in of one significant well during 2004
in order to redirect the flow of gas to a pipeline with available capacity; and
(iii) a negative prior period volume adjustment made by the operator on another
significant well during 2004. These decreases were partially offset by a
positive prior period volume adjustment made by the operator on one significant
well during 2004.

 Average oil and gas prices increased to 37.88 per barrel and 5.13 per
Mcf, respectively, in 2004 from 29.32 per barrel and 4.68 per Mcf,
respectively, in 2003.

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 19,000 (2.8 in 2004 as compared to 2003. This
increase was primarily due to workover expenses incurred on several wells during
2004. This increase was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in lease operating
expenses associated with the decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold; (ii)
positive prior period lease operating expense adjustments made in 2003 on two
significant wells; and (iii) a negative prior period production tax adjustment
made in 2004 by the operator on one significant well. As a percentage of oil and
gas sales, these expenses increased to 24.5 in 2004 from 24.2 in 2003.

 DD&A of oil and gas properties increased 64,000 (46.8 in 2004 as
compared to 2003. This increase was primarily due to two significant wells being
substantially depleted during 2004 due to the lack of remaining reserves. This
increase was partially offset by (i) the decreases in volumes of oil and gas
sold and (ii) upward revisions in the estimates of remaining oil and gas
reserves during 2004. As a percentage of oil and gas sales, this expense
increased to 7.2 in 2004 from 5.0 in 2003, primarily due to the dollar
increase in DD&A of oil and gas properties.

 General and administrative expenses decreased 3,000 (1.0 in 2004 as
compared to 2003. As a percentage of oil and gas

increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold. These increases were
partially offset by decreases of 18,000 and 119,000, respectively, related to
decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold. Volumes of oil and gas sold decreased
484 barrels and 24,860 Mcf, respectively, in 2005 as compared to 2004.

 The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to: (i) negative
prior period volume adjustments made by the operators on several wells during
2005; (ii) similar positive prior period volume adjustments made on other wells
during 2004; and (iii) normal declines in production. These decreases were

 Oil and gas production expenses (including lease operating expenses and
production taxes) increased 51,000 (8.4 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This
increase was primarily due to: (i)an increase in production taxes associated
with the increase in oil and gas sales; (ii) workover expenses incurred on
several wells during 2005; and (iii) an increase in salt water disposal

-61-

expenses incurred on one significant unit during 2005 as compared to 2004. These
increases were partially offset by workover expenses incurred on two significant

that the salt water disposal expenses on this unit will remain at 2005 levels.
As a percentage of oil and gas sales, these expenses decreased to 17.1 in 2005
from 21.2 in 2004, primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales.

 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas
properties decreased 81,000 (37.6 in 2005 as compared to 2004. This decrease
was primarily due to (i) one significant well being fully depleted during 2004
due to the lack of remaining reserves and (ii) the decreases in volumes of oil
and gas sold. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) an increase of
 17,000 due to the depletion of additional capitalized costs of oil and gas
properties as a result of the upward revision in the estimate of the asset
retirement obligations, of which 10,000 was related to previously fully
depleted wells; (ii) an increase of 5,000 due to accretion of these additional
asset retirement obligations; and (iii) one significant well being fully
depleted during 2005 due to the lack of remaining reserves. As a percentage of
oil and gas sales, this expense decreased to 3.5 in 2005 from 7.5 in 2004,
primarily due to (i) the dollar decrease in DD&A of oil and gas properties and
(ii) the increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold.

 General and administrative expenses increased 6,000 (2.7 in 2005 as

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Net proceeds from operations less necessary operating capital are
distributed to the Limited Partners on a quarterly basis. See "Item 5. Market
for Units and Related Limited Partner Matters." The net proceeds from production
generally are not reinvested in productive assets, except to the extent that
producing wells are improved, where methods are employed to permit more
efficient recovery of reserves, or where identified developmental drilling or
recompletion opportunities are pursued, thereby resulting in a positive economic
impact. Assuming 2005 production levels for future years, the Partnerships
proved reserve quantities at December 31, 2005 would have the following
remaining lives:

 Partnership Gas-Years Oil-Years
 ----------- --------- ---------

 II-A 9.8 11.9
 II-B 9.3 12.2
 II-C 10.9 11.7
 II-D 12.9 7.9
 II-E 11.9 9.9
 II-F 9.4 13.2
 II-G 9.5 13.1
 II-H 9.5 13.3

These life of reserves estimates are based on the current estimates of remaining
oil and gas reserves. See "Item 2. Properties" for a discussion of these reserve
estimates. Any increase or decrease in the oil and gas prices at December 31,
2005 may cause an increase or decrease in the estimated life of said reserves.
As discussed below, the Partnerships must terminate no later than December 31,
2011 (six years from December 31, 2005).

 The Partnerships' available capital from the Limited Partners'
subscriptions has been spent on oil and gas properties and there should be no
further material capital resource commitments in the future. The Partnerships
have no debt commitments. Cash for operational purposes will be provided by
current oil and gas production. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Partnerships
expended no capital on oil and gas acquisition or exploration activities.
However, during those years the Partnerships expended the following amounts on
oil and gas development activities, primarily well recompletions and
developmental drilling:

 II-H 9,960 43,819 24,574

While these expenditures reduce or eliminate cash available for a particular
quarterly cash distribution, the General Partner believes that these activities
are necessary for the prudent operation of the properties and maximization of
their value to the Partnerships.

 The Partnerships sold certain oil and gas properties during 2005, 2004,
and 2003. The sales of the Partnerships' properties were made by the General
Partner after giving due consideration to both the offer price and the General
Partner's estimate of the property's remaining proved reserves and future
operating costs. Net proceeds from the sales of such properties were distributed
to the Partnerships and included in the calculation of the Partnerships' cash
distributions for the quarter immediately following the Partnerships' receipt of
the proceeds. The amount of such proceeds from the sales of oil and gas
properties during 2005, 2004, and 2003, were as follows:

 Partnership 2005 2004 2003
 ----------- ------- ------- --------

 II-A - 26,393 8,732
 II-B - 32,405 1,968
 II-C - 13,888 739
 II-D 27,451 - 8,060
 II-E - 8,569 22,535
 II-F - 22,941 60,479
 II-G - 48,031 127,575
 II-H - 11,149 29,981

 Over the years, as part of the normal course of business, some of the
Partnerships' interests in wells have been sold, generally at oil and gas
auctions. Given the generally favorable current environment for oil and gas
dispositions, it is possible that the Partnerships will increase the number of
properties to be sold. In the event of sales, any net proceeds are distributed
as soon as possible after the disposition. Future production, costs, and cash
flow will be reduced as properties are sold.

-73-

There can be no assurance as to the amount of the Partnerships' future
cash distributions. The Partnerships' ability to make cash distributions depends
primarily upon the level of available cash flow generated by the Partnerships'
operating activities, which will be affected (either positively or negatively)
by many factors beyond the control of the Partnerships, including the price of
and demand for oil and gas and other market and economic conditions. Even if
prices and costs remain stable, the amount of cash available for distributions
will decline over time (as the volume of production from producing properties
declines) since the Partnerships are not generally replacing production through
acquisitions of producing properties and extensive drilling.

 The General Partner expects general and administrative expenses to
increase substantially during 2006 and 2007 due to costs required to comply with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such anticipated increase will
reduce cash available for distribution. The General Partner expects at least a
portion of this anticipated increase in general and administrative expenses to
continue in years beyond 2007.

 The Partnerships would have terminated on December 31, 2001 in accordance
with the Partnership Agreements. However, the Partnership Agreements provide
that the General Partner may extend the term of each Partnership for up to five
periods of two years each. The General Partner has extended the terms of the
Partnerships for their third two-year extension thereby extending their
termination date to December 31, 2007. As of the date of this Annual Report, the
General Partner has not determined whether to further extend the term of any
Partnership.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 The Partnerships do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations

 The Partnerships do not have any contractual obligations of the type which
are required by the SEC to be disclosed in this Annual Report under this
heading.

Critical Accounting Policies

 The Partnerships follow the successful efforts method of accounting for
their oil and gas properties. Under the successful efforts method, the
Partnerships capitalize all property acquisition costs and development costs
incurred in connection with the further development of oil and gas reserves.
Property acquisition costs include costs incurred by the

-74-

Partnerships or the General Partner to acquire producing properties, including
related title insurance or examination costs, commissions, engineering, legal
and accounting fees, and similar costs directly related to the acquisitions,
plus an allocated portion of the General Partners' property screening costs. The
acquisition cost to the Partnership of properties acquired by the General
Partner is adjusted to reflect the net cash results of operations, including
interest incurred to finance the acquisition, for the period of time the
properties are held by the General Partner.

 Depletion of the cost of producing oil and gas properties, amortization of
related intangible drilling and development costs, and depreciation of tangible
lease and well equipment are computed on the units-of-production method. The
Partnerships' calculation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization includes
estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values.
When complete units of depreciable property are retired or sold, the asset cost
and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any gain or loss
reflected in income. When less than complete units of depreciable property are
retired or sold, the proceeds are credited to oil and gas properties.

 The Partnerships evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of
their proved oil and gas properties for each oil and gas field (rather than
separately for each well). If the unamortized costs of all oil and gas
properties within a field exceed the expected undiscounted future cash flows
from such properties, the cost of the properties is written down to fair value,
which is determined by using the discounted future cash flows from the
properties. The risk that the Partnerships will be required to record impairment
provisions in the future increases as oil and gas prices decrease.

 The Deferred Charge on the Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report represents costs deferred for lease operating expenses incurred in
connection with the Partnerships' underproduced gas imbalance positions.
Conversely, the Accrued Liability represents charges accrued for lease operating
expenses incurred in connection with the Partnerships' overproduced gas
imbalance positions. The rates used in calculating the Deferred Charge and
Accrued Liability are the annual average production cost per Mcf.

 The Partnerships' oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and
revenue recognized at or near the Partnerships' wells under short-term purchase
contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements which are
customary in the oil and gas industry. Sales of gas applicable to the
Partnerships' interest in producing oil and gas leases are recorded as revenue
when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales
contracts covering the Partnerships' interest in gas reserves. During such times
as a Partnership's sales of gas

-75-

exceed its pro rata ownership in a well, such sales are recorded as revenues
unless total sales from the well have exceeded the Partnership's share of
estimated total gas reserves underlying the property, at which time such excess
is recorded as a liability. The rates per Mcf used to calculate this liability
are based on the average gas price for which the Partnerships are currently
settling similar liabilities. These amounts were recorded as gas imbalance
payables in accordance with the sales method. These gas imbalance payables will
be settled by either gas production by the underproduced party in excess of
current estimates of total gas reserves for the well or by a negotiated or
contractual payment to the underproduced party.

 The Partnerships' wells must be properly plugged and abandoned after their
oil and gas reserves are exhausted. The Partnerships follow FAS No. 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" in accounting for the future
expenditures that will be necessary to plug and abandon these wells. FAS No. 143
requires the estimated plugging and abandonment obligations to be recognized in
the period in which they are incurred (i.e. when the well is drilled or
acquired) if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and to be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the well.

New Accounting Pronouncements

 The Partnerships are not aware of any recently issued accounting
pronouncements that would have an impact on the Partnerships' future results of
operations and financial position.

Inflation and Changing Prices

 Prices obtained for oil and gas production depend upon numerous factors,
including the extent of domestic and foreign production, foreign imports of oil,
market demand, domestic and foreign economic conditions in general, and
governmental regulations and tax laws. Inflationary pressure on drilling and
operating costs have impacted the operating costs and drilling costs incurred by
the Partnerships. This pressure is expected to continue if commodity prices
remain at their current levels. Oil and gas prices have fluctuated during recent
years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation. See "Item
2. Properties - Oil and Gas Production, Revenue, and Price History."

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

 The General Partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for actual general
and administrative costs and operating costs incurred and attributable to the
conduct of the business affairs and operations of the Partnerships, computed on
a cost basis, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Such reimbursed costs and expenses allocated to the Partnerships
include office rent, secretarial, employee compensation and benefits, travel and
communication costs, fees for professional services, and other items generally
classified as general or administrative expense. When actual costs incurred
benefit other Partnerships and affiliates, the allocation of costs is based on
the relationship of the Partnerships' reserves to the total reserves owned by
all Partnerships and affiliates. The amount of general and administrative
expense allocated to the General Partner and its affiliates which was charged to
each Partnership during 2005, 2004, and 2003, is set forth in the table below.
Although the actual costs incurred by the General Partner and its affiliates
have fluctuated during the three years presented, the amounts charged to the
Partnerships have not fluctuated due to expense limitations imposed by the
Partnership Agreements.

Affiliates of the Partnerships serve as operator of some of the
Partnerships' wells. The General Partner contracts with such affiliates for
services as operator of the wells. As operator, such affiliates are compensated
at rates provided in the operating agreements in effect and charged to all
parties to such agreement. Such compensation may occur both prior and subsequent
to the commencement of commercial marketing of production of oil or gas. The
dollar amount of such compensation paid by the Partnerships to the affiliates is
impossible to quantify as of the date of this Annual Report.

 Samson maintains necessary inventories of new and used field equipment.
Samson may have provided some of this equipment for wells in which the
Partnerships have an interest. This equipment was provided at prices or rates
equal to or less than those normally charged in the same or comparable
geographic area by unaffiliated persons or companies dealing at arm's length.
The operators of these wells billed the Partnerships for a portion of such costs
based upon the Partnerships' interest in the well.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

 The following table provides information as to the beneficial ownership of
the Units as of the date of filing this Annual Report by (i) each beneficial
owner of more than five percent of the issued and outstanding Units, (ii) the
directors and officers of the General Partner, and (iii) the General Partner and
its affiliates. The address of each of such persons is Samson Plaza, Two West
Second Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

 The General Partner and certain of its affiliates engage in oil and gas
activities independently of the Partnerships which result in conflicts of
interest that cannot be totally eliminated. The allocation of acquisition and
drilling opportunities and the nature of the compensation arrangements between
the Partnerships and the General Partner also create potential conflicts of
interest. An affiliate of the Partnerships owns some of the Partnerships' Units
and therefore has an identity of interest with other Limited Partners with
respect to the operations of the Partnerships.

 In order to attempt to assure limited liability for Limited Partners as
well as an orderly conduct of business, management of the Partnerships is
exercised solely by the General Partner. The Partnership Agreements grant the
General Partner broad discretionary authority with respect to the Partnerships'
participation in drilling prospects and expenditure and control of funds,
including borrowings. These provisions are similar to those contained in
prospectuses and partnership agreements for other public oil and gas
partnerships. Broad discretion as to general management of the Partnerships
involves circumstances where the General Partner has conflicts of interest and
where it must allocate costs and expenses, or opportunities, among the
Partnerships and other competing interests.

 The General Partner does not devote all of its time, efforts, and
personnel exclusively to the Partnerships. Furthermore, the Partnerships do not
have any employees, but instead rely on the personnel of Samson. The
Partnerships thus compete with Samson (including other oil and gas partnerships)
for the time and resources of such personnel. Samson devotes such time and
personnel to the management of the Partnerships as are indicated by

-90-

the circumstances and as are consistent with the General Partner's fiduciary
duties.

 Affiliates of the Partnerships are solely responsible for the negotiation,
administration, and enforcement of oil and gas sales agreements covering the
Partnerships' leasehold interests. Because affiliates of the Partnership who
provide services to the Partnership have fiduciary or other duties to other
members of Samson, contract amendments and negotiating positions taken by them
in their effort to enforce contracts with purchasers may not necessarily
represent the positions that the Partnerships would take if they were to
administer their own contracts without involvement with other members of Samson.
On the other hand, management believes that the Partnerships' negotiating
strength and contractual positions have been enhanced by virtue of their
affiliation with Samson.

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

 Audit Fees

 During 2005 and 2004, each Partnership incurred the following audit fees:

 2005 2004
 ------- -------
 Year-end audit per
 engagement letter 23,716 21,560
 1st quarter 10-Q review 925 825
 2nd quarter 10-Q review 917 825
 3rd quarter 10-Q review 917 825

Audit-Related Fees

 During 2005 and 2004 the Partnerships did not pay any audit-related fees
of the type required by the SEC to be disclosed in this Annual Report under this
heading.

Tax Fees

 During 2005 and 2004 the Partnerships did not pay any tax compliance, tax
advice, or tax planning fees of the type required by the SEC to be disclosed in
this Annual Report under this heading.

All Other Fees

 During 2005 and 2004 the Partnerships did not pay any other fees of the
type required by the SEC to be disclosed in this Annual Report under this
heading.

-91-

Audit Approval

 The Partnerships do not have audit committee pre-approval policies and
procedures as described in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.
The Partnerships did not receive any services of the type described in Items
9(e)(2) through 9(e)(4) of Schedule 14A.

Audit and Related Fees paid by Affiliates

 The Partnerships' accountants received compensation from other limited
partnerships managed by the General Partner and from other entities affiliated
with the General Partner. This compensation is for audit services, tax related
services, and other accounting-related services. The General Partner does not
believe this arrangement creates a conflict of interest or impairs the auditors'
independence.

ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE PARTNERS

GEODYNE ENERGY INCOME LIMITED PARTNERSHIP II-A
GEODYNE PRODUCTION PARTNERSHIP II-A

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related
combined statements of operations, changes in partners' capital (deficit) and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of the Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-A, an Oklahoma
limited partnership, and Geodyne Production Partnership II-A, an Oklahoma
general partnership, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the combined results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Partnerships' management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to the Combined Financial Statements under
the heading "Asset Retirement Obligation," effective January 1, 2003 the
Partnerships changed the manner in which they account for asset retirement
obligations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE PARTNERS

GEODYNE ENERGY INCOME LIMITED PARTNERSHIP II-B
GEODYNE PRODUCTION PARTNERSHIP II-B

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related
combined statements of operations, changes in partners' capital (deficit) and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of the Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-B, an Oklahoma
limited partnership, and Geodyne Production Partnership II-B, an Oklahoma
general partnership, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the combined results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Partnerships' management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to the Combined Financial Statements under
the heading "Asset Retirement Obligation," effective January 1, 2003 the
Partnerships changed the manner in which they account for asset retirement
obligations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE PARTNERS

GEODYNE ENERGY INCOME LIMITED PARTNERSHIP II-E
GEODYNE PRODUCTION PARTNERSHIP II-E

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related
combined statements of operations, changes in partners' capital (deficit) and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of the Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-E, an Oklahoma
limited partnership, and Geodyne Production Partnership II-E, an Oklahoma
general partnership, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the combined results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Partnerships' management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to the Combined Financial Statements under
the heading "Asset Retirement Obligation," effective January 1, 2003 the
Partnerships changed the manner in which they account for asset retirement
obligations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE PARTNERS

GEODYNE ENERGY INCOME LIMITED PARTNERSHIP II-G
GEODYNE PRODUCTION PARTNERSHIP II-G

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related
combined statements of operations, changes in partners' capital (deficit) and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of the Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnership II-G, an Oklahoma
limited partnership, and Geodyne Production Partnership II-G, an Oklahoma
general partnership, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the combined results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Partnerships' management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to the Combined Financial Statements under
the heading "Asset Retirement Obligation," effective January 1, 2003 the
Partnerships changed the manner in which they account for asset retirement
obligations.

 Notes to Combined Financial Statements
 For the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Organization and Nature of Operations

 The Geodyne Energy Income Limited Partnerships (the "Partnerships") were
formed pursuant to a public offering of depositary units ("Units"). Upon
formation, investors became limited partners (the "Limited Partners") and held
Units issued by each Partnership. Geodyne Resources, Inc. is the general partner
of each Partnership. Each Partnership is a general partner in the related
Geodyne Production Partnership (the "Production Partnership") in which Geodyne
Resources, Inc. serves as the managing partner. Limited Partner capital
contributions were contributed to the related Production Partnerships for
investment in producing oil and gas properties. The Partnerships were activated
on the following dates with the following Limited Partner capital contributions.

 Limited
 Date of Partner Capital
 Partnership Activation Contributions
 ----------- ------------------ ---------------

 II-A July 22, 1987 48,428,300
 II-B October 14,1987 36,171,900
 II-C January 14, 1988 15,462,100
 II-D May 10, 1988 31,487,800
 II-E September 27, 1988 22,882,100
 II-F January 5, 1989 17,140,000
 II-G April 10, 1989 37,218,900
 II-H May 17, 1989 9,171,100

 The Partnerships would have terminated on December 31, 2001 in accordance
with the partnership agreements for the Partnerships. However, such partnership
agreements provide that the General Partner may extend the term of each
Partnership for up to five periods of two years each. The General Partner has
extended the terms of the Partnerships for their third two-year extension
thereby extending their termination date to December 31, 2007.

 For purposes of these financial statements, the Partnerships and
Production Partnerships are collectively referred to as the "Partnerships" and
the general partner and managing partner are collectively referred to as the
"General Partner".

 The Partnerships' sole business is the development and production of oil
and gas. Substantially all of the Partnerships' gas production is being sold
regionally on the "spot market." Due to the highly competitive nature of the
spot market, prices on the spot market are subject to wide seasonal and regional
pricing fluctuations. In addition, such spot market sales are generally
short-term in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services
provided by pipelines. The Partnerships' oil is sold at or near the
Partnerships' wells under short-term purchase contracts at prevailing
arrangements which are customary in the oil industry. The prices received for
the Partnerships' oil and gas are subject to influences such as global
consumption and supply trends.

Allocation of Costs and Revenues

 The combination of the allocation provisions in each Partnership's limited
partnership agreement and each Production Partnership's partnership agreement
(collectively, the "Partnership Agreement") results in allocations of costs and
income between the Limited Partners and General Partner as follows:

F-50

Before Payout(1) After Payout(1)
 ------------------ ------------------
 General Limited General Limited
 Partner Partners Partner Partners
 -------- -------- -------- --------
 Costs(2)
- ------------------------
Sales commissions, pay-
 ment for organization
 and offering costs
 and management fee 1 99 - -
Property acquisition

Gain on sale of produc-
 ing properties(3) 5 95 15 85 
All other income(3) 5 95 15 85 

- ----------

(1) Payout occurs when total distributions to Limited Partners equal total
 original Limited Partner subscriptions.
(2) The allocations in the table result generally from the combined effect of
 the allocation provisions in the Partnership Agreements. For example, the
 costs incurred in development drilling are allocated 95.9596 to the
 limited partnership and 4.0404 to the managing partner. The 95.9596 
 portion of these costs allocated to the limited partnership, when passed
 through the limited partnership, is further allocated 99 to the limited
 partners and 1 to the general partner. In this manner the Limited
 Partners are allocated 95 of such costs and the General Partner is
 allocated 5 of such costs.
(3) If at payout the Limited Partners have received distributions at an annual
 rate less than 12 of their subscriptions, the percentage of income and
 costs allocated to the general partner and managing partner will increase
 to only 10 and the percentage allocated to the Limited Partners will
 decrease to only 90 . Thereafter, if the

F-51

distribution to Limited Partners reaches an average annual rate of 12 the
 allocation will change to 15 to the general partner and managing partner
 and 85 to the Limited Partners.

 All Partnerships have achieved payout. After payout, operations and
revenues for the Partnerships have been and will be allocated using the 10 /
90 after payout percentages as described in Footnote 3 to the table above.

Basis of Presentation

 These financial statements reflect the combined accounts of each
Partnership after the elimination of all inter-partnership transactions and
balances.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 The Partnerships consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
not insured, which cause the Partnerships to be subject to risk.

Credit Risks

 Accrued oil and gas sales which are due from a variety of oil and gas
purchasers subject the Partnerships to a concentration of credit risk. Some of
these purchasers are discussed in Note 3 - Major Customers.

Oil and Gas Properties

 The Partnerships follow the successful efforts method of accounting for
their oil and gas properties. Under the successful efforts method, the
Partnerships capitalize all property acquisition costs and development costs
incurred in connection with the further development of oil and gas reserves.
Property acquisition costs include costs incurred by the Partnerships or the
General Partner to acquire producing properties, including related title
insurance or examination costs, commissions, engineering, legal and accounting
fees, and similar costs directly related to the acquisitions, plus an allocated
portion of the General Partners' property screening costs. The acquisition cost
to the Partnership of properties acquired by the General Partner is adjusted to
reflect the net cash results of operations, including interest incurred to
finance the acquisition, for the period of time the properties are held by the
General Partner.

F-52

Depletion of the cost of producing oil and gas properties, amortization of
related intangible drilling and development costs, and depreciation of tangible
lease and well equipment are computed on the units-of-production method. The
Partnerships' calculation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization includes
estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values.
The depreciation, depletion, and amortization rates, which include accretion of
the asset retirement obligation, per equivalent barrel of oil produced during
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, were as follows:

 Partnership 2005 2004 2003
 ----------- ----- ----- -----

 II-A 2.41 1.25 1.09
 II-B 2.51 1.17 1.14
 II-C 1.79 1.08 1.22
 II-D 1.63 1.26 1.95
 II-E 2.31 2.33 1.41
 II-F 1.53 2.32 1.37
 II-G 1.55 2.39 1.39
 II-H 1.54 2.42 1.38

 When complete units of depreciable property are retired or sold, the asset
cost, related accumulated depreciation, and remaining asset retirement
obligation, are eliminated with any gain or loss reflected in income. When less
than complete units of depreciable property are retired or sold, the proceeds
are credited to oil and gas properties.

 The Partnerships evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of
their proved oil and gas properties at the field level. If the unamortized costs
of oil and gas properties within a field exceed the expected undiscounted future
cash flows from such properties, the cost of the properties is written down to
fair value, which is determined by using the discounted future cash flows from
the properties. No impairment provisions were recorded by the Partnerships
during the three years ended December 31, 2005.

 The risk that the Partnerships will be required to record impairment
provisions in the future increases as oil and gas prices decrease.

Deferred Charge

 The Deferred Charge represents costs deferred for lease operating expenses
incurred in connection with the Partnerships' underproduced gas imbalance
positions. The rate used in calculating the deferred charge is the annual
average production costs per Mcf. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, cumulative
total gas sales volumes for underproduced wells were less than the

F-53

Partnerships' pro-rata share of total gas production from these wells by the
following amounts:

 2005 2004
 ---------------------- ---------------------
 Partnership Mcf Amount Mcf Amount
 ----------- ------- -------- ------- --------

 II-A 526,539 601,624 547,267 625,308
 II-B 230,226 271,456 220,054 252,768
 II-C 195,069 155,926 169,216 121,531
 II-D 470,689 371,875 447,143 345,329
 II-E 326,359 209,941 324,938 208,295
 II-F 54,651 30,727 62,433 35,102
 II-G 117,353 65,542 134,837 75,307
 II-H 28,476 16,952 33,149 19,734

Accrued Liability - Other

 The Accrued Liability - Other at December 31, 2004 for the II-A
Partnership represents a charge accrued for the payment of a judgment related to
plugging liabilities. The decrease in Accrued Liability - Other from December
31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 was due to a ruling made by the Texas Supreme
Court on April 8, 2005 that the Partnership did not owe this liability.

Accrued Liability

 The Accrued Liability represents charges accrued for lease operating
expenses incurred in connection with the Partnerships' overproduced gas
imbalance positions. The rate used in calculating the accrued liability is the
annual average production costs per Mcf. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
cumulative total gas sales volumes for overproduced wells exceeded the
Partnerships' pro-rata share of total gas production from these wells by the
following amounts:

2005 2004
 -------------------- -------------------
 Partnership Mcf Amount Mcf Amount
 ----------- ------- -------- ------- --------

 II-A 136,010 155,405 156,928 179,306
 II-B 56,172 72,442 39,928 42,599
 II-C 55,517 44,603 47,790 34,323

 II-G 68,713 45,118 60,048 35,560
 II-H 18,994 15,003 16,145 11,907

F-54

Oil and Gas Sales and Gas Imbalance Payable

 The Partnerships' oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and
revenue recognized at or near the Partnerships' wells under short-term purchase
contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements which are
customary in the oil industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Partnerships'
interest in producing oil and gas leases are recorded as revenue when the gas is
metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales contracts covering the
Partnerships' interest in gas reserves. During such times as a Partnership's
sales of gas exceed its pro rata ownership in a well, such sales are recorded as
revenues unless total sales from the well have exceeded the Partnership's share
of estimated total gas reserves underlying the property, at which time such
excess is recorded as a liability. The rates per Mcf used to calculate this
liability are based on the average gas prices for which the Partnerships are
currently settling this liability. At December 31, 2005 and 2004 total sales
exceeded the Partnerships' share of estimated total gas reserves as follows:

 2005 2004
 ------------------- -----------------
 Partnership Mcf Amount Mcf Amount
 ----------- ------ -------- ------ --------

 II-A 64,638 96,957 72,424 108,636
 II-B 23,709 35,564 26,351 39,527
 II-C 8,969 13,454 14,693 22,040
 II-D 11,732 17,598 15,064 22,596
 II-E 28,949 43,424 28,949 43,424
 II-F 1,541 2,312 2,261 3,392
 II-G 10,211 15,317 7,897 11,846
 II-H - - - -

These amounts were recorded as gas imbalance payables in accordance with the
sales method. These gas imbalance payables will be settled by either gas
production by the underproduced party in excess of current estimates of total
gas reserves for the well or by a negotiated or contractual payment to the
underproduced party.

 The Partnerships have not entered into any hedging or derivative contracts
in connection with their production and sale of oil and gas.

General and Administrative Overhead

 The General Partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for actual general
and administrative costs incurred and attributable to the conduct of the
business affairs and operations of the Partnerships.

F-55

Use of Estimates in Financial Statements

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Further, the
deferred charge, the gas imbalance payable, asset retirement obligations, and
the accrued liability all involve estimates which could materially differ from
the actual amounts ultimately realized or incurred in the near term. Oil and gas
reserves (see Note 4) also involve significant estimates which could materially
differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.

Income Taxes

 Income or loss for income tax purposes is includable in the income tax
returns of the partners. Accordingly, no recognition has been given to income
taxes in these financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligation

 The Partnerships' wells must be properly plugged and abandoned after their
oil and gas reserves are exhausted. FAS No. 143 requires the estimated plugging
and abandonment obligations to be recognized in the period in which they are
incurred (i.e. when the well is drilled or acquired) if a reasonable estimate of
fair value can be made and to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of
the well. Estimated abandonment dates will be revised in the future based on
changes to related economic lives, which vary with product prices and production
costs. Estimated plugging costs may also be adjusted to reflect industry
experience. On January 1, 2003, the Partnerships adopted FAS No.143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations" and recorded an increase in capitalized cost
of oil and gas properties, an increase (decrease) in net income for the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle, and an asset retirement
obligation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Partnerships' asset
retirement obligations were revised upward due to an increase in both the labor
and rig costs associated with plugging wells. Cash flows would not be affected
until wells are actually plugged and abandoned.

 The asset retirement obligation is adjusted upwards each quarter in order
to recognize accretion of the time-related discount factor. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the II-A, II-B, II-C, II-D, II-E, II-F, II-G, and II-H
Partnerships

F-56

recognized approximately 167,000, 71,000, 25,000, 89,000, 49,000, 27,000,
 58,000, and 14,000, respectively, of an increase in depreciation, depletion,
and amortization expense, which was comprised of accretion of the asset
retirement obligation and depletion of the increase in capitalized cost of oil
and gas properties.

 The components of the change in asset retirement obligations for the year
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as shown below.

2. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

 The Partnerships reimburse the General Partner for the general and
administrative overhead applicable to the Partnerships, based on an allocation
of actual costs incurred by the General Partner. When actual costs incurred
benefit other partnerships and affiliates, the allocation of costs is based on
the relationship of the Partnerships' reserves to the total reserves owned by
all partnerships and affiliates. The General Partner believes this allocation
method is reasonable. Although the actual costs incurred by the General Partner
and its affiliates have fluctuated during the three years presented, the amounts
charged to the Partnerships have not fluctuated due to expense limitations
imposed by the Partnership Agreements. The following is a summary of payments
made to the General Partner or its affiliates by the Partnerships for general
and administrative overhead costs for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003:

 In the event of interruption of purchases by one or more of these
significant customers or the cessation or material change in availability of
open access transportation by the Partnerships' pipeline transporters, the
Partnerships may encounter difficulty in marketing their gas and in maintaining
historic sales levels. Alternative purchasers or transporters may not be readily
available.

Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves - Unaudited

 The following tables summarize changes in net quantities of the
Partnerships' proved reserves, all of which are located in the United States of
America, for the periods indicated. The proved reserves at December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, were estimated by petroleum engineers employed by affiliates of
the Partnerships. Certain reserve information was reviewed by Ryder Scott
Company, L.P., an independent petroleum engineering firm. The following
information includes certain gas balancing adjustments which cause the gas
volumes to differ from the reserve reports prepared by the General Partner and
reviewed by Ryder Scott.

 record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

 (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
 other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
 internal control over financial reporting.
