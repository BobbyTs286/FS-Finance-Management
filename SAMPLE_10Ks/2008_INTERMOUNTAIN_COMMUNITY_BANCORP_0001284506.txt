Item 1. 

BUSINESS 

Intermountain Community Bancorp Intermountain or
 the Company is a financial holding company
 registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
 amended. The Company was formed as Panhandle Bancorp in October
 1997 under the laws of the State of Idaho in connection with a
 holding company reorganization of Panhandle State Bank (the
 Bank that was approved by the shareholders on
 November 19, 1997 and became effective on January 27,
 1998. In June 2000, Panhandle Bancorp changed its name to
 Intermountain Community Bancorp.

Panhandle State Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
 was first opened in 1981 to serve the local banking needs of
 Bonner County, Idaho. Panhandle State Bank is regulated by the
 Idaho Department of Finance Department ), the State
 of Washington Department of Financial Institutions, the Oregon
 Division of Finance and Corporate Securities and by the Federal
 Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), its primary
 federal regulator and the insurer of its deposits.

Since opening in 1981, the Bank has continued to grow by opening
 additional branch offices throughout Idaho. During 1999, the
 Bank opened its first branch under the name of Intermountain
 Community Bank, a division of Panhandle State Bank, in Payette,
 Idaho. Over the next four years, the Bank opened branches in
 Weiser, Coeur d Alene, Nampa, Rathdrum, Caldwell and Post
 Falls, Idaho. In January 2003, the Bank acquired a branch office
 from Household Bank F.S.B. located in Ontario, Oregon, its first
 and only out-of-state branch at the time. Also, in 2003, the
 Company changed the names of the Coeur d Alene, Post Falls,
 and Rathdrum branches from Intermountain Community Bank to
 Panhandle State Bank, because the Panhandle State Bank name had
 more brand recognition in the northern part of the state. In
 November 2004, Intermountain acquired Snake River Bancorp, Inc.
 Snake River and its subsidiary bank, Magic Valley
 Bank, which consisted of three branches. The branches are
 located in south central Idaho in the cities of Twin Falls,
 Gooding and Jerome. In June 2005, the Company opened a branch in
 Spokane Valley, Washington. In August 2005, the Company closed
 its Jerome, Idaho branch and consolidated the branch operations
 into its Twin Falls branch.

In 2006, the Company opened branches in Kellogg and Fruitland,
 Idaho and a branch in downtown Spokane, Washington. It also
 opened a Trust Wealth division, offering
 trust wealth management services to its customers.
 In September 2006, the Company opened a second branch in Twin
 Falls, Idaho, and purchased a small investment company, Premier
 Alliance, which now operates as Intermountain Community
 Investment Services ICI ), providing investment
 advisory services to its customers. In January 2007, the Company
 opened a loan

production and administrative office in Nampa, Idaho, and in
 August of 2007, it relocated its Spokane Valley branch to a new
 larger facility.

The Bank has filed an application with its bank regulators to
 move its main office location. Pending final approval, the Bank
 will move its main office to a newly built structure in
 Sandpoint and will retain the current Sandpoint office as a
 drive-up 
 banking facility.

The Bank s primary service area covers three distinct
 geographical regions. The north Idaho and eastern Washington
 region encompasses the four northernmost counties in Idaho,
 including Boundary County, Bonner County, Shoshone County and
 Kootenai County and Spokane County in eastern Washington. The
 north Idaho region is heavily forested and contains numerous
 lakes. As such, the economies of these counties are primarily
 based on tourism, real estate development and natural resources,
 including logging, mining and agriculture. Both Kootenai and
 Bonner County have also experienced additional light industrial,
 high-tech, commercial, retail and medical development over the
 past ten years. Shoshone County is experiencing residential
 development relating to the outdoor recreation industry in the
 area. The Spokane County economy is the most diverse in eastern
 Washington. There is an emergence of new high tech industries,
 as well as an established base of mature businesses in the
 manufacturing, health care and service industries.

The second region served by the Bank encompasses three counties
 in southwestern Idaho (Canyon, Payette, and Washington) and one
 county in southeastern Oregon (Malheur). The economies of these
 counties are primarily based on agriculture and related or
 supporting businesses. A variety of crops are grown in the area
 including beans, onions, corn, apples, peaches, cherries and
 sugar beets. Livestock, including cattle and pigs, are also
 raised. Because of its proximity to Boise, Canyon County has
 expanding residential and retail development, and a more
 diversified light manufacturing and commercial base.

The third region served by the Bank encompasses two counties in
 south central Idaho (Twin Falls and Gooding). The economies of
 these counties are primarily based on agriculture and related or
 supporting businesses. A variety of crops are grown in the area
 including beans, peas, corn, hay, sugar beets and potatoes. Fish
 farms, dairies and beef cattle are also prevalent. Twin Falls
 County has experienced significant growth over the past
 10 years and as a result, residential and commercial
 construction is a much larger driver of the local economy. The
 area is also experiencing growth in light manufacturing and
 retail development.

The Company s equity investments include Panhandle State
 Bank, as previously noted, and Intermountain Statutory
 Trust I and Intermountain Statutory Trust II,
 financing subsidiaries formed in January 2003 and March 2004,
 respectively. Each Trust has issued 8 million in preferred
 securities, the purchasers of which are entitled to receive
 cumulative cash distributions from the Trusts. The Company has
 issued junior subordinated debentures to the Trusts, and
 payments from these debentures are used to make the cash
 distributions to the holders of the Trusts preferred
 securities.

Primary
 Market Area 

The Company conducts its primary banking business through its
 bank subsidiary, Panhandle State Bank. The Bank maintains its
 main office in Sandpoint, Idaho and has 18 other branches. In
 addition to the main office, seven branch offices operate under
 the name of Panhandle State Bank. Eight branches are operated
 under the name Intermountain Community Bank, a division of
 Panhandle State Bank, and three branches operate under the name
 Magic Valley Bank, a division of Panhandle State Bank. Sixteen
 of the Company s branches are located throughout Idaho in
 the cities of Bonners Ferry, Caldwell, Coeur d Alene,
 Fruitland, Gooding, Kellogg, Nampa, Payette, Ponderay, Post
 Falls, Priest River, Rathdrum, Sandpoint, Twin Falls and Weiser.
 One branch is located in Spokane Valley, Washington and one
 branch is located in Spokane, Washington. In addition, the
 Company has one branch located in Ontario, Oregon. The Company
 focuses its banking and other services on individuals,
 professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses throughout
 its market area. On December 31, 2007, the Company had
 total consolidated assets of 1.05 billion.

Competition 

Based on total asset size as of December 31, 2007, the
 Company continues to be the largest independent community bank
 headquartered in Idaho. The Company competes with a number of
 international banking groups, out-of-state banking companies,
 state-wide banking organizations, and several local community
 banks, as well as savings banks, savings and loans, credit
 unions and other non-bank competitors throughout its market
 area. Banks and similar financial institutions compete based on
 a number of factors, including price, customer service,
 convenience, technology, local market knowledge, operational
 efficiency, advertising and promotion, and reputation. In
 competing against other institutions, the Company focuses on
 delivering highly personalized customer service with an emphasis
 on local decision-making. It recruits, retains and motivates
 seasoned, knowledgeable bankers who have worked in the
 Company s market areas for extended periods of time and
 supports them with current technology. Product offerings,
 pricing and location convenience are generally competitive with
 other banks in its market areas. The Company seeks to
 differentiate itself based on the high skill levels and local
 knowledge of its staff, combined with sophisticated relationship
 management and profit systems that pinpoint marketing and
 service opportunities. The Company has employed these
 competitive tools to grow both market share and profitability
 over the past several years. Based on the June 2007 FDIC survey
 of banking institutions, the Company is the market share leader
 in deposits in five of the eleven counties in which it operates.

As discussed above, the Company s principal market area is
 divided into three separate regions based upon population and
 the presence of banking offices. In the northern part of Idaho
 and eastern Washington, the delineated communities are Boundary,
 Bonner, Kootenai and Shoshone Counties in Idaho and Spokane
 County in Washington. Primary competitors in this northern
 region include US Bank, Wells Fargo, Washington Trust Bank,
 Sterling Savings Bank and Bank of America, all large
 international or regional banks, and Idaho Independent Bank and
 Mountain West Bank, both community banks.

In southwestern and south central Idaho and eastern Oregon, the
 Bank has delineated Washington, Payette, Canyon, Malheur, Twin
 Falls and Gooding Counties. Primary competitors in the southern
 region include international or regional banks, US Bank, Wells
 Fargo, Key Bank, Bank of America and Zions Bank, and community
 banks, Bank of the Cascades, Idaho Independent Bank, DL Evans
 Bank and Farmers National Bank.

Services
 Provided 

Lending
 Activities 

The Bank offers and encourages applications for a variety of
 secured and unsecured loans to help meet the needs of its
 communities, dependent upon the Bank s financial condition
 and size, legal impediments, local economic conditions and
 consistency with safe and sound operating practices. While
 specific credit programs may vary from time to time, based on
 Bank policies and market conditions, the Bank makes every effort
 to encourage applications for the following credit services
 throughout its communities.

Commercial Loans. The Bank offers a wide range
 of loans and open-end credit arrangements to businesses of small
 and moderate size, from small sole proprietorships to larger
 corporate entities, with purposes ranging from working capital
 and inventory acquisition to equipment purchases and business
 expansion. The Bank also participates in the Small Business
 Administration SBA and USDA financing programs.
 Operating loans or lines of credit typically carry annual
 maturities. Straight maturity notes are also available, in which
 the maturities match the anticipated receipt of specifically
 identified repayment sources. Term loans for purposes such as
 equipment purchases, expansion, term working capital, and other
 purposes generally carry terms that match the borrower s
 cash flow capacity, typically with maturities of three years or
 longer. Risk is controlled by applying sound, consistent
 underwriting guidelines, concentrating on relationship loans as
 opposed to transaction type loans, and establishing sound
 alternative repayment sources. Government guaranty programs are
 also utilized when appropriate.

The Bank also offers loans for agricultural and ranching
 purposes. These include expansion loans, short-term working
 capital loans, equipment loans, cattle or livestock loans, and
 real estate loans on a limited basis. Terms are generally up to
 one year for operating loans or lines of credit and up to seven
 years for term loans. As with other business loans, sound
 underwriting is applied by a staff of lending and credit
 personnel seasoned in this line of

Table of Contents 

lending. Government guaranteed programs are utilized whenever
 appropriate and available. Agricultural real estate loans are
 considered for financially sound borrowers with strong financial
 and management histories.

Real Estate Loans. For consumers, the Bank
 offers first mortgage loans to purchase or refinance homes, home
 improvement loans and home equity loans and credit lines.
 Conforming 1st mortgage loans are offered with up to
 30-year 
 maturities, while typical maturities for 2nd mortgages
 (home improvement and home equity loans and lines) are as stated
 below under Consumer Loans. Lot acquisition and
 construction loans are also offered to consumers with typical
 terms up to 36 months (interest only loans are also
 available) and up to 12 months (with six months 
 extension), respectively. Loans for purchase, construction,
 rehabilitation or repurchase of commercial and industrial
 properties are also available through the Bank, as are property
 development loans, with up to two-year terms typical for
 construction and development loans, and up to 10 years for
 term loans (generally with re-pricing after three, five or seven
 years). Risk is mitigated by selling the conventional
 residential mortgage loans (currently nearly 100 are sold) and
 underwriting 2nd mortgage products for potential sale.
 Commercial real estate loans are generally confined to
 owner-occupied properties unless there is a strong customer
 relationship or sound business project justifying otherwise. All
 commercial real estate loans are restricted to borrowers with
 established track records and financial wherewithal. Project due
 diligence is conducted by the Bank, to help provide for adequate
 contingencies, collateral
 and/or 
 government guaranties.

Consumer Loans. The Bank offers a variety of
 consumer loans, including personal loans, motor vehicle loans,
 boat loans, recreational vehicle loans, home improvement loans,
 home equity loans, open-end credit lines, both secured and
 unsecured, and overdraft protection credit lines. The
 Bank s terms and underwriting on these loans are consistent
 with what is offered by competing community banks and credit
 unions. Loans for the purchase of new autos typically range up
 to 72 months. Loans for the purchase of smaller RV s,
 pleasure crafts and used vehicles range up to 60 months.
 Loans for the purchase of larger RV s and larger pleasure
 crafts, mobile homes, and home equity loans range up to
 120 months (180 months if credit factors and value
 warrant). Unsecured loans are usually limited to two years,
 except for credit lines, which may be open-ended but are
 generally reviewed by the Bank periodically. Relationship
 lending is emphasized, which, along with credit control
 practices, minimizes risk in this type of lending.

Municipal Financing. Operating and term loans
 are available to entities that qualify for the Bank to offer
 such financing on a tax-exempt basis. Operating loans are
 generally restricted by law to duration of one fiscal year. Term
 loans, which under certain circumstances can extend beyond one
 year, typically range up to five years. Municipal financing is
 restricted to loans with sound purposes and with established tax
 basis or other revenue to adequately support repayment.

Deposit
 Services 

The Bank offers the full range of deposit services typically
 available in most banks and savings and loan associations,
 including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market
 accounts and various types of certificates of deposit. The
 transaction accounts and certificates of deposit are tailored to
 the Bank s primary market area at rates competitive with
 those offered in the area. All deposit accounts are insured by
 the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law. The bank also
 offers non-FDIC insured alternatives on a limited basis to
 customers, in the form of reverse repurchase agreements and
 sweep accounts.

Investment
 Services 

The Bank provides non-FDIC insured investment services through
 its division, Intermountain Community Investments
 ICI ). Products offered by ICI include annuities,
 equity and fixed income securities, mutual funds, insurance
 products and brokerage services to its customers. The Bank
 offers these products in a manner consistent with the principles
 of prudent and safe banking and in compliance with applicable
 laws, rules, regulations and regulatory guidelines. The Bank
 earns fees for providing these services.

 higher net worth customers to assist them in investment, tax and
 estate planning. The Bank offers these services in a manner

Table of Contents 

prudent and safe banking and in compliance with applicable laws,
 rules, regulations and regulatory guidelines. The Bank earns
 fees for managing client s assets and providing trust
 services.

Other
 Services

 ATMs ), debit cards, safe deposit boxes, merchant

 credit cards and ACH origination services. The Bank is a member
 of the Star, Plus, Exchange, Interlink and Accell ATM networks.
 New products and services introduced in 2007 include check
 collect for businesses, enhanced internet cash management
 services and portfolio checking for professionals.

Loan
 Portfolio 

The loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets.
 In 2007, the Company increased total gross loans by 14 or
 93.2 million. Commercial loans contributed the highest
 dollar growth in 2007, increasing 96.1 million or 18 over
 2006.

During 2007, with a volatile short-term interest rate
 environment and a slowdown in lending, loan competition
 increased, as lenders continued to aggressively pursue new loan
 originations and refinancings. With market interest rates
 flattening in early 2007 and then declining in the later months,
 yields on the loan portfolio increased only slightly over the
 prior year. The Bank continues to pursue quality loans using
 conservative underwriting and control practices and to monitor
 existing loans carefully for increased default risk. The Bank
 continues to utilize relationship pricing models and techniques
 to increase customer profitability.

In 2006, the Company increased total gross loans by 20 , or
 111.3 million. Commercial loans contributed the highest
 percentage growth in 2006, increasing 102.3 million or 24 
 over 2005.

In 2005, the total loan portfolio increased 33 , with commercial
 loans contributing the highest percentage growth, 39 over 2004.
 In November 2004, the Bank acquired Snake River Bancorp, Inc.
 and its subsidiary bank, Magic Valley Bank, which contributed
 65.5 million in net loans receivable at the acquisition
 date.

Classification
 of Loans 

The Bank is required under applicable law and regulations to
 review its loans on a regular basis and to classify them as
 satisfactory, special mention, 
 substandard, doubtful or
 loss. A loan which possesses no apparent weakness or
 deficiency is designated satisfactory. A loan which
 possesses weaknesses or deficiencies deserving close attention
 is designated as special mention. A loan is
 generally classified as substandard if it possesses
 a

7

Table of Contents 

well-defined weakness and the Bank will probably sustain some
 loss if the weaknesses or deficiencies are not corrected. A loan
 is classified as doubtful if a probable loss of
 principal
 and/or 
 interest exists but the amount of the loss, if any, is subject
 to the outcome of future events which are undeterminable at the
 time of classification. If a loan is classified as
 loss, the Bank either establishes a specific
 valuation allowance equal to the amount classified as loss or
 charges off such amount.

During 2007, the Company modified its risk grade allocation
 factors to better reflect varying loss experiences in different
 types of loans. As of December 31, 2007, the risk factors
 range from cash equivalent secured loans (Risk Grade
 1 to doubtful/loss (Risk Grade
 8 ). Risk Grades 3 , 5 ,
 6 , 7 and 8 closely reflect
 the FDIC s definitions for Satisfactory, 
 Special Mention, Substandard ,
 Doubtful and Loss , respectively. Risk
 Grade 4 is an internally designated
 Watch category. At December 31, 2007, the
 Company had 4.7 million in the Special Mention,
 18.2 million in the substandard, 423,000 in the Doubtful
 and 0 in the Loss loan categories. The majority of the
 classified loans were real-estate related, reflecting the
 slowdown in the real estate sector of the economy, particularly
 in the land development and residential construction sectors.

Non-accrual loans are those loans that have become delinquent
 for more than 90 days (unless well-secured and in the
 process of collection). Placement of loans on non-accrual status
 does not necessarily mean that the outstanding loan principal
 will not be collected, but rather that timely collection of
 principal and interest is in question. When a loan is placed on
 non-accrual status, interest accrued but not received is
 reversed. The amount of interest income which would have been
 recorded in fiscal 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 on
 non-accrual loans was approximately 161,000, 21,000, 95,000,
 55,000 and 7,000, respectively. A non-accrual loan may be
 restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments
 are brought current or when brought to 90 days or less
 delinquent and continuing payment of principal and interest is
 expected.

As of December 31, 2007, there were a total of
 6.4 million in identified loans which were not in
 compliance with the stated terms of the loan or otherwise
 presented additional credit risk to the Company. Of these loans
 800,000 were loans past due 90 days and still accruing
 interest and 5.6 million were non-accrual loans.

The 4.4 million increase in non-accrual loans from
 December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 is primarily
 comprised of several larger residential construction and land
 loans where repayment is primarily reliant on selling the asset.
 The Company has evaluated the borrowers and the collateral
 underlying these loans and determined that the probability of
 recovery of the loans principal balance is high.

Allowance
 for Loan Losses 

Allowance for loan losses is based upon management s
 assessment of various factors including, but not limited to,
 current and future economic trends, historical loan losses,
 delinquencies, underlying collateral values, as well as current
 and potential risks identified in the loan portfolio. The
 allowance is evaluated on a monthly basis by management. The
 methodology for calculating the allowance is discussed in more
 detail below. An allocation is also included for unfunded
 commitments, however this allocation is recorded as a liability,
 as required by new bank regulatory guidance issued in early 2007.

During 2007, the company changed its method of calculating its
 loan loss allowance, in line with new bank regulatory guidance
 issued in early 2007. Under the new methodology, the loan
 portfolio is segregated into loans for which a specific reserve
 is calculated by management, and loans for which a reserve is
 calculated using an allowance model. For loans with a specific
 reserve, management evaluates each loan and derives the
 appropriate reserve based on such factors as expected
 collectability, collateral value and guarantor support. For
 loans with reserves calculated by the model, the model
 mathematically derives a base reserve allocation for each loan
 using probability of default and loss given default rates based
 on both historical and industry experience. This base reserve
 allocation is then modified by management considering factors
 such as the current economic environment, portfolio delinquency
 trends, collateral valuation trends, quality of underwriting and
 quality of collection activities. The reserves derived from the
 model are modified by management, then added to the reserve for
 specifically identified loans to produce the total reserve.
 Management believes that this methodology provides a more
 accurate, reliable and verifiable reserve calculation and
 closely follows recent regulatory guidance. The Bank s
 total allowance for loan losses was 1.53 of total loans at
 December 31, 2007 and 1.46 of total loans at
 December 31, 2006. The following table provides additional
 detail on the allowance.

In November 2004, the Bank acquired Snake River Bancorp, Inc,
 and its subsidiary bank, Magic Valley Bank. Total loans of
 approximately 65.5 million were acquired which was net of
 a 1.1 million allowance for loan losses. The loan
 portfolio acquired from Magic Valley Bank is similar to the
 Bank s existing loan portfolio. Therefore, the Bank s
 current process for assessing the allowance for loan loss was
 applied to the Magic Valley Bank portfolio at December 31,
 2007, 2006 and 2005.

In January 2003, the Company acquired the loan portfolio of the
 Ontario branch of Household FSB Ontario Branch
 Portfolio ). Total loans of approximately
 39.4 million were acquired which was net of a
 1.6 million allowance for loan losses. Of the total
 1.1 million in charge-offs during 2003, 0.2 million
 related to the Ontario Branch Portfolio.

Loan
 Portfolio Concentrations 

The Bank continuously monitors concentrations of loan categories
 in regards to industries and loan types. Due to the makeup of
 the Bank s marketplace, it expects to have significant
 concentrations in certain industries and with specific loan
 types. Concentration guidelines are established and then
 approved by the Board of Directors at least annually, and are
 reviewed by management and the Board monthly. Detrimental
 circumstances affecting industries involved in loan
 concentrations are reviewed as to their impact as they occur,
 and appropriate action is determined regarding the loan
 portfolio
 and/or 
 lending strategies and practices.

As of December 31, 2007, the Bank s loan portfolio by
 loan type was:

Commercial

31.26

Commercial real estate

49.81

Residential real estate

14.83

Consumer

3.42

Municipal

0.68

These concentrations are typical for the markets served by the
 Bank, and management believes that they are comparable with
 those of the Bank s peer group (banks of similar size and
 operating in the same geographic areas). At December 31,
 2007, approximately 65 of the total loan portfolio was secured
 by real estate.

Management does not consider the overall commercial portfolio
 total to present a concentration risk, and feels that there is
 adequate diversification by type, industry, and geography to
 further mitigate risk. The agricultural portfolio, which is
 included in commercial loans, presents a somewhat greater risk,
 in that it represents a large percentage of the loans in the
 Bank s southern Idaho region. At December 31, 2007,
 agricultural loans and agricultural real estate loans represent
 approximately 11.0 and 3.1 of the total loan portfolio,
 respectively. The agricultural portfolio consists of loans
 secured by crops, real estate and livestock. To mitigate credit
 risk, specific underwriting is applied to retain only borrowers
 that have proven track records in the agricultural industry. In
 addition, the Bank has hired senior lenders with significant
 experience in agricultural lending to administer these loans.
 Further mitigation is provided through frequent collateral
 inspections, adherence to farm operating budgets, and annual or
 more frequent review of financial performance.

The residential land and construction loan portfolio currently
 appears to pose the greatest overall risk of
 loan-type concentration. However, experienced
 lenders and consistently applied underwriting standards help to
 mitigate credit risk. Real estate values tend to fluctuate
 somewhat with economic conditions. Currently, valuations are
 static or falling in many of the Bank s markets, although
 the rate of decline is smaller than current national average
 rates of decline. Over longer periods, real estate collateral is
 generally considered one of the more stable forms of collateral
 in regards to maintaining value.

The Bank lends to contractors and developers, and is also active
 in custom construction lending. The Bank has established
 concentration limits as measured against Tier 1 capital
 (generally, Tier 1 capital is the Company s tangible
 net worth). These concentration limits include residential and
 commercial construction loans not to exceed 175 and, combined
 with development loans, not to exceed 325 of Tier 1
 capital. The guidelines further specify that total commercial
 real estate loans are not to exceed 400 and other real estate
 (agricultural and land) loans are not to exceed 230 of the
 Bank s Tier 1 capital. Accordingly, at
 December 31, 2007, residential and commercial construction
 loans represented 128.2 and, combined with development loans,
 represented 295.6 of Tier 1 capital. Total commercial real
 estate loans represented 380.5 , and other real estate loans
 represented 147.7 of the Bank s Tier 1 capital,
 respectively. In response to the combined banking agencies 
 recently adopted Commercial Real Estate Lending Guidelines, the
 Bank revised measurements and expanded categories for monitoring
 in 2007.

The methodology of determining the Bank s overall allowance
 provides for specific allocation for individual loans or
 components of the loan portfolio. This could include any
 segment. However, all components deemed to represent significant
 concentrations are especially scrutinized for credit quality and
 appropriate allowance. Allocations are reviewed and determined
 by senior management monthly and reported to the Board of
 Directors.

Investments 

The investment portfolio is the second largest earning asset
 category and is comprised mostly of securities categorized as
 available-for-sale. These securities are recorded at market
 value. Unrealized gains and losses that are considered temporary
 are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
 income or loss.

The carrying value of the available-for-sale securities
 portfolio increased 34.0 to 158.8 million at
 December 31, 2007 from 118.5 million at
 December 31, 2006. The carrying value of the
 held-to-maturity securities portfolio increased 68.5 to
 11.3 million at December 31, 2007 from
 6.7 million at December 31, 2006. During 2007, the
 Company utilized funds from repurchase agreements and new
 deposits to fund the growth in the investment portfolio. In
 general, the Company sought to increase the yield and use the
 investment portfolio to limit the Bank s overall interest
 rate risk position during the year. In doing so, the Company
 extended the duration of its portfolio and re-positioned it to
 perform better in a down-rate environment, to offset the weaker
 performance expected from the loan portfolio in such an
 environment. The Company used a combination of U.S agency
 debentures, highly rated whole loan collateralized mortgage
 obligations (CMOs), and municipal bonds to accomplish this
 re-positioning. The average duration of the available-for-sale
 and the held-to-maturity portfolios was approximately
 4.4 years and 6.4 years, respectively on
 December 31, 2007, compared to 3.6 years and
 5.2 years, respectively on December 31, 2006.

Deposits 

Deposits represent approximately 79.1 of the Bank s
 liabilities at December 31, 2007. The Bank gathers its
 deposit base from a combination of small business and retail
 sources. The retail and small business base continues to grow
 with new and improved product offerings. However, management
 recognizes that customer service, targeted marketing and
 attractive product offerings, not a vast retail branch network,
 are going to be the key to the Bank s future customer and
 deposit growth. In 2007, the Bank experienced strong competition
 for deposits, but successfully grew lower-cost transaction
 deposits, including demand, NOW and money market balances, at a
 relatively strong rate. Total deposits grew 9.3 in 2007 with
 non-interest bearing deposits growing 12.3 and interest-bearing
 deposits growing 8.5 over 2006 balances. NOW and money market
 accounts (personal, business and public) grew 5.99 to
 308.9 million at December 31, 2007 from
 291.4 million at December 31, 2006. Demand accounts
 grew 12.3 to 159.1 million at December 31, 2007 from
 141.6 million at December 31, 2006. Certificate of
 deposit accounts grew 24.1 million, from
 178.7 million at December 31, 2006 to
 202.8 million at December 31, 2007, an overall
 increase of 13.5 .

The rise in short-term interest rates during 2006 placed
 pressure on banks to raise rates paid on deposits during the
 first nine months of 2007, placing pressure on the Bank s
 cost of funds and net interest margin. The Bank

13

Table of Contents 

responded by focusing on growing core customer relationships
 through targeting high deposit balance customers and prospects,
 providing high-touch personal service to these customers,
 pursuing referrals from existing customers, competitively
 pricing its traditional deposit products and enhancing services
 offered to its business customers. The decrease in short-term
 interest rates during the latter part of 2007 will likely have
 the lagged effect of decreasing deposit rates during 2008, but
 may simultaneously decrease demand for deposits as well.
 Volatility in the equity markets and other customer investment
 alternatives may counterbalance this pressure, however.

Borrowings 

As part of the Company s funds management and liquidity
 plan, the Bank has arranged to have short-term and long-term
 borrowing facilities available. The short-term and overnight
 facilities are federal funds purchasing lines as reciprocal
 arrangements to the federal funds selling agreements in place
 with various correspondent banks. At December 31, the Bank
 had overnight unsecured credit lines of 50.0 million
 available. For additional long and short-term funding needs, the
 Bank has credit available from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
 Seattle (FHLB), limited to a percentage of its total regulatory
 assets subject to collateralization requirements and a blanket
 pledge agreement. At December 31, 2007 the Bank had a
 5.0 million FHLB advance that matures in June 2008, a
 14.0 million FHLB advance that matures in September 2009
 and a 10.0 million FHLB advance that matures in September
 2010. These notes totaled 29.0 million, and the Bank had
 the ability to borrow an additional 59.5 million.

In March 2007, the Company entered into an additional borrowing
 agreement with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank in the amount of
 18.0 million and in December 2007 increased the amount to
 25.0 million. The borrowing agreement is a revolving line
 of credit with a variable rate of interest tied to LIBOR and is
 collateralized by Bank stock and the Sandpoint Center. This line
 is currently being used primarily to fund the construction of
 the Company s new headquarters building in Sandpoint, with
 pay down likely in late 2008 from the building s
 anticipated sale or refinancing into a longer-term instrument.
 In January 2006, the Company purchased land to build the
 headquarters building and entered into a Note Payable with the
 sellers of the property in the amount of 1,130,000. The note
 has a fixed rate of 6.65 , matures in February 2026 and had an
 outstanding balance of 982,000 at December 31, 2007.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are
 classified as other secured borrowings, generally are short-term
 agreements. These agreements are treated as financing
 transactions and the obligations to repurchase securities sold
 are reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial
 statements. The dollar amount of securities underlying the
 agreements remains in the applicable asset account. These
 agreements had a weighted average interest rate of 4.69 , 5.03 
 and 3.60 at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
 respectively. The average balances of securities sold subject to
 repurchase agreements were 104.2 million,
 59.7 million and 31.6 million during the years ended
 December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The maximum
 amount outstanding at any month end during these same periods
 was 124.1 million, 106.2 million and
 47.6 million, respectively. The increase in the peak in
 2007 reflected the issuance of repurchase agreements primarily
 to municipal customers during the year. In 2006, the Company
 entered into an institutional repurchase agreement to reduce
 interest rate risk in a down-rate environment. The majority of
 the repurchase agreements mature on a daily basis, with the
 institutional repurchase agreement in the amount of
 30.0 million maturing in July 2011. At December 31,
 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company pledged as collateral, certain
 investment securities with aggregate amortized costs of
 122.2 million,

14

Table of Contents 

109.0 million and 37.9 million, respectively. These
 investment securities had market values of 123.7 million,
 109.0 million and 37.1 million at December 31,
 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In January 2003 the, Company issued 8.0 million of
 Trust Preferred securities through its subsidiary,
 Intermountain Statutory Trust I. Approximately
 7.0 million was subsequently transferred to the capital
 account of Panhandle State Bank for capitalizing the Ontario
 branch acquisition. The debt associated with these securities
 bears interest at 6.75 with interest payable quarterly. The
 debt is callable by the Company in March 2008 and matures in
 March 2033.

In March 2004, the Company issued 8.0 million of
 additional Trust Preferred securities through a second
 subsidiary, Intermountain Statutory Trust II. This debt is
 callable by the Company in April 2009, bears interest on a
 variable basis tied to the
 90-day LIBOR
 index plus 2.8 , and matures in April 2034. The rate at
 December 31, 2007 was 8.04 . Funds received from this
 borrowing were used to support planned expansion activities
 during 2004, including the Snake River Bancorp acquisition.

Employees 

The Bank employed 450 full-time equivalent employees at
 December 31, 2007. None of the employees are represented by
 a collective bargaining unit and the Company believes it has
 good relations with its employees.

Supervision
 and Regulation 

General 

The following discussion describes elements of the extensive
 regulatory framework applicable to Intermountain Community
 Bancorp (the Company and Panhandle State (the
 Bank ). This regulatory framework is primarily
 designed for the protection of depositors, federal deposit
 insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than
 specifically for the protection of shareholders. Due to the
 breadth of this regulatory framework, our costs of compliance
 continue to increase in order to monitor and satisfy these
 requirements.

To the extent that this section describes statutory and
 regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by
 reference to those provisions. These statutes and regulations,
 as well as related policies, are subject to change by Congress,
 state legislatures and federal and state regulators. Changes in
 statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us,
 including interpretation or implementation thereof, could have a
 material effect on our business or operations.

Federal
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 

General. The Company is a bank holding company
 as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
 BHCA ), and is therefore subject to regulation,
 supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. In general,
 the BHCA limits the business of bank holding companies to owning
 or controlling banks and engaging in other activities closely
 related to banking. The Company must file reports with and
 provide the Federal Reserve such additional information as it
 may require.

Holding Company Bank Ownership. The BHCA
 requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval
 of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring, directly or
 indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another
 bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it
 would own or control more than 5 of such shares;
 (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of
 another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or
 consolidating with another bank holding company.

Holding Company Control of Nonbanks. With some
 exceptions, the BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from
 acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control
 of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company which is not
 a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or
 indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing
 or controlling banks, or providing services for its
 subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions
 involve certain non-bank activities that, by statute or by
 Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as
 activities closely related to the business of banking or of
 managing or controlling banks.

Table of Contents 

Transactions with Affiliates. Subsidiary banks
 of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by
 the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the holding
 company or its subsidiaries, on investments in their securities
 and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans to
 any borrower. These regulations and restrictions may limit the
 Company s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its
 cash needs, including funds for payment of dividends, interest
 and operational expenses.

Tying Arrangements. The Company is prohibited
 from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with
 any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing
 of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither the
 Company nor its subsidiaries may condition an extension of
 credit to a customer on either (i) a requirement that the
 customer obtain additional services provided by us; or
 (ii) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining
 other services from a competitor.

Support of Subsidiary Banks. Under Federal
 Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of
 financial and managerial strength to the Bank. This means that
 the Company is required to commit, as necessary, resources to
 support the Bank. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes
 to its subsidiary banks are subordinate to deposits and to
 certain other indebtedness of those subsidiary banks.

State Law Restrictions. As an Idaho
 corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and
 restrictions under applicable Idaho corporate law. For example,
 state law restrictions in Idaho include limitations and
 restrictions relating to indemnification of directors,
 distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors,
 officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books,
 records and minutes, and observance of certain corporate
 formalities.

Federal
 and State Regulation of the Bank 

General. The Bank is an Idaho commercial bank
 operating in Idaho, with one branch in Oregon and two in
 Washington. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC. As a result,
 the Bank is subject to primary supervision and regulation by the
 Idaho Department of Finance and the FDIC. With respect to the
 Oregon branch and Washington branch, the Bank is also subject to
 supervision and regulation by, respectively, the Oregon
 Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Washington
 Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the FDIC. These
 agencies have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in
 what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.

Community Reinvestment. The Community
 Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires that, in connection with
 examinations of financial institutions within their
 jurisdiction, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC evaluate the
 record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs
 of its local communities, including low and moderate-income
 neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of
 the institution. A bank s community reinvestment record is
 also considered by the applicable banking agencies in evaluating
 mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or
 facility.

Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are also
 subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve
 Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors,
 principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons.
 Extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the
 same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow
 credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as
 those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
 persons not covered above and who are not employees; and
 (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of
 repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also
 subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts
 to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the
 assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, the
 imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory
 sanctions.

Regulation of Management. Federal law
 (i) sets forth circumstances under which officers or
 directors of a bank may be removed by the institution s
 federal supervisory agency; (ii) places restraints on
 lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors,
 principal shareholders, and their related interests; and
 (iii) prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving
 as a director or in other management positions of another
 financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or
 which has an office within a specified geographic area.

Safety and Soundness Standards. Federal law
 imposes upon banks certain non-capital safety and soundness
 standards. These standards cover internal controls, information
 systems and internal audit systems, loan

16

Table of Contents 

documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure,
 asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other
 operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to
 be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and
 stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these
 standards must develop a plan acceptable to its regulators,
 specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the
 standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may
 subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.

Consumer Protection and Disclosure
 Regulations. Federal and state law requires banks
 to adhere to a number of regulations designed to protect
 consumers and businesses from inadequate disclosure, unfair
 treatment, excessive fees and other similar abuses. An
 institution that fails to comply with these regulations must
 develop a plan acceptable to its regulators, specifying the
 steps that the institution will take to adhere to the
 regulations. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may
 subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. As new
 regulations have been added in the last few years with more
 expected in the near future, the costs to the institution of
 complying with these regulations has increased.

Interstate
 Banking And Branching 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
 of 1994 Interstate Act relaxed prior interstate
 branching restrictions under federal law by permitting
 nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain
 circumstances. Generally, bank holding companies may purchase
 banks in any state, and states may not prohibit these purchases.
 Additionally, banks are permitted to merge with banks in other
 states, as long as the home state of neither merging bank has
 opted out under the legislation. The Interstate Act requires
 regulators to consult with community organizations before
 permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a
 low-income area.

Idaho, Oregon and Washington have each enacted opting
 in legislation in accordance with the Interstate Act
 provisions allowing banks to engage in interstate merger
 transactions, subject to certain aging requirements.
 Idaho and Oregon also restrict an out-of-state bank from opening
 de novo branches. However, once an out-of-state bank has
 acquired a bank within either state, either through merger or
 acquisition of all or substantially all of the bank s
 assets, the out-of-state bank may open additional branches
 within the state. In contrast, under Washington law, an
 out-of-state bank may, subject to Department of Financial
 Institutions approval, open de novo branches in Washington
 or acquire an in-state branch so long as the home state of the
 out-of-state bank has reciprocal laws with respect to,
 respectively, de novo branching or branch acquisitions.

Deposit
 Insurance 

In 2006, federal deposit insurance reform legislation was
 enacted that (i) required the FDIC to merge the Bank
 Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund into a
 newly created Deposit Insurance Fund; (ii) increases the
 amount of deposit insurance coverage for retirement accounts;
 (iii) allows for deposit insurance coverage on individual
 accounts to be indexed for inflation starting in 2010;
 (iv) provides the FDIC more flexibility in setting and
 imposing deposit insurance assessments; and (v) provides
 eligible institutions credits on future assessments.

The Bank s deposits are currently insured to the maximum
 allowed per depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund. The
 Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums, which are
 assessed and paid regularly. The premium amount is based upon a
 risk classification system established by the FDIC. Banks with
 higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern
 are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of
 capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern.

Dividends 

The principal source of the Company s cash is from
 dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to
 government regulation and limitations. Regulatory authorities
 may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying
 dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound
 banking practice or would reduce the amount of its capital below
 that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital
 requirements. Idaho law also limits a bank s ability to pay
 dividends subject to surplus reserve requirements.

Capital
 Adequacy 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines. Federal bank
 regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the
 examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks.
 The guidelines are risk-based, meaning that they are
 designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to
 differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding
 companies.

Tier I and Tier II Capital. Under
 the guidelines, an institution s capital is divided into
 two broad categories, Tier I capital and Tier II
 capital. Tier I capital generally consists of common
 stockholders equity, surplus and undivided profits.
 Tier II capital generally consists of the allowance for
 loan losses, hybrid capital instruments, and term subordinated
 debt. The sum of Tier I capital and Tier II capital
 represents an institution s total regulatory capital. The
 guidelines require that at least 50 of an institution s
 total capital consist of Tier I capital.

Risk-based Capital Ratios. The adequacy of an
 institution s capital is gauged primarily with reference to
 the institution s risk-weighted assets. The guidelines
 assign risk weightings to an institution s assets in an
 effort to quantify the relative risk of each asset and to
 determine the minimum capital required to support that risk. An
 institution s risk-weighted assets are then compared with
 its Tier I capital and total capital to arrive at a
 Tier I risk-based ratio and a total risk-based ratio,
 respectively. The guidelines provide that an institution must
 have a minimum Tier I risk-based ratio of 4 and a minimum
 total risk-based ratio of 8 .

Leverage Ratio. The guidelines also employ a
 leverage ratio, which is Tier I capital as a percentage of
 total assets, less intangibles. The principal objective of the
 leverage ratio is to constrain the maximum degree to which a
 bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base. The
 minimum leverage ratio is 3 ; however, for all but the most
 highly rated bank holding companies and for bank holding
 companies seeking to expand, regulators expect an additional
 cushion of at least 1 to 2 .

Prompt Corrective Action. Under the
 guidelines, an institution is assigned to one of five capital
 categories depending on its total risk-based capital ratio,
 Tier I risk-based capital ratio, and leverage ratio,
 together with certain subjective factors. The categories range
 from well capitalized to critically
 undercapitalized. Institutions that are
 undercapitalized or lower are subject to certain
 mandatory supervisory corrective actions.

In 2007, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC and
 the Federal Reserve, approved final rules to implement new
 risk-based capital requirements. Presently, this new advanced
 capital adequacy framework, called Basel II, is applicable only
 to large and internationally active banking organizations.
 Basel II changes the existing risk-based capital framework
 by enhancing its risk sensitivity. Whether Basel II will be
 expanded to apply to banking organizations that are the size of
 the Company or the Bank is unclear at this time, and what effect
 such regulations would have on us cannot be predicted, but we do
 not expect our operations would be significantly impacted.

Regulatory
 Oversight and Examination 

The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank
 holding companies, which are performed both onsite and offsite.
 The supervisory objectives of the inspection program are to
 ascertain whether the financial strength of the bank holding
 company is being maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine
 the effects or consequences of transactions between a holding
 company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its subsidiary
 banks. For holding companies under 10 billion in assets,
 the inspection type and frequency varies depending on asset
 size, complexity of the organization, and the holding
 company s rating at its last inspection.

Banks are subject to periodic examinations by their primary
 regulators. Bank examinations have evolved from reliance on
 transaction testing in assessing a bank s condition to a
 risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and
 cover the entire breadth of operations of the bank. Generally,
 safety and soundness examinations occur on an
 18-month 
 cycle for banks under 500 million in total assets that are
 well capitalized and without regulatory issues, and
 12-months 
 otherwise. Examinations alternate between the federal and state
 bank regulatory agency or may occur on a combined schedule. The
 frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked
 to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA
 ratings at its most recent examination. However, the examination
 authority of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC allows them to
 examine supervised banks as frequently as deemed necessary based
 on the condition of the bank or as a result of certain
 triggering events.

Corporate
 Governance and Accounting Legislation 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley
 Act of 2002 (the Act addresses among other things,
 corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and
 timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for
 non-compliance. Generally, the Act (i) requires chief
 executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to
 the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission (the SEC (ii) imposes
 specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements;
 (iii) accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider
 transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies;
 (iv) requires companies to adopt and disclose information
 about corporate governance practices, including whether or not
 they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers
 and whether the audit committee includes at least one
 audit committee financial expert; and
 (v) requires the SEC, based on certain enumerated factors,
 to regularly and systematically review corporate filings.

To deter wrongdoing, the Act (i) subjects bonuses issued to
 top executives to disgorgement if a restatement of a
 company s financial statements was due to corporate
 misconduct; (ii) prohibits an officer or director
 misleading or coercing an auditor; (iii) prohibits insider
 trades during pension fund blackout periods 
 (iv) imposes new criminal penalties for fraud and other
 wrongful acts; and (v) extends the period during which
 certain securities fraud lawsuits can be brought against a
 company or its officers.

As a publicly reporting company, the company is subject to the
 requirements of the Act and related rules and regulations issued
 by the SEC. After enactment, we updated our policies and
 procedures to comply with the Act s requirements and have
 found that such compliance, including compliance with
 Section 404 of the Act relating to management control over
 financial reporting, has resulted in significant additional
 expense for the Company. We anticipate that we will continue to
 incur such additional expense in our ongoing compliance
 activities.

Anti-terrorism
 Legislation 

USA Patriot Act of 2001. The Uniting and
 Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
 Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, intended to combat
 terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006 (the
 Patriot Act ). Certain provisions of the Patriot Act
 were made permanent and other sections were made subject to
 extended sunset provisions. The Patriot Act, in
 relevant part, (i) prohibits banks from providing
 correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks;
 (ii) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or
 holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy
 foreign individuals; (iii) requires financial institutions
 to establish an anti-money-laundering compliance program; and
 (iv) eliminates civil liability for persons who file
 suspicious activity reports. The Act also includes provisions
 providing the government with power to investigate terrorism,
 including expanded government access to bank account records.
 While the Patriot Act has had some effect on our record keeping
 and reporting expenses, we do not believe that the renewal and
 amendment will have a material adverse effect on our business or
 operations.

Financial
 Services Modernization 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999
 brought about significant changes to the laws affecting banks
 and bank holding companies. Generally, the Act (i) repeals
 historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating
 with securities firms; (ii) provides a uniform framework
 for the activities of banks, savings institutions and their
 holding companies; (iii) broadens the activities that may
 be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank
 holding companies; (iv) provides an enhanced framework for
 protecting the privacy of consumer information and requires
 notification to consumers of bank privacy policies; and
 (v) addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory
 issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term
 activities of financial institutions. Bank holding companies
 that qualify and elect to become financial holding companies can
 engage in a wider variety of financial activities than permitted
 under previous law, particularly with respect to insurance and
 securities underwriting activities.

Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of
 2006. In 2006, the President signed the
 Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 into law
 (the Relief Act ). The Relief Act amends several
 existing banking laws and

19

Table of Contents 

regulations, eliminates some unnecessary and overly burdensome
 regulations of depository institutions and clarifies several
 existing regulations. The Relief Act, among other things,
 (i) authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to set reserve
 ratios; (ii) amends regulations of national banks relating
 to shareholder voting and granting of dividends;
 (iii) amends several provisions relating to loans to
 insiders, regulatory applications, privacy notices, and golden
 parachute payments; and (iv) expands and clarifies the
 enforcement authority of federal banking regulators. Our
 business, expenses, and operations have not been significantly
 impacted by this legislation.

Effects
 Of Government Monetary Policy 

Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general
 economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary
 policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal
 Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy
 for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession,
 but its open market operations in U.S. government
 securities, control of the discount rate applicable to
 borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of
 reserve requirements against certain deposits, influence the
 growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect
 interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature
 and impact of future changes in monetary policies, such as the
 recent lowering of the Federal Reserve s discount and
 federal funds target rate, and their impact on us cannot be
 predicted with certainty.

Forward-Looking
 Statements 

From time to time, Intermountain and its senior managers have
 made and will make forward-looking statements within the meaning
 of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
 statements may be contained in this report and in other
 documents that Intermountain files with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission. Such statements may also be made by
 Intermountain and its senior managers in oral or written
 presentations to analysts, investors, the media and others.
 Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that
 they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
 Also, forward-looking statements can generally be identified by
 words such as may, could, 
 should, would, believe, 
 anticipate, estimate, seek, 
 expect, intend, plan and
 similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements provide management s
 expectations or predictions of future conditions, events or
 results. They are not guarantees of future performance. By their
 nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
 uncertainties. These statements speak only as of the date they
 are made. Intermountain does not undertake to update
 forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of
 circumstances or events that arise after the date the
 forward-looking statements were made. There are a number of
 factors, many of which are beyond Intermountain s control
 that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ
 significantly from those described in the forward-looking
 statements. These factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere
 in this report, include:

the inflation and interest rate levels, and market and monetary
 fluctuations;

trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest
 rate policies of the federal government;

applicable laws and regulations and legislative or regulatory
 changes;

the timely development and acceptance of new products and
 services of Intermountain;

the willingness of customers to substitute competitors 
 products and services for Intermountain s products and
 services;

Intermountain s success in gaining regulatory approvals,
 when required;

technological and management changes;

growth and acquisition strategies;

the Company s critical accounting policies and the
 implementation of such policies;

lower-than-expected revenue or cost savings or other issues in
 connection with mergers and acquisitions;

Item 1A. 

RISK
 FACTORS 

As a
 financial holding company, our earnings are dependent upon the
 performance of our bank as well as by business, economic and
 political conditions. 

Intermountain is a legal entity separate and distinct from the
 Bank. Our right to participate in the assets of the Bank upon
 the Bank s liquidation, reorganization or otherwise will be
 subject to the claims of the Bank s creditors, which will
 take priority except to the extent that we may be a creditor
 with a recognized claim.

The Company is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of
 dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval.
 These restrictions may affect the amount of dividends the
 Company may declare for distribution to its shareholders in the
 future.

Earnings are impacted by business and economic conditions in the
 United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term
 and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply,
 fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the
 strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in
 which we operate. Business and economic conditions that
 negatively impact household or corporate incomes could decrease
 the demand for our products and increase the number of customers
 who fail to pay their loans.

A
 downturn in the local economies or real estate markets could
 negatively impact our banking business. 

The Company has a high concentration in the real estate market
 and a downturn in the local economies or real estate markets
 could negatively impact our banking business. Because we
 primarily serve individuals and businesses located in northern,
 southwestern and southcentral Idaho, eastern Washington and
 southeastern Oregon, a significant portion of our total loan
 portfolio is originated in these areas or secured by real estate
 or other assets located in these areas. As a result of this
 geographic concentration, the ability of customers to repay
 their loans, and consequently our results, are impacted by the
 economic and business conditions in our market areas. Any
 adverse economic or business developments or natural disasters
 in these areas could cause uninsured damage and other loss of
 value to real estate that secures our loans or could negatively
 affect the ability of borrowers to make payments of principal
 and interest on the underlying loans. In the event of such
 adverse development or natural disaster, our results of
 operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.
 Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and
 selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and
 we would more likely suffer losses on defaulted loans.

Furthermore, current uncertain geopolitical trends and variable
 economic trends, including uncertainty regarding economic
 growth, inflation and unemployment, may negatively impact
 businesses in our markets. While the short-term and long-term
 effects of these events remain uncertain, they could adversely
 affect general economic conditions, consumer confidence, market
 liquidity or result in changes in interest rates, any of which
 could have a negative impact on the banking business.

21

Table of Contents 

Changes
 in market interest rates could adversely affect our
 earnings. 

Our earnings are impacted by changing market interest rates.
 Changes in market interest rates impact the level of loans,
 deposits and investments, the credit profile of existing loans
 and the rates received on loans and investment securities and
 the rates paid on deposits and borrowings. One of our primary
 sources of income from operations is net interest income, which
 is equal to the difference between the interest income received
 on interest-earning assets (usually, loans and investment
 securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with
 interest-bearing liabilities (usually, deposits and borrowings).
 These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our
 control, including general economic conditions, both domestic
 and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various
 governmental and regulatory authorities. Net interest income can
 be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates.
 Changes in relative interest rates may reduce net interest
 income as the difference between interest income and interest
 expense decreases.

Market interest rates have shown considerable volatility over
 the past several years. After rising through much of 2005 and
 the first half of 2006, short-term market rates flattened and
 the yield curve inverted through the latter half of 2006 and the
 first half of 2007. In this environment, short-term market rates
 were higher than long-term market rates, and the amount of
 interest we paid on deposits and borrowings increased more
 quickly than the amount of interest we received on our loans,
 mortgage-related securities and investment securities. In the
 latter half of 2007 and early 2008, short-term market rates
 declined significantly, causing asset yields to decline. If this
 trend continues, it could cause our net interest margin to
 decline and profits to decrease.

Should rates start rising again, interest rates would likely
 reduce the value of our investment securities and may decrease
 demand for loans and make it more difficult for borrowers to
 repay their loans. Increasing market interest rates may also
 depress property values, which could affect the value of
 collateral securing our loans.

An increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact
 on our results of operations by reducing the ability of
 borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These
 circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults,
 foreclosures and write-offs, but also necessitate further
 increases to the allowances for loan losses.

Should market rates fall further, rates on our assets may fall
 faster than rates on our liabilities, resulting in decreased
 income for the bank. Fluctuations in interest rates may also
 result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away
 from depository institutions into direct investments that pay a
 higher rate of return and may affect the value of our investment
 securities and other interest-earning assets.

Our cost of funds may increase because of general economic
 conditions, unfavorable conditions in the capital markets,
 interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally
 obtained funds principally through deposits and borrowings. As a
 general matter, deposits are a cheaper source of funds than
 borrowings, because interest rates paid for deposits are
 typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings. If,
 as a result of general economic conditions, market interest
 rates, competitive pressures, or other factors, our level of
 deposits decreases relative to our overall banking operation, we
 may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds
 in the future, which may negatively impact net interest margin.

Competition
 may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers
 at current levels. 

The banking and financial services businesses in our market
 areas are highly competitive. Competition in the banking,
 mortgage and finance industries may limit our ability to attract
 and retain customers. We face competition from other banking
 institutions, savings banks, credit unions and other financial
 institutions. We also compete with non-bank financial service
 companies within the states that we serve and out of state
 financial intermediaries that have opened loan production
 offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. There has
 also been a general consolidation of financial institutions in
 recent years, which results in new competitors and larger
 competitors in our market areas.

In particular, our competitors include major financial companies
 whose greater resources may provide them a marketplace
 advantage. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans
 and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits and the range and
 quality of services provided. Because we have fewer financial
 and other resources than larger institutions with which we
 compete, we may be limited in our ability to attract customers.
 In addition, some of the current commercial banking customers
 may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for
 credit

22

Table of Contents 

facilities larger than we can accommodate. If we are unable to
 attract and retain customers, we may be unable to continue our
 loan and deposit growth, and our results of operations and
 financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted.

Additional
 market concern over investment securities backed by mortgage
 loans could create losses in the Company s investment
 portfolio 

A majority of the Company s investment portfolio is
 comprised of securities where mortgages are the underlying
 collateral. These securities include agency-guaranteed mortgage
 backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and
 triple AAA rated non- agency mortgage-backed securities and
 collateralized mortgage obligations. With the recent national
 downturn in real estate markets and the rising mortgage
 delinquency and foreclosure rates, investors are increasingly
 concerned about these types of securities. The potential for
 subsequent discounting, if continuing for a long period of time,
 could lead to permanent impairment in the value of these
 investments. This impairment could negatively impact earnings
 and the Company s capital position.

We may
 not be able to successfully implement our internal growth
 strategy. 

We have pursued and intend to continue to pursue an internal
 growth strategy, the success of which will depend primarily on
 generating an increasing level of loans and deposits at
 acceptable risk levels and terms without proportionate increases
 in non-interest expenses. There can be no assurance that we will
 be successful in implementing our internal growth strategy.
 Furthermore, the success of our growth strategy will depend on
 maintaining sufficient regulatory capital levels and on
 continued favorable economic conditions in our market areas.

There
 are risks associated with potential acquisitions. 

We may make opportunistic acquisitions of other banks or
 financial institutions from time to time that further our
 business strategy. These acquisitions could involve numerous
 risks including lower than expected performance or higher than
 expected costs, difficulties in the integration of operations,
 services, products and personnel, the diversion of
 management s attention from other business concerns,
 changes in relationships with customers and the potential loss
 of key employees. Any acquisitions will be subject to regulatory
 approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
 obtain such approvals. We may not be successful in identifying
 further acquisition candidates, integrating acquired
 institutions or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality
 deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for
 acquisitions in our market area is highly competitive, and we
 may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive
 terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
 completing future acquisitions, or if such transactions are
 completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired
 businesses into our operations. Our ability to grow may be
 limited if we are unable to successfully make future
 acquisitions.

We may
 not be able to replace key members of management or attract and
 retain qualified relationship managers in the
 future. 

We depend on the services of existing management to carry out
 our business and investment strategies. As we expand, we will
 need to continue to attract and retain additional management and
 other qualified staff. In particular, because we plan to
 continue to expand our locations, products and services, we will
 need to continue to attract and retain qualified commercial
 banking personnel and investment advisors. Competition for such
 personnel is significant in our geographic market areas. The
 loss of the services of any management personnel, or the
 inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the
 future, could have an adverse effect on our results of
 operations, financial conditions and prospects.

The
 allowance for loan losses may be inadequate. 

Our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the
 terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the payment of
 these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan
 balance. We therefore may experience significant loan losses,
 which could have a material adverse effect on our operating
 results.

23

Table of Contents 

We make various assumptions and judgments about the
 collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the
 creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real
 estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment
 of many of our loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our
 experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among
 other factors, in determining the amount of the allowance for
 loan losses. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our
 allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses
 inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our
 allowance. Increases in this allowance result in an expense for
 the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions or a
 decrease in asset quality, management determines that additional
 increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, we may
 incur additional expenses.

Our loans are primarily secured by real estate, including a
 concentration of properties located in northern, southwestern
 and southcentral Idaho, eastern Washington and southeastern
 Oregon. If an earthquake, volcanic eruption or other natural
 disaster were to occur in one of our major market areas, loan
 losses could occur that are not incorporated in the existing
 allowance for loan losses.

We are
 expanding our lending activities in riskier areas. 

We have identified commercial real estate and commercial
 business loans as areas for increased lending emphasis. While
 increased lending diversification is expected to increase
 interest income, non-residential loans carry greater historical
 risk of payment default than residential real estate loans. As
 the volume of these loans increase, credit risk increases. In
 the event of substantial borrower defaults, our provision for
 loan losses would increase and therefore, earnings would be
 reduced. As the Company lends in diversified areas such as
 commercial real estate, commercial, agricultural, real estate,
 commercial construction and residential construction, the
 Company may be incur additional risk if one lending area
 experienced difficulties due to economic conditions.

Our
 stock price can be volatile. 

Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of
 factors, including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly
 operating results, recommendations by securities analysts and
 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
 the financial services industry. Other factors include new
 technology used or services offered by our competitors,
 operating and stock price performance of other companies that
 investors deem comparable to us, and changes in government
 regulations.

General market fluctuations, industry factors and general
 economic and political conditions and events, such as future
 terrorist attacks and activities, economic slowdowns or
 recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, also
 could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our
 operating results.

MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
 conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
 thereto presented elsewhere in this report. This report contains
 forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
 Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of
 the risks and uncertainties inherent in such statements, see
 Business Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

The Company operates a multi-branch banking system and is
 executing plans for the formation and acquisition of banks and
 bank branches that can operate under a decentralized community
 bank structure. Based on opportunities available in the future,
 the Company plans expansion in markets generally located within
 the states where it currently operates or in contiguous states,
 including Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Montana, or in other
 areas that may provide significant opportunity for targeted
 customer growth. The Company is pursuing a balance of asset and
 earnings growth by focusing on increasing its market share in
 its present locations, expanding services sold to existing
 customers, building new branches and merging
 and/or 
 acquiring community banks that fit closely with the Bank s
 strategic direction.

The Company continues to make significant investments in human
 resources and technology to support its growth initiatives.
 Asset growth is expected to keep pace or exceed earnings growth
 over the next several years while the Company pursues its
 expansion and customer acquisition goals. Further, the Company
 continues to leverage its capital which, in addition to retained
 earnings, has been supplemented by two trust preferred
 debentures totaling approximately 16.5 million, and a
 12.0 million common stock offering in December 2005, both
 executed in anticipation of expansion into new markets.

Management and the Board of Directors remain committed to
 building a decentralized community banking organization and
 further increasing the level of service we provide our targeted
 customers and our communities. Our strategic plan calls for a
 balanced yet aggressive set of asset growth and shareholder
 return goals. We expect to achieve these goals by employing
 experienced, knowledgeable and dedicated people and supporting
 them with strong technology and training.

In September 2006, the Company acquired a small investment
 company with which it had maintained a close relationship for
 many years, and subsequently renamed the department,
 Intermountain Community Investment Services ICI ).
 This acquisition allows the Company to offer non-FDIC insured
 investment alternatives to its customers, including mutual
 funds, insurance, brokerage services and annuities.

In June 2005, the Company entered the Washington State market by
 opening a branch in Spokane Valley, Washington. This branch
 allowed the Company to enter into the eastern Washington banking
 market and to also better serve its existing customer base. It
 added a downtown Spokane location in April 2006 after the Bank
 was able to attract a seasoned team of commercial and private
 bankers. The Company now offers full service banking and
 residential and commercial lending from its Spokane Valley
 branch and Spokane downtown offices, which it operates under the
 name of Intermountain Community Bank Washington. In
 August 2007, the Spokane Valley branch was moved to a larger
 facility in a growing small business and retail area. It now
 also houses a mortgage loan center and some administrative
 offices.

In March 2006, the Company opened a branch in Kellogg, Idaho
 under the Panhandle State Bank name. In April 2006, the Company
 opened a branch in Fruitland, Idaho which operates as
 Intermountain Community Bank. In April 2006, the Company also
 opened a Trust Wealth Management division, and began
 offering these services to its customers. In September 2006, the
 Company opened a second branch in Twin Falls, Idaho, which
 operates as

31

Table of Contents 

Magic Valley Bank. These new branches and divisions allowed the
 Company to expand geographically and better serve its existing
 customer base.

In 2005, the Company relocated the Coeur d Alene branch and
 administrative office to a combined administrative and branch
 office building located on Neider Avenue between Highway 95 and
 Government Way in Coeur d Alene. This facility serves as
 our primary Coeur d Alene office and accommodates the Home
 Loan Center, our centralized real estate mortgage processing
 department, various administrative support departments and our
 SBA Loan Production Center. The SBA center was initiated in 2003
 to enhance the service, delivery and efficiency of the Small
 Business Administration lending process.

In August 2006, the Company began construction of a
 94,000 square foot financial and technical center office
 building in Sandpoint, Idaho. The Company plans to relocate both
 its Sandpoint main branch and headquarters to this building,
 with the Company occupying approximately 47,000 square
 feet. Pending regulatory approval, the Company anticipates
 moving into the facility during the second quarter of 2008.

The Company will continue its focus on expanding market share of
 targeted customers in its existing markets, and entering new
 markets in which it can attract and retain strong employees. It
 will also look for opportunities to acquire other community
 banks that believe in the strategy of community banking and
 desire to build on the Company s culture, employee capital,
 technology and operational efficiency. Based on the June 2007
 FDIC survey of banking institutions, the Company is the market
 share leader in deposits in five of the eleven counties in which
 it operates, and has experienced share growth in virtually all
 of its markets over the past year.

2007 represented a challenging year for the banking
 industry, as slowing economic growth combined with rising loan
 defaults, particularly in the real estate sector, to place
 pressure on bank earnings. Large banking institutions were also
 hurt by significant investment exposure to sub-prime and similar
 collateralized debt obligations. As delinquencies in the
 collateral underlying these investments increased and investors
 pulled money from the market, many large commercial and
 investment banks experienced significant write-downs.

While smaller banks did not generally have direct exposure to
 the subprime market, the effects of the subprime meltdown
 increased pressure on their local real estate loans, causing
 rising defaults and chargeoffs. As the Fed sought to control the
 situation by adding liquidity and lowering interest rates in the
 latter half of the year, many smaller banks also faced
 compression in their net interest margin, as they were unable to
 reprice liabilities as quickly as assets were repricing.

Worsening economic and real estate conditions are likely in
 2008, as the US economy continues to struggle with slower
 growth, a weak dollar, and higher inflation, particularly in gas
 and food prices, With this backdrop, the Federal Reserve is
 likely to continue to push short-term market rates down to spur
 higher economic growth.

The northwest economy in which the Company operates held up
 better than much of the rest of the nation in 2007, and is
 likely to do so again in 2008. Relatively strong exports,
 continued in-migration and lower-cost, business-friendly
 governments may help bolster these markets against some of the
 national difficulties. Still, the northwest economy is likely to
 feel the impacts in terms of slowing growth and rising prices.

In this environment, the most significant perceived risks to the
 Company are credit quality, interest rate risk,
 operational/execution risk, and human resources risk. Poor
 credit quality can create significant earnings, capital and
 liquidity pressures more quickly than other types of risk faced
 by the Bank. During 2007, the financial stability of the
 Company s customers weakened in response to the weakening
 national economy, although our local markets generally held up
 better.. Total loans receivable in 2007 increased 13.9 while
 our net loan charge-off rate increased to 0.26 of total loans
 from 0.06 in 2006. Non-accrual loans increased approximately
 4.4 million in 2007 to 0.74 of total loans. Loan
 delinquencies over
 30-days at
 fiscal year end 2007 increased to 0.40 at December 31,
 2007 from 0.24 at December 31, 2006. The delinquency
 ratios reflected strong collection efforts by the Company s
 officers, and trended with the increased non-accrual and loss
 percentages. Softening credit conditions and particularly a
 slowdown in the real estate sector of the economy placed
 additional pressure on the loan portfolio during 2007. The
 economic environment is expected to deteriorate further in 2008,
 creating more risk in the loan portfolio. Management is
 responding by actively managing its underwriting, monitoring and
 collection efforts.

32

Table of Contents 

Interest rate risk for the Company can create earnings and
 liquidity pressure as market rate changes may adversely impact
 net interest income and net earnings. To address this risk,
 management closely monitors changing market rate conditions and
 bank portfolios and responds accordingly through both portfolio
 mix and pricing decisions. In addition, the Company engages in
 certain hedging activities to protect itself against changes in
 market rates. Market rates were inverted through much of 2007,
 meaning that short-term rates were higher than longer-term
 rates. In this environment, it became more difficult to maintain
 the Company s net interest margin, because deposits
 continued to reprice upward as loan rates remained static. In
 the latter half of 2007 and early 2008, the Federal Reserve
 aggressively cut short-term target rates, leading to a
 significant decline in overall short-term market rates,
 including the Bank s prime lending rate. These movements
 are anticipated to create additional pressure on the
 Company s net interest margin, as loans reprice down more
 quickly than its deposit portfolio. Management anticipated these
 movements, and responded by repricing its deposit portfolio
 down, aggressively seeking lower-cost funding sources, including
 non-interest and low-interest bearing deposits, and engaging in
 additional hedging transactions to offset declining asset
 yields. The Company also actively employs a customer
 profitability system and pricing model to ensure that loans and
 deposits are priced appropriately.

The growth in the Bank has increased the risk of operational
 problems. These are being addressed through the recruitment and
 hiring of additional experienced staff in key administrative
 support positions, significant increases in our training budget
 and programs, implementation of new monitoring and control
 technology and the expansion of our internal compliance and
 audit staff.

In addressing human resources risk, management focuses a great
 deal of its efforts on developing a culture that promotes,
 retains and attracts high quality individuals. Our compensation
 and reward systems contribute directly to maintaining and
 enhancing this culture, and we encourage strong participation
 among all employees in establishing and implementing the
 bank s business plans.

Management believes that its efforts in managing these and other
 risks have been successful, but that continued diligence is
 required.

To summarize the Company s financial performance in 2007,
 net income increased 2.6 over 2006 while assets increased 14.0 
 over the same time period. The Company realized record net
 income of 9.4 million or 1.10 per share (diluted). This
 is a 2.8 increase in diluted earnings per share over the 2006
 figure of 1.07 per share (diluted). Return on average equity
 (ROAE) and return on average assets (ROAA), common measures of
 bank performance, totaled 11.3 and 0.96 , respectively,
 compared to 12.9 and 1.13 in 2006. Assets increased at a
 stronger pace than net income in 2007, which resulted in the
 decrease in ROAA for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net
 income increased only slightly in 2007, while equity increased
 due to the retention of net income and the reversal of an
 unrealized loss to an unrealized gain position on the investment
 portfolio.

In 2005 the Company successfully raised 12 million in
 equity capital through a common stock offering. In this common
 stock offering, the Company issued 705,882 common shares and
 added 11.9 million to stockholders equity. Other equity
 events over the past few years include 10 common stock
 dividends effective May 31, 2007, and May 31, 2006,
 and a
 3-for-2 
 stock split effective March 10, 2005. All per-share data
 computations are calculated after giving retroactive effect to
 stock dividends and stock splits.

Total assets reached 1.05 billion, a 14.0 increase from
 920.3 million at December 31, 2006. Net loans
 experienced 13.8 growth to 756.5 million at
 December 31, 2007 from 664.9 million at the end of
 2006. Total deposits grew from 693.7 million to
 757.8 million during 2007, representing a 9.3 increase.
 Both loans receivable and deposit growth reflect strong organic
 growth in the Bank s existing markets, as well as
 increasing contributions from the newer markets. Growth over the
 past four years has been largely driven by the Company s
 continued commitment to attracting, motivating and retaining
 high quality employees, maintaining high levels of customer
 service and community involvement, pursuing an aggressive branch
 expansion and acquisition plan and successful face-to-face
 business development efforts.

The Company s net interest margin for the year ended
 December 31, 2007 was 5.21 , as compared to 5.66 for 2006
 and 5.01 for 2005. A volatile interest rate environment, in
 which interest rates on interest-costing liabilities generally
 rose more than on interest earning assets during 2007 created
 the decrease in the Company s margin in 2007.

Net
 Interest Income 2007 Compared to 2006 

The Company s net interest income increased to
 46.5 million in 2007 from 42.0 million in 2006. The
 net interest income increase attributable to volume increases
 was a favorable 7.0 million over 2006 as average interest
 earning assets increased by 150.6 million and average
 interest costing liabilities increased by 137.8 million.
 During 2007, interest rates increased both on the interest
 earning assets and interest costing liabilities; however, rates
 increased more significantly on the liability side than the
 assets. This created a 2.5 million decrease attributable
 to rate variances. The separate volume and rate changes along
 with a 44,000 decrease due to the interplay between rate and
 volume factors created a 4.5 million overall increase in
 net interest income for 2007.

The yield on interest-earning assets increased 0.14 in 2007
 from 2006, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities
 increased 0.65 during the same period. At 0.09 , the loan yield
 increase was relatively modest over the prior year. The prime
 lending rate was stable during the first half of 2007, but was
 generally higher than during 2006. However, it dropped by 1.00 
 during the final four months of the year, resulting in a
 relatively small annual increase in the overall average loan
 yield. Approximately 64 of the Bank s loan portfolio is
 variable rate, so it responds relatively quickly to both rising
 and falling market rates. The Bank sought to moderate this
 impact by increasing the higher yielding commercial loan
 component of its loan portfolio and emphasizing more fixed rate
 loans in 2007.

The investment securities portfolio experienced an increase in
 yield of 0.63 as the Company extended the duration of its
 investment portfolio and bought higher-yielding securities to
 increase yield and offset some of the volatility in the loan
 portfolio yield.

The volatile interest rate environment also impacted the
 Company s interest-bearing liability costs. During the
 first eight months of 2007, market rates stabilized and deposit
 costs generally rose in response to market rate increases in
 2006. Over the final four months, market rates dropped
 significantly and liability costs began to decline, but at a
 slower rate than market rate and asset yield declines. As a
 result, the overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities
 increased by 0.65 during the year.

Net
 Interest Income 2006 Compared to 2005 

The Company s net interest income increased to
 42.0 million in 2006 from 30.9 million in 2005. The
 net interest income increase attributable to volume increases
 was a favorable 6.6 million over 2005 as interest earning
 assets increased by 125.5 million and interest costing
 liabilities increased by 110.4 million. During 2006,
 interest rates increased both on the interest earning assets and
 interest costing liabilities; however, rates increased more
 significantly on the asset side than the liabilities. This
 created a 3.5 million increase attributable to rate
 variances. The separate volume and rate increases along with a
 957,000 increase due to the interplay between rate and volume
 factors created an 11.1 million overall increase in net
 interest income for 2006.

37

Table of Contents 

The yield on interest-earning assets increased 1.27 in 2006
 versus 2005. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased
 0.79 . The loan yield increase of 1.23 represented the largest
 combined impact to net yield. The increase by 1.00 in the prime
 lending rate during 2006 directly affected the Bank s
 variable rate loan portfolio, which comprised approximately 63 
 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2006. The Bank
 has increased the higher yielding commercial loan component of
 the loan portfolio, which contributed to the increase in loan
 yield. The investment securities portfolio experienced an
 increase in yield of 0.92 as the Company swapped a number of
 lower yielding investment securities for higher yielding ones
 during the year. The yield on federal funds sold rose during
 2006 by 1.96 , which is in line with the short-term investment
 market. The increases in earning asset yields were partially
 offset by increases in the cost of interest-bearing sources of
 funding. The cost of other borrowings increased by 1.32 as the
 Bank partially funded loan and other asset growth with
 borrowings. This represented the most drastic rate change from
 2005. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 0.66 as
 the Bank raised interest rates on small certificate of deposits
 and money market accounts in a rising interest rate environment.
 The Company was generally asset-sensitive in 2006, resulting in
 improved net interest income during the year, as its earning
 assets repriced more quickly and to a higher degree than its
 interest costing liabilities.

Provision
 for Loan Losses 

Management continually evaluates allowances for estimated loan
 losses and based on this evaluation, charges a corresponding
 provision against income. While the Bank generally maintained
 its sound credit quality position in 2007, the softening economy
 and real estate downturn impacted its results. The allowance for
 loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable was 1.53 
 at December 31, 2007 and 1.46 at December 31, 2006.
 The provision for loan losses increased from 2.1 million
 in 2006 to 3.9 million in 2007. Net chargeoffs in 2007
 totaled 2.0 million versus only 347 thousand in 2006.
 Much of the additional net chargeoff volume consisted of
 write-downs on non-performing construction and land loans to
 lowered collateral values, as the Company reevaluated its
 collateral positions on its real estate portfolio. At
 December 31, 2007, the total allowance for loan losses was
 11.8 million compared to 9.8 million at the end of
 the prior year.

With the strong growth in the loan portfolio and its
 concentration in real estate loans, management continues to
 focus on enhancing its credit quality efforts by recruiting
 individuals with strong credit experience, providing additional
 training for our lending officers, and refining its credit
 approval, management and review process. During the year, the
 company also credit-shocked its real estate portfolio and
 revised its method of calculating its loan loss allowance, in
 line with new bank regulatory guidance issued in early 2007. The
 credit shock testing provided management with better information
 about the potential impact of different economic scenarios on
 the Company s real estate loan portfolio. The ALLL
 methodology change provides more detailed and granular
 information to management in its consideration of appropriate
 allowance levels. While both national and local credit markets
 experienced a downturn, the local economy remains relatively
 stable. Given local credit conditions and the stability of the
 bank s loan portfolio, management believes that the loan
 loss allowance is adequate at December 31, 2007.

Fees earned from loans sold and a variety of fees and service
 charges earned on deposit accounts continue to be the
 Bank s primary sources of other income. Fees and service
 charges increased significantly during 2007 as a result of
 increasing investment, trust, debit card and business services
 income during the year. The Trust division, established in 2006,
 picked up customer volume and grew to approximately
 48.5 million in assets under management at the end of
 2007. Intermountain Community Investments, purchased in
 September 2006, had a strong year in 2007, contributing over
 700,000 in fee income, and debit card activity expanded rapidly
 as customers continued to migrate to electronic banking.
 Increasing customer accounts, pricing changes on some services
 and stronger cross-selling activity also contributed to the
 improvement. The Company expects further growth in income from
 all of these sources in 2008 and future years.

Mortgage banking income, which had been expanding rapidly in
 prior years, slowed in 2007 as a result of the downturn in the
 real estate economy. 2008 is likely to remain a slow year, as
 residential real estate activity continues to soften. BOLI
 income reflected slightly higher yields in the BOLI portfolio,
 while the net loss on securities decreased significantly. In
 2006, the Company swapped some very low-yielding securities
 resulting in a significant loss, which was not repeated in 2007.
 The yield pickup from this investment swap offset the loss taken
 within nine months of the swap date. The other income
 subcategory largely consists of fees earned on the
 Company s contract to provide deposit accounts used to
 secure credit card portfolios. This program continued to expand
 volumes during the year, but at a slower pace than prior years,
 as national credit card activity slowed in 2007. The Company
 forecasts continued growth in this contract income, but at
 slower rates as the slower economy begins to weigh on credit
 card borrowing.

Overall, the Bank continues to rank near the top of its peer
 group in terms of other income as a percentage of average
 assets. To maintain this position and expand the percentage of
 revenue contributed by non-interest income, the Company will
 continue to aggressively seek account growth in its local
 markets, adjust pricing, cross-sell its investment, trust and
 business solutions, and seek further opportunities to diversify
 its non-interest income sources.

Similar to 2006 and 2005, salaries and employee benefits
 continued to be the majority of non-interest expense in 2007.
 The pace of growth in salaries and employee benefits expense
 slowed significantly in 2007, as compared to 2006 and 2005 as
 the Company did not expand into new markets or open new branches
 during the year.

The number of full-time equivalent employees (FTE) at the Bank
 grew in 2007, but at a slower pace than prior years. The Company
 added 35 net FTE in 2007, an 8 increase, versus 83, a 25 
 increase in 2006. The 2007 FTE growth resulted from expanding
 existing branches and increasing administrative staff to support
 growth and comply with increasing regulatory requirements. This
 increase in FTE, along with normal
 cost-of-living 
 and promotional increases added approximately 3.5 million
 to salary and benefits expense during the year. The bank s
 incentive plans, driven by a combination of asset growth, net
 income and return on equity, paid at a lower rate as the

39

Table of Contents 

Company s asset and income growth slowed and the return on
 equity worsened. Recruitment costs totaled 219 thousand in
 2007, down from 604,000 the year before. Stock based
 compensation expense decreased to 486,000 in 2007 from 848,000
 in 2006. Prior to the adoption of FAS123 (R) stock based
 compensation expense in 2005 totaled 79,000. Benefits costs
 continued to rise, however as health insurance premiums
 increased.

As the economy shifts, the Company expects to further stabilize
 its staffing levels in 2008 and pursue its short-term objectives
 through the retention and motivation of its existing
 high-quality staff. The rate of personnel expense growth is
 expected to decline further as the company implements cost
 saving strategies, including revising business processes to more
 effectively utilize existing bank staff. However, benefits
 expenses are expected to increase at a rate higher than salary
 expenses as health insurance premiums continue to rise.

The 2006 personnel expense and FTE growth resulted from
 expanding existing branches and opening new branches in
 Fruitland, Kellogg, Twin Falls and downtown Spokane during the
 year. In addition, the Company established the Trust and Wealth
 Management division, purchased Intermountain Community
 Investments, and added administrative staff to support the
 company growth and comply with increased regulatory requirements
 related to lending compliance, the US Patriot Act and the
 Sarbanes Oxley Act. The 2006 increase also reflects introduction
 of new incentive compensation plans and changes in accounting
 for stock option expense resulting from the introduction of
 FAS123 (R), which required the expensing of stock options for
 the first time in 2006.

Consistent with the Company s growth strategy, occupancy
 and equipment expense grew significantly in 2007 and 2006. The
 expense increase was primarily caused by the full-year effect of
 operational costs of the branches and divisions opened in 2006.
 It also reflects increasing technology expense, as the Bank
 continues to improve its infrastructure to support growth,
 security and product development initiatives. This expense is
 anticipated to increase again in 2008 as the Company completes
 and moves into the Sandpoint Center, but it will mitigate some
 of this impact by reducing its lease expense and implementing
 cost saving measures in other areas.

Public relations and advertising expense totaled
 1.3 million for 2007, a 13 increase over the
 1.2 million expense in 2006. Continued market development,
 the need to market in more geographic areas and new target
 marketing initiatives caused the increases over 2006 and 2005.
 Management expects costs to remain stable in this category in
 2008 as the Bank anticipates improving the efficiency of its
 marketing efforts during the year.

The increase in fees and service charges during 2007 was caused
 primarily by increasing volumes of business and the entry into
 new product lines where third party vendors were required. In
 addition, the Bank chose to pay service fees to its
 correspondent banks and sweep balances into interest-bearing
 accounts, rather than maintaining sufficient balances in
 non-interest bearing accounts to offset correspondent banking
 fees. We expect moderation in this area, as efficiencies allow
 us to spread our vendor costs, and new technology initiatives
 reduce some of our volume-related expenses. Printing, postage
 and supplies remained stable from 2006 to 2007 as the Company
 controlled costs in this area. It is expected that this expense
 will remain stable in 2008.

Legal and accounting expense decreased in 2007 as the Company
 reduced expenditures on Sarbanes Oxley compliance and legal fees
 on the collection of problem loans. In 2006, the Company
 incurred substantial additional accounting expense to comply
 with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley for
 the first time, as well as other new accounting regulations. The
 Company also incurred significant legal expense to collect a
 large loan in southern Idaho, some of which is anticipated to be
 recovered in 2008. It is anticipated that legal and accounting
 expense will moderate in 2008, but at a slower pace as the
 Company continues its compliance with Sarbanes Oxley and other
 legal, regulatory and accounting pronouncements.

Other expenses decreased in 2007, as the Company trimmed
 expenses in training, travel, professional consulting,
 telecommunications and other operational expenses during the
 year. It also experienced lower operational losses than in the
 prior year. This category is expected to be stable for 2008, as
 the Company continues to focus on cost-saving initiatives.

Cost management is a more critical priority for management in
 2008, as the economy slows and credit losses potentially
 increase. While 2006 presented unique growth opportunities and
 challenges, management began actively targeting higher
 efficiency as a significant goal in 2007 and expects to continue
 this focus in 2008. It will seek to leverage the investments
 made over the past couple years in personnel, compensation
 systems, fixed assets, training and marketing expenses to
 generate additional growth without corresponding increases in
 these expenses.

In 2008, it will also engage in significant business process
 revisions to improve workflows, efficiency and the quality of
 the customer experience. As a result, it will be centralizing
 certain processes and employing additional technology to slow
 the growth in salary and other expenses.

Financial
 Position 

Assets increased by 128.3 million or 14 during 2007. This
 increase was driven largely by organic growth in the loans
 receivable portfolio, particularly commercial loans. Loans
 receivable increased by 91.7 million or 14 compared to
 2006. Continued strong loan demand in both new and existing
 markets and continued progress on relationship banking
 initiatives within the Bank created the significant increase in
 2007.

Assets increased in 2006 by 186.2 million, or 25 . This
 increase primarily resulted from organic loan growth of
 109.4 million, or 20 over 2005, as well as expansion in
 the investment portfolio. Loan and asset growth is expected to
 moderate in 2008, as local economies respond to the slowdown in
 the national economy, and particularly in the real estate
 sector. Growth rates in the Company s market areas,
 however, are anticipated to exceed national growth rates.

Investments in available for sale securities increased by 34 
 from 2006, totaling 158.8 million at December 31,
 2007, compared to 118.5 million at December 31, 2006.
 Available for sale investments increased to 15 of total assets
 compared to 13 for the previous year.
 Held-to-maturity 
 investments also increased, from 6.7 million in 2006 to
 11.3 million in 2007. Management expanded the investment
 portfolio again in 2007 to improve its interest rate risk
 position, particularly in a down-rate environment. Management
 continues to manage the investment portfolio to achieve
 reasonable yield and manage interest rate risk exposure, while
 maintaining the liquidity necessary to support the rapidly
 growing loan portfolio. Changes in the investment portfolio
 along with changes in market rates converted an unrealized loss
 of 111,000 in the investment portfolio at the end of 2006 into
 an unrealized gain of 1.3 million at the end of 2007. The
 Company also drew its Fed Funds Sold position down by
 28.8 million during 2007 and reinvested the funds in the
 higher-yielding loan portfolio.

Office properties and equipment increased 16.6 million or
 65 at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31,
 2006. Continued construction on the new Sandpoint headquarters
 building and the new Spokane Valley office produced much of the
 increase. Investment in additional technology also added to the
 change. It is anticipated that the total construction and land
 cost of the Sandpoint building will be approximately
 24.4 million. The Company currently plans to sell the
 building upon completion and full occupancy in late 2008. It
 will then lease back the branch and headquarters space. After
 2008, occupancy expense is expected to moderate, as the
 Company s future growth initiatives will likely involve
 fewer fixed asset expenditures.

Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to
 12.4 million at December 31, 2007, from
 12.5 million at December 31, 2006. The Company had
 goodwill and core deposit intangible assets of approximately
 10.9 million related to the November 2004 Snake River
 acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets of
 approximately 1.9 million as a result of the January 2003
 purchase of the Ontario branch of Household FSB. The September
 2006 purchase of a small investment company, Premier Alliance,
 added 263,000 in goodwill to this total in 2006. No new
 acquisitions occurred in 2007. Goodwill and other intangible
 assets equaled 1.2 of total assets at December 31, 2007.
 The decrease in the balance of goodwill and other intangible
 assets in 2007 relates to the amortization of the core deposit
 intangibles related to the Snake River acquisition and the
 Household FSB purchase.

To fund the asset growth, liabilities increased by
 116.3 million, or 14 over 2006. Most of the increase was
 in traditional customer deposits, which grew 64.2 million
 or 9 from 2006 balances. The increase in deposits was split
 between non-interest bearing deposit accounts
 17.5 million growth), NOW and money market accounts
 17.5 million growth), and certificates of deposit
 24.1 million growth) from the previous year. Over the
 last several years, strong penetration in our existing markets
 and rapid growth in new branches have combined with market
 forces, including volatile equity markets, to produce the
 increases. Declining interest rates and increasing competition
 from other banks who are facing significant funding pressures
 will create additional challenges in growing deposits in 2008.
 To combat this, the Bank is specifically targeting customers and
 expanding in areas with high deposit concentrations, changing
 compensation structures to encourage branch staff to seek
 deposit growth, and providing additional training, target
 marketing and technology support for our staff. Management will
 also emphasize new product development and the use of other
 funding alternatives.

Deposits as of December 31, 2006 increased by
 96.2 million over December 31, 2005, or 16 . NOW and
 money market accounts grew 75.4 million, or 35 from
 December 31, 2005. Demand deposit accounts increased
 9.2 million over December 31, 2005, or 7 . Savings
 and IRA accounts increased by 8.2 million from
 December 31, 2005, or 11 .

Repurchase agreements increased 17.9 million, or 17 as
 the Bank utilized repurchase agreements to partially fund the
 strong loan and investment growth that occurred during 2007.
 Much of the growth in 2007 was used to fund the Company s
 purchase of certain investment securities to protect against
 lower market rates. The Bank continues to rely on repurchase
 agreements as an alternate source of funding to support its
 asset growth. The 24 million increase in Federal Home Loan
 Bank advances was also used to fund the Company s
 investment transactions. The 64 increase over 2006 in other
 borrowings to 37.0 million reflects the use of a credit
 line to fund construction of the Sandpoint Center. The
 outstanding balance of this credit line at December 31,
 2007 was 19.5 million.

Total shareholders equity increased by 12.0 million
 from 78.1 million at December 31, 2006 to
 90.1 million at December 31, 2007. This increase is
 due to the retention of the Company s earnings and the
 after-tax increase in the market value of the
 available-for-sale 
 investment portfolio. Total shares outstanding increased to
 8.2 million shares. Total shareholders equity grew by
 13.8 million from 64.3 million at December 31,
 2005 to 78.1 million at December 31, 2006. This
 increase was due primarily to the retention of the
 Company s earnings. Both the Bank s and the
 Company s regulatory capital ratios remain well above the
 percentages required by the FDIC to qualify as a well
 capitalized institution. Management is closely monitoring
 current capital levels in line with its long-term capital plan
 to maintain sufficient protection against risk and provide
 flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities.

Capital 

Capital is the shareholders investment in the Company.
 Capital grows through the retention of earnings, the issuance of
 new stock, and through the exercise of stock options. Capital
 formation allows the Company to grow assets and provides
 flexibility and protection in times of adversity. Total equity
 on December 31, 2007 was 8.6 of total assets. The largest
 component of equity is common stock representing 85 of total
 equity. Retained earnings amount to 13 and the remaining 2 is
 accumulated other comprehensive income.

Banking regulations require the Company to maintain minimum
 levels of capital. The Company manages its capital to maintain a
 well capitalized designation (the FDIC s
 highest rating). Regulatory capital calculations include some of
 the trust preferred securities as a component of capital. At
 December 31, 2007, the Company s Total capital to risk
 weighted assets was 11.61 , compared to 11.62 at
 December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, the
 Company s Tier I capital to risk weighted assets was
 10.36 , compared to 10.37 at December 31, 2006. At
 December 31, 2007, the Company s Tier I capital
 to average assets was 8.90 , compared to 9.13 at
 December 31, 2006. The decrease in these capital ratios at
 December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 is
 primarily a result of asset growth outpacing the growth of
 equity during 2007. It is anticipated that in the future, the
 Company will build capital through the retention of earnings and
 other sources. To be categorized as well capitalized, an
 institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I
 risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios of 10 , 6 , and 5 ,
 respectively. Based on the established regulatory ratios, the
 Company continues to maintain a well-capitalized 
 designation.

In February 2005, the Company approved a
 3-for-2 
 stock split, payable on March 15, 2005 to shareholders of
 record on March 10, 2005. In December 2005, the Company
 successfully completed a 12.0 million common stock
 offering to its existing shareholders and customers. This
 resulted in the issuance of an additional 705,882 shares of
 common stock. In April 2006, the Company approved a 10 stock
 dividend to all shareholders of record as of May 15, 2006.
 In April 2007, the Company approved an additional 10 stock
 dividend to all shareholders of record as of May 15, 2007.

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the term used to define the Company s ability
 to meet its financial commitments. The Company maintains
 sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both
 lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds. The Company
 derives liquidity primarily through core deposit growth,
 repurchase agreements and other borrowing arrangements, loan
 payments and the maturity of investment securities.

At December 31, 2007, the
 available-for-sale 
 investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains in the amount of
 2.2 million, compared to 183,000 at December 31,
 2006. Management believes that all unrealized losses as of
 December 31, 2007 and 2006 are market driven, with no
 permanent sector or issuer credit concerns or impairments.

Core deposits include demand, interest checking, money market,
 savings, and local time deposits. Additional liquidity and
 funding sources are provided through the sale of loans, sales of
 securities, access to national certificate of deposit
 (CD) markets, and both secured and unsecured borrowings.

Core deposits, (total deposits less public deposits and brokered
 certificates of deposit), at December 31, 2007 were 95.7 
 of total deposits, compared to 97.1 at December 31, 2006.
 During 2007, the Company experienced a 45.3 million or
 6.7 increase in its core deposit base. Deposit growth of
 64 million lagged loan growth of 87 million in 2007,
 but was offset by strong increases in repurchase agreements and
 the use of a large Federal Funds Sold position at the beginning
 of 2007. As a result, the Company did not significantly utilize
 other higher-cost funding sources, such as wholesale
 certificates of deposit and other borrowings. In the future,
 management anticipates continued competition for deposits which
 will require stronger core deposit-gathering efforts and the use
 of other funding alternatives. The company utilized other
 repurchase agreements, wholesale certificates of deposit and
 Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the year to purchase
 additional investment securities that would provide interest
 rate risk protection in a declining rate environment.

Overnight-unsecured borrowing lines have been established at US
 Bank, Wells Fargo, Pacific Coast Bankers Bank the Federal Home
 Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of
 San Francisco. At December 31, 2007, the Company had
 approximately 50.0 million of overnight funding available
 from its unsecured sources and no overnight fed funds borrowed.
 In addition, 2 to 5 million in funding is available on a
 semiannual basis from the State of Idaho in the form of
 negotiated certificates of deposit. In March 2007, the Company
 entered into an additional borrowing agreement with Pacific
 Coast Bankers Bank in the amount of 18.0 million, with the
 amount being increased to 25.0 million in December 2007.
 The borrowing agreement is a revolving line of credit with a
 variable rate of interest tied to LIBOR and is being used to
 support construction of the new Sandpoint headquarters facility.
 Management has also sold whole loans or participated portions of
 loans with other lenders as an additional source of liquidity.

While asset growth is expected to moderate in 2008, the
 competitive environment for deposits continues to be difficult
 in the short-term. As a result, management may utilize these
 alternative funding sources to a greater extent in 2008. As
 such, management is improving its access to these sources and
 upgrading its asset and liability management process, expertise
 and technology to effectively control potential future risks in
 this area.

Related
 Party Transactions 

The Bank has executed certain loans and deposits with its
 directors, officers and their affiliates. All loans and deposits
 made are in conformance with regulatory requirements for banks
 and on substantially the same terms and conditions as other
 similarly qualified borrowers. The aggregate amount of loans
 outstanding to such related parties at December 31, 2007
 and 2006 was approximately 1,024,000 and 638,000, respectively.

Directors fees of approximately 296,000, 314,000, and
 310,000 were paid during the years ended December 31,
 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Two of the Company s Board of Directors are principals in
 law firms that provide legal services to Intermountain. During
 the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 the
 Company incurred legal fees of approximately 9,000, 11,000,
 and 7,000, respectively, related to services provided by these
 firms.

Two directors of Intermountain who joined the boards of
 Intermountain and Panhandle State Bank in connection with the
 Snake River Bancorp, Inc. acquisition and one former employee of
 Magic Valley Bank, who is now an employee of the Company, are
 all members of a partnership which owned the branch office
 building of Magic Valley Bank in Twin Falls, Idaho. The lease
 requires monthly rent of 13,165 and expires on
 February 28, 2018. The Company has an option to renew the
 lease for three consecutive five-year terms at current market
 rates. In connection with the Snake River Bancorp acquisition,
 the lease was amended to grant the Company a two-year option to
 acquire the property for 2.5 million. In December 2006,
 the Company sold the option to acquire the property to an
 unrelated party and executed a lease agreement to lease the
 building. The property was sold in January 2007 and the lease
 commenced in January 2007.

Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements 

The Company, in the conduct of ordinary business operations
 routinely enters into contracts for services. These contracts
 may require payment for services to be provided in the future
 and may also contain penalty clauses for the early termination
 of the contracts. The Company is also party to financial
 instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of
 business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
 financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and
 standby letters of credit. Management does not believe that
 these off-balance sheet arrangements have a material current
 effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in
 financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
 operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
 resources, but there is no assurance that such arrangements will
 not have a future effect. See Note 14 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation 

Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Company
 are monetary. Therefore, inflation has a less significant impact
 on the Company than does fluctuation in market interest rates.
 Inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses
 and may be a contributor to interest rate changes, both of which
 may impact net earnings. During the last two years, inflation,
 as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has not increased
 significantly, although current inflationary trends are higher.
 The effects of inflation have not had a material impact on the
 Company.

Critical
 Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and
 to general practices within the banking industry. The
 preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
 affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
 accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
 estimates. The Company s management has identified the
 accounting policies described below as those that, due to the
 judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies,
 are critical to an understanding of the Company s
 Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations.

Income Recognition. The Company recognizes
 interest income by methods that conform to general accounting
 practices within the banking industry. In the event management
 believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest
 on a loan has become doubtful, which generally occurs after the
 loan is 90 days past due, the

45

Table of Contents 

Company discontinues the accrual of interest and any previously
 accrued interest recognized in income deemed uncollectible is
 reversed. Interest received on nonperforming loans is included
 in income only if recovery of the principal is reasonably
 assured. A nonperforming loan is restored to accrual status when
 it is brought current or when brought to 90 days or less
 delinquent, has performed in accordance with contractual terms
 for a reasonable period of time, and the collectibility of the
 total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

Allowance For Loan Losses. In general,
 determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires
 significant judgment and the use of estimates by management.
 This analysis is designed to determine an appropriate level and
 allocation of the allowance for losses among loan types and loan
 classifications by considering factors affecting loan losses,
 including: specific losses; levels and trends in impaired and
 nonperforming loans; historical bank and industry loan loss
 experience; current national and local economic conditions;
 volume, growth and composition of the portfolio; regulatory
 guidance; and other relevant factors. Management monitors the
 loan portfolio to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance. The
 allowance can increase or decrease based upon the results of
 management s analysis.

The amount of the allowance for the various loan types
 represents management s estimate of probable incurred
 losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio based upon
 historical bank and industry loan loss experience for each loan
 type. The allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans
 usually is based on the fair value of the collateral for certain
 collateral dependent loans. This evaluation requires management
 to make estimates of the value of the collateral and any
 associated holding and selling costs.

Individual loan reviews are based upon specific quantitative and
 qualitative criteria, including the size of the loan, loan
 quality classifications, value of collateral, repayment ability
 of borrowers, and historical experience factors. The historical
 experience factors utilized are based upon past loss experience,
 trends in losses and delinquencies, the growth of loans in
 particular markets and industries, and known changes in economic
 conditions in the particular lending markets. Allowances for
 homogeneous loans (such as residential mortgage loans, personal
 loans, etc.) are collectively evaluated based upon historical
 bank and industry loan loss experience, trends in losses and
 delinquencies, growth of loans in particular markets, and known
 changes in economic conditions in each particular lending
 market. The Allowance for Loan Losses is presented to the Audit
 Committee for review.

Management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate
 at December 31, 2007. While management uses available
 information to provide for loan losses, the ultimate
 collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio
 and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based
 on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors. A
 slowdown in economic activity could adversely affect cash flows
 for both commercial and individual borrowers, as a result of
 which the Company could experience increases in nonperforming
 assets, delinquencies and losses on loans.

A reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level
 that, in the opinion of management, is adequate to absorb
 probable losses associated with the Bank s commitment to
 lend funds under existing agreements such as letters or lines of
 credit. Management determines the adequacy of the reserve for
 unfunded commitments based upon reviews of individual credit
 facilities, current economic conditions, the risk
 characteristics of the various categories of commitments and
 other relevant factors. The reserve is based on estimates, and
 ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. These
 estimates are evaluated on a regular basis and, as adjustments
 become necessary, they are recognized in earnings in the periods
 in which they become known through charges to other non-interest
 expense. Draws on unfunded commitments that are considered
 uncollectible at the time funds are advanced are charged to the
 reserve for unfunded commitments. Provisions for unfunded
 commitment losses, and recoveries on commitment advances
 previously charged-off, are added to the reserve for unfunded
 commitments, which is included in the Other Liabilities section
 of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Investments. Assets in the investment
 portfolios are initially recorded at cost, which includes any
 premiums and discounts. The Company amortizes premiums and
 discounts as an adjustment to interest income using the interest
 yield method over the term of the security. The cost of
 investment securities sold, and any resulting gain or loss, is
 based on the specific identification method.

Management determines the appropriate classification of
 investment securities at the time of purchase.
 Held-to-maturity 
 securities are those securities that the Company has the
 positive intent and ability to hold to

46

Table of Contents 

maturity, and are recorded at amortized cost.
 Available-for-sale 
 securities are those securities that would be available to be
 sold in the future in response to liquidity needs, changes in
 market interest rates, and asset-liability management
 strategies, among others.
 Available-for-sale 
 securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized holding
 gains and losses that are considered to be temporary reported in
 shareholders equity as a separate component of other
 comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income taxes.

Management evaluates investment securities for other than
 temporary declines in fair value on a periodic basis. If the
 fair value of investment securities falls below their amortized
 cost and the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the
 securities will be written down to current market value and the
 write down will be deducted from earnings. There were no
 investment securities which management identified to be
 other-than-temporarily 
 impaired for the year ended December 31, 2007. Charges to
 income could occur in future periods due to a change in
 management s intent to hold the investments to maturity, a
 change in management s assessment of credit risk, or a
 change in regulatory or accounting requirements.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill
 arising from business combinations represents the value
 attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the
 business acquired. The Company s goodwill relates to value
 inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon
 the Company s ability to provide quality, cost-effective
 services in a competitive market place. As such, goodwill value
 is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume
 of business transacted. A decline in earnings as a result of a
 lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective
 services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of
 goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.
 Goodwill is not amortized, but is subjected to impairment
 analysis at least annually. The last impairment analysis was
 performed in December 2007. No impairment was considered
 necessary during the year ended December 31, 2007. However,
 future events could cause management to conclude that the
 Company s goodwill is impaired, which would result in the
 Company recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment
 loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company s
 financial condition and results of operations.

Other intangible assets consisting of core-deposit intangibles
 with definite lives are amortized over the estimated life of the
 acquired depositor relationships. These intangible assets are
 also subject to impairment analysis. No impairment was
 considered necessary during the year ended December 31,
 2007.

Real Estate Owned (REO). Property acquired
 through foreclosure of defaulted mortgage loans is carried at
 the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell.
 Development and improvement costs relating to the property are
 capitalized to the extent they are deemed to be recoverable.

An allowance for losses on REO is designed to include amounts
 for estimated losses as a result of impairment in value of the
 real property after repossession. The Company reviews its REO
 for impairment in value whenever events or circumstances
 indicate that the carrying value of the property may not be
 recoverable. In performing the review, if expected future
 undiscounted cash flows from the use of the property or the fair
 value, less selling costs, from the disposition of the property
 are less than its carrying value, an allowance for loss is
 recognized. As a result of changes in the real estate markets in
 which these properties are located, it is reasonably possible
 that the carrying values could be reduced in the near term.

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R),
 Business Combinations SFAS No. 141
 (R) ). SFAS No. 141 (R) establishes principles
 and requirements for how the acquirer: 1) recognizes and
 measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
 acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
 interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures the
 goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
 bargain purchase; 3) determines what information to
 disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
 the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
 SFAS No. 141 (R) applies prospectively to
 business combinations entered into by the Company after
 January 1, 2009. The Company intends to continue to pursue
 a long term growth strategy, which may include acquiring other
 financial institutions. As such, SFAS No. 141 (R) may
 have a material effect on the Company, mainly in regards to the
 valuation of loans, and the treatment for acquisition costs.

In November 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
 Bulletin 109 SAB 109 regarding the
 valuation of loan commitments. SAB 109 supersedes
 SAB 105, and states that in measuring the fair value of a
 derivative loan commitment, the expected net future cash flows
 related to the associated servicing of the loan should be
 included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that
 are accounted for at fair value through earnings. SAB 109
 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008.
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
 SAB 109 on future periods.

In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The
 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
 Liabilities SFAS No. 159 ).
 SFAS No. 159 provides a fair value measurement
 election for many financial instruments, on an instrument by
 instrument basis. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for
 the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently
 evaluating whether to make the SFAS No. 159 fair value
 election on any of its financial instruments.

In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force
 EITF reached a consensus on Issue
 No. 06-4, 
 Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
 Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
 Arrangements. EITF Issue
 No. 06-4 
 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008.
 The Company has evaluated the impact of EITF Issue
 No. 06-4 
 on future periods and has determined the amount to be immaterial.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
 Fair Value Measurements 
 SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157
 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
 value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
 SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company as of
 January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the
 impact of this standard and does not expect
 SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its
 consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A. 

QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest
 Rate Sensitivity Management 

The largest component of the Company s earnings is net
 interest income, which can fluctuate widely when interest rate
 movements occur. The Bank s management is responsible for
 minimizing the Company s exposure to interest rate risk.
 This is accomplished by developing objectives, goals and
 strategies designed to enhance profitability and performance,
 while managing risk within specified control parameters. The
 ongoing management of the Company s interest rate
 sensitivity limits interest rate risk by controlling the mix and
 maturity of assets and liabilities. Management continually
 reviews the Bank s position and evaluates alternative
 sources and uses of funds. This includes any changes in external
 factors. Various methods are used to achieve and maintain the
 desired rate sensitive position, including the sale or purchase
 of assets and product pricing.

The Company views any asset or liability which matures, or is
 subject to repricing within one year to be interest sensitive
 even though an analysis is performed for all other time
 intervals as well. The difference between interest-sensitive
 assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a defined period
 of time is known as the interest sensitivity gap ,
 and may be either positive or negative. When the gap is
 positive, interest sensitive assets reprice quicker than
 interest sensitive liabilities. When negative, the reverse
 occurs. Non-interest assets and liabilities have been positioned
 based on management s evaluation of the general sensitivity
 of these balances to migrate into rate-sensitive products. This
 analysis provides a general measure of interest rate risk but
 does not address complexities such as prepayment risk, basis
 risk and the Bank s customer responses to interest rate
 changes.

At December 31, 2007, the Company s one-year interest
 sensitive gap is negative 299.4 million, or negative
 28.55 which falls within the risk tolerance levels established
 by the Company s Board. The current gap position indicates
 that if interest rates were to change and affect assets and
 liabilities equally, rising rates would decrease the Bank s
 net interest income. The reverse is true when rates fall. The
 primary cause for the negative gap is the large block of
 deposits with no stated maturity, including NOW, money market
 and savings accounts that can be repriced at any time. However,
 changes in rates offered on these types of deposits tend to lag
 changes in market interest rates, thereby potentially reducing
 or eliminating the impact of the negative gap position. As such,
 this measure is only a small part of a larger Interest Rate Risk
 assessment or analysis.

The Asset/Liability Management Committee of the Company also
 periodically reviews the results of a detailed and dynamic
 simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net
 interest income (NII) and the estimated economic value of the
 Company to changes in interest rates. The simulation model,
 which has been compared to and validated with an independent
 third-party model, illustrates the estimated impact of changing
 interest rates on the interest income received and interest
 expense paid on all interest bearing assets and liabilities
 reflected on the Company s statement of financial
 condition. This interest sensitivity analysis is compared to
 policy limits for risk tolerance levels of net interest income
 exposure over a one-year time horizon, given a 300 and
 100 basis point movement in interest rates. Trends in
 out-of-tolerance 
 conditions are then addressed by the committee, resulting in the
 implementation of strategic management intervention designed to
 bring interest rate risk within policy targets. A parallel shift
 in interest rates over a one-year period is assumed as a
 benchmark, with reasonable assumptions made regarding the timing
 and extent to which each interest-bearing asset and liability
 responds to the changes in market rates. The original
 assumptions were made based on industry averages and the
 company s own experience, and have been modified based on
 the company s continuing analysis of its actual versus
 expected performance, and after consultations with an outside
 consultant. The following table represents the estimated
 sensitivity of the Company s net interest income as of
 December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the established
 policy limits:

12 Month Cumulative effect on NII 

Policy Limit 

12-31-07 

12-31-06 

+ 100bp

+ 8.0 to - 8.0

1.81

300bp

+ 15.0 to -15.0

17.8

6.28

The model results for both years fall within the risk tolerance
 guidelines established by the committee, with the exception of
 the minus 300 basis point scenario in 2007. Given that
 market rates have declined 2.25 over the past six months,
 management considers an additional 3.0 drop highly unlikely.

REPORT OF
 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Intermountain Community Bancorp

Sandpoint, Idaho

We have audited Intermountain Community Bancorp s
 Company internal control over financial reporting
 as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
 Commission (the COSO criteria). Intermountain Community
 Bancorp s management is responsible for maintaining
 effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
 assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
 financial reporting, included in the accompanying
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
 Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
 company s internal control over financial reporting based
 on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
 over financial reporting was maintained in all material
 respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
 internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
 that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
 design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
 the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
 procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
 believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
 opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
 process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
 reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
 financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those
 policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
 company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
 statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
 are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
 management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
 unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
 company s assets that could have a material effect on the
 financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
 financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
 Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
 periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
 inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
 of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Intermountain Community Bancorp maintained, in
 all material respects, effective internal control over financial
 reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
 criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
 consolidated balance sheets of Intermountain Community Bancorp
 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
 consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes
 in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
 three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and our
 report dated March 17, 2008, expressed an unqualified
 opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Intermountain Community Bancorp

Sandpoint, Idaho

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
 Intermountain Community Bancorp as of December 31, 2007 and
 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income,
 comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and
 cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
 December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
 responsibility of the Company s management. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
 statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
 free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
 test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
 the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
 used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
 evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
 believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
 opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
 to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
 position of Intermountain Community Bancorp at December 31,
 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash
 flows for each of the three years in the period ended
 December 31, 2007 , in conformity with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
 statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based
 Payment , as of January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
 Intermountain Community Bancorp s internal control over
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
 criteria established in Internal Control 
 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
 Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report
 dated March 17, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion
 thereon.

 COMMUNITY BANCORP 

SUMMARY
 OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Organization 

Intermountain Community Bancorp Intermountain or
 the Company is a financial holding company whose
 principal activity is the ownership and management of its wholly
 owned subsidiary, Panhandle State Bank the Bank ).
 The Bank is a state chartered commercial bank under the laws of
 the state of Idaho. At December 31, 2007, the Bank had
 eight branch offices in northern Idaho, five in southwestern
 Idaho, three in southcentral Idaho, two branches in eastern
 Washington and one branch in eastern Oregon operating under the
 names of Panhandle State Bank, Intermountain Community Bank and
 Magic Valley Bank. It also had a loan production office
 operating under the name Intermountain Community Bank in
 southwestern Idaho.

Intermountain provides customized quality financial services and
 banking products to its customers through experienced, highly
 trained staff who are long-time residents of its local markets.
 Intermountain believes this philosophy has allowed it to grow
 rapidly in its market areas. With 1.05 billion in total
 assets as of December 31, 2007, Intermountain originates
 loans and attracts Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
 FDIC insured deposits from the general public
 through 19 branches and one loan production office located in
 Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. In addition, Intermountain also
 markets trust and wealth management services through its
 Trust Division and fixed income and equity products, mutual
 funds, fixed and variable annuities and other financial products
 through Intermountain Community Investments.

Principles
 of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
 accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All
 significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
 eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and
 Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents are any highly liquid debt instruments with a
 remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of
 purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are on deposit with other
 banks and financial institutions in amounts that periodically
 exceed the federal insurance limit. Intermountain evaluates the
 credit quality of these banks and financial institutions to
 mitigate its credit risk.

Restricted
 Cash 

Restricted cash represents the required reserve balances
 maintained to comply with Federal Reserve Bank requirements.

Investments 

Intermountain classifies debt and equity investments as follows:

Available-for-Sale. Debt and equity
 investments that will be held for indefinite periods of time are
 classified as available-for-sale and are carried at market
 value. Market value is determined using published quotes or
 other indicators of value as of the close of business.
 Unrealized gains and losses that are considered temporary are
 reported, net of deferred income taxes, as a component of
 accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in
 stockholders equity until realized.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle
 Stock. Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Seattle stock may only be redeemed by FHLB Seattle or sold to
 another member institution at par. Therefore, this investment is
 carried at cost.

Held-to-Maturity. Investments in debt
 securities that management has the intent and ability to hold
 until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are
 carried at their remaining unpaid principal balance, net of
 unamortized premiums or unaccreted discounts.

F-10

Table of Contents 

INTERMOUNTAIN
 COMMUNITY BANCORP 

SUMMARY
 OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using the
 level-interest-yield method over the estimated remaining term of
 the underlying security. Realized gains and losses on sales of
 investments and mortgage-backed securities are recognized in the
 statement of income in the period sold using the specific
 identification method.

Loans
 Held for Sale 

Loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market
 are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net
 unrealized losses are recognized through a valuation allowance
 by charges to income. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans
 are recognized based on the differences between the selling
 price and the carrying value of the mortgage loans sold.

The Company records a transfer of financial assets as a sale
 when it surrenders control over those financial assets to the
 extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the
 transferred assets is received in exchange. The Company
 considers control surrendered when all conditions prescribed by
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
 Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities are
 met. Those conditions focus on whether the transferred assets
 are isolated beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors,
 the constraints on the transferee or beneficial interest
 holders, and the Company s rights or obligations to
 reacquire transferred financial assets.

Loans
 Receivable 

Loans receivable that management of Intermountain has the intent
 and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity
 or pay-off are reported at their outstanding principal balance
 less any unearned income, premiums or discounts and an
 associated allowance for losses on loans. Unearned income
 includes deferred loan origination fees reduced by loan
 origination costs.

Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current
 information and events, it is probable the Bank will be unable
 to collect all amounts as scheduled under the contractual terms
 of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the
 present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
 loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the
 collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Changes in
 these values are reflected in income through charges to the
 provision for loan losses.

Interest income is recognized over the term of the loans
 receivable based on the unpaid principal balance. The accrual of
 interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in
 management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to make
 payments as they become due. When interest accrual is
 discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest
 income is then subsequently recognized only to the extent cash
 payments are received in excess of principal due.

Allowance
 for Losses on Loans 

The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are
 estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses
 charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the
 allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a
 loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are
 credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is
 evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon
 management s periodic review of the collectibility of the
 loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume
 of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the
 borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any
 underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This
 evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates
 that are susceptible to significant revision as more information
 becomes available.

A reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level
 that, in the opinion of management, is adequate to absorb
 probable losses associated with the Bank s commitment to
 lend funds under existing agreements such as letters or lines of
 credit. Management determines the adequacy of the reserve for
 unfunded commitments based upon reviews of individual credit
 facilities, current economic conditions, the risk
 characteristics of the various

F-11

Table of Contents 

INTERMOUNTAIN
 COMMUNITY BANCORP 

SUMMARY
 OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

categories of commitments and other relevant factors. The
 reserve is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from
 the current estimates. These estimates are evaluated on a
 regular basis and, as adjustments become necessary, they are
 recognized in earnings in the periods in which they become known
 through charges to other non-interest expense. Draws on unfunded
 commitments that are considered uncollectible at the time funds
 are advanced are charged to the reserve for unfunded
 commitments. Provisions for unfunded commitment losses, and
 recoveries on commitment advances previously charged-off, are
 added to the reserve for unfunded commitments, which is included
 in the Other Liabilities section of the Consolidated Statements
 of Financial Condition.

Loan
 Origination and Commitment Fees 

Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are
 deferred and recognized as interest income using the level
 interest yield method over the contractual term of each loan
 adjusted for actual loan prepayment experience.

Loan commitment fees are deferred until the expiration of the
 commitment period unless management believes there is a remote
 likelihood that the underlying commitment will be exercised, in
 which case the fees are amortized to fee income using the
 straight-line method over the commitment period. If a loan
 commitment is exercised, the deferred commitment fee is
 accounted for in the same manner as a loan origination fee.
 Deferred commitment fees associated with expired commitments are
 recognized as fee income.

Other
 Real Estate Owned 

Properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure of
 defaulted real estate loans are carried at the lower of cost or
 fair value (less estimated costs to sell). Development and
 improvement costs related to the property are capitalized to the
 extent they are deemed to be recoverable. Subsequent to
 foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and the
 assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
 less costs to sell. Expenses for maintenance and changes in the
 valuation are charged to earnings. Other real estate owned is
 included with prepaid expenses and other assets on the
 consolidated balance sheet.

Office
 Properties and Equipment 

Office properties and equipment are carried at cost less
 accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
 straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
 assets, ranging from two to thirty years. Expenditures for new
 properties and equipment and major renewals or betterments are
 capitalized. In the case where the Company constructs a facility
 and the construction period is lengthy, interest expense will be
 capitalized and added to the cost of the facility. Expenditures
 for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
 Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated
 depreciation are removed from the respective property or
 equipment accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are
 reflected in operations.

Bank-Owned
 Life Insurance 

Bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) is carried at the initial
 premium paid for the policies plus the increase in the cash
 surrender value.

Goodwill
 and Other Intangibles 

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
 Other Intangible Assets , goodwill and intangible assets
 with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to
 impairment tests at least annually. Intangible assets with
 finite lives, including core deposit intangibles, are amortized
 over the estimated life of the depositor relationships acquired.

SUMMARY
 OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Advertising
 and Promotion 

The Company expenses all costs associated with its advertising
 and promotional efforts as incurred. Those costs are included
 with operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income.

Income
 Taxes 

Intermountain accounts for income taxes using the liability
 method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
 be determined based on the temporary differences between the
 financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and
 liabilities and tax attributes using enacted tax rates in effect
 in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to
 reverse.

Earnings
 Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
 the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
 the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
 net income by the weighted average number of common shares
 outstanding increased by the additional common shares that would
 have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares
 had been issued.

Equity
 Compensation Plans 

The Company maintains an Equity Participation Plan under which
 the Company has granted non-qualified and incentive stock
 options and restricted stock to employees and non-employee
 directors. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
 FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based
 Payments , using the modified prospective method, and the
 fair value recognition provision of the Transition
 Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
 Share-Based Payment Awards FSP 123R) ).
 Using the alternative transition method, the Company elected to
 adopt the alternative transition method provided in
 FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
 compensation. The alternative transition method includes
 simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the
 additional-paid-in-capital pool APIC pool related
 to the tax effects of stock-based compensation, and for
 determining the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
 consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
 stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon
 adoption of SFAS 123 (R).

Prior to 2006, the Company applied the disclosure-only provision
 of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
 Disclosure. The Company measured compensation cost for
 stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
 value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principals
 Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
 for Stock Issued to Employees. All of the stock options
 are granted at market value on the date of grant. Accordingly,
 no compensation expense was recognized in 2005 for options
 related to the stock option plan. Restricted stock grants,
 however, are subject to a five-year vesting period, and the fair
 values on issuance date of these grants were expensed on a
 straight line basis over the life of the grant.

Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
 America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
 and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are
 particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term
 relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses,
 valuation of investments, deferred tax assets and liabilities
 and valuation and recoverability of goodwill and intangible
 assets.

SUMMARY
 OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Business
 Combinations 

Pursuant to SFAS No. 141 Business
 Combinations , Intermountain s mergers and
 acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of
 accounting. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the
 acquired entities are recorded by Intermountain at their
 respective fair values at the date of the acquisition and the
 results of operations are included with those of Intermountain
 commencing with the date of acquisition. The excess of the
 purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets,
 is recorded as goodwill.

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts in the 2006 financial statements have been
 reclassified to conform with the current year s
 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on total
 stockholders equity or net income as previously reported.

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R),
 Business Combinations SFAS No. 141
 (R) ). SFAS No. 141 (R) establishes principles
 and requirements for how the acquirer: 1) recognizes and
 measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
 acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
 interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures the
 goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
 bargain purchase; 3) determines what information to
 disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
 the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
 SFAS No. 141 (R) applies prospectively to
 business combinations entered into by the Company after
 January 1, 2009. The Company intends to continue to pursue
 a long term growth strategy, which may include acquiring other
 financial institutions. As such, SFAS No. 141 (R) may
 have a material effect on the Company, mainly in regards to the
 valuation of loans, and the treatment for acquisition costs.

In November 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
 Bulletin 109 SAB 109 regarding the
 valuation of loan commitments. SAB 109 supersedes
 SAB 105, and states that in measuring the fair value of a
 derivative loan commitment, the expected net future cash flows
 related to the associated servicing of the loan should be
 included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that
 are accounted for at fair value through earnings. SAB 109
 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008.
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
 SAB 109 on future periods.

In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The
 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
 Liabilities SFAS No. 159 ).
 SFAS No. 159 provides a fair value measurement
 election for many financial instruments, on an instrument by
 instrument basis. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for
 the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently
 evaluating whether to make the SFAS No. 159 fair value
 election on any of its financial instruments.

In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force
 EITF reached a consensus on Issue
 No. 06-4, 
 Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
 Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
 Arrangements. EITF Issue
 No. 06-4 
 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008.
 The Company has evaluated the impact of EITF Issue
 No. 06-4 
 on future periods and has determined the amount to be immaterial.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
 Fair Value Measurements 
 SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157
 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
 value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
 SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company as of
 January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the
 impact of this standard and does not expect
 SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its
 consolidated financial statements.

As required by bank regulatory guidance issued in 2007, the
 allowance for unfunded commitments was removed from the
 allowance for loan loss and reclassified to other liabilities.
 This change had a small impact on the consolidated balance
 sheets, increasing 2007 and 2006 net loans receivable and
 other liabilities by 18,000 and 482,000 respectively.

Loans that are not performing in accordance with their original
 contractual terms at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were
 approximately 6,366,000 and 1,288,000, respectively. The total
 allowance for losses related to these loans at December 31,
 2007 and 2006 was 585,000 and 534,000, respectively.

For loans on non-accrual status, interest income of
 approximately 270,000, 230,000, and 8,000 was recorded for
 the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
 respectively. If these non-accrual loans had

performed in accordance with their original contract terms,
 additional income of approximately 161,000, 21,000, and
 95,000 would have been recorded for the years ended
 December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

The Company s investment in impaired loans for
 December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was 6,492,000
 and 4,762,000, respectively. The Company s investment in
 other real estate owned for December 31, 2007 and
 December 31, 2006 was 1,682,000 and 795,000, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, the contractual principal payments

Securities
 Sold Subject To Repurchase Agreements 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are
 classified as secured borrowings, generally are short-term
 agreements. These agreements are treated as financing
 transactions and the obligations to repurchase securities sold
 are reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial
 statements. The dollar amount of securities underlying the
 agreements remains in the applicable asset account. These
 agreements have a weighted average interest rate of 4.69 and
 5.03 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 Approximately 94.1 million of the repurchase agreements
 mature on a daily basis, while the remaining balance of
 30.0 million has a variable interest rate of 5.87 and
 matures in July 2011. The interest rate reindexes quarterly and
 is based on 90 Day LIBOR. At December 31, 2007 and
 2006, the Company pledged as collateral, certain investment
 securities with aggregate amortized costs of 120.8 million
 and 118.2 million, respectively. These investments
 securities had market values of 122.2 million and
 118.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
 respectively.

Advances
 From Federal Home Loan Bank 

During June of 2003 the Bank obtained an advance from the
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB Seattle) in the amount
 of 5,000,000. The note is due in 2008 with interest only
 payable monthly at 2.71 . During September 2007, the Bank
 obtained two advances from the FHLB Seattle in the amounts of
 10,000,000 and 14,000,000 with interest payable at 4.96 and
 4.90 and maturities in September 2010 and September 2009,
 respectively.

Advances from FHLB Seattle are collateralized by certain
 qualifying loans with a carrying value of approximately
 29,000,000 at December 31, 2007. The Bank s credit
 line with FHLB Seattle is limited to a percentage of its total
 regulatory assets subject to collateralization requirements. At
 December 31, 2007, Intermountain had the ability to borrow
 an additional 59,477,000 from FHLB Seattle. Intermountain would
 be able to borrow amounts in excess of this total from the FHLB
 Seattle with the placement of additional available collateral.

Other
 Borrowings 

In January 2003, the Company issued 8.0 million of

 interest only paid quarterly starting in June 2003. The debt is
 callable by the Company in March 2008 and matures in March 2033.

In March 2004, the Company issued 8.0 million of

 90 day LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offering Rate) index plus
 2.8 and matures in April 2034. The rate on this borrowing was
 8.04 at December 31, 2007.

Overnight-unsecured borrowing lines have been established at US
 Bank, Wells Fargo, Pacific Coast Bankers Bank, the Federal Home
 Loan Bank of Seattle and with the Federal Reserve Bank of
 San Francisco. At December 31, 2007, the Company had
 approximately 50.0 million of overnight funding available

In March 2007, the Company entered into an additional borrowing
 agreement with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank in the amount of
 18.0 million which was raised to 25.0 million in
 December 2007. The borrowing agreement is a revolving line of
 credit with a variable rate of interest tied to LIBOR with a
 maturity of January 18, 2009. The collateral for the credit
 line is all of the Bank stock and the Sandpoint Center, which is
 currently under construction. Under the restrictive covenants of
 this borrowing agreement, Intermountain cannot incur additional
 debt over 5.0 million without Pacific Coast Bankers
 Bank s consent, and Intermountain is obligated to provide
 information regarding the loan portfolio on a regular basis. At
 December 31, 2007, the balance outstanding was 19,488,000
 at 6.73 .

In January 2006, the Company purchased land to build the
 94,000 square foot Sandpoint Center in Sandpoint, Idaho. It

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 FIN No. 48 ). This pronouncement requires
 a certain methodology for measuring and reporting uncertain tax
 positions, as well as disclosures regarding such tax positions.
 FIN No. 48 became effective for Intermountain as of
 January 1, 2007. Intermountain has performed an analysis of
 its uncertain tax positions and has not recorded any potential
 penalties, interest or additional tax in its financial
 statements as of December 31, 2007. Intermountain s
 tax positions for the years 2003 through 2006 remain subject to
 review by the Internal Revenue Service. Intermountain does not
 expect unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within
 the next twelve months.

Stock-Based
 Compensation Plans 

On August 18, 1999, the shareholders of Intermountain
 approved two stock option plans, one for certain key employees
 of the Bank (the 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan) and another
 for the Directors of Intermountain (the Director Stock Option
 Plan). The 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan replaced a
 10-year plan
 that expired in February 1998.

In December 2003, the Board of Directors amended the 1999
 Employee Stock Option Plan to provide for 291,100 shares of
 common stock in Intermountain to be granted as either qualified
 or nonqualified incentive stock options at a price not less than
 the greater of (1) the fair market value of the common
 stock, or (2) the net book value of the common stock at the
 time of the grant. Additionally, if the grant is an incentive
 option to an employee owning 10 percent or more of common
 stock, then the issue price cannot be less than 110 percent
 of the fair market value of the common stock at the time of
 issue. These options vest over a period up to five years and
 expire in 10 years.

At a shareholder meeting held on December 17, 2003,
 amendments were approved to allow the issuance of restricted
 shares and to increase the number of shares allocated to the
 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan to 582,200

 STATEMENTS (Continued) 

subject to a
 2-for-1 
 stock split which was effective December 29, 2003. Under
 the amended 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan, 185,166 options
 remain available for grant as either stock options or restricted
 shares as of December 31, 2007.

The Directors Stock Option Plan was adopted to provide
 incentives to Directors of Intermountain thereby helping to
 attract and retain the best available individuals for positions
 as directors of the corporation. In April 2005, the plan was
 amended to allow for the issuance of restricted shares. The plan
 provides for a total of 161,051 common stock options at a price
 not less than the greater of (1) the fair market value of
 the common stock, or (2) the net book value of the common
 stock at the time of the grant. These options vest over a
 five-year term and expire in 10 years. At December 31,
 2007, 62,233 options remain available for grant as either stock
 options or restricted shares under this Plan.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company granted restricted stock
 to its directors and employees from the Director Option Plan and
 the 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan. These restricted stock
 grants vest evenly over a five-year period. The Company did not
 grant stock options during 2007, 2006 or 2005.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the
 date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
 Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
 estimating the fair value of options. In addition, option
 valuation models require the input of highly subjective
 assumptions, particularly for the expected term and stock price
 volatility. The employee stock options do not trade on a
 secondary exchange, therefore employees do not derive a benefit
 from holding stock options unless there is an appreciation in
 the market price of the stock above the grant price. Such an
 increase in stock price would benefit all shareholders
 commensurately. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value
 of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to
 reflect market conditions and our experience. The fair value of
 each restricted share is based on the fair market value at the
 date of grant. The Company records compensation expense based on
 the determined fair value.

Prior to 2006, we adopted disclosure-only provisions of
 SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
 Disclosure . The company chose to measure compensation cost
 for stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
 value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion
 No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees .
 All stock options were granted at market value on the date of
 grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in
 2005 for options related to the stock option plans. The company
 adopted the provisions of SFAS 123 (R), Share Based Payment
 on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method
 of adoption.

Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
 consolidated statement of operations for the years ended
 December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 486,000 and 848,000 before
 income taxes, respectively. Of the total stock-based
 compensation expense during the years ended December 31,
 2007 and 2006, stock option expense was 196,000 and 141,000,
 restricted stock expense was 244,000 and 661,000 and other
 expense related to stock options issued below market price at
 issue date totaled 46,000 and 46,000, respectively. The
 Company has approximately 135,000 remaining to expense related
 to the non-vested stock options outstanding at December 31,
 2007. This expense will be recorded over a weighted average
 remaining period of 12 months.

 No. 00-15, 
 Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income

 as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows, on
 a prospective basis. This amount is shown as Excess tax
 benefit from stock-based compensation on the consolidated
 statement of cash flows.

Stockholders 
 Equity 

On May 31, 2007 and 2006, Intermountain distributed a Board
 of Directors approved 10 stock dividend to shareholders of
 record on May 15, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Effective December 1, 2005, Intermountain completed a
 12.0 million common stock offering, issued
 705,882 shares of common stock and added 11.9 million
 to stockholders equity.

On April 30, 2005, at the annual meeting of shareholders of
 Intermountain Community Bancorp, shareholders approved
 increasing the number of authorized common shares of stock from
 7,084,000 to 24,000,000. This subsequently increased to
 26,400,000 shares upon the declaration of the stock
 dividend, effective May 31, 2006, and to 29,040,000 upon
 the declaration of the stock dividend, effective May 31,
 2007.

As of February 24, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
 3-for-2 
 stock split which was effective March 10, 2005.
 Intermountain issued 1,914,809 common shares, net of fractional

Regulatory
 Matters 

The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of
 dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval.
 At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately
 9.4 million and 9.2 million of retained earnings
 were available for dividend declaration without prior regulatory
 approval.

The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject
 to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state
 and federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
 requirements can initiate

F-28

NOTES TO
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS (Continued) 

certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions
 by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct, material
 effect on the Company s financial statements.

Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
 for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet
 specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures
 of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items
 as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital
 amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative
 judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings
 and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure
 capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain
 minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital to
 risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average
 assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2007, that
 the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements
 to which it is subject.

As of December 31, 2007, the most recent notification from
 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and
 the State of Idaho Department of Finance categorized the Company
 and the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework
 for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well
 capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total
 risk-based, Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage
 ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no
 conditions or events since that notification that management
 believes have changed the Company s or the Bank s
 category.

The following table sets forth the amounts and ratios regarding
 actual and minimum core Tier 1 risk-based and total
 risk-based capital requirements, together with the amounts and
 ratios required in order to meet the definition of a
 well-capitalized institution (in thousands). For all

Commitments
 and Contingent Liabilities 

The Company is engaged in lending activities with borrowers in a
 variety of industries. A substantial portion of lending is
 concentrated in the regions in which the Company is located.
 Collateral on loans, loan commitments and standby letters of
 credit vary and may include accounts receivable, inventories,
 investment securities, real estate, equipment and vehicles. The
 amount and nature of collateral required is based on credit
 evaluations of the individual customers.

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with
 off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet
 the financing needs of its banking customers. These financial
 instruments generally include commitments to extend credit,
 credit card arrangements, standby letters of credit and
 financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to varying
 degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of
 the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The
 contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of
 involvement the Bank has in particular classes of financial
 instruments.

The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of
 nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument
 for commitments to extend credit, credit card arrangements,
 standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is
 represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The
 Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and
 conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet
 instruments.

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
 representing credit risk at December 31, 2007, were as
 follows (in thousands):

Commitments to extend credit

171,482

Credit card arrangements

10,272

Standby letters of credit

11,803

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
 customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
 established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
 expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
 payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
 expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
 not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby
 letters of credit typically expire during the next
 12 months.

Intermountain leases office space and equipment. As of
 December 31, 2007, future minimum payments under all of the
 Company s non-cancelable operating leases that have initial
 terms in excess of one year are due as follow (in thousands):

 lease obligations outlined above include lease obligations for
 the Canyon Rim and Gooding branches in the amount of 112,500
 per year and 63,750 per year, respectively. Intermountain owned
 these buildings and executed a purchase and sale agreement to
 sell these buildings in December 2006. Intermountain also
 executed lease agreements in December 2006 which became
 effective in January 2007 to lease the same buildings. The
 sale-leaseback agreements do not require any

future commitments, obligations, provisions or circumstances
 that would require or result in the Company s continuing
 involvement.

At December 31, 2007, Intermountain had an outstanding
 commitment to fund the completion of the Sandpoint Center
 totaling 4.0 million. The Company expects to pay this
 amount within 2008 as the Sandpoint Center is completed.

Employee
 Benefits Plans 

The Company sponsors a 401(k) profit sharing plan covering
 employees meeting minimum eligibility requirements. Employee
 contributions are voluntary, and the Company may make elective
 contributions to match up to 50 of the employee s
 contribution up to 8 of eligible compensation. The
 Company s contributions to the plan for the years ended
 December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 totaled approximately
 589,000, 410,000, and 310,000, respectively.

During 2003, the Company entered into a split dollar life
 insurance agreement on behalf of certain key executives. The
 policies were fully funded at purchase. The Company and the
 employee s estate are co-beneficiaries, with each receiving
 a certain amount upon death of the employee. Also, as a result
 of the Snake River Bancorp, Inc. acquisition in November 2004,
 the Company also assumed a split dollar life insurance agreement
 with Snake River directors and key executives.

The Company has various compensation plans for employees.
 Contributions to the plan are at the discretion of the Board of
 Directors. Deferred compensation expense for the plans described
 below for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
 was approximately 3,251,000, 3,961,000, and 2,890,000,
 respectively. These various compensation plans are discussed in
 detail below.

The Company has annual incentive plans for key employees.
 Amounts are paid annually within 75 days after each year
 end. The accrued balance at December 31, 2007 and 2006 for
 these plans was approximately 2,558,000 and 2,874,000,
 respectively.

In 2003, the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement
 Plan SERP ). The SERP is a non-qualified unfunded
 plan designed to provide retirement benefits for two key
 employees of Intermountain. Participants will receive
 approximately 258,620 in annual payments for 10 years
 beginning at normal retirement age. Retirement benefits vest
 after ten years of continued service and benefits are reduced
 for early retirement. The disability benefit is similar to the
 reduced benefit for early retirement without any vesting
 requirements. The plan provides for a change in control benefit
 if, within one year of a change in control, the
 participant s employment is terminated. Total amount
 accrued under the plan as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
 was approximately 254,000 and 190,000, respectively.

In April 2006, the Company implemented a long-term executive
 incentive plan, based on long-term corporate goals, to provide
 compensation in the form of stock grants to key executive
 officers. Participants are required to remain employed through
 the vesting period to receive any accrued benefits under the
 plan. For this stock-based compensation plan, the total
 adjustment to equity per SFAS 123 (R) at December 31,
 2007 was 597,000 and the compensation expense recorded for the
 year ended December 31, 2007 was 66,000.

The Company approved stock purchase agreements for certain key
 officers. Participants must remain employed to receive payments
 annually in December. The total amount paid under these
 agreements for 2007 and 2006 was approximately 562,000 and
 500,000, respectively. Approximately 2,057,000 remained
 available to be awarded at December 31, 2007.

16. 

Interest
 Rate Risk 

The results of operations for financial institutions may be
 materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing
 economic conditions, including rapid changes in interest rates,
 declines in real estate market values and the monetary and
 fiscal policies of the federal government. Like all financial
 institutions, Intermountain s net interest income and its
 NPV (the net present value of financial assets, liabilities and
 off-balance sheet contracts) are subject to fluctuations in
 interest rates. Currently, Intermountain s interest-
 earning assets, consisting primarily of loans receivable and
 investments, mature or reprice more rapidly, or on different
 terms, than do its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting
 primarily of deposits. The fact that assets mature or reprice
 more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in
 times of rising interest rates; however, such an asset/liability
 structure may result in declining net interest income during
 periods of falling interest rates. The use of the Bank s
 pricing strategies, along with other asset-liability strategies,
 helps to mitigate the negative impact in a falling interest rate
 environment.

To minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on net
 interest income, Intermountain promotes a loan pricing policy
 consisting of both fixed and variable rate structures. Deposit
 pricing strategies are also employed to help distribute funding
 repricing between both short and long term sources.
 Additionally, Intermountain maintains an asset and liability
 management program intended to manage net interest income
 through interest rate cycles and to protect its NPV by
 controlling its exposure to changing interest rates.

Intermountain uses an internal simulation model designed to
 measure the sensitivity of net interest income, net income and
 NPV to changes in interest rates. This simulation model is
 designed to enable Intermountain to generate a forecast of net
 interest income, net income and NPV given various interest rate
 forecasts and alternative strategies. The model also is designed
 to measure the anticipated impact that prepayment risk, basis
 risk, customer maturity preferences, volumes of new business and
 changes in the relationship between long and short-term interest
 rates have on the performance of Intermountain. Validation of
 this model is achieved through backtesting and the use of a
 third party model. Consultants from this vendor run an
 independent model which is then used to compare and validate
 internal results as well as providing critical information for
 asset-liability decision making.

Another monitoring tool used by Intermountain to assess interest
 rate risk is gap analysis. The matching of repricing
 characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by
 examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are
 interest sensitive and by monitoring
 Intermountain s interest sensitivity gap. 
 Management is aware of the sources of interest rate risk and
 endeavors to actively monitor and manage its interest rate risk
 although there can be no assurance regarding the management of
 interest rate risk in future periods.

Related-Party
 Transactions 

The Bank has executed certain loans and deposits with its
 directors, officers and their affiliates. Related party loans
 and deposits are transacted as part of the Company s normal
 course of business, and are not subject to preferential terms or
 conditions. The aggregate amount of loans outstanding to such
 related parties at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
 approximately 1,244,000 and 638,000, respectively.

During the year, the balance of loans outstanding to directors
 and executive officers changed as follows (dollars in thousands):

Two of the Company s Board of Directors are principals in
 law firms that provide legal services to Intermountain. During
 the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 the
 Company incurred legal fees of approximately 9,000, 11,000,
 and 7,000, respectively, related to services provided by these
 firms.

Two directors of Intermountain who joined the boards of
 Intermountain and Panhandle State Bank in connection with the
 Snake River Bancorp, Inc. acquisition and two former employees
 of Magic Valley Bank, who are now employees of the Company, are
 all members of a partnership which owned the branch office
 building of Magic Valley Bank in Twin Falls, Idaho. The lease
 requires monthly rent of 13,165 and expires on
 February 28, 2018. The Company has an option to renew the
 lease for three consecutive five-year terms at current market
 rates. In connection with the Snake River Bancorp acquisition,
 the lease was amended to grant the Company a two-year option to
 acquire the property for 2.5 million. In December 2006,
 the Company sold the option to acquire the property to an
 unrelated party and executed a lease agreement to lease the
 building. The property was sold in January 2007 and the lease
 commenced in January 2007.

18. 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair value estimates are determined as of a specific date in
 time utilizing quoted market prices, where available, or various
 assumptions and estimates. As the assumptions underlying these
 estimates change, the fair value of the financial instruments
 will change. The use of assumptions and various valuation
 techniques will likely reduce the comparability of fair value
 disclosures between financial institutions. Accordingly, the
 aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent and
 should not be construed to represent the full underlying value
 of Intermountain.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
 each class of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash,
 Cash Equivalents, Federal Funds and Certificates of
 Deposit 

The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, federal funds sold
 and certificates of deposit approximates fair value due to the
 relatively short-term nature of these instruments.

Investments
 and BOLI 

The fair value of investments is based on quoted market prices.
 If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
 on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. The fair
 value of BOLI is equal to the cash surrender value of the life
 insurance policies.

Loans
 Receivable and Loans Held For Sale 

The fair value of performing mortgage loans, commercial real
 estate construction, permanent financing, consumer and
 commercial loans is estimated by discounting the cash flows
 using interest rates that consider the interest rate risk
 inherent in the loans and current economic and lending
 conditions. Non-accrual loans are assumed to be carried at their
 current fair value and therefore are not adjusted.

Deposits 

The fair values for deposits subject to immediate withdrawal
 such as interest and non-interest bearing checking, savings and
 money market deposit accounts, are discounted using market rates
 for replacement dollars and using industry statistics for
 decay/maturity dates. The carrying amounts for variable-rate
 certificates of deposit and other time deposits approximate
 their fair value at the reporting date. Fair values for
 fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated by discounting
 future cash flows using interest rates currently offered on time
 deposits with similar remaining maturities.

INTERMOUNTAIN
 COMMUNITY BANCORP 

NOTES TO
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Borrowings 

The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings under repurchase
 agreements approximate their fair values due to the relatively
 short period of time between the origination of the instruments
 and their expected payment. The fair value of long-term FHLB
 Seattle advances and other long-term borrowings is estimated
 using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company s
 current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
 borrowing arrangements with similar remaining terms.

Accrued
 Interest 

The carrying amounts of accrued interest payable and receivable
 approximate their fair value.

The estimated fair value of the financial instruments as of
 December 31, 2007 and 2006, are as follows (in thousands):

This Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of Bancorp s Second Amended and Restated
Employee Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the Plan ). Such terms and conditions are
incorporated herein by this reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and condition of the Plan
shall govern.

1. 
 
 Award of Shares 

a. 
 
 General . In connection with a Restricted Stock Award (as defined in
the Plan), Bancorp grants to the Grantee the number of shares of Bancorp s Common Stock
identified above (the Shares ). 

b. 
 
 Conditions to Award of Shares . As a condition precedent to Bancorp s
obligation to award shares under paragraph 1.a, the Grantee shall deliver to Bancorp,
within thirty (30) days following the Date of Grant, (i) an original of this Agreement
duly executed by the Grantee, and (ii) the aggregate Purchase Price, if any, in cash or
cash equivalent. In the event the Grantee fails to make such delivery(ies), then the
rights and obligations of Bancorp and the Grantee hereunder shall terminate without the
need for further action by any party, and Bancorp and the Grantee shall have no further
rights or obligations with respect to the Restricted Stock Award described in paragraph
1.a. 

c. 
 
 Issuance of Shares and Delivery of Certificates . Concurrently with the
payment by the Grantee of the aggregate Purchase Price, if any, as described in
paragraph 1.b, Bancorp shall issue the Shares to the Grantee. As provided in paragraph
3, all certificates representing the Shares so issued shall be held in escrow by the
Secretary of Bancorp. 

1 

d. 
 
 Cash Dividends . Any cash dividends with respect to Unvested Shares
(defined below) will be held by Bancorp (unsegregated and as part of its general
assets) until the Unvested Shares have vested, and will be paid over to the Grantee as
soon as the vesting period is completed with respect to the Shares. Prior to the date
of vesting, cash dividends related to Unvested Shares will be held in escrow by Bancorp
and will be subject to forfeiture, as described in paragraph 2.a., with respect to the
Unvested Shares. 

e. 
 
 Stock Dividends or Splits . Whenever Unvested Shares become vested
pursuant to paragraph 1.g and are released to the Grantee, a number of Shares equal to
the amount of shares issued in the event of stock dividends and splits between the
Grant Date and the date of vesting shall also be issued to the Grantee. Prior to the
date of vesting, shares related to stock dividends or splits will be held in escrow by
Bancorp and will be subject to forfeiture or Bancorp s Repurchase Right (defined
below), as the case may be, with respect to the Unvested Shares. 

f. 
 
 Rights Upon Issuance of Shares . Until such time as Bancorp exercises
its Repurchase Right with respect to Unvested Shares or such Shares are forfeited, as
the case may be, and subject to any restrictions contained in the Plan or this
Agreement, the Grantee (or his or her successor in interest) shall have the voting
rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares, including Unvested Shares. 

g. 
 
 Vesting Schedule . The Shares shall vest as provided in the vesting
schedule set forth below. In no event shall any portion of the Shares vest after the
Grantee first ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee (as defined in the
Plan), unless the vesting of such shares is accelerated as described in paragraph 7.a.
That portion of the Shares that is not vested at the time that the Grantee first ceases

The number of Shares that vest each year, resulting from multiplying the
original number of Shares by the percentage shown, shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole number, but the total number of Shares that vest over the entire
vesting period shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the total number of Shares
identified in this Agreement above. 

2. 
 
 Forfeiture and Repurchase Right 

a. 
 
 Forfeiture . With respect to any Shares for which the Purchase Price is
not applicable (i.e. the Purchase Price is 0.00), any Unvested Shares (and related
cash dividends and Shares related to stock dividends or stock splits) will be forfeited
by the Grantee on the date on which Grantee, for any reason, first ceases to maintain
Continuous Status as an Employee, unless the vesting of such shares is accelerated as
described in paragraph 7.a. 

b. 
 
 Repurchase Right . With respect to any Shares for which a Purchase
Price is specified, and notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Bancorp shall have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase all
or any portion of the Unvested Shares (the Repurchase Right at the Purchase Price
originally paid by the Grantee for such Unvested Shares. Such Repurchase Right shall
be exercisable at any time during the ninety (90) day period that immediately follows
the date on which Grantee, for any reason, first ceases to maintain Continuous Status
as an Employee, unless the vesting of such shares is accelerated as described in
paragraph 7.a. 

c. 
 
 Exercise of Repurchase Right . If Bancorp elects to exercise the
Repurchase Right for all or any portion of the Unvested Shares, it shall do so by
delivering a written notice of exercise to the Grantee prior to the expiration of the
ninety (90) day period described in paragraph 2.b. Such notice shall specify the
number of Unvested Shares that Bancorp will repurchase and the date on which the
repurchase is to be effected, which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after
the date of the notice. To the extent that one or more certificates
representing Unvested Shares may have been previously delivered out of escrow to the
Grantee, the Grantee shall, prior to the close of business on the date 

3 

specified for
the repurchase, deliver to the Secretary of Bancorp the certificates representing
the Unvested Shares to be repurchased, each certificate to be properly endorsed for
transfer. Bancorp shall, concurrently with the receipt of such stock certificates
(either from escrow or from the Grantee as herein provided), pay to the Grantee, in
cash or cash equivalents, an amount equal to the Purchase Price originally paid by
the Grantee for the Unvested Shares that Bancorp elects to repurchase. If Bancorp
does not elect to exercise the Purchase Right for all or any portion of the Unvested
Shares, in the manner and within the time period described above, then Bancorp shall
cease to have any further Repurchase Right with respect to the Unvested Shares that
it does not elect to repurchase. 

d. 
 
 Additional Shares or Substitute Securities . In the event of a stock
dividend, stock split, recapitalization or other change affecting Bancorp s outstanding
Common Stock as a class (effected, in each case, without receipt by Bancorp of
consideration), then any new, substituted or additional securities or other property
(including money paid, other than as a regular cash distribution) that is by reason of
such transaction distributed with respect to the Shares shall be immediately subject to
forfeiture or the Repurchase Right, as the case may be, but only to the extent that
such Shares are at the time Unvested Shares. Appropriate adjustments to reflect the
distribution of such securities or property shall be made to the number of Shares at
the time subject to forfeiture or the Repurchase Right hereunder, as the case may be,
and to the price per share to be paid upon the exercise of the Repurchase Right, in
order to reflect the effect of any such transaction upon Bancorp s capital structure;
provided, however, that the aggregate Purchase Price shall remain the same. 

3. 
 
 Escrow 

a. 
 
 Deposit . The Grantee hereby authorizes Bancorp to hold in escrow, in
accordance with this paragraph 3, all certificates representing Unvested Shares. In
the event any such certificates shall come into the possession of the Grantee, the
Grantee shall immediately deliver the same to the Secretary of Bancorp for such
purposes. The Grantee further agrees to deliver, at the time any Unvested Shares are
issued to him, a duly executed Assignment Separate From Certificate, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, to accompany any certificates representing Unvested
Shares. The certificates representing Unvested Shares shall remain in escrow until
such time or times as they are released or surrendered in accordance with paragraph
3.b. 

b. 
 
 Release/Surrender . As to Shares in which the Grantee acquires a vested
interest (as described in paragraph 1.g), the certificates representing such Shares
shall be released from escrow and delivered to the Grantee as soon as practicable after
the Grantee acquires such vested interest. As to Shares that are Unvested Shares at
the time that the Grantee first ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee,
and which are forfeited or for which Bancorp elects to exercise the 

4 

Repurchase Right
with respect to all or any portion of such Unvested Shares, as the case may be and
as provided in paragraph 2, certificates representing the Unvested Shares that are
forfeited or that Bancorp elects to repurchase shall be delivered to Bancorp,
concurrently with the payment to the Grantee, in cash or cash equivalent, of an
amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price, if any, for such Unvested Shares, and
the Grantee shall cease to have any further rights or claims with respect to such
Unvested Shares. As to Shares that are Unvested Shares at the time that the Grantee
first ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee and for which a Purchase
Price is applicable, if Bancorp does not elect to exercise the Repurchase Right, as
provided in paragraph 2, or elects to exercise the Repurchase Right with respect to
less than all of the Unvested Shares, certificates for Unvested Shares that Bancorp
does not elect to repurchase shall be delivered to the Grantee, and Bancorp shall
cease to have any further Repurchase Right with respect to such Unvested Shares. 

c. 
 
 Prohibition on Transfer . The Grantee shall not sell, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of Unvested Shares, and any such sale, transfer or
pledge in violation of this Agreement shall be void. Bancorp shall not be required (i) 
to transfer on its books any Shares that shall have been sold or transferred in
violation of this Agreement, or (ii) to accord any rights (including, without
limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends, or to receive the proceeds of
liquidation) to any transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred. 

4. 
 
 Legends . In order to reflect restrictions on disposition of the Unvested Shares, each
certificate representing Shares may be endorsed with a legend substantially as follows, in
addition to any other legends that Bancorp deems to be necessary or advisable: 

THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT,
 , A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE OFFICE OF
BANCORP AND THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 

5. 
 
 Section 83(b) Election . The Grantee understands and acknowledges that: 

a. 
 
 Under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ),
the excess of the fair market value of the Shares at the time that any restrictions on
the Shares lapse over the Purchase Price for the Shares is taxed, as ordinary income,
in the taxable year in which such restrictions lapse. In this context, restriction 
means the mandatory forfeiture of the Unvested Shares under circumstances or the right
of Bancorp to buy back the Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Right. 

b. 
 
 If Section 83 of the Code is applicable, the Grantee may file a special
election Section 83(b) Election so that the excess of the fair market value of the
Shares 

5 

at the time the Shares are transferred to him/her (rather than the time that any
restrictions on the Shares lapse) over the Purchase Price for the Shares is taxed, as
ordinary income, in the taxable year in which the Shares are transferred to him/her
(rather than the taxable year in which any restrictions lapse). Even if the fair
market value of the Shares equals the amount paid for the Shares, the election must be
made to avoid adverse tax consequences in the future. 

c. 
 
 The Participant will not be entitled to a deduction for any ordinary income
previously recognized as a result of making a Section 83(b) Election, if the Unvested
Shares are subsequently forfeited to Bancorp. 

d. 
 
 If the value of the Unvested Shares declines after a Section 83(b) Election,
such election may cause the Grantee to recognize more compensation income than he/she
would have otherwise recognized. 

e. 
 
 There may be tax reporting, payroll tax and withholding tax requirements
relating to the acquisition, and/or the subsequent vesting, of Shares. 

f. 
 
 THE FORM FOR MAKING A SECTION 83(b) ELECTION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT B.
IF THE GRANTEE CHOOSES TO MAKE SUCH AN ELECTION, THIS FORM MUST BE FILED NO LATER THAN
THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE SHARES ARE TRANSFERRED TO HIM. FAILURE TO MAKE A TIMELY
SECTION 83(b) ELECTION MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ORDINARY INCOME BY THE GRANTEE
AS THE REPURCHASE RIGHT LAPSES. IT IS THE GRANTEE S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT
BANCORP S, TO MAKE A TIMELY SECTION 83(b) ELECTION. 

g. 
 
 THE GRANTEE IS ADVISED TO SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE REGARDING THE APPLICABLE
PROVISIONS OF ANY TAX LAWS RELATING TO HIS ACQUISITION OF ANY SHARES. 

6. 
 
 Securities Law Compliance . Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement, the
Shares may not be sold, assigned or transferred, unless they are registered under applicable
Federal and state securities laws and regulations or, if the Shares are not then so
registered, an exemption from such registration is available. 

7. 
 
 Miscellaneous 

a. 
 
 Corporate Sale Transactions . In the event of the merger or
reorganization of Bancorp with or into any other corporation, the sale of substantially
all of the assets of Bancorp, or a dissolution or liquidation of Bancorp (collectively,
 Sale Transaction ), (1) the vesting schedule for otherwise Unvested Shares shall be
accelerated so that such Shares will be fully vested; and (2) the forfeiture and
Repurchase Right provisions set forth in paragraph 2 shall lapse and be
unenforceable as to such previously Unvested Shares. 

6 

b. 
 
 Successors in Interest . This Agreement and all of its terms,
conditions and covenants are intended to be fully effective and binding, to the extent
permitted by law, on the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
assigns of the parties hereto. 

c. 
 
 Spousal Consent . If the Grantee is married, the Grantee shall obtain
the signature of the Grantee s spouse as set forth on the Consent of Spouse below. The
Grantee s failure to obtain such consent shall constitute a representation by the
Grantee, on which Bancorp shall rely, that the Grantee is unmarried and that the
Grantee has sole authority with respect to the Grantee s actions regarding the Shares. 

d. 
 
 No Right to Employment . Nothing in this Agreement shall affect in any
manner whatsoever the right or power of Bancorp to terminate the Grantee s employment
with Bancorp, or the Grantee s ability to quit Bancorp s employment, with or without
cause, at any time. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the day and year first
indicated above.

the date on which Grantee, for any reason, first ceases to maintain Continuous Status
as a Director, unless the vesting of such shares is accelerated as described in
paragraph 7.a. 

c. 
 
 Exercise of Repurchase Right . If Bancorp elects to exercise the
Repurchase Right for all or any portion of the Unvested Shares, it shall do so by
delivering a written notice of exercise to the Grantee prior to the expiration of the
ninety (90) day period described in paragraph 2.b. Such notice shall specify the
number of Unvested Shares that Bancorp will repurchase and the date on which the
repurchase is to be effected, which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after
the date of the notice. To the extent that one or more certificates representing
Unvested Shares may have been previously delivered out of escrow to the Grantee, the
Grantee shall, prior to the close of business on the date specified for the repurchase,
deliver to the Secretary of Bancorp the certificates representing the Unvested Shares
to be repurchased, each certificate to be properly endorsed for transfer. Bancorp
shall, concurrently with the receipt of such stock certificates (either from escrow or
from the Grantee as herein provided), pay to the Grantee, in cash or cash equivalents,
an amount equal to the Purchase Price originally paid by the Grantee for the Unvested
Shares that Bancorp elects to repurchase. If Bancorp does not elect to exercise the
Purchase Right for all or any portion of the Unvested Shares, in the manner and within
the time period described above, then Bancorp shall cease to have any further
Repurchase Right with respect to the Unvested Shares that it does not elect to
repurchase. 

d. 
 
 Additional Shares or Substitute Securities . In the event of a stock
dividend, stock split, recapitalization or other change affecting Bancorp s outstanding
Common Stock as a class (effected, in each case, without receipt by Bancorp of
consideration), then any new, substituted or additional securities or other property
(including money paid, other than as a regular cash distribution) that is by reason of
such transaction distributed with respect to the Shares shall be immediately 

3 

subject to
forfeiture or the Repurchase Right, as the case may be, but only to the extent that
such Shares are at the time Unvested Shares. Appropriate adjustments to reflect the
distribution of such securities or property shall be made to the number of Shares at
the time subject to forfeiture or the Repurchase Right hereunder, as the case may be,
and to the price per share to be paid upon the exercise of the Repurchase Right, in
order to reflect the effect of any such transaction upon Bancorp s capital structure;
provided, however, that the aggregate Purchase Price shall remain the same. 

3. 
 
 Escrow 

a. 
 
 Deposit . The Grantee hereby authorizes Bancorp to hold in escrow, in
accordance with this paragraph 3, all certificates representing Unvested Shares. In
the event any such certificates shall come into the possession of the Grantee, the
Grantee shall immediately deliver the same to the Secretary of Bancorp for such
purposes. The Grantee further agrees to deliver, at the time any Unvested Shares are
issued to him, a duly executed Assignment Separate From Certificate, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, to accompany any certificates representing Unvested
Shares. The certificates representing Unvested Shares shall remain in escrow until
such time or times as they are released or surrendered in accordance with paragraph
3.b. 

b. 
 
 Release/Surrender . As to Shares in which the Grantee acquires a vested
interest (as described in paragraph 1.g), the certificates representing such Shares
shall be released from escrow and delivered to the Grantee as soon as practicable after
the Grantee acquires such vested interest. As to Shares that are Unvested Shares at
the time that the Grantee first ceases to maintain Continuous Status as a Director, and
which are forfeited or for which Bancorp elects to exercise the Repurchase Right with
respect to all or any portion of such Unvested Shares, as the case may be and as
provided in paragraph 2, certificates representing the Unvested Shares that are
forfeited or that Bancorp elects to repurchase shall be delivered to Bancorp,
concurrently with the payment to the Grantee, in cash or cash equivalent, of an amount
equal to the aggregate Purchase Price, if any, for such Unvested Shares, and the
Grantee shall cease to have any further rights or claims with respect to such Unvested
Shares. As to Shares that are Unvested Shares at the time that the Grantee first
ceases to maintain Continuous Status as a Director and for which a Purchase Price is
applicable, if Bancorp does not elect to exercise the Repurchase Right, as provided in
paragraph 2, or elects to exercise the Repurchase Right with respect to less than all
of the Unvested Shares, certificates for Unvested Shares that Bancorp does not elect to
repurchase shall be delivered
to the Grantee, and Bancorp shall cease to have any further Repurchase Right with
respect to such Unvested Shares. 

c. 
 
 Prohibition on Transfer . The Grantee shall not sell, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of Unvested Shares, and any such sale, transfer or
pledge in violation of this Agreement shall be void. Bancorp shall not be required (i) 
to 

4 

transfer on its books any Shares that shall have been sold or transferred in
violation of this Agreement, or (ii) to accord any rights (including, without
limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends, or to receive the proceeds of
liquidation) to any transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred. 

4. 
 
 Legends . In order to reflect restrictions on disposition of the Unvested Shares, each
certificate representing Shares may be endorsed with a legend substantially as follows, in
addition to any other legends that Bancorp deems to be necessary or advisable: 

THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT, DATED
 , A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE OFFICE OF BANCORP AND THE
PROVISIONS OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 

5. 
 
 Section 83(b) Election . The Grantee understands and acknowledges that: 

a. 
 
 Under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
 Code ), the excess of the fair market value of the Shares at the time that any
restrictions on the Shares lapse over the Purchase Price for the Shares is taxed,
as ordinary income, in the taxable year in which such restrictions lapse. In this
context, restriction means the mandatory forfeiture of the Unvested Shares under
circumstances or the right of Bancorp to buy back the Shares pursuant to the
Repurchase Right. 

b. 
 
 If Section 83 of the Code is applicable, the Grantee may file a special
election Section 83(b) Election so that the excess of the fair market value of
the Shares at the time the Shares are transferred to him/her (rather than the time
that any restrictions on the Shares lapse) over the Purchase Price for the Shares is
taxed, as ordinary income, in the taxable year in which the Shares are transferred to
him/her (rather than the taxable year in which any restrictions lapse). Even if the
fair market value of the Shares equals the amount paid for the Shares, the election
must be made to avoid adverse tax consequences in the future. 

c. 
 
 The Participant will not be entitled to a deduction for any ordinary income
previously recognized as a result of making a Section 83(b) Election, if the Unvested
Shares are subsequently forfeited to Bancorp. 

d. 
 
 If the value of the Unvested Shares declines after a Section 83(b)
Election, such election may cause the Grantee to recognize more compensation income
than he/she would have otherwise recognized. 

e. 
 
 There may be tax reporting, payroll tax and withholding tax requirements
relating to the acquisition, and/or the subsequent vesting, of Shares. 

5 

f. 
 
 THE FORM FOR MAKING A SECTION 83(b) ELECTION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT
B. IF THE GRANTEE CHOOSES TO MAKE SUCH AN ELECTION, THIS FORM MUST BE FILED NO LATER
THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE SHARES ARE TRANSFERRED TO HIM. FAILURE TO MAKE A
TIMELY SECTION 83(b) ELECTION MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ORDINARY INCOME BY THE
GRANTEE AS THE REPURCHASE RIGHT LAPSES. IT IS THE GRANTEE S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY,
AND NOT BANCORP S, TO MAKE A TIMELY SECTION 83(b) ELECTION. 

g. 
 
 THE GRANTEE IS ADVISED TO SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE REGARDING THE APPLICABLE
PROVISIONS OF ANY TAX LAWS RELATING TO HIS ACQUISITION OF ANY SHARES. 

6. 
 
 Securities Law Compliance . Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement, the
Shares may not be sold, assigned or transferred, unless they are registered under applicable
Federal and state securities laws and regulations or, if the Shares are not then so
registered, an exemption from such registration is available. 

7. 
 
 Miscellaneous 

a. 
 
 Corporate Sale Transactions . In the event of the merger or
reorganization of Bancorp with or into any other corporation, the sale of substantially
all of the assets of Bancorp, or a dissolution or liquidation of Bancorp (collectively,
 Sale Transaction ), (1) the vesting schedule for otherwise Unvested Shares shall be
accelerated so that such Shares will be fully vested; and (2) the forfeiture and
Repurchase Right provisions set forth in paragraph 2 shall lapse and be unenforceable
as to such previously Unvested Shares. 

b. 
 
 Successors in Interest . This Agreement and all of its terms,
conditions and covenants are intended to be fully effective and binding, to the extent
permitted by law, on the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
assigns of the parties hereto. 

c. 
 
 Spousal Consent . If the Grantee is married, the Grantee shall obtain
the signature of the Grantee s spouse as set forth on the Consent of Spouse below. The
Grantee s failure to obtain such consent shall constitute a representation by the
Grantee, on which Bancorp shall rely, that the Grantee is unmarried and that the
Grantee has sole authority with respect to the Grantee s actions regarding the Shares. 

d. 
 
 No Right to Continuing Status as a Director . Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of Grantee or of the
shareholders of Bancorp to terminate Grantee s status as Director of Bancorp at any
time.

a) 
 
 Partial Reimbursement of Excise Tax . If a Change in Control occurs the
Executive may become entitled to acceleration of benefits under this
Agreement or under any other plan or agreement of or with PSB or IMCB, including
accelerated vesting of stock options and acceleration of benefits under any other
benefit, compensation, or incentive plan or arrangement with PSB or IMCB (collectively,
the Total Benefits ). If a Change in Control occurs, IMCB and PSB shall cause the
certified public accounting firm retained by IMCB as of the date immediately before the
Change in
Control (the Accounting Firm to calculate the Total Benefits and any excise tax
payable by the Executive under sections 280G and 4999 based upon the Total Benefits. If
the Accounting Firm determines that an excise tax is payable, at the same time PSB pays
the Change in Control benefit under Section 10 of this Agreement, and not before, PSB
shall also pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to the excise tax calculated by
the Accounting Firm (the Excise Tax ). The Executive acknowledges and agrees

4 

that this Section 11 provides for partial reimbursement only of the final excise tax
that may be payable by him, and that additional unreimbursed excise taxes may be payable
by him after taking into account the reimbursement payment provided under this Section
11. The partial reimbursement of the excise tax under this Section 11 shall be made in
addition to the amount set forth in Section 10. 

(b) 
 
 Calculating the Excise Tax . For purposes of determining whether any of
the Total Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and for purposes of determining
the amount of the Excise Tax, 

1) Determination of Parachute Payments Subject to the Excise Tax : any other payments
or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in
Control or the Executive s Termination of Employment (whether under the terms of this
Agreement or any other agreement, stock option plan or any other benefit plan or
arrangement with PSB or IMCB, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or
any person affiliated with PSB, IMCB, or such person) shall be treated as parachute
payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, and all
 excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the Accounting Firm such other
payments or benefits do not constitute (in whole or in part) parachute payments, or such
excess parachute payments represent (in whole or in part) reasonable compensation for
services actually rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of the Internal
Revenue Code in excess (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code),
or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, 

2) Calculation of Benefits Subject to Excise Tax : the amount of the Total Benefits that
shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the
total amount of the Total Benefits reduced by the amount of such Total Benefits that in
the opinion of the Accounting Firm are not parachute payments, or (b) the amount of
excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) (after applying
clause (i), above), and 

3) Value of Noncash Benefits and Deferred Payments : the value of any noncash benefits or
any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance
with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

(c) 
 
 Assumed Marginal Income Tax Rate . For purposes of determining the
amount of the partial Excise Tax reimbursement payment to be made under this Section
11, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal
rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the partial Excise Tax
reimbursement under this Section 11 is to be made and state and local income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive s
residence on the date of Termination of

5 

Employment, net of the reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from
deduction of such state and local taxes (calculated by assuming that any reduction under
section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code in the amount of itemized deductions allowable
to the Executive applies first to reduce the amount of such state and local income taxes
that would otherwise be deductible by the Executive, and applicable federal FICA and
Medicare withholding taxes). 

(d) 
 
 Accounting Firm s Determinations Are Final and Binding . All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 11 shall be final and
binding on PSB, IMCB, and the Executive. All determinations required to be made under
this Section 11 including the assumptions used to calculate Total Benefits and the
Excise Tax shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to PSB and the Executive.

service institutions, including without limitation banks, insurance companies, leasing
companies, mortgage companies, and brokerage firms that engage in business in the State of

17) Enforcement. 

a) 
 
 Employer and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and
circumstances of the relationship between Executive and Employer, the agreements
referred to in Sections 15 and 16 (including without limitation their scope, duration
and geographic extent) are fair and reasonably necessary for the protection of
Employer s goodwill and other protectable interests. If a court of competent
jurisdiction should decline to enforce any of those covenants and agreements, Executive
and Employer request the court to reform these provisions to restrict Executive s
ability to compete with Employer to the maximum extent, in time, scope of activities,
and geography, the court finds enforceable. 

b) 
 
 Executive acknowledges that Employer will suffer immediate and irreparable harm
that will not be compensable by damages alone, if Executive repudiates or breaches any
of the provisions of Sections 15 and 16 or threatens or attempts to do so. For this
reason, under these circumstances, Employer, in addition to and without limitation of
any other rights, remedies or damages available to it at law or in equity, will be
entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions in order to
prevent or restrain the 

9 

breach, and Employer will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting
of this relief. 

18) 
 
 Adequate Consideration. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of adequate
consideration, including without limitation the Termination Payment, identified in Section 9,
if due and owing, for the covenants contained in Sections 15 and 16 and that Employer is
entitled to require him to comply with those Sections regardless of the reason(s) for
Executive s separation of employment with Employer. Sections 15 and 16 will survive
termination of this Agreement, but will expire no later than two years from the date of the
termination of employment or the maturity of this agreement, whichever is later. Executive
represents that if his employment is terminated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
Executive has experience and capabilities sufficient to enable Executive to obtain employment
in areas which do not violate this Agreement and that Employer s enforcement of a remedy by
way of injunction will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood. 

19) 
 
 Entire Agreement . This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties
concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, including that certain
employment agreement between Executive and Employer effective January 1, 2002 and the Change
in Control Agreement. Accordingly, Executive specifically waives the terms of and all of
Executive s rights under any severance provisions of any employment and/or change-in-control
agreements, whether written or oral, previously entered into with PSB and/or IMCB.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the terms of this agreement are separate from and do not
supercede the terms of the Tax Bonus Agreement or the Salary Continuation Agreement. 

20) 
 
 Savings Clause Relating to Compliance with Code Section 409A . Despite any contrary provision
of this Agreement, if when the Executive s employment terminates the Executive is a specified
employee, as defined in Code section 409A, and if any payments under Articles 9, 10 or 11 of
this Agreement will result in additional tax or interest to the Executive because of section
409A, the Executive shall not be entitled to the payments under Articles 9, 10 or 11 until the
earliest of (i) the date that is at least six months after termination of the Executive s
employment for reasons other than the Executive s death, (ii) the date of the Executive s
death, or (iii) any earlier date that does not result in additional tax or interest to the
Executive under section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement would subject the Executive
to additional tax or interest under section 409A, the Employer shall reform the provision.
However, the Employer shall maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of
the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and
the Employer shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of
the reformed provision. 

21) Miscellaneous Provisions. 

a) 
 
 Choice of Law . This Agreement is made with reference to and is
intended to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. 

10 

b) 
 
 Payment of Legal Fees . Employer is aware that after a Change in Control
management could cause or attempt to cause Employer to refuse to comply with the
obligations under this Agreement, or could institute or cause or attempt to cause
Employer to institute litigation seeking to have this Agreement declared unenforceable,
or could take or attempt to take other action to deny Executive the benefits intended
under this Agreement. In these circumstances the purpose of this Agreement would be
frustrated. It is Employer s intention that the Executive not be required to incur the
expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under this Agreement, whether by
litigation or other legal action, because the cost and expense thereof would
substantially detract from the benefits intended to be granted to the Executive
hereunder. It is Employer s intention that the Executive not be forced to negotiate
settlement of his rights under this Agreement under threat of incurring expenses.
Accordingly, if after a Change in Control occurs it appears to the Executive that (a)
Employer has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b)
Employer or any other person has taken any action to declare this Agreement void or
unenforceable, or instituted any litigation or other legal action designed to deny,
diminish, or to recover from the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the
Executive hereunder, Employer irrevocably authorize the Executive from time to time to
retain counsel of his choice, at Employer s expense as provided in this paragraph (b),
to represent the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against Employer or any director,
officer, stockholder, or other person affiliated with Employer, in any jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any existing or previous attorney-client relationship between Employer
and any counsel chosen by the Executive under this paragraph (b), Employer irrevocably
consents to the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that
counsel, and Employer and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall
exist between the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel selected
from time to time by the Executive as provided in this section shall be paid or
reimbursed to the Executive by Employer on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation
by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance
with such counsel s customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 500,000,
whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not incurred in trial, bankruptcy, or
appellate proceedings. Employer s obligation to pay the Executive s legal fees provided
by this paragraph (b) operates separately from and in addition to any legal fee
reimbursement obligation Employer may have with the Executive under any separate
severance, employment, salary continuation, or other agreement. Anything in this
paragraph (b) to the contrary notwithstanding however, Employer shall not be required
to pay or reimburse the Executive s legal expenses if doing so would violate section
18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and Rule 359.3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 12 CFR 359.3 . 

11 

c) 
 
 Successors . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and each of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns. 

d) 
 
 Amendment . This Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by
the Parties. 

e) 
 
 Headings . The headings of sections of this Agreement have been
included for convenience of reference only. They shall not be construed to modify or
otherwise affect in any respect any of the provisions of the Agreement. 

f) 
 
 Counsel Review . Executive acknowledges that he has had the opportunity
to consult with independent counsel with respect to the negotiation, preparation, and
execution of this Agreement. 

g) 
 
 Severability . The provisions of this Agreement are severable. The invalidity
of any provision will not affect the validity of other provisions of this Agreement. 

EXECUTED by each of the Parties effective as of the date first stated above.

 ARTICLE 2
 LIFETIME BENEFITS

 2.1 NORMAL RETIREMENT. Unless Separation from Service occurs before Normal
Retirement Age, when the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age the Bank shall
pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.1 instead of any
other benefit under this Agreement. If the Executive's Separation from Service
thereafter is a Termination for Cause or if this Agreement terminates under
Article 5, no further benefits shall be paid.

 2.1.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.1 is
 147,657.

 2.1.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the month immediately after the
 month in which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank
 shall pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.2 EARLY TERMINATION. If Early Termination occurs before Normal
Retirement Age but ten years or more after the Effective Date, the Bank shall
pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.2 instead of any
other benefit under this Agreement. If Early Termination occurs within ten years
after the Effective Date, no benefit shall be payable under this Agreement.
Additionally, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement if the
Executive's employment is terminated under circumstances described in Article 5
of this Agreement. Neither the Bank nor the Executive shall be entitled to elect
in the 24-month period after a Change in Control between the benefit under this
section 2.2 versus the benefit under section 2.4. If the Executive's Separation
from Service within 24 months after a Change in Control is an involuntary
termination other than for Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good Reason, no
benefit shall be payable under this section 2.2 and the Executive shall instead
be entitled to the benefit under section 2.4 (unless the Change in Control is
the result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that the Bank
should be sold) or, if the Executive first attained Normal Retirement Age,
section 2.1.

 4

2.2.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.2 is
 calculated as the amount that fully amortizes the Accrual Balance
 existing at the end of the month immediately before the month in
 which Separation from Service occurs, amortizing that Accrual
 Balance over the ten-year period beginning with the Executive's
 Normal Retirement Age and taking into account interest at the
 discount rate or rates established by the Plan Administrator.

 2.2.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the later of (i) the seventh
 month after the month in which the Executive's Separation from
 Service occurs, or (ii) the month immediately after the month in
 which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall
 pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.3 DISABILITY. For Separation from Service because of Disability before
Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall pay to the Executive the benefit described
in this section 2.3 instead of any other benefit under this Agreement.

 2.3.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.3 is
 calculated as the amount that fully amortizes the Accrual Balance
 existing at the end of the month immediately before the month in
 which Separation from Service occurs, amortizing that Accrual
 Balance over the ten-year period beginning with the Executive's
 Normal Retirement Age and taking into account interest at the
 discount rate or rates established by the Plan Administrator.

 2.3.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the later of (i) the seventh
 month after the month in which the Executive's Separation from
 Service occurs, or (ii) the month immediately after the month in
 which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall
 pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.4 CHANGE-IN-CONTROL. If the Executive's Separation from Service is an
involuntary termination without Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good
Reason, in either case within 24 months after a Change in Control, the Bank
shall pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.4 instead of
any other benefit under this Agreement, unless the Change in Control is the
result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that the Bank should
be sold. No benefits shall be payable under this Agreement if the Executive's
employment is terminated under circumstances described in Article 5 of this
Agreement. Neither the Bank nor the Executive shall be entitled to elect in the
24-month period after a Change in Control between the benefit under this section
2.4 versus the Early Termination benefit under section 2.2. If the Executive's
Separation from Service within 24 months after a Change in Control is an
involuntary termination without Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good
Reason, no benefit shall be payable under section 2.2 and the Executive shall
instead be entitled to the benefit under this section 2.4, unless the Change in
Control is the result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that
the Bank should be sold. But if the Executive shall have attained Normal
Retirement Age when Separation from Service within 24 months after a Change in
Control occurs, whether Separation from Service is voluntary or involuntary for
any reason other than Termination for Cause, the Executive shall be entitled
solely to the benefit provided by section 2.1, not this section 2.4.

 2.4.1 Amount of benefit. The benefit under this section 2.4 is the Normal
 Retirement Age Accrual Balance required by section 2.1, discounting
 the Normal Retirement Age Accrual Balance to present value using a
 discount rate selected by the Plan Administrator, but the discount
 rate selected by the Plan Administrator shall not exceed the
 discount rate employed at the time of the Change in Control for
 purposes of calculating the Accrual Balance.

 5

2.4.2 Payment of benefit. The Bank shall pay the benefit under this
 section 2.4 to the Executive in a single lump sum on the first day
 of the seventh month after the month in which the Executive's
 Separation from Service occurs.

 2.5 LUMP-SUM PAYOUT OF REMAINING NORMAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT, EARLY
TERMINATION BENEFIT, OR DISABILITY BENEFIT WHEN A CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS. If a
Change in Control occurs while the Executive is receiving the Normal Retirement
Age benefit under section 2.1, the Bank shall pay the remaining salary
continuation benefits to the Executive in a single lump sum on the date of the
Change in Control. If a Change in Control occurs after Separation from Service
but while the Executive is receiving or is entitled at Normal Retirement Age to
receive the Early Termination benefit under section 2.2 or the Disability
benefit under section 2.3, the Bank shall pay the remaining salary continuation
benefits to the Executive in a single lump sum on the later of (i) the date of
the Change in Control or (ii) the first day of the seventh month after the month
in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs. The lump-sum payment
due to the Executive as a result of a Change in Control shall be an amount equal
to the Accrual Balance amount corresponding to the particular benefit when the
Change in Control occurs.

 2.6 ANNUAL BENEFIT STATEMENT. Within 120 days after the end of each Plan
Year the Plan Administrator shall provide or cause to be provided to the
Executive an annual benefit statement showing benefits payable or potentially
payable to the Executive under this Agreement. Each annual benefit statement
shall supersede the previous year's annual benefit statement. If there is a
contradiction between this Agreement and the annual benefit statement concerning
the amount of a particular benefit payable or potentially payable to the
Executive under sections 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 hereof, the amount of the benefit
determined under the Agreement shall control.

 2.7 SAVINGS CLAUSE RELATING TO COMPLIANCE WITH CODE SECTION 409A. Despite
any contrary provision of this Agreement, if when the Executive's employment
terminates the Executive is a specified employee, as defined in Code section
409A, and if any payments under Article 2 of this Agreement will result in
additional tax or interest to the Executive because of section 409A, the
Executive shall not be entitled to the payments under Article 2 until the
earliest of (i) the date that is at least six months after termination of the
Executive's employment for reasons other than the Executive's death, (ii) the
date of the Executive's death, or (iii) any earlier date that does not result in
additional tax or interest to the Executive under section 409A. If any provision
of this Agreement would subject the Executive to additional tax or interest
under section 409A, the Bank shall reform the provision. However, the Bank shall
maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable
provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and
the Bank shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a
result of the reformed provision.

 2.8 ONE BENEFIT ONLY. Despite anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Executive and Beneficiary are entitled to one benefit only under this
Agreement, which shall be determined by the first event to occur that is dealt
with by this Agreement. Except as provided in section 2.5 or Article 3,
subsequent occurrence of events dealt with by this Agreement shall not entitle
the Executive or Beneficiary to other or additional benefits under this
Agreement.

 6

ARTICLE 3
 DEATH BENEFITS

 3.1 DEATH BEFORE SEPARATION FROM SERVICE AND NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If the
Executive dies in active service to the Bank before Normal Retirement Age, at
the Executive's death the Executive's Beneficiary shall be entitled solely to
the benefit, if any, provided by the Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement
attached to this Agreement as Addendum A instead of any benefit payable under
this Agreement. If the Executive dies after Separation from Service or after
attaining Normal Retirement Age, the Executive's Beneficiary shall be entitled
to no benefits under the Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement attached to this
Agreement as Addendum A.

 3.2 DEATH AFTER SEPARATION FROM SERVICE OR NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If the
Executive dies after Normal Retirement Age or after Separation from Service
occurring at any age, at the Executive's death the Executive's Beneficiary shall
be entitled to the benefits, if any, that would have been payable to the
Executive under Article 2 had the Executive survived. The benefits shall be
payable to the Executive's Beneficiary in the same amounts they would have been
paid to the Executive had the Executive survived, except that payments shall
commence in the month after the Executive's death.

 3.3 CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PAYOUT OF BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 3.2. If a Change in
Control occurs while the Executive's Beneficiary is receiving the benefit
provided by section 3.2, the Bank shall pay the remaining benefits to the
Executive's Beneficiary in a single lump sum within three days after the Change
in Control. The lump-sum payment shall be an amount equal to the Accrual Balance
amount corresponding to the benefit being paid.

 ARTICLE 4
 BENEFICIARIES

 4.1 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS. The Executive shall have the right to
designate at any time a Beneficiary to receive any benefits payable under this
Agreement at the Executive's death. The Beneficiary designated under this
Agreement may be the same as or different from the beneficiary designation under
any other benefit plan of the Bank in which the Executive participates.

 4.2 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION: CHANGE. The Executive shall designate a
Beneficiary by completing and signing the Beneficiary Designation Form and
delivering it to the Plan Administrator or its designated agent. The Executive's
Beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the Beneficiary
predeceases the Executive or if the Executive names a spouse as Beneficiary and
the marriage is subsequently dissolved. The Executive shall have the right to
change a Beneficiary by completing, signing, and otherwise complying with the
terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and the Plan Administrator's rules and
procedures, as in effect from time to time. Upon the acceptance by the Plan
Administrator of a new Beneficiary Designation Form, all Beneficiary
designations previously filed shall be cancelled. The Plan Administrator shall
be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary Designation Form filed by the
Executive and accepted by the Plan Administrator before the Executive's death.

 4.3 ACKNOWLEDGMENT. No designation or change in designation of a
Beneficiary shall be effective until received, accepted, and acknowledged in
writing by the Plan Administrator or its designated agent.

 4.4 NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. If the Executive dies without a valid
beneficiary designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the
Executive, then the Executive's spouse shall be the designated Beneficiary. If
the Executive has no surviving spouse, the benefits shall be made to the
personal representative of the Executive's estate.

 7

4.5 FACILITY OF PAYMENT. If a benefit is payable to a minor, to a person
declared incapacitated, or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of
his or her property, the Bank may pay the benefit to the guardian, legal
representative, or person having the care or custody of the minor, incapacitated
person, or incapable person. The Bank may require proof of incapacity, minority,
or guardianship as it may deem appropriate before distribution of the benefit.
Distribution shall completely discharge the Bank from all liability for the
benefit.

 ARTICLE 5
 GENERAL LIMITATIONS

 5.1 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Despite any contrary provision of this

the Bank nor does it interfere with the Bank's right to discharge the Executive.
It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee or interfere with
the Executive's right to terminate employment at any time.

 11

8.4 NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Benefits under this Agreement may not be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, attached, or encumbered.

 8.5 SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT. By an assumption agreement in form and

assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Bank would be required to perform this Agreement had no
succession occurred.

 8.6 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Bank shall withhold any taxes that are required
to be withheld from the benefits provided under this Agreement.

 8.7 APPLICABLE LAW. Except to the extent preempted by the laws of the

performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Idaho, without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws of such state.

 8.8 UNFUNDED ARRANGEMENT. The Executive and the Beneficiary are general
unsecured creditors of the Bank for the payment of benefits under this

invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and each such
other provision shall continue in full force and effect to the full extent

attached as Addendum A constitute the entire agreement between the Bank and the
Executive concerning the subject matter. No rights are granted to the Executive
under this Agreement other than those specifically set forth. The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement satisfies in full Intermountain
Community Bancorp's and the Bank's obligation to provide a salary continuation
plan for the benefit of the Executive, which obligation is stated in section 7
of the Executive Employment Agreement dated as of December 17, 2003 by and among
the Executive, Intermountain Community Bancorp, and the Bank, as the same may be
amended.

 12

8.13 PAYMENT OF LEGAL FEES. The Bank is aware that after a Change in
Control management of the Bank could cause or attempt to cause the Bank to
refuse to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, or institute or
cause or attempt to cause the Bank to institute litigation seeking to have this
Agreement declared unenforceable, or take or attempt to take other action to
deny the Executive the benefits intended under this Agreement. In these
circumstances the purpose of this Agreement would be frustrated. The Bank
desires that the Executive not be required to incur the expenses associated with
the enforcement of rights under this Agreement by litigation or other legal
action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the
benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. The Bank desires
that the Executive not be required to negotiate any settlement of rights under
threat of incurring expenses. Accordingly, if after a Change in Control (i) it
appears to the Executive that the Bank has failed to comply with any of its
obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) the Bank or any other person takes any
action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any
litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to recover from
the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder,
the Bank irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain
counsel of the Executive's choice, at the Bank's expense as provided in this
section 8.13, to represent the Executive in any litigation or other legal
action, whether by or against the Bank or any director, officer, stockholder, or
other person affiliated with the Bank, in any jurisdiction. Despite any existing
or previous attorney-client relationship between the Bank and any counsel chosen
by the Executive under this section 8.13, the Bank irrevocably consents to the
Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that counsel, and
the Bank and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist
between the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel
selected from time to time by the Executive as herein above provided shall be
paid or reimbursed to the Executive by the Bank on a regular, periodic basis
upon presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such
counsel in accordance with such counsel's customary practices, up to a maximum
aggregate amount of 500,000, whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not
incurred in trial, bankruptcy, or appellate proceedings. The Bank's obligation
to pay the Executive's legal fees provided by this section 8.13 operates
separately from and in addition to any legal fee reimbursement obligation the
Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp may have with the Executive under any
separate employment, severance, or other agreement. Despite anything in this
Agreement to the contrary however, the Bank shall not be required to pay or
reimburse the Executive's legal expenses if doing so would violate section 18(k)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1828(k)] and Rule 359.3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [12 CFR 359.3].

 8.14 EXCISE TAX UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTIONS 280G AND 4999. (a)
Partial reimbursement of the Excise Tax. If a Change in Control occurs the
Executive may become entitled to acceleration of benefits under this Agreement
or under another plan or agreement of or with the Bank or Intermountain
Community Bancorp, including accelerated vesting of stock options and
acceleration of benefits under any other benefit, compensation, or incentive
plan or arrangement with the Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp
(collectively, the "Total Benefits"). If a Change in Control occurs,
Intermountain Community Bancorp and the Bank shall cause the certified public
accounting firm retained by Intermountain Community Bancorp as of the date
immediately before the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") to calculate
the Total Benefits and any excise tax payable by the Executive under Code
sections 280G and 4999 based upon the Total Benefits. If the Accounting Firm
determines that an excise tax is payable, at the same time the Bank pays the
Change in Control benefit under section 2.4 of this Agreement the Bank shall
also pay or cause to be paid to the Executive an amount in cash equal to the
excise tax calculated by the Accounting Firm (the "Excise Tax"). The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that this section 8.14 provides for partial
reimbursement only of the final excise tax that may be payable by him, and that
additional unreimbursed excise taxes may be payable after taking into account
the reimbursement payment provided under this section 8.14. The partial

 13

reimbursement of the excise tax under this section 8.14 shall be made in
addition to the amount set forth in section 2.4.

 (b) Calculating the Excise Tax. For purposes of determining whether any of
the Total Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and for purposes of
determining the amount of the Excise Tax,

 1) Determination of "parachute payments" subject to the Excise Tax: any
 other payments or benefits received or to be received by the
 Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the Executive's
 Separation from Service (whether under the terms of this Agreement
 or any other agreement, stock option plan or any other benefit plan
 or arrangement with the Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp, any
 person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any person
 affiliated with the Bank, Intermountain Community Bancorp, or such
 person) shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning
 of Code section 280G(b)(2), and all "excess parachute payments"
 within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject
 to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the Accounting Firm such
 other payments or benefits do not constitute (in whole or in part)
 parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments represent (in
 whole or in part) reasonable compensation for services actually
 rendered within the meaning of Code section 280G(b)(4) in excess of
 the base amount (as defined in Code section 280G(b)(3)), or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,

 2) Calculation of benefits subject to the Excise Tax: the amount of the
 Total Benefits that shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax
 shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of the Total
 Benefits reduced by the amount of such Total Benefits that in the
 opinion of the Accounting Firm are not parachute payments, or (ii)
 the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (1), above), and

 3) Value of noncash benefits and deferred payments: the value of any
 noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles
 of Code sections 280G(d)(3) and (4).

 (c) Assumed marginal income tax rate. For purposes of determining the
amount of the partial Excise Tax reimbursement payment to be made under this
section 8.14, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which
the partial Excise Tax reimbursement under this section 8.14 is to be made and
state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the
state and locality of the Executive's residence on the date of Separation from
Service, net of the reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from
deduction of such state and local taxes (calculated by assuming that any
reduction under Code section 68 in the amount of itemized deductions allowable
to the Executive applies first to reduce the amount of such state and local
income taxes that would otherwise be deductible by the Executive, and applicable
federal FICA and Medicare withholding taxes).

 (d) Accounting firm's determinations are final and binding. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this section 8.14 shall be
final and binding on the Bank, Intermountain Community Bancorp, and the
Executive. All determinations required to be made under this section 8.14 -
including the assumptions used to calculate Total Benefits and the Excise Tax -
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Bank and the Executive.

 14

8.15 TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN TAX
STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS. The Bank is entering into this Agreement on the
assumption that certain existing tax statutes, rules, and regulations will
continue in effect in their current form. If that assumption materially changes
and the change has a material detrimental effect on this Agreement, the Bank
reserves the right to terminate or modify this Agreement accordingly, subject to
obtaining the written consent of the Executive, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. This section 8.15 shall become null and void effective immediately
upon a Change in Control.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and a duly authorized Bank officer have
executed this Amended Salary Continuation Agreement as of the date first written
above.

ADDENDUM A
 PANHANDLE STATE BANK
 SPLIT DOLLAR AGREEMENT

 THIS SPLIT DOLLAR AGREEMENT is entered into as of this _____ day of ___
, 2003, by and between Panhandle State Bank, an Idaho-chartered, FDIC-insured
bank with its main office in Sandpoint, Idaho (the "Bank") and Curt Hecker,
Chief Executive Officer of the Bank (the "Executive"). This Split Dollar
Agreement shall append the Split Dollar Policy Endorsement entered into on even
date herewith, or as subsequently amended, by and between the aforementioned
parties.

 To encourage the Executive to remain an employee of the Bank, the Bank
is willing to divide the death proceeds of a life insurance policy on the
Executive's life to be effective until the Executive's Normal Retirement Age of
60. The Bank will pay life insurance premiums from its general assets.

 ARTICLE 1
 GENERAL DEFINITIONS

 Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Split Dollar Agreement
are used herein as defined in the Salary Continuation Agreement dated as of the
date of this Split Dollar Agreement between the Bank and the Executive. The
following terms shall have the meanings specified:

 1.1 Administrator means the administrator described in Article 7.

 1.2 Executive's Interest means the benefit set forth in Section
 2.2.

 1.3 Insured means the Executive.

 1.4 Insurer means each life insurance carrier for which there is a
 Split Dollar Policy Endorsement attached to this Split Dollar
 Agreement.

 Policy minus the cash surrender value.

 issued by the Insurer(s).

 1.7 Split Dollar Policy Endorsement means the form required by the
 Administrator or the Insurer to indicate the Executive's
 interest, if any, in a Policy on the Executive's life.

 ARTICLE 2
 POLICY OWNERSHIP/INTERESTS

 2.1 Bank Ownership. The Bank is the sole owner of the Policy and
shall have the right to exercise all incidents of ownership. The Bank shall be
the beneficiary of any death proceeds remaining after the Executive's interest
has been paid under Section 2.2 of this Split Dollar Agreement.

 2.2 Executive's Interest. The Executive shall have the right to
designate the beneficiary(ies) of the Executive's Interest, which shall be an
amount equal to 1,109,673 of the Net Death Proceeds. The Executive shall also
have the right to elect and change settlement options specified in the Policy
that may be permitted. However, the Executive, the Executive's transferee, or
the Executive's beneficiary(ies) shall have no rights or interests in the Policy
for that portion of the death proceeds designated in this Section 2.2 if the
Executive is not in the full-time employment of the Bank at the time of death,
except for reason of a leave of absence approved by the Bank, or if benefits
under the Salary Continuation Agreement of even date herewith are denied under
Article 5 of that Salary Continuation Agreement.

 2.3 Option to Purchase. The Bank shall not sell, surrender, or
transfer ownership of the Policy while this Split Dollar Agreement is in effect
without first giving the Executive or the Executive's transferee a right of
first refusal to purchase the Policy for the Policy's interpolated terminal
reserve value. The right of first refusal to

 1

purchase the Policy must be exercised within 60 days from the date the Bank
gives written notice of the Bank's intention to sell, surrender or transfer
ownership of the Policy. This provision shall not impair the right of the Bank
to terminate this Split Dollar Agreement.

 2.4 Comparable Coverage. Upon execution of this Split Dollar
Agreement, the Bank shall maintain the Policy in full force and effect, and the
Bank shall not amend, terminate, or otherwise abrogate the Executive's interest
in the Policy unless the Bank (a) replaces the Policy with a comparable
insurance policy to cover the benefit provided under this Split Dollar Agreement
and (b) executes a new Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement for the comparable
insurance policy. The Policy or any comparable policy shall be subject to the
claims of the Bank's creditors.

 ARTICLE 3
 PREMIUMS

 3.1 Premium Payment. The Bank shall pay any premiums due on the
Policy.

 3.2 Imputed Income. The Bank shall impute income to the Executive

imputed under Revenue Rulings 64-328 and 66-110, or any subsequent applicable
authority.

 ARTICLE 4
 ASSIGNMENT

Policy and in this Split Dollar Agreement to any person, entity, or trust. If
the Executive transfers all of the Executive's interest in the Policy, then all
of the Executive's interest in the Policy and in the Split Dollar Agreement
shall be vested in the Executive's transferee, who shall be substituted as a
party hereunder, and the Executive shall have no further interest in the Policy
or in this Split Dollar Agreement.

 ARTICLE 5
 INSURER

 The Insurer shall be bound only by the terms of the Policy. Any
payments the Insurer makes or actions it takes in accordance with the Policy

 benefits.

 6.2.3 Considerations on Review. In considering the review, the Bank
 shall take into account all materials and information the

 whether such information was submitted or considered in the

solely by a writing signed by the Bank and the Executive. However, this Split

expressly assume and agree to perform this Split Dollar Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be required to perform this

provision, together with all other provisions of this Split Dollar Agreement,

agrees that the Bank may after this Split Dollar Agreement is adopted wish to
exchange the Policy for another contract of life insurance insuring the
Executive's life. Provided that the Policy is replaced (or intended to be
replaced) with a comparable policy of life insurance consistent with the
requirements of section 2.4 herein, the Executive agrees to provide medical
information and cooperate with medical insurance-related testing required by a
prospective Insurer for implementing the Policy or, if necessary, for modifying
or updating to a comparable Insurer per section 2.4. The Executive's

 5

inability to pass an insurability determination for purposes of obtaining a
comparable replacement Policy does not permit the Bank to abrogate the
Executive's interest in the Policy without the Executive's consent.

 8.11 Termination or Modification of Split Dollar Agreement Because
of Changes in Tax Statutes, Rules, or Regulations. The Bank is entering into
this Split Dollar Agreement on the assumption that certain existing tax
statutes, rules, and regulations will continue in effect in their current form.
If that assumption materially changes and the change has a material detrimental
effect on this Split Dollar Agreement, the Bank reserves the right to terminate
or modify this Split Dollar Agreement accordingly, subject to obtaining the
written consent of the Executive, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. This
Section 8.11 shall become null and void effective immediately upon a Change in
Control.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Bank and the Executive have executed this Split
Dollar Agreement as of the date first written above.

Control (the Accounting Firm to calculate the Total Benefits and any excise tax
payable by the Executive under sections 280G and 4999 based upon the Total Benefits. If
the Accounting Firm determines that an excise tax is payable, at the same time PSB pays
the Change in Control benefit under Section 10 of this Agreement, and not before, PSB
shall also pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to the excise tax calculated by
the Accounting Firm (the Excise Tax ). The Executive acknowledges and agrees that this
Section 11 provides for partial reimbursement only of the final excise tax that may be
payable by him, and that additional unreimbursed excise taxes may be payable by him

partial reimbursement of the excise tax under this Section 11 shall be made in addition
to the amount set forth in Section 10. 

(b) 
 
 Calculating the Excise Tax . For purposes of determining whether any of
the Total Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and for purposes of determining
the amount of the Excise Tax, 

1) Determination of Parachute Payments Subject to the Excise Tax : any other payments
or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in
Control or the Executive s Termination of Employment (whether under the terms of this
Agreement or any other agreement, stock option plan or any other benefit plan or
arrangement with PSB or IMCB, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or
any person affiliated with PSB, IMCB, or such person) shall be treated as parachute
payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, and all
 excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the Accounting Firm such other
payments or benefits do not constitute (in whole or in part) parachute payments, or such
excess parachute payments represent (in whole or in part) reasonable compensation for
services actually rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of the

5 

Internal Revenue Code in excess (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code), or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,

2) Calculation of Benefits Subject to Excise Tax : the amount of the Total Benefits that
shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the
total amount of the Total Benefits reduced by the amount of such Total Benefits that in
the opinion of the Accounting Firm are not parachute payments, or (b) the amount of
excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) (after applying
clause (i), above), and

3) Value of Noncash Benefits and Deferred Payments : the value of any noncash benefits or
any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance
with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code.

(c) 
 
 Assumed Marginal Income Tax Rate . For purposes of determining the
amount of the partial Excise Tax reimbursement payment to be made under this Section
11, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal
rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the partial Excise Tax
reimbursement under this Section 11 is to be made and state and local income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive s
residence on the date of Termination of Employment, net of the reduction in federal
income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes
(calculated by assuming that any reduction under section 68 of the Internal Revenue
Code in the amount of itemized deductions allowable to the Executive applies first to
reduce the amount of such state and local income taxes that would otherwise be
deductible by the Executive, and applicable federal FICA and Medicare withholding
taxes). 

(d) 
 
 Accounting Firm s Determinations Are Final and Binding . All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 11 shall be final and
binding on PSB, IMCB, and the Executive. All determinations required to be made under
this Section 11 including the assumptions used to calculate Total Benefits and the
Excise Tax shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to PSB and the Executive.

conditions: 

1) 
 
 a material diminution of the Executive s base salary; 

2) 
 
 a material diminution of the Executive s authority, duties, or
responsibilities; 

8 

3) 
 
 a material diminution in the authority, duties, or
responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Executive is required to report,
including a requirement that the Executive report to a corporate officer or
employee instead of reporting directly to the board of directors; 

4) 
 
 a material diminution in the budget over which the Executive
retains authority; 

5) 
 
 a material change in the geographic location at which the
Executive must perform services for the Employer (material change in geographic
location means a change of more than 60 miles (one way) in the Executive s
commute if the Executive does not agree to move), or; 

6) 
 
 any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach
by the Employer of this agreement or of any other agreement under which the
Executive provides services to the Employer. 

13) 
 
 Confidentiality. Executive will not, after signing this Agreement, including during and
after its Term, use for his own purposes or disclose to any other person or entity any
confidential information concerning Employer or its business operations or customers, unless
(1) Employer consents to the use or disclosure of its confidential information, (2) the use or
disclosure is consistent with Executive s duties under this Agreement, or (3) disclosure is
required by law or court order. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to,
financial information, customer lists, marketing strategies, and business plans. 

14) 
 
 Return of Employer Property. If and when Executive ceases, for any reason, to be employed by
Employer, Executive must return to Employer all keys, pass cards, identification cards and any
other property of Employer. At the same time, Executive also must return to Employer all
originals and copies (whether in hard copy, electronic or other form) of any documents, notes,
memoranda, designs, devices, diskettes, tapes, manuals, and specifications which constitute
proprietary information or material of Employer. The obligations in this Section include the
return of documents and other materials which may be in Executive s desk at work, in
Executive s car or place of residence, or in any other location under Executive s control. 

15) 
 
 Non-Solicitation. Executive shall not solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any
employee of Employer for a period of two (2) years following Executive s termination; nor
solicit or cause to be solicited the business and/or accounts of customers of Employer for a
period of two years following Executive s termination. Executive s obligations under this
Section 15 terminate immediately upon a Change in Control. 

16) 
 
 Non-competition. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, while Executive
is employed by Employer and for two years following termination of Executive s employment for
any reason, , Executive will not become involved with a Competing Business or serve, directly
or indirectly, a Competing Business in any manner, including, without limitation, as a
shareholder, member, partner, director, 

9 

officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, employee, consultant, or agent;
 provided , however , that Executive may acquire and passively own an interest not
exceeding 2 of the total equity interest in a Competing Business. Executive s obligations
under this Section 16 terminate immediately upon a Change in Control. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term Competing Business means any financial service institutions, including
without limitation banks, insurance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies, and
brokerage firms that engage in business in the State of Idaho, or southeastern Oregon, or
eastern Washington. 

17) 
 
 Enforcement. 

a) 
 
 Employer and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and
circumstances of the relationship between Executive and Employer, the agreements
referred to in Sections 15 and 16 (including without limitation their scope, duration
and geographic extent) are fair and reasonably necessary for the protection of
Employer s goodwill and other protectable interests. If a court of competent
jurisdiction should decline to enforce any of those covenants and agreements, Executive
and Employer request the court to reform these provisions to restrict Executive s
ability to compete with Employer to the maximum extent, in time, scope of activities,
and geography, the court finds enforceable. 

b) 
 
 Executive acknowledges that Employer will suffer immediate and irreparable harm
that will not be compensable by damages alone, if Executive repudiates or breaches any
of the provisions of Sections 15 and 16 or threatens or attempts to do so. For this
reason, under these circumstances, Employer, in addition to and without limitation of
any other rights, remedies or damages available to it at law or in equity, will be
entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions in order to
prevent or restrain the breach, and Employer will not be required to post a bond as a
condition for the granting of this relief. 

18) 
 
 Adequate Consideration. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of adequate
consideration, including without limitation the Termination Payment, identified in Section 9,
if due and owing, for the covenants contained in Sections 15 and 16 and that Employer is
entitled to require him to comply with those Sections regardless of the reason(s) for
Executive s separation of employment with Employer. Sections 15 and 16 will survive
termination of this Agreement, but will expire no later than two years from the date of the
termination of employment or the maturity of this agreement, whichever is later. Executive
represents that if his employment is terminated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
Executive has experience and capabilities sufficient to enable Executive to obtain employment
in areas which do not violate this Agreement and that Employer s enforcement of a remedy by
way of injunction will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood. 

19) 
 
 Entire Agreement . This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties
concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, 

10 

including that certain employment agreement between Executive and Employer effective January 1,
2002 and the Change in Control Agreement. Accordingly, Executive specifically waives the terms
of and all of Executive s rights under any severance provisions of any employment and/or
change-in-control agreements, whether written or oral, previously entered into with PSB and/or
IMCB. Notwithstanding the preceding, the terms of this agreement are separate from and do not
supercede the terms of the Salary Continuation Agreement. 

20) 
 
 Savings Clause Relating to Compliance with Code Section 409A . Despite any contrary provision
of this Agreement, if when the Executive s employment terminates the Executive is a specified
employee, as defined in Code section 409A, and if any payments under Articles 9, 10 or 11 of
this Agreement will result in additional tax or interest to the Executive because of section
409A, the Executive shall not be entitled to the payments under Articles 9, 10 or 11 until the
earliest of (i) the date that is at least six months after termination of the Executive s
employment for reasons other than the Executive s death, (ii) the date of the Executive s
death, or (iii) any earlier date that does not result in additional tax or interest to the
Executive under section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement would subject the Executive
to additional tax or interest under section 409A, the Employer shall reform the provision.
However, the Employer shall maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of
the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and
the Employer shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of
the reformed provision. 

21) 
 
 Miscellaneous Provisions. 

a) 
 
 Choice of Law . This Agreement is made with reference to and is
intended to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. 

b) 
 
 Payment of Legal Fees . Employer is aware that after a Change in Control
management could cause or attempt to cause Employer to refuse to comply with the
obligations under this Agreement, or could institute or cause or attempt to cause
Employer to institute litigation seeking to have this Agreement declared unenforceable,
or could take or attempt to take other action to deny Executive the benefits intended
under this Agreement. In these circumstances the purpose of this Agreement would be
frustrated. It is Employer s intention that the Executive not be required to incur the
expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under this Agreement, whether by
litigation or other legal action, because the cost and expense thereof would
substantially detract from the benefits intended to be granted to the Executive
hereunder. It is Employer s intention that the Executive not be forced to negotiate
settlement of his rights under this Agreement under threat of incurring expenses.
Accordingly, if after a Change in Control occurs it appears to the Executive that (a)
Employer has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b)
Employer or any other person has taken any action to declare this Agreement void or
unenforceable, or 

11 

instituted any litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to
recover from the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive
hereunder, Employer irrevocably authorize the Executive from time to time to retain
counsel of his choice, at Employer s expense as provided in this paragraph (b), to
represent the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any litigation
or other legal action, whether by or against Employer or any director, officer,
stockholder, or other person affiliated with Employer, in any jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any existing or previous attorney-client relationship between Employer
and any counsel chosen by the Executive under this paragraph (b), Employer irrevocably
consents to the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that
counsel, and Employer and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall
exist between the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel selected
from time to time by the Executive as provided in this section shall be paid or
reimbursed to the Executive by Employer on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation
by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance
with such counsel s customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 500,000,
whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not incurred in trial, bankruptcy, or
appellate proceedings. Employer s obligation to pay the Executive s legal fees provided
by this paragraph (b) operates separately from and in addition to any legal fee
reimbursement obligation Employer may have with the Executive under any separate
severance, employment, salary continuation, or other agreement. Anything in this
paragraph (b) to the contrary notwithstanding however, Employer shall not be required to
pay or reimburse the Executive s legal expenses if doing so would violate section 18(k)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and Rule 359.3 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation 12 CFR 359.3 . 

c) 
 
 Successors . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and each of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns. 

d) 
 
 Amendment . This Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by
the Parties. 

e) 
 
 Headings . The headings of sections of this Agreement have been
included for convenience of reference only. They shall not be construed to modify or
otherwise affect in any respect any of the provisions of the Agreement. 

f) 
 
 Counsel Review . Executive acknowledges that he has had the opportunity
to consult with independent counsel with respect to the negotiation, preparation, and
execution of this Agreement. 

12 

g) 
 
 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. The invalidity
of any provision will not affect the validity of other provisions of this Agreement. 

EXECUTED by each of the Parties effective as of the date first stated above.

Continuation Agreement and, as amended, to restate the Salary Continuation
Agreement in its entirety,

 WHEREAS, none of the conditions or events included in the definition of
the term "golden parachute payment" that is contained in section 18(k)(4)(A)(ii)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1828(k)(4)(A)(ii)] and in
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Rule 359.1(f)(1)(ii) [12 CFR
359.1(f)(1)(ii)] exists or, to the best knowledge of the Bank, is contemplated
insofar as the Bank is concerned, and

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that this Agreement shall be considered
an unfunded arrangement maintained primarily to provide supplemental retirement
benefits for the Executive, and to be considered a non-qualified benefit plan
for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"). The Executive is fully advised of the Bank's financial status.

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Executive and the Bank hereby agree as follows.

 ARTICLE 1
 DEFINITIONS

 1.1 "ACCRUAL BALANCE" means the liability that should be accrued by the
Bank under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the Bank's
obligation to the Executive under this Agreement, applying Accounting Principles

Accrual Balance shall be calculated such that when it is credited with interest
each month the Accrual Balance at Normal Retirement Age equals the present value
of the normal retirement benefits. The discount rate means the rate used by the
Plan Administrator for determining the Accrual Balance. The rate is based on the
yield on a 20-year corporate bond rated Aa by Moody's, rounded to the nearest

a group acquires from Intermountain Community Bancorp assets having a total
gross fair market value equal to or exceeding 40 of the total gross fair market
value of all of Intermountain Community Bancorp's assets immediately before the

must submit proof to the Plan Administrator of the Social Security
Administration's or provider's determination.

 1.7 "EARLY TERMINATION" means the Executive's Separation from Service with

Agreement, applicable laws include any statute, rule, regulatory order,

or body having regulatory authority over the Bank, or

 (e) the occurrence of any event that results in the Executive being

 ARTICLE 2
 LIFETIME BENEFITS

 2.1 NORMAL RETIREMENT. Unless Separation from Service occurs before Normal
Retirement Age, when the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age the Bank shall
pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.1 instead of any
other benefit under this Agreement. If the Executive's Separation from Service
thereafter is a Termination for Cause or if this Agreement terminates under
Article 5, no further benefits shall be paid.

 2.1.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.1 is
 110,963.

 2.1.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the month immediately after the
 month in which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank
 shall pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.2 EARLY TERMINATION. If Early Termination occurs before Normal
Retirement Age but ten years or more after the Effective Date, the Bank shall
pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.2 instead of any
other benefit under this Agreement. If Early Termination occurs within ten years
after the Effective Date, no benefit shall be payable under this Agreement.
Additionally, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement if the
Executive's employment is terminated under circumstances described in Article 5
of this Agreement. Neither the Bank nor the Executive shall be entitled to elect
in the 24-month period after a Change in Control between the benefit under this
section 2.2 versus the benefit under section 2.4. If the Executive's Separation
from Service within 24 months after a Change in Control is an involuntary
termination other than for Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good Reason, no
benefit shall be payable under this section 2.2 and the Executive shall instead
be entitled to the benefit under section 2.4 (unless the Change in Control is
the result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that the Bank
should be sold) or, if the Executive first attained Normal Retirement Age,
section 2.1.

 4

2.2.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.2 is
 calculated as the amount that fully amortizes the Accrual Balance
 existing at the end of the month immediately before the month in
 which Separation from Service occurs, amortizing that Accrual
 Balance over the ten-year period beginning with the Executive's
 Normal Retirement Age and taking into account interest at the
 discount rate or rates established by the Plan Administrator.

 2.2.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the later of (i) the seventh
 month after the month in which the Executive's Separation from
 Service occurs, or (ii) the month immediately after the month in
 which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall
 pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.3 DISABILITY. For Separation from Service because of Disability before
Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall pay to the Executive the benefit described
in this section 2.3 instead of any other benefit under this Agreement.

 2.3.1 Amount of benefit. The annual benefit under this section 2.3 is
 calculated as the amount that fully amortizes the Accrual Balance
 existing at the end of the month immediately before the month in
 which Separation from Service occurs, amortizing that Accrual
 Balance over the ten-year period beginning with the Executive's
 Normal Retirement Age and taking into account interest at the
 discount rate or rates established by the Plan Administrator.

 2.3.2 Payment of benefit. Beginning with the later of (i) the seventh
 month after the month in which the Executive's Separation from
 Service occurs, or (ii) the month immediately after the month in
 which the Executive attains Normal Retirement Age, the Bank shall
 pay the annual benefit to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
 installments on the first day of each month. The annual benefit
 shall be paid to the Executive for ten years.

 2.4 CHANGE-IN-CONTROL. If the Executive's Separation from Service is an
involuntary termination without Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good
Reason, in either case within 24 months after a Change in Control, the Bank
shall pay to the Executive the benefit described in this section 2.4 instead of
any other benefit under this Agreement, unless the Change in Control is the
result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that the Bank should
be sold. No benefits shall be payable under this Agreement if the Executive's
employment is terminated under circumstances described in Article 5 of this
Agreement. Neither the Bank nor the Executive shall be entitled to elect in the
24-month period after a Change in Control between the benefit under this section
2.4 versus the Early Termination benefit under section 2.2. If the Executive's
Separation from Service within 24 months after a Change in Control is an
involuntary termination without Cause or a Voluntary Termination with Good
Reason, no benefit shall be payable under section 2.2 and the Executive shall
instead be entitled to the benefit under this section 2.4, unless the Change in
Control is the result of a written supervisory determination by the FDIC that
the Bank should be sold. But if the Executive shall have attained Normal
Retirement Age when Separation from Service within 24 months after a Change in
Control occurs, whether Separation from Service is voluntary or involuntary for
any reason other than Termination for Cause, the Executive shall be entitled
solely to the benefit provided by section 2.1, not this section 2.4.

 2.4.1 Amount of benefit. The benefit under this section 2.4 is the Normal
 Retirement Age Accrual Balance required by section 2.1, discounting
 the Normal Retirement Age Accrual Balance to present value using a
 discount rate selected by the Plan Administrator, but the

 5

discount rate selected by the Plan Administrator shall not exceed
 the discount rate employed at the time of the Change in Control for
 purposes of calculating the Accrual Balance.

 2.4.2 Payment of benefit. The Bank shall pay the benefit under this
 section 2.4 to the Executive in a single lump sum on the first day
 of the seventh month after the month in which the Executive's
 Separation from Service occurs.

 2.5 LUMP-SUM PAYOUT OF REMAINING NORMAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT, EARLY
TERMINATION BENEFIT, OR DISABILITY BENEFIT WHEN A CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS. If a
Change in Control occurs while the Executive is receiving the Normal Retirement
Age benefit under section 2.1, the Bank shall pay the remaining salary
continuation benefits to the Executive in a single lump sum on the date of the
Change in Control. If a Change in Control occurs after Separation from Service
but while the Executive is receiving or is entitled at Normal Retirement Age to
receive the Early Termination benefit under section 2.2 or the Disability
benefit under section 2.3, the Bank shall pay the remaining salary continuation
benefits to the Executive in a single lump sum on the later of (i) the date of
the Change in Control or (ii) the first day of the seventh month after the month
in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs. The lump-sum payment
due to the Executive as a result of a Change in Control shall be an amount equal
to the Accrual Balance amount corresponding to the particular benefit when the
Change in Control occurs.

 2.6 ANNUAL BENEFIT STATEMENT. Within 120 days after the end of each Plan
Year the Plan Administrator shall provide or cause to be provided to the
Executive an annual benefit statement showing benefits payable or potentially
payable to the Executive under this Agreement. Each annual benefit statement
shall supersede the previous year's annual benefit statement. If there is a
contradiction between this Agreement and the annual benefit statement concerning
the amount of a particular benefit payable or potentially payable to the
Executive under sections 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 hereof, the amount of the benefit
determined under the Agreement shall control.

 2.7 SAVINGS CLAUSE RELATING TO COMPLIANCE WITH CODE SECTION 409A. Despite
any contrary provision of this Agreement, if when the Executive's employment
terminates the Executive is a specified employee, as defined in Code section
409A, and if any payments under Article 2 of this Agreement will result in
additional tax or interest to the Executive because of section 409A, the
Executive shall not be entitled to the payments under Article 2 until the
earliest of (i) the date that is at least six months after termination of the
Executive's employment for reasons other than the Executive's death, (ii) the
date of the Executive's death, or (iii) any earlier date that does not result in
additional tax or interest to the Executive under section 409A. If any provision
of this Agreement would subject the Executive to additional tax or interest
under section 409A, the Bank shall reform the provision. However, the Bank shall
maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable
provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and
the Bank shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a
result of the reformed provision.

 2.8 ONE BENEFIT ONLY. Despite anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Executive and Beneficiary are entitled to one benefit only under this
Agreement, which shall be determined by the first event to occur that is dealt
with by this Agreement. Except as provided in section 2.5 or Article 3,
subsequent occurrence of events dealt with by this Agreement shall not entitle
the Executive or Beneficiary to other or additional benefits under this
Agreement.

 6

ARTICLE 3
 DEATH BENEFITS

 3.1 DEATH BEFORE SEPARATION FROM SERVICE AND NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If the
Executive dies in active service to the Bank before Normal Retirement Age, at
the Executive's death the Executive's Beneficiary shall be entitled solely to
the benefit, if any, provided by the Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement
attached to this Agreement as Addendum A instead of any benefit payable under
this Agreement. If the Executive dies after Separation from Service or after
attaining Normal Retirement Age, the Executive's Beneficiary shall be entitled
to no benefits under the Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement attached to this
Agreement as Addendum A.

 3.2 DEATH AFTER SEPARATION FROM SERVICE OR NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE. If the
Executive dies after Normal Retirement Age or after Separation from Service
occurring at any age, at the Executive's death the Executive's Beneficiary shall
be entitled to the benefits, if any, that would have been payable to the
Executive under Article 2 had the Executive survived. The benefits shall be
payable to the Executive's Beneficiary in the same amounts they would have been
paid to the Executive had the Executive survived, except that payments shall
commence in the month after the Executive's death.

 3.3 CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PAYOUT OF BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 3.2. If a Change in
Control occurs while the Executive's Beneficiary is receiving the benefit
provided by section 3.2, the Bank shall pay the remaining benefits to the
Executive's Beneficiary in a single lump sum within three days after the Change
in Control. The lump-sum payment shall be an amount equal to the Accrual Balance
amount corresponding to the benefit being paid.

 ARTICLE 4
 BENEFICIARIES

 4.1 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS. The Executive shall have the right to
designate at any time a Beneficiary to receive any benefits payable under this
Agreement at the Executive's death. The Beneficiary designated under this
Agreement may be the same as or different from the beneficiary designation under
any other benefit plan of the Bank in which the Executive participates.

 4.2 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION: CHANGE. The Executive shall designate a
Beneficiary by completing and signing the Beneficiary Designation Form and
delivering it to the Plan Administrator or its designated agent. The Executive's
Beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the Beneficiary
predeceases the Executive or if the Executive names a spouse as Beneficiary and
the marriage is subsequently dissolved. The Executive shall have the right to
change a Beneficiary by completing, signing, and otherwise complying with the
terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and the Plan Administrator's rules and
procedures, as in effect from time to time. Upon the acceptance by the Plan
Administrator of a new Beneficiary Designation Form, all Beneficiary
designations previously filed shall be cancelled. The Plan Administrator shall
be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary Designation Form filed by the
Executive and accepted by the Plan Administrator before the Executive's death.

 4.3 ACKNOWLEDGMENT. No designation or change in designation of a
Beneficiary shall be effective until received, accepted, and acknowledged in
writing by the Plan Administrator or its designated agent.

 4.4 NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. If the Executive dies without a valid
beneficiary designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the
Executive, then the Executive's spouse shall be the designated Beneficiary. If
the Executive has no surviving spouse, the benefits shall be made to the
personal representative of the Executive's estate.

 7

4.5 FACILITY OF PAYMENT. If a benefit is payable to a minor, to a person
declared incapacitated, or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of
his or her property, the Bank may pay the benefit to the guardian, legal
representative, or person having the care or custody of the minor, incapacitated
person, or incapable person. The Bank may require proof of incapacity, minority,
or guardianship as it may deem appropriate before distribution of the benefit.
Distribution shall completely discharge the Bank from all liability for the
benefit.

 ARTICLE 5
 GENERAL LIMITATIONS

 5.1 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Despite any contrary provision of this
Agreement, the Bank shall not pay any benefit under this Agreement and this
Agreement shall terminate if Separation from Service is a Termination for Cause
or if Separation from Service is an Early Termination occurring within ten years
after the Effective Date. Likewise, the Beneficiary shall be entitled to no
benefits under the Split Dollar Agreement attached to this Agreement as Addendum
A and the Split Dollar Agreement also shall terminate if Separation from Service
is a Termination for Cause or if Separation from Service is an Early Termination
occurring within ten years after the Effective Date.

 5.2 MISSTATEMENT. The Bank shall not pay any benefit under this Agreement
and the Beneficiary shall be entitled to no benefits under the Split Dollar
Agreement attached as Addendum A if the Executive makes any material
misstatement of fact on any application or resume provided to the Bank or on any
application for benefits provided by the Bank.

 5.3 REMOVAL. If the Executive is removed from office or permanently
prohibited from participating in the Bank's affairs by an order issued under
section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.
1818(e)(4) or (g)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the effective date of the order, and the Split Dollar Agreement
also shall terminate as of the effective date of the order.

 5.4 DEFAULT. Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, if the Bank
is in "default" or "in danger of default," as those terms are defined in section
3(x) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(x), all obligations
under this Agreement shall terminate.

 5.5 FDIC OPEN-BANK ASSISTANCE. All obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate, except to the extent determined that continuation of the contract is
necessary for the continued operation of the Bank, when the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on
behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in Federal Deposit Insurance
Act section 13(c). 12 U.S.C. 1823(c). Rights of the parties that have already
vested shall not be affected by such action, however.

ARTICLE 7
 ADMINISTRATION OF AGREEMENT

 7.1 PLAN ADMINISTRATOR DUTIES. This Agreement shall be administered by a
Plan Administrator consisting of the board or such committee or person(s) as the
board shall appoint. The Executive may be a member of the Plan Administrator.
The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretion and authority to (i) make,
amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the
administration of this Agreement and (ii) decide or resolve any and all
questions, including interpretations of this Agreement, as may arise in
connection with the Agreement.

 7.2 AGENTS. In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan
Administrator may employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties
as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and
may from time to time consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the Bank.

 7.3 BINDING EFFECT OF DECISIONS. The decision or action of the Plan
Administrator concerning any question arising out of the administration,
interpretation, and application of the Agreement and the rules and regulations
promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons
having any interest in the Agreement. No Executive or Beneficiary shall be
deemed to have any right, vested or non-vested, regarding the continued use of
any previously adopted assumptions, including but not limited to the discount
rate and calculation method employed in the determination of the Accrual
Balance.

 7.4 INDEMNITY OF PLAN ADMINISTRATOR. The Bank shall indemnify and hold
harmless the members of the Plan Administrator against any and all claims,
losses, damages, expenses, or liabilities arising from any action or failure to
act with respect to this Agreement, except in the case of willful misconduct by
the Plan Administrator or any of its members.

 7.5 BANK INFORMATION. To enable the Plan Administrator to perform its
functions, the Bank shall supply full and timely information to the Plan
Administrator on all matters relating to the date and circumstances of the
retirement, Disability, death, or Separation from Service of the Executive, and
such other pertinent information as the Plan Administrator may reasonably
require.

 ARTICLE 8
 MISCELLANEOUS

 8.1 AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION. Subject to section 8.15 of this Agreement,
this Agreement may be amended solely by a written agreement signed by the Bank
and by the Executive, and except for termination occurring under Article 5 this
Agreement may be terminated solely by a written agreement signed by the Bank and
by the Executive.

 8.2 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall bind the Executive, the Bank, and
their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, successors, administrators, and
transferees.

 8.3 NO GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT. This Agreement is not an employment policy
or contract. It does not give the Executive the right to remain an employee of
the Bank nor does it interfere with the Bank's right to discharge the Executive.
It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee or interfere with
the Executive's right to terminate employment at any time.

 11

8.4 NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Benefits under this Agreement may not be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, attached, or encumbered.

 8.5 SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT. By an assumption agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Executive, the Bank shall require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Bank to expressly
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Bank would be required to perform this Agreement had no
succession occurred.

 8.6 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Bank shall withhold any taxes that are required
to be withheld from the benefits provided under this Agreement.

 8.7 APPLICABLE LAW. Except to the extent preempted by the laws of the
United States of America, the validity, interpretation, construction, and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Idaho, without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws of such state.

 8.8 UNFUNDED ARRANGEMENT. The Executive and the Beneficiary are general
unsecured creditors of the Bank for the payment of benefits under this
Agreement. The benefits represent the mere promise by the Bank to pay benefits.
The rights to benefits are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by
creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life is a general asset of the Bank
to which the Executive and Beneficiary have no preferred or secured claim.

 8.9 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, such
invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and each such
other provision shall continue in full force and effect to the full extent
consistent with law. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid in part,
such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of the provision, and the
remainder of such provision together with all other provisions of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect to the full extent consistent with law.

 8.10 HEADINGS. The headings of sections herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision of this Agreement.

 8.11 NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
delivered by hand or mailed, certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, with postage prepaid. Unless otherwise changed by notice, notice
shall be properly addressed to the Executive if addressed to the address of the
Executive on the books and records of the Bank at the time of the delivery of
such notice, and properly addressed to the Bank if addressed to the Board of
Directors, Panhandle State Bank, Third and Oak Streets, Sandpoint, Idaho 83864.

 8.12 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Split Dollar Agreement
attached as Addendum A constitute the entire agreement between the Bank and the
Executive concerning the subject matter. No rights are granted to the Executive
under this Agreement other than those specifically set forth. The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement satisfies in full Intermountain
Community Bancorp's and the Bank's obligation to provide a salary continuation
plan for the benefit of the Executive, which obligation is stated in section 7
of the Executive Employment Agreement dated as of December 17, 2003 by and among
the Executive, Intermountain Community Bancorp, and the Bank, as the same may be
amended.

 12

8.13 PAYMENT OF LEGAL FEES. The Bank is aware that after a Change in
Control management of the Bank could cause or attempt to cause the Bank to
refuse to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, or institute or
cause or attempt to cause the Bank to institute litigation seeking to have this
Agreement declared unenforceable, or take or attempt to take other action to
deny the Executive the benefits intended under this Agreement. In these
circumstances the purpose of this Agreement would be frustrated. The Bank
desires that the Executive not be required to incur the expenses associated with
the enforcement of rights under this Agreement by litigation or other legal
action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the
benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. The Bank desires
that the Executive not be required to negotiate any settlement of rights under
threat of incurring expenses. Accordingly, if after a Change in Control (i) it
appears to the Executive that the Bank has failed to comply with any of its
obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) the Bank or any other person takes any
action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any
litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to recover from
the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder,
the Bank irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain
counsel of the Executive's choice, at the Bank's expense as provided in this
section 8.13, to represent the Executive in any litigation or other legal
action, whether by or against the Bank or any director, officer, stockholder, or
other person affiliated with the Bank, in any jurisdiction. Despite any existing
or previous attorney-client relationship between the Bank and any counsel chosen
by the Executive under this section 8.13, the Bank irrevocably consents to the
Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that counsel, and
the Bank and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist
between the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel
selected from time to time by the Executive as herein above provided shall be
paid or reimbursed to the Executive by the Bank on a regular, periodic basis
upon presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such
counsel in accordance with such counsel's customary practices, up to a maximum
aggregate amount of 500,000, whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not
incurred in trial, bankruptcy, or appellate proceedings. The Bank's obligation
to pay the Executive's legal fees provided by this section 8.13 operates
separately from and in addition to any legal fee reimbursement obligation the
Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp may have with the Executive under any
separate employment, severance, or other agreement. Despite anything in this
Agreement to the contrary however, the Bank shall not be required to pay or
reimburse the Executive's legal expenses if doing so would violate section 18(k)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1828(k)] and Rule 359.3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [12 CFR 359.3].

 8.14 EXCISE TAX UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTIONS 280G AND 4999. (a)
Partial reimbursement of the Excise Tax. If a Change in Control occurs the
Executive may become entitled to acceleration of benefits under this Agreement
or under another plan or agreement of or with the Bank or Intermountain
Community Bancorp, including accelerated vesting of stock options and
acceleration of benefits under any other benefit, compensation, or incentive
plan or arrangement with the Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp
(collectively, the "Total Benefits"). If a Change in Control occurs,
Intermountain Community Bancorp and the Bank shall cause the certified public
accounting firm retained by Intermountain Community Bancorp as of the date
immediately before the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") to calculate
the Total Benefits and any excise tax payable by the Executive under Code
sections 280G and 4999 based upon the Total Benefits. If the Accounting Firm
determines that an excise tax is payable, at the same time the Bank pays the
Change in Control benefit under section 2.4 of this Agreement the Bank shall
also pay or cause to be paid to the Executive an amount in cash equal to the
excise tax calculated by the Accounting Firm (the "Excise Tax"). The Executive
acknowledges and agrees that this section 8.14 provides for partial
reimbursement only of the final excise tax that may be payable by him, and that
additional unreimbursed excise taxes may be payable after taking into account
the reimbursement payment provided under this section 8.14. The partial

 13

reimbursement of the excise tax under this section 8.14 shall be made in
addition to the amount set forth in section 2.4.

 (b) Calculating the Excise Tax. For purposes of determining whether any of
the Total Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and for purposes of
determining the amount of the Excise Tax,

 1) Determination of "parachute payments" subject to the Excise Tax: any
 other payments or benefits received or to be received by the
 Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the Executive's
 Separation from Service (whether under the terms of this Agreement
 or any other agreement, stock option plan or any other benefit plan
 or arrangement with the Bank or Intermountain Community Bancorp, any
 person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any person
 affiliated with the Bank, Intermountain Community Bancorp, or such
 person) shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning
 of Code section 280G(b)(2), and all "excess parachute payments"
 within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject
 to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the Accounting Firm such
 other payments or benefits do not constitute (in whole or in part)
 parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments represent (in
 whole or in part) reasonable compensation for services actually
 rendered within the meaning of Code section 280G(b)(4) in excess of
 the base amount (as defined in Code section 280G(b)(3)), or are
 otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,

 2) Calculation of benefits subject to the Excise Tax: the amount of the
 Total Benefits that shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax
 shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of the Total
 Benefits reduced by the amount of such Total Benefits that in the
 opinion of the Accounting Firm are not parachute payments, or (ii)
 the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of
 section 280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (1), above), and

 3) Value of noncash benefits and deferred payments: the value of any
 noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
 determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles
 of Code sections 280G(d)(3) and (4).

 (c) Assumed marginal income tax rate. For purposes of determining the
amount of the partial Excise Tax reimbursement payment to be made under this
section 8.14, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which
the partial Excise Tax reimbursement under this section 8.14 is to be made and
state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the
state and locality of the Executive's residence on the date of Separation from
Service, net of the reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from
deduction of such state and local taxes (calculated by assuming that any
reduction under Code section 68 in the amount of itemized deductions allowable
to the Executive applies first to reduce the amount of such state and local
income taxes that would otherwise be deductible by the Executive, and applicable
federal FICA and Medicare withholding taxes).

 (d) Accounting firm's determinations are final and binding. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this section 8.14 shall be
final and binding on the Bank, Intermountain Community Bancorp, and the
Executive. All determinations required to be made under this section 8.14 -
including the assumptions used to calculate Total Benefits and the Excise Tax -
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Bank and the Executive.

 14

8.15 TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN TAX
STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS. The Bank is entering into this Agreement on the
assumption that certain existing tax statutes, rules, and regulations will
continue in effect in their current form. If that assumption materially changes
and the change has a material detrimental effect on this Agreement, the Bank
reserves the right to terminate or modify this Agreement accordingly, subject to
obtaining the written consent of the Executive, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. This section 8.15 shall become null and void effective immediately
upon a Change in Control.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and a duly authorized Bank officer have
executed this Amended Salary Continuation Agreement as of the date first written
above.

 THIS SPLIT DOLLAR AGREEMENT is entered into as of this ____ day of
____ , 2003, by and between Panhandle State Bank, an Idaho-chartered,

Jerrold B. Smith, President of the Bank (the "Executive"). This Split Dollar
Agreement shall append the Split Dollar Policy Endorsement entered into on even
date herewith, or as subsequently amended, by and between the aforementioned
parties.

 To encourage the Executive to remain an employee of the Bank, the Bank
is willing to divide the death proceeds of a life insurance policy on the
Executive's life to be effective until the Executive's Normal Retirement Age of
60. The Bank will pay life insurance premiums from its general assets.

 ARTICLE 1
 GENERAL DEFINITIONS

 Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Split Dollar Agreement
are used herein as defined in the Salary Continuation Agreement dated as of the
date of this Split Dollar Agreement between the Bank and the Executive. The
following terms shall have the meanings specified:

 1.1 Administrator means the administrator described in Article 7.

 1.2 Executive's Interest means the benefit set forth in Section
 2.2.

 issued by the Insurer(s).

 1.7 Split Dollar Policy Endorsement means the form required by the
 Administrator or the Insurer to indicate the Executive's
 interest, if any, in a Policy on the Executive's life.

 ARTICLE 2
 POLICY OWNERSHIP/INTERESTS

 2.1 Bank Ownership. The Bank is the sole owner of the Policy and
shall have the right to exercise all incidents of ownership. The Bank shall be
the beneficiary of any death proceeds remaining after the Executive's interest
has been paid under Section 2.2 of this Split Dollar Agreement.

 2.2 Executive's Interest. The Executive shall have the right to
designate the beneficiary(ies) of the Executive's Interest, which shall be an
amount equal to 833,913 of the Net Death Proceeds. The Executive shall also have
the right to elect and change settlement options specified in the Policy that
may be permitted. However, the Executive, the Executive's transferee, or the
Executive's beneficiary(ies) shall have no rights or interests in the Policy for
that portion of the death proceeds designated in this Section 2.2 if the
Executive is not in the full-time employment of the Bank at the time of death,
except for reason of a leave of absence approved by the Bank, or if benefits
under the Salary Continuation Agreement of even date herewith are denied under
Article 5 of that Salary Continuation Agreement.

 2.3 Option to Purchase. The Bank shall not sell, surrender, or
transfer ownership of the Policy while this Split Dollar Agreement is in effect
without first giving the Executive or the Executive's transferee a right of
first refusal to purchase the Policy for the Policy's interpolated terminal
reserve value. The right of first refusal to

purchase the Policy must be exercised within 60 days from the date the Bank
gives written notice of the Bank's intention to sell, surrender or transfer
ownership of the Policy. This provision shall not impair the right of the Bank
to terminate this Split Dollar Agreement.

 2.4 Comparable Coverage. Upon execution of this Split Dollar
Agreement, the Bank shall maintain the Policy in full force and effect, and the
Bank shall not amend, terminate, or otherwise abrogate the Executive's interest
in the Policy unless the Bank (a) replaces the Policy with a comparable
insurance policy to cover the benefit provided under this Split Dollar Agreement
and (b) executes a new Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement for the comparable
insurance policy. The Policy or any comparable policy shall be subject to the
claims of the Bank's creditors.

 ARTICLE 3
 PREMIUMS

 3.1 Premium Payment. The Bank shall pay any premiums due on the
Policy.

 3.2 Imputed Income. The Bank shall impute income to the Executive

authority.

Policy and in this Split Dollar Agreement to any person, entity, or trust. If

party hereunder, and the Executive shall have no further interest in the Policy
or in this Split Dollar Agreement.

 8.1 Amendment and Termination. Subject to Section 8.11 of this
Split Dollar Agreement, this Split Dollar Agreement may be amended or terminated
solely by a writing signed by the Bank and the Executive. However, this Split
Dollar Agreement will terminate automatically and the Executive's interest shall
be forfeited if benefits under the Salary Continuation Agreement are neither

discharge the Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an

time.

 4

8.4 Successors; Binding Agreement. By an assumption agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, the Bank shall require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Bank to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Split Dollar Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be required to perform this
Split Dollar Agreement if no succession had occurred. The Bank's failure to
obtain such an assumption agreement before succession becomes effective shall be
considered a breach of the Split Dollar Agreement and shall entitle the
Executive to the Change-in-Control Benefits payable under Section 2.4 of the
Salary Continuation Agreement between the Bank and the Executive of even date
herewith.

 8.5 Applicable Law. The Split Dollar Agreement and all rights

Continuation Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Bank and the
Executive concerning the subject matter hereof. No rights are granted to the
Executive under this Split Dollar Agreement other than those specifically set
forth herein.

 8.7 Severability. If for any reason any provision of this Split
Dollar Agreement is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other
provision of this Split Dollar Agreement not held invalid, and to the full
extent consistent with the law each such other provision shall continue in full
force and effect. If any provision of this Split Dollar Agreement is held
invalid in part, such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of such
provision, and to the full extent consistent with the law the remainder of such
provision, together with all other provisions of this Split Dollar Agreement,
shall continue in full force and effect.

 8.8 Headings. The caption headings herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision of this Split Dollar Agreement.

 8.9 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if delivered by hand or mailed, certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, with postage prepaid, to the following addresses or to such
other address as either party may designate by like notice.

 (a) If to the Bank, to:
 Board of Directors
 Panhandle State Bank
 Third and Oak Streets
 Sandpoint, Idaho 83864

 (b) If to the Executive,
 to: Jerrold B. Smith
 Panhandle State Bank
 Third and Oak Streets
 Sandpoint, Idaho 83864

and to such other or additional person or persons as either party shall have
designated to the other party in writing by like notice.

 8.10 IRC Section 1035 Exchanges. The Executive recognizes and
agrees that the Bank may after this Split Dollar Agreement is adopted wish to
exchange the Policy for another contract of life insurance insuring the
Executive's life. Provided that the Policy is replaced (or intended to be
replaced) with a comparable policy of life insurance consistent with the
requirements of section 2.4 herein, the Executive agrees to provide medical
information and cooperate with medical insurance-related testing required by a
prospective Insurer for implementing the Policy or, if necessary, for modifying
or updating to a comparable Insurer per section 2.4. The Executive's

 5

inability to pass an insurability determination for purposes of obtaining a
comparable replacement Policy does not permit the Bank to abrogate the
Executive's interest in the Policy without the Executive's consent.

 8.11 Termination or Modification of Split Dollar Agreement Because
of Changes in Tax Statutes, Rules, or Regulations. The Bank is entering into
this Split Dollar Agreement on the assumption that certain existing tax
statutes, rules, and regulations will continue in effect in their current form.
If that assumption materially changes and the change has a material detrimental
effect on this Split Dollar Agreement, the Bank reserves the right to terminate
or modify this Split Dollar Agreement accordingly, subject to obtaining the
written consent of the Executive, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. This
Section 8.11 shall become null and void effective immediately upon a Change in
Control.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Bank and the Executive have executed this Split
Dollar Agreement as of the date first written above.

 Calculating the Excise Tax . For purposes of determining whether any
of the Total Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and for purposes of
determining the amount of the Excise Tax, 

1) Determination of Parachute Payments Subject to the Excise Tax : any other payments
or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in
Control or the Executive s Termination of Employment (whether under the terms of this
Agreement or any other agreement, stock option plan or any other benefit plan or
arrangement with PSB or IMCB, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or
any person affiliated with PSB, IMCB, or such person) shall be treated as parachute
payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
all excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) shall be
treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the Accounting Firm such
other payments or benefits do not constitute (in whole or in part) parachute payments,
or such excess parachute payments represent (in whole or in part) reasonable
compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4) of
the Internal Revenue Code in excess (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code), or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, 

2) Calculation of Benefits Subject to Excise Tax : the amount of the Total Benefits that
shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the
total amount of the Total Benefits reduced by the amount of such Total Benefits that in
the opinion of the Accounting Firm are not parachute payments, or (b) the amount of
excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) (after applying
clause (i), above), and 

3) Value of Noncash Benefits and Deferred Payments : the value of any noncash benefits
or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue
Code. 

e) 
 
 Assumed Marginal Income Tax Rate . For purposes of determining the
amount of the partial Excise Tax reimbursement payment to be made under Sub-section
c), the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal
rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the partial Excise Tax
reimbursement under Sub-section c) is to be made and state and local income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive s
residence on the date of Termination of Employment, net of the reduction in federal
income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes
(calculated by assuming that any reduction under section 68 of the Internal Revenue
Code in the amount of itemized deductions allowable to the Executive applies first to
reduce the amount of such state and local income taxes that would 

3 

otherwise be deductible by the Executive, and applicable federal FICA and Medicare withholding
taxes). 

f) 
 
 Accounting Firm s Determinations Are Final and Binding . All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 3 shall be final and
binding on PSB, IMCB, and the Executive. All determinations required to be made under

 General Provisions . 

a) 
 
 Choice of Law . This Agreement is made with reference to and is
intended to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. 

b) 
 
 Payment of Legal Fees . PSB and IMCB are aware that after a Change in
Control management could cause or attempt to cause PSB and IMCB to refuse to comply
with the obligations under this Agreement, or could institute or cause or attempt to
cause PSB or IMCB to institute litigation seeking to have this Agreement declared
unenforceable, or could take or attempt to take other action to deny Executive the 

7 

benefits intended under this Agreement. In these circumstances the purpose of this
Agreement would be frustrated. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the Executive not
be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of
his rights under this Agreement, whether by litigation or other legal action, because
the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to
be granted to the Executive hereunder. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the
Executive not be forced to negotiate settlement of his rights under this Agreement
under threat of incurring expenses. Accordingly, if after a Change in Control occurs
it appears to the Executive that (a) either of PSB or IMCB has failed to comply with
any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b) either of PSB or IMCB or any other
person has taken any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or
instituted any litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to
recover from the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive
hereunder, PSB and IMCB irrevocably authorize the Executive from time to time to retain
counsel of his choice, at PSB s and IMCB s expense as provided in this paragraph (b),
to represent the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against PSB or IMCB or any director,
officer, stockholder, or other person affiliated with PSB or IMCB, in any jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any existing or previous attorney-client relationship between PSB or
IMCB and any counsel chosen by the Executive under this paragraph (b), PSB and IMCB
irrevocably consent to the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with
that counsel, and PSB and IMCB and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship
shall exist between the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel
selected from time to time by the Executive as provided in this section shall be paid
or reimbursed to the Executive by PSB or IMCB on a regular, periodic basis upon
presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in
accordance with such counsel s customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of
 300,000, whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not incurred in trial,
bankruptcy, or appellate proceedings. PSB s and IMCB s obligation to pay the
Executive s legal fees provided by this paragraph (b) operates separately from and in
addition to any legal fee reimbursement obligation PSB or IMCB may have with the
Executive under any separate severance, employment, salary continuation, or other
agreement. Anything in this paragraph (b) to the contrary notwithstanding however, PSB
and IMCB shall not be required to pay or reimburse the Executive s legal expenses if
doing so would violate section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C.
1828(k) and Rule 359.3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 12 CFR 359.3 . 

c) 
 
 Successors . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and each of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns. 

8 

d) 
 
 Amendment . This Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by
the Parties. 

e) 
 
 Headings . The headings of sections of this Agreement have been
included for convenience of reference only. They shall not be construed
to modify or otherwise affect in any respect any of the provisions of the Agreement.

5. 
 
 Not an Employment Agreement . Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon Executive the right to employment with PSB. Accordingly, except with respect to
the Severance Payment, this Agreement shall have no effect on the determination of any
compensation payable by PSB to Executive, or upon any of the other terms of Executive s
employment with PSB. The specific arrangements referred to herein are not intended to exclude
any other benefits which may be available to Executive upon a termination of employment with
PSB pursuant to employee benefit plans of PSB or otherwise. 

6.

such case said corporation, bank or other entity shall by operation of law or expressly in
writing assume all obligations of PSB hereunder as fully as if it had been originally made a
party hereto, but may not otherwise assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder. Executive
may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder. 

8. 
 
 Entire Agreement . This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties
concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, including but not limited
to that certain agreement between Executive and PSB dated May 23, 2001 . Accordingly,

executed severance agreement, severance provisions of any employment and/or change-in-control
agreements, whether written or oral, previously entered into with PSB and/or IMCB. 

9. 
 
 Savings Clause Relating to Compliance with Code Section 409A . Despite any contrary provision
of this Agreement, if when the Executive s employment terminates the Executive is a specified
employee, as defined in Code section 409A, and if any payments under Article 3 of this
Agreement will result in additional tax or interest to the Executive because of section 409A,
the Executive shall not be entitled to the payments under Article 3 until the earliest of (i)
the date that is at least six months after termination of the Executive s employment for
reasons other than the Executive s death, (ii) the date of the Executive s death, or (iii) any earlier date that does not result in additional tax
or interest to the Executive under section 409A. If any provision 

5 

of this Agreement would
subject the Executive to additional tax or interest under section 409A, PSB shall reform the
provision. However, PSB shall maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent
of the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and
PSB shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of the
reformed provision. 

10. 
 
 General Provisions . 

a) 
 
 Choice of Law . This Agreement is made with reference to and is
intended to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. 

b) 
 
 Payment of Legal Fees . PSB and IMCB are aware that after a Change in
Control management could cause or attempt to cause PSB and IMCB to refuse to comply
with the obligations under this Agreement, or could institute or cause or attempt to
cause PSB or IMCB to institute litigation seeking to have this Agreement declared
unenforceable, or could take or attempt to take other action to deny Executive the
benefits intended under this Agreement. In these circumstances the purpose of this
Agreement would be frustrated. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the Executive not
be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under
this Agreement, whether by litigation or other legal action, because the cost and
expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be granted
to the Executive hereunder. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the Executive not
be forced to negotiate settlement of his rights under this Agreement under threat of
incurring expenses. Accordingly, if after a Change in Control occurs it appears to
the Executive that (a) either of PSB or IMCB has failed to comply with any of its
obligations under this Agreement, or (b) either of PSB or IMCB or any other person has
taken any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or instituted any
litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to recover from the
Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, PSB and
IMCB irrevocably authorize the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of his
choice, at PSB s and IMCB s expense as provided in this paragraph (b), to represent
the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any litigation or other
legal action, whether by or against PSB or IMCB or any director, officer, stockholder,
or other person affiliated with PSB or IMCB, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any
existing or previous attorney-client relationship between PSB or IMCB and any counsel
chosen by the Executive under this paragraph (b), PSB and IMCB irrevocably consent to
the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that counsel, and PSB
and IMCB and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between
the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel selected from time to
time by the Executive as provided in this section shall be paid or
reimbursed to the Executive by PSB or IMCB on a regular, periodic basis upon
presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in
accordance with 

6 

such counsel s customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of
 250,000, whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not incurred in trial,
bankruptcy, or appellate proceedings. PSB s and IMCB s obligation to pay the
Executive s legal fees provided by this paragraph (b) operates separately from and in
addition to any legal fee reimbursement obligation PSB or IMCB may have with the
Executive under any separate severance, employment, salary continuation, or other
agreement. Anything in this paragraph (b) to the contrary notwithstanding however, PSB
and IMCB shall not be required to pay or reimburse the Executive s legal expenses if
doing so would violate section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C.
1828(k) and Rule 359.3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 12 CFR 359.3 . 

c) 
 
 Successors . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and each of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns. 

d) 
 
 Amendment . This Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by
the Parties. 

e) 
 
 Headings . The headings of sections of this Agreement have been
included for convenience of reference only. They shall not be construed to modify or
otherwise affect in any respect any of the provisions of the Agreement.

10. 
 
 General Provisions . 

a) 
 
 Choice of Law . This Agreement is made with reference to and is
intended to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. 

b) 
 
 Payment of Legal Fees . PSB and IMCB are aware that after a Change in
Control management could cause or attempt to cause PSB and IMCB to refuse to comply
with the obligations under this Agreement, or could institute or cause or attempt to
cause PSB or IMCB to institute litigation seeking to have this Agreement declared
unenforceable, or could take or attempt to take other action to deny Executive the
benefits intended under this Agreement. In these circumstances the purpose of this
Agreement would be frustrated. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the Executive not
be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under
this Agreement, whether by litigation or other legal action, because the cost and
expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be granted
to the Executive hereunder. It is PSB s and IMCB s intention that the Executive not
be forced to negotiate settlement of his rights under this Agreement under threat of
incurring expenses. Accordingly, if after a Change in Control occurs it appears to
the Executive that (a) either of PSB or IMCB has failed to comply with any of its
obligations under this Agreement, or (b) either of PSB or IMCB or any other person has
taken any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or instituted any
litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to recover from the
Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, PSB and
IMCB irrevocably authorize the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of his
choice, at PSB s and IMCB s expense as provided in this paragraph (b), to represent
the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any litigation or other
legal action, whether by or against PSB or IMCB or any director, officer, stockholder,
or other person affiliated with PSB or IMCB, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any
existing or previous attorney-client relationship between PSB or IMCB and any counsel
chosen by the Executive under this paragraph (b), PSB and IMCB irrevocably consent to
the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with that counsel, and PSB
and IMCB and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between
the Executive and that counsel. The fees and expenses of counsel selected from time to
time by the Executive as provided in this section shall be paid or reimbursed to the
Executive by PSB or IMCB on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by the
Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with 

6 

such counsel s customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 250,000,
whether suit be brought or not, and whether or not incurred in trial, bankruptcy, or
appellate proceedings. PSB s and IMCB s obligation to pay the Executive s legal fees
provided by
this paragraph (b) operates separately from and in addition to any legal fee
reimbursement obligation PSB or IMCB may have with the Executive under any separate
severance, employment, salary continuation, or other agreement. Anything in this
paragraph (b) to the contrary notwithstanding however, PSB and IMCB shall not be
required to pay or reimburse the Executive s legal expenses if doing so would violate
section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and Rule 359.3
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 12 CFR 359.3 . 

c) 
 
 Successors . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and each of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns. 

d) 
 
 Amendment . This Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by
the Parties. 

e) 
 
 Headings . The headings of sections of this Agreement have been
included for convenience of reference only. They shall not be construed to modify or
otherwise affect in any respect any of the provisions of the Agreement.
