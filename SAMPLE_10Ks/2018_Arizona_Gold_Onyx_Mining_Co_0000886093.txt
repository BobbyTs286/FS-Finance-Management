NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN 

 Arizona
Gold and Onyx Mining Company (the Company was incorporated November 12, 1986, as a Utah business corporation under
the name of Silver Harvest, Inc. to transact any business authorized under the general corporation law of Utah. In February 1990,
the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Viking Capital Group, Inc. and in May 2010, the Company
changed its name to its current name Arizona Gold and Onyx Mining Company. 

 Pursuant
to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 1, 2001, The Company acquired 25 of the ownership of Beijing Fei Yun Viking Enterprises
Company, Ltd. Fei Yun ), with its principal place of business located in Beijing, China. Twenty-five percent of
this newly formed entity was acquired for common shares of The Company. A total of 7,500,000 common shares were issued directly
to Fei Yun and the remaining 14,000,000 common shares were issued to the owners of the assets that were transferred into Fei Yun
in conjunction with The Company s purchase. The agreement to acquire 25 of Fei Yun was entered into on August 1, 2001 and
was effective on December 3, 2001. The Company purchased an additional 71 of Fei Yun with the issuance of 1,800,000 shares of
The Company s preferred stock. After the acquisition of the additional 71 interest and through the divestiture date, The
Company accounted for its investment in Fei Yun under the consolidation method. 

Effective
January 31, 2003, pursuant to a Stock and Note Receivable For Ownership Agreement dated January 31, 2003, the Company sold its
96 ownership of Fei Yun to Beijing Fei Yun Property Development Company, Ltd. (Fei Yun Property). In exchange for the 96 ownership
of Fei Yun Viking, the Company received 1.8 million shares of its Series 2001 Callable Preferred Shares, 7,000,000 common restricted
shares of the Company, a 6.5 million note receivable due from Hebei Kangshun Feiyun Organic Waste Processing Company, Ltd., and
7.5 million common shares of the Company that were held as treasury shares by Fei Yun. 

Additionally,
pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated September 3, 2001, which became effective November 29, 2001, after receiving all
necessary approvals from the Chinese authorities, The Company acquired 25 of Wuxi Viking Garments Co., Ltd Wuxi ),
with its principal place of business located in Wuxi, China. This entity was acquired for 1,800,000 common shares of The Company.
The total value of the common stock issued for the acquisition was 540,000. Until the divestiture date, The Company accounted
for its investment in Wuxi using the equity method of accounting. 

Effective
March 28, 2003, the Company sold its 25 equity ownership position in Wuxi Viking Garment Co., Ltd. (Wuxi). The Company received
1.4 million of its common restricted shares in exchange for its 25 equity ownership position in Wuxi. 

For
the periods presented, Arizona Gold and Onyx Mining Company f/k/a Arizona Gold and Onyx Mining Company and its subsidiaries are
collectively referred to as the Company. 

Subsequent
to December 31, 2004, a number of events have transpired that impact the future operations and direction of the Company. In January
2005, the Company experienced a change of control associated with a significant acquisition and significant other changes that
included a reduction of accrued compensation and previous related party receivables and payables. 

11 

On
January 27, 2005, the Company acquired from FITT, Inc. (Seller), 60 of the authorized and issued outstanding common stock of
Brentwood, Re, Ltd. (Brentwood), a St. Kitts, West Indies domiciled insurance company in exchange for 20,000,000 of the Company s
restricted common shares and 1,800,000 of the Company s Series 2001 Callable Preferred shares. The Company has accounted
for this transaction under the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the value of the Company s acquisition
is determined at 19,440,000, or the fair market value of the Company s stock tendered to the Seller at the date of acquisition
as calculated using an average of the closing bid price on the day of transaction and the four trading days prior. Brentwood s
un-audited assets at the date of acquisition include 32,400,000 of long-term assets and no liabilities. Brentwood has had no
history of operations since its incorporation date of November 23, 2003. The Company has determined that the appraised value of
these long term assets is at a minimum the value assigned by the Company to this purchase. Commencing January 27, 2005, the Company
will include the results of operations, if any, of Brentwood in its consolidated results of operations. For the year ending December
31, 2006, the results of operations was zero. 

As
a result of this acquisition and on this same date, the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. William J. Fossen,
announced his retirement and subsequently Mr. Steve Mills was appointed as Mr. Fossen s successor. On January 27, 2005,
the Company authorized for Mr. Mills 8,000,000 restricted common stock options exercisable at .05 per share for a period up to
ten years from the date of award. The Company also authorized options for an additional 2,000,000 restricted common shares at
 0.10 per share to be awarded to the Company s management at dates and other terms to be decided. 

On
December 3, 2003, the Company had announced a letter of intent to purchase Texamerican Food Marketing, Inc. from R. M. Sandifer,

of 0.06 per share. In addition, a related party to this director agreed on this same date to receive 750,000 of the Company s

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared within the framework of the significant accounting policies
summarized below: 

 Principles
of Consolidation 

 The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

 The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions, particularly with respect to the valuation of mineral properties and deferred costs, that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

 Cash
and cash equivalents 

 Cash
and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts, trust accounts and interest-bearing bank deposits with remaining maturities
of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. As of December 31, 2009, the Company s cash and cash equivalents consist of
zero cash. 

 Property
and Equipment 

 Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital lease is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease. The Company provides for the depreciation of its office furniture and equipment using the straight line
method over the estimated useful life of the depreciable assets ranging from five to seven years. Computer equipment held under
capital lease is amortized straight line over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset ranging
from three to five years. Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included with depreciation expense. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized. 

13 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS 144 ), which supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, SFAS 121 and accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting
Principles Bulletin Opinion 30, Reporting the Results of Operations, for a disposal of a segment. SFAS 133 develops
one accounting model based on the framework established in SFAS 121 for long-lived assets to be disposed of and significantly
changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale. SFAS 133 also required expected future operating
losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period(s) in which the losses are incurred, rather than as of the measurement
date. 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes
in operations, significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the
time of acquisition, a decision to abandon acquired products, services or technologies, or other significant adverse changes that
would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted pre-tax future net cash flows expected to be generated by that
asset. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Long-Lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. 

Allowance
for Loan Losses 

Specific
valuation allowances are provided for loans receivable when it becomes probable that all of the principal and interest payments
will not be received as scheduled in the loan agreement (excluding insignificant delays or payment shortfalls). In addition to
specific allowances, a general allowance may be provided for future losses based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and prevailing
market conditions. Additions to the allowance are expensed as recognized. 

Interest
Income on Notes Receivable 

The
Company recognizes interest income on a monthly basis in accordance with the stated interest rate contained in the note agreements. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Rental
revenue through the divesture date was reported as income over the lease term as it becomes receivable according to the provisions
of the lease. However, if the rentals vary from the straight-line basis, the income is recognized on a straight-line basis unless
another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit from the leased property
is diminished, in which case that basis is used. 

Loss
per share 

Basic
and diluted loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 

14 

Software
Development 

Software
development costs have been capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86 ). In accordance with
SFAS 86, capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends when
a product is available for general release to customers. Under SFAS 86, the Company must evaluate the unamortized cost of the
computer software product at each balance sheet date to determine if the net realizable value is less than the unamortized cost,
in which case an impairment loss must be recorded. Since there have been no sales of the software to date, and the Company currently
has no sales commitments, management determined during 2002 that the net realizable value of this software is 50,000. Accordingly,
the Company recognized an impairment loss for the carrying value of this asset during 2002 of approximately 363,000. During 2004,
management determined that the net realizable value of this software was zero. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment
loss for the carrying value of this asset during 2004 of 50,000. 

Investment
in Affiliates Accounted for Under the Equity Method 

Investments
in significant 20 to 50 percent owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting, whereby the investment
is carried at original cost, plus or minus The Company s equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition. 

Foreign
Currency Translation 

Fei
Yun s operations are conducted in the People s Republic of China. Fei Yun s local currency is the functional
currency (primary currency in which business is conducted). As Fei Yun s functional currency was stable in relation to the
U. S. dollar for the period since the acquisition through January 31, 2003, there is no adjustment resulting from translating
the foreign functional currency assets. 

Stock-based
compensation plan 

In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transaction and Disclosure SFAS 148 ). SFAS 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123 ), to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123 s fair value method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. 

SFAS
148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require
disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect
to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements.
While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method,
the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are applicable to all companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether
they account for that compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25,
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 ). Under APB, if the exercise price of an employee s
stock option equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company has elected to continue to utilize the accounting method prescribed by APB 25 and has adopted
the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. 

15 

Stock-based
employee compensation expense is recognized as options vest. 

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by
SFAS No. 148 and Emerging Issue Task Force EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That
Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. All Transactions in
which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty s
performance i9s complete or the date on which the counterparty s performance is complete or the date on which it is probable
that performance will occur. 

Financial
Instruments 

Financial
assets and financial liabilities held-for-trading are measured at fair value with changes in those fair values recognized in net
income. Financial assets and financial liabilities considered held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities
are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method of amortization. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other income. Investments in equity instruments classified as available-for-sale
that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured at cost. 

The
Company has made the following classifications: 

Measured
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from change in fair values are recorded in net income. 

Accounts
receivable and royalty tax recoverable are classified as loans and receivables and are recorded at amortized cost,
which upon their initial measurement is equal to their fair value. Subsequent measurements are recorded at amortized cost using
the effective interest rate method. 

Accounts
payable is classified as other financial liabilities and is initially measured at their fair value. Subsequent measurements
are recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
