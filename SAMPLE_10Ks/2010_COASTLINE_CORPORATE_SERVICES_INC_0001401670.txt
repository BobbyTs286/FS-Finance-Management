1. BUSINESS 

Company
Overview 

Coastline
Corporate Services, Inc. was incorporated on October 27, 2006 under the laws of
the State of Florida. 

Our
Business: Principal Products or Services and Their Markets 

We are a
Company with the principal business objective to provide electronic filing
services for clients that need to electronically file prospectuses, registration
statements, and other documents pursuant to federal securities laws with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission via the SEC s Electronic Data Gathering and
Retrieval system EDGAR ). The SEC requires public companies to file
disclosure information with the SEC in an electronic format rather than by the
traditional paper filing package. This electronic format, ASCII, HTML, or
Legacy, includes additional submission information and coding tags within the
document for aid in the SEC s analysis of the document and in the retrieval by
the public. These electronically formatted documents are generally
delivered by direct telecommunications, but may be delivered on magnetic
computer tape or by diskette. EDGAR allows registrants to file, and the
public to retrieve, disclosure information electronically. 

Coastline
Corporate Services, Inc. is a full-service EDGARizing firm that files EDGAR
reports on behalf of public companies. The scope of work a full-service
EDGARizing firm undertakes is as follows: 

Filing
 for EDGAR access codes; 

Conversion
 of document to EDGAR acceptable
format; 

Client
 approval of EDGARized document; and 

Electronic
 filing of the document. 

Management
of the Company believes that public companies, through its services, will have
the opportunity to receive all of the advantages of using an EDGAR filing agent,
while keeping costs and fees to a minimum. 

Business
Development 

From
inception until July 8, 2010, Toni A. Eldred was the majority owner and
President of the organization. On July 8, 2010, Ms. Eldred entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement which provided for the sale of 600,000 shares of common stock
of the Company (the Purchased Shares to Daulat (Dan) Nijjar (the
 Purchaser ). The consideration paid for the Purchased Shares, which represent
75.7 of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a
fully-diluted basis, was 331,560. In addition, Mr. Nijjar acquired a
total of 47,500 shares of common stock from three other shareholders resulting
in Mr. Nijjar owning a total of 647,500 common shares, or 81.7 of the issued
and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted
basis. 

Effective
as of July 8, 2010, in connection with the disposition of the Purchased Shares
Toni A. Eldred resigned from her positions as the President, Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary and
Treasurer of the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company elected
Daulat (Dan) Nijjar as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the
Company. 

The
additional shares acquired by Mr. Nijjar related to 22,500 common shares
acquired from Alex Long who resigned as a Director of the Company on July 5,
2010, 20,000 common shares acquired from Nanuk Warman who resigned as a Director
of the Company on June 30, 2010, and 5,000 common shares acquired from Dragon
Investment Group which is an investment firm controlled by Ms.
Eldred. 

Subsequent
to the share transactions, Mr. Nijjar owns 647,500 shares of common stock of the
Company, or 81.7 , and the Board of Directors consists of Mr. Nijjar and Ms.
Eldred. There are no arrangements or understandings among members of
both the former and new control persons and their associates with respect to the
election of directors of the Company or other matters. 

To meet
our need for cash we raised money from a regulation D 506 Offering for U.S.
citizens and Regulation S for non-U.S. citizens. We believe we will have
sufficient working capital to meet our needs for the next twelve months.
 If we are unable to generate meaningful revenues during the next twelve
months, or if we are unable to make a reasonable profit after twelve months, we
may have to cease operations. At the present time, we have not made any
plans to raise additional cash other than through our own
operations. 

4 

If
we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations
entirely. 

Employees 

Since
inception on October 27, 2006, we have had one full time employee, Toni A.
Eldred. As our President, and now serving only as a Director of the
Company, Ms. Eldred has provided the labor necessary to support the operation.
 We currently have no other key employees. Ms. Eldred is not receiving pay
or other stock benefits for her performance. Ms. Eldred declined to
take any salary until the Company generated more revenue and profits. There are
no key consulting contracts with any individuals or companies at this
time. 

We do not
believe that there is a critical need for a specific type of candidate we would
use in our business. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

We have a
limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of
our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties,
complications and delays that we may encounter because we are a small business.
As a result, we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate
sufficient revenue to develop as we have planned. 

Our
ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow will be
dependent upon: 

Management s
 ability to maintain the skills for our conversion
 services; 

The
 Company s ability to keep abreast of the changes by the Securities and
 Exchange Commission regarding its EDGAR
system; 

Our
 ability to attract customers who require the services we offer;
 and 

Our
 ability to generate revenues through the sale of our services to potential
 clients who need our filing
services. 

Based
upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods
because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues to
cover our expenses. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in
generating revenues in the future. Failure to generate sufficient revenues
will cause us to go out of business and any investment in our Company would be
lost. 

Managing
a small public company involves a high degree of risk. Few small public
companies ever reach market stability and we will be subject to oversight from
governing bodies and regulations that will be costly to meet. Our present
officers and directors do not have any experience in managing a fully reporting
public company so we may be forced to obtain outside consultants to assist with
our meeting these requirements. These outside consultants are expensive
and can have a direct impact on our ability to be profitable. This will make an
investment in our Company a highly speculative and risky investment. 

While the
Company is attempting to disclose all of the potential risks associated with an
investment in the Company, there can be no assurance that all of the risks are
visible to management. Events occurring in the future may be additional
risks to an investment in the Company which are currently
unforeseen.

2. PROPERTIES 

Our
principal business location is at 111 2 nd 
Avenue NE, Suite 900, St. Petersburg, Florida, which we rent on a month-to-month
basis. The monthly rent of 165 is considered by management to be at fair market
value for the space being provided. We own our furniture, computers,
ancillary equipment and office supplies. 
 Our
office is located in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida in a commercial office
building.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are
not engaged in any litigation, and we are unaware of any claims or complaints
that could result in future litigation. We will seek to minimize
disputes with our customers but recognize the inevitability of legal action in
today s business environment as an unfortunate price of conducting
business.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in the filing contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Actual results
may materially differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements as
a result of certain risks and uncertainties set forth in this report. Although
management believes that the assumptions made and expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the
underlying assumptions will, in fact, prove to be correct or that actual results
will not be different from expectations expressed in this report. 

We desire
to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This filing contains a number of forward-looking
statements which reflect management s current views and expectations with
respect to our business, strategies, products, future results and events, and
financial performance. All statements made in this filing other than statements
of historical fact, including statements addressing operating performance,
events, or developments which management expects or anticipates will or may
occur in the future, including statements related to distributor channels,
volume growth, revenues, profitability, new products, adequacy of funds from
operations, statements expressing general optimism about future operating
results, and non-historical information, are forward looking statements. In
particular, the words believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, 
 may, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such
statements, and their absence does not mean that the statement is not
forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties, including those discussed below. Our actual results,
performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as
well as those expressed in, anticipated, or implied by these forward-looking
statements. We do not undertake any obligation to revise these forward-looking
statements to reflect any future events or circumstances. 

Readers
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are
based on management s current expectations and projections about future events,
are not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties
and assumptions (including those described below), and apply only as of the date
of this filing. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ
materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking
statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, the risks to be discussed in our Annual Report on form
10-K and in the press releases and other communications to shareholders issued
by us from time to time which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks
and factors which may affect our business. We undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events, or otherwise.

This
report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current
views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate,
anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their
nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these
forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly
report. These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
historical results or our predictions. 

Overview 

Coastline
was previously a development stage company that was in the early stages of
commercialization of providing EDGARizing services to corporations required to
file periodic reports with the US Securities Exchange
Commission. Since our inception in October 2006, we have:
1) completed a private placement which has provided us with the
necessary seed capital to begin operations, 2) filed and have had declared
effective a registration statement with the SEC on form SB-2, 3) established
commercial operations. Since we have achieved our initial development
and established a recurring base revenue stream, management considers that the
company is no longer a development stage enterprise. 

We
anticipate that our business will incur operating losses in the future until
that point in time, if ever, that our revenues from our Edgarization services
exceeds our operation expenses. 

Our
existence is dependent upon managements ability to develop profitable
operations. While management anticipates Coastline will attain
profitable status through the further development and expansion in the number of
customers that utilize our services, there can be no assurances that we will
ever reach profitability. 

Revenues 

For the
Year ended April 30, 2010 and for the Year ended April 30, 2009 we had revenues
from our operations of 2,800 and 11,603,
respectively. Revenues were derived from our EDGARizing
services. 

Expenses 

The major
component of our expenses for the year ended April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2009
was professional fees of 7,000 and 14,505, respectively. Selling, General and
Administrative expenses were 4,014 and 6,587 for the years ended April 30,
2010 and for the Year Ended April 30, 2009, respectively. Employee
compensation and payroll taxes were 0 and 0; Occupancy (rent) was 1,155 and
 1,809 for the years ended April 30, 2010 and for the year ended April 30, 2009,
respectively; and Bad Debt expenses was 2,200 and 5,515 for the years ended
April 30, 2010 and for the Year Ended April 30, 2009, respectively. 

Net
Losses 

Our net
loss for the year ended April 30, 2010 and for the year ended April 30, 2009 was
 11,885 and 16,971, respectively. The losses were primarily due to
the professional fees, auditor fees, employee compensation, general and
administrative expenses, Bad debt expenses and occupancy expenses. We
expect to continue to incur losses from our operations until such time, if ever,
that we begin to successfully generate sufficient revenues to cover our
operating expenses. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of
April 30, 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 324. While we
have begun commercial operations we do not believe that the revenues from our
operations will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses during the next
twelve months, and we believe we will likely incur additional losses during the
next twelve months. While we expect to incur losses during the next
twelve months, we believe that we have sufficient working capital to sustain our
operating expenses and any losses. 

We do not
anticipate that our revenues will increase to off-set any operating expenses
above and beyond our current run rate. Additionally, we do not expect
to incur the same rate of legal and audit expense associated with the initial
registration. We do not anticipate that there will be need to raise
any additional capital over the next twelve months. 

Our
independent certified public accountants stated in their report dated July
29,2010 that the 
 Company has generated nominal revenue and has not established operations which
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern . 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Alternative Business Strategies 

In order
to continue to protect and increase shareholder value management believes that
it may, from time to time, consider alternative management strategies to create
value for the company or additional revenues. Strategies to be
reviewed may include acquisitions; roll-ups; strategic alliances; joint ventures
on large projects; and/or mergers. 

 Management
will only consider these options where it believes the result would be to
increase shareholder value while continuing the viability of the
company. 

Critical Accounting
Policies 

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. These principles require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that these estimates
are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however,
actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The
company issued stock options and follows guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification Topic (Topic 505 and 718) Share-Based Payment 
which requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options to be recognized as compensation expense in the
financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over
the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange
for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting
period). The Company had no common stock options or common stock equivalents
granted or outstanding for all periods presented. 

The
Company issued restricted stock for various business and administrative
services. For these transactions the Company follows the guidance in
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 505 "Accounting for Equity Instruments
that are issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with
Selling Goods or Services". Cost for these transactions are measured
at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measureable. The value
of the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm
commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is
reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is
complete. All stock issued was for past services
provided, accordingly, all shares issued are fully vested, and there is no
unrecognized compensation associated with these transactions as of April 30,
2010 and for year ended April 30, 2009 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

In June
2009, the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification Codification 
or ASC as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the
FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States GAAP ). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC issued under authority of federal securities laws
are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to
be changed as a result of the Codification, and accordingly the change did not
impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is
organized and presented.

To
the Board of Directors 

 Coastline
Corporate Services, Inc. 

 St.
Petersburg, Florida 

We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of Coastline Corporate Services, Inc as
of April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2009 and the related statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year
period ended April 30, 2010. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audit. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required
at this time, to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provided a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

In our
opinion, based on our audit, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
April 30, 2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the two year period ended April 30, 2010 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Footnote 3 to the
financial statements, the Company has generated nominal revenue and has not
established operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters
are also described in Footnote 3. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

Notes
to Financial Statements 

 As
of April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2009 

1. GENERAL
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 

Coastline
Corporate Services, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Florida on October 27, 2006. The Company operates on an
April 30 fiscal year end. 

The
Company provides services to public companies requiring guidance and assistance
in converting and filing their documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC ). The SEC s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval system EDGAR performs automated collection, validation, indexing,
acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are
required by law to file forms with the SEC. Our primary emphasis is on
converting a Company s Word, WordPerfect or other type of word processed
documents to ASCII, Legacy or HTML format suitable for filing with
EDGAR. 

2. DEVELOPMENT
STAGE ENTERPRISE 

The
Company, in prior periods, presented financial statements as a development stage
enterprise. In the initial year the Company, devoted
substantially all of its efforts to raising capital, planning and implementing
the principal operations. The Company may continue to incur
significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flow from operating
activities. The Company's ability to eliminate operating losses and to
generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will depend upon a
variety of factors, many of which it is unable to control. However,
management believes that the Company has established the primary business
development plan. 

3. GOING
CONCERN 

The
accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
assumes the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of
revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a
going concern. 

The
Company incurred a net loss of 11,885 and 16,971 for the years ended April 30,
2010 and for the year ended April 30, 2009, respectively. The Company
has 324 of cash with which to satisfy any future cash requirements. The Company
depends upon capital to be derived from future financing activities such as
subsequent offerings of its common stock or debt financing in order to operate
and grow the business. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in raising such capital. The key factors that are
not within the Company's control and that may have a direct bearing on operating
results include, but are not limited to, acceptance of the Company's business
plan, the ability to raise capital in the future, the ability to expand its
customer base, and the ability to hire key employees to provide
services. There may be other risks and circumstances that management
may be unable to predict. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of
the Company to continue as a going concern. 

4. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
significant accounting policies followed are: 

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. These principles require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that these estimates
are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however,
actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes

 As
of April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2009 

4. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

The
majority of cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the United
States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed
on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company considers
all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts
receivable consist of charges for service provided to customers. The
Company will recognize revenue when services have been provided and collection
is reasonably assured. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
considered to be established for any amounts that may not be recoverable, which
is based on an analysis of the Company s customer credit worthiness, and current
economic trends. Based on management s review of accounts receivable,
no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered
necessary. Receivables are determined to be past due, based on
payment terms of original invoices. The Company does not typically
charge interest on past due receivables. 

Property
and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives (five years for property and
equipment). The carrying amount of all long-lived assets is evaluated
periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation and amortization
period or the unamortized balance is warranted. Based upon its most recent
analysis, the Company believes that no impairment of property and equipment
exists at April 30, 2010. 

In
accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards Codification (Topic 360),
"Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," long-lived assets
such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be
held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the
asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash
flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals,
if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not
recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized
for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the
asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair
value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate
with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. We did not
recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented. 

The
Company issues stock options and follows guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification Topic(Topic 505 and 718) , Share-Based Payment which
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options to be recognized as compensation expense in the financial
statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for
the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).
The Company had no common stock options or common stock equivalents granted or
outstanding for all periods presented. 

The
Company issued restricted stock for various business and administrative
services. For these transactions the Company follows the guidance in
Accounting Standards Codification Topic
505 "Accounting for Equity Instruments that are issued to
Other than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services". Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the
common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm
commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is
reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is
complete. All stock issued was for past services provided,
accordingly, all shares issued are fully vested, and there is no unrecognized
compensation associated with these transactions as of April 30, 2010
and April 30, 2009 . 

The costs
of advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was 0 and 0
for the years ending April 30, 2010 and for the year ended April 30, 2009,
respectively.

4. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires
use of the liability method. Topic 740 provides that deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purpose, referred to as temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the currently enacted
tax rates applied to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. 

The
Company follows in Accounting Standards Codification (Topic 260),
 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share calculations are
determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of shares plus the effect of the dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. There are no
share equivalents for any periods presented and, thus, anti-dilution issues are
not applicable. 

5. THE
EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In June
2009, the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification Codification 
or ASC as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the
FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States GAAP ). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC issued under authority of federal securities laws
are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to
be changed as a result of the Codification, and accordingly the change did not
impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is
organized and presented.

 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles- a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 were
recently issued. SFAS No. 165, 166, 167, and 168 have no current applicability
to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been
significant. 

Accounting
Standards Update ASU ASU No. 2009-05 (ASC Topic 820), which amends Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures Overall, ASU No. 2009-13 (ASC Topic 605),
Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, ASU No. 2009-14 (ASC Topic 985),
Certain Revenue Arrangements that include Software Elements, and various other

7. PROVISION
FOR INCOME TAXES 

The
Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses
generated since inception based on uncertainties concerning its ability to
generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the
years presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred
tax assets arising from operating losses and other temporary differences, the
realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In
future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized
when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than
not. As of April 30, 2010, the Company incurred net operating losses
of approximately 75,175. Net operating losses generated begin to
expire in the taxable year of 2027 

8. STOCKHOLDERS 
EQUITY 

The
Company has no potentially dilutive securities outstanding at the end of the
statement periods, such as warrants or options. 

The

9. EARNINGS
PER SHARE 

The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company s net income
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted
number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially
dilutive debt or equity. 

The
Company has no potentially dilutive securities outstanding at the end of the
statement periods. Therefore, the basic and diluted earnings (loss)
per share are presented on the face of the statement of operations as the same
number. 

The numerators and denominators used in the computations of basic and diluted EPS are
presented in the following table for the years ended April 30:

AND CONTINGENCIES 

The
Company has had limited need for use of office space or
equipment. Any use of office space or equipment is being supplied
through sublease of office space and charges are based on occupancy use at the
fair value of the space occupied, currently valued at 165 per
month. This arrangement is on a month to month basis,
cancellable upon 30 days notice. Rent expense totaled 1,155 and
 1,809 for the year ended April 30, 2010 and for the year ended April 30, 2009,
respectively. 

From time
to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims
against the Company. Management believes that there are no current matters
that would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results
of operations.

There

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief Financial Officer has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
fiscal period ending April 30, 2010 covered by this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief
Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required
under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. This conclusion by
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief Financial
Officer does not relate to reporting periods after April 30,
2010. 

Management s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) of the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management,
under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of
April 30, 2010 under the criteria set forth in the in Internal Control Integrated
Framework . 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Management has determined that material weaknesses exist
due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company's limited
resources. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

No change
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the
year ended April 30, 2010, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. 

Changes in Internal
Controls 

There
were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls, or other
factors, that could significantly affect the Company s controls subsequent to
the date of the evaluations performed by the executive officers of the
Company. No deficiencies or material weaknesses were found that would
require corrective action.

as well as our employees. Our standards are in writing and will be posted
on our website once our site is operational. Our complete Code of Ethics
has been attached to this registration statement as an exhibit. Our annual
report filed with the Securities Exchange Commission will set forth the manner
in which a copy of our code may be requested at no charge. The following
is a summation of the key points of the Code of Ethics we adopted: 

Honest
 and ethical conduct, including ethical handling of actual or apparent
 conflicts of interest between personal and professional
 relationships; 

Full,
 fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure reports and
 documents that a small business issuer files with, or submits to, the
 Commission and in other public communications made by our
 Company; 

Full
 compliance with applicable government laws, rules and
 regulations; 

The
 prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate
 person or persons identified in the code;
and

23 

Corporate
Governance 

As a
small business issuer we are not listed on a national securities exchange or in
an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the
board of directors be independent. Further, we have not applied for a
listing with a national exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system which
has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent.
 We are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act respecting any director. We have conducted special
Board of Director meetings almost every month since inception. Each of our
directors has attended all meetings either in person or via telephone
conference. We have no standing committees regarding compensation or other
nominating committees. We do have a standing independent audit committee
of which Director Nanuk Warman is the sole member. In addition to the
contact information in private placement memorandum and this Prospectus, each
shareholder will be given specific information on how he/she can direct
communications to the officers and directors of the corporation at our annual
shareholders meetings. All communications from shareholders are relayed to
the members of the Board of Directors.

Coastline Corporate Services, Inc. with copies of all forms so

Based
solely upon a review of copies of such forms filed on Forms 3, 4, and 5, and

report, our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent beneficial
owners complied on a timely basis with all Section 16(a) filing
requirements.

Audit
and Non-Audit Service Pre-Approval Policy 

In
accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Audit Committee has adopted an
informal approval policy that it believes will result in an effective and
efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm. 

Audit Services. Audit services
include the annual financial statement audit (including quarterly reviews) and
other procedures required to be performed by the independent registered public
accounting firm to be able to form an opinion on our financial statements. The
Audit Committee pre-approves specified annual audit services engagement terms
and fees and other specified audit fees. All other audit services must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee monitors
the audit services engagement and may approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope or other
items. 

Audit-Related Services.
 Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial
statements which historically have been provided to us by the independent
registered public accounting firm and are consistent with the SEC s rules on
auditor independence. The Audit Committee pre-approves specified audit-related
services within pre-approved fee levels. All other audit-related services must
be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 

Tax Services. The Audit
Committee pre-approves specified tax services that the Audit Committee believes
would not impair the independence of the independent registered public
accounting firm and that are consistent with SEC rules and guidance. The Audit
Committee must specifically approve all other tax services. 

All Other Services. Other
services are services provided by the independent registered public accounting
firm that do not fall within the established audit, audit-related and tax
services categories. The Audit Committee pre-approves specified other services
that do not fall within any of the specified prohibited categories of
services. 

27 

Procedures. All proposals for
services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm,
which must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered and the
amount of corresponding fees, are submitted to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee and the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer
authorizes services that have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. If there
is any question as to whether a proposed service fits within a pre-approved
service, the Audit Committee chair is consulted for a determination. The Chief
Financial Officer submits requests or applications to provide services that have
not been pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which must include an affirmation
by the Chief Financial Officer and the independent registered public accounting
firm that the request or application is consistent with the SEC s rules on
auditor independence, to the Audit Committee (or its Chair or any of its other
members pursuant to delegated authority) for approval.
