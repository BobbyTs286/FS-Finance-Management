CVI has advanced funds of 189,972 to GFI under the promissory note, which is unsecured, bears interest at 5 per annum, and was due on December 31, 2014.

The response to last round of comments received from Health Canada was received by CVI (Canada) in February 6, 2015. We responded on February 26, 2015 and Health Canada acknowledged receipt on February 27, 2015. The Contract had an initial term of 4 months, expiring August 31, 2014, to give the Company the time to acquire the necessary license from Health Canada. During this four month period, the Company paid the owner of the property a nonrefundable payment of 4,000 a month and this expense has been recognized in our statement of operations. The Contract had been extended on a month to month basis and as of February 2015, the Company continues to pay the property owner a reduced nonrefundable payment of 2,500 a month while it awaits the determination from Health Canada. There is no guarantee that the property owner will continue to extend the term of the Contract or that the Company will be successful in obtaining a license from Health Canada.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Report. Some of the information contained in this Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by the use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and there can be no assurance that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. Our auditors reports contain a statement that our net loss and limited working capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accountants have stated in their report (included in Item 8. Financial Statements) that our significant operating losses and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We incurred net losses of 278,875 and 35,990, respectively, for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2013. We will be required to raise substantial capital to fund our capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements since our current cash assets are exhausted and we have generated no revenues to date to sustain our operations. We will need to seek other financing to complete our business plans. The successful outcome of future financing activities cannot be determined at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business plan or generate positive operational results. In addition to our current deficit, we expect to incur additional losses during the foreseeable future. Until we are able to successfully execute our business plan. Consequently, we will require substantial additional capital to continue our development and marketing activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing through private placements and/or public offerings necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements and/or public offerings are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital through other sources, such as bank loans and/or financings. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. We are incurring increased costs as a result of being a publicly-traded company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These new rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have created additional board committees and have adopted policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we have incurred additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. In addition, these new rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which we currently cannot afford to do. As a result of the new rules, it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company or the timing of such costs. 7 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not recognize any revenue. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the year ended November 30, 2014 were 88,903 compared with 35,990 for the year ended November 30, 2013. A summary of the operating expenses are as follows: Analysis of Operating Expenses November 30, November 30, Variance Operating Expense 2014 2013 Depreciation - 475 (475) (100.0) Land Purchase Option 28,000 - 28,000 100 Management Fees 6,000 7,000 (1,000) (14.3) Professional Fees 25,054 6,500 18,554 285.4 Overhead and Administration 23,905 19,908 3,997 20.1 Transfer Agent and Filing Fees 5,944 2,107 3,837 182.1 88,903 35,990 52,913 147.0 Overall, the increase in operating expenses were due to payments of 28,000 for the a nonrefundable payment of 4,000 a month in respect of our proposed purchase of property in Canada and an increase in professional fees of 18,554 relating to the Company s accounting, audit, and legal fees that were incurred as part of the SEC filing process. Additionally, the Company saw minor increases of 3,997 in overhead and administration expense due to an increase in the day-to-day activities in the Company, and 3,836 in transfer agent and filing fees relating to costs incurred with respect to the private placement that was issued during the year. The Company has fully amortized its property and equipment, which lead to the overall decrease in depreciation expense. Impairment of Loan Receivable During the year ended November 30, 2014 we recognized an impairment expense of 189,972 (2013 - 0) in respect of funds we had advanced under a promissory note to Global Farmacy, Inc GFI ). In September 2014, CVI entered into a promissory note agreement with GFI, an Arizona non-profit corporation, to finance a potential cultivation project. CVI has advanced funds of 189,972 to GFI under a promissory note which is unsecured, bears interest at 5 per annum and was due on December 31, 2014. As GFI was delinquent in performing certain obligations under the terms of the promissory note and our ability to recover this advance is currently uncertain, we have a provided in full against the value of this promissory note and recognized an impairment expense of 189,972 effective December 31, 2014. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended November 30, 2014 was 278,875 or (0.00) loss per share compared with a net loss of 35,990 and (0.00) loss per share for the year ended November 30, 2013 due to the factors discussed above. 8 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2014, the Company has no revenue or other source of income, has a working capital deficit of 192,673, and an accumulated deficit of 387,071. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, its ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generate profitable operations from the Company s planned future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Working Capital November 30, 2014 November 30, 2013 Current Assets - 104 Current Liabilities 192,673 37,200 Working Capital (Deficit) (192,673) (37,096) As at November 30, 2014, the Company had current assets of nil and current liabilities of 192,673 compared with current assets of 104 and current liabilities of 37,200 at November 30, 2013. The increase in the working capital deficit was largely attributable to an increase in amounts due to related parties of 146,337 for amounts paid on behalf of the Company for operating expenditures and advanced to GFI under a promissory note receivable.

Cannabis Ventures, Inc. (Canada) CVI (Canada) In May 2014, CVI (Canada) entered into a contract to acquire certain property in Vancouver, Canada for 600,000 the Contract ). It is the Company s intention to facilitate the cultivation of medical marijuana on the property if it is able to acquire the necessary license from Health Canada. The property is owned personally by a director of CVI (Canada). In July 2014, CVI (Canada) filed the application with Health Canada for the MMPR License (Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations). The response to last round of comments received from Health Canada was received by CVI (Canada) in February 6, 2015. We responded on February 26, 2015 and Health Canada acknowledged receipt on February 27, 2015. The Contract had an initial term of 4 months, expiring August 31, 2014, to give the Company the time to acquire the necessary license from Health Canada.

Future Financings We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and activities. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes for the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the valuation of its mineral leases and claims and our ability to obtain final government permission to complete the project. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2013 (Expressed in U.S. dollars) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1 Balance Sheets F-2 Statement of Operations F-3 Statements of Cash Flows F-4 Statements of Changes in Stockholder s Deficit F-5 Notes to the Financial Statements F-6 12 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Gala Global, Inc. Las Vegas, Nevada, 89146 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Gala Global, Inc. as of November 30, 2014 and 2013 and the related statement of operations, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gala Global, Inc. as of November 30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the Company has suffered losses and negative cash flow from operations which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the twelve months ended November 30, 2014 and 2013 (Expressed in U.S. dollars) 1. Organization and Nature of Operation GALA Global Inc. the Company , we , us or our was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 15, 2010 (Inception). The Company was formed to provide garment tailoring and alteration services. On May 19, 2014, a change in control of the Company occurred when IDG Ventures Ltd., the Company s then controlling shareholder, sold all of its 3,547,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing 60.04 of our issued and outstanding common shares, in a private share purchase transaction to Messrs. Haas, Lefevre and Naccarato. On June 26, 2014, the Company had a change in management when Mr. Robert Frei resigned as President and Director of the Company and Mr. Lefevre was appointed as his successor. Concurrent with the change of management, the Company acquired two 100 owned subsidiary companies, Cannabis Ventures Inc (USA), incorporated on February 27, 2014 in the state of Nevada and Cannabis Ventures Inc. (Canada), incorporated on April 9, 2014 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Neither of these subsidiary companies had traded prior to their acquisition by the Company other than as described below. GALA Global, Inc. is currently distributing all-natural everyday custom tailored women's clothing products from England. The Company is exploring different hemp alternatives of fabric and materials needed to produce our all new custom designed apparel. Our new products are scheduled for launch in the latter part of 2015. GALA Global, Inc., since its change in management effective June 26, 2014, has expanded into the Hemp and Cannabidiol CBD industry. The expansion is focusing on the development, research, and commercialization of products derived from the Hemp and Cannabis Plant. GALA Global, Inc. currently markets a new CBD flavored Thin-film strip. The film strip delivery system uses a dissolving film strip that is absorbed in the mouth. The film-strip method is an advanced method of providing CBD for dietary supplement. GALA also is seeking acquisition candidates in this area of interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.The Company also plans to enter into the medical marijuana cultivation industry as approved in the United States and Canada to build legalized cultivation operations GALA Global, Inc. s services include the development of cannabinoid based health and wellness products; the development of medical grade compounds; the licensing of proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal herb industry. Cannabis Ventures Inc. (USA) CVI In September 2014, CVI entered into a promissory note agreement with Globe Farmacy, Inc., an Arizona non-profit corporation GFI ), to finance a potential cultivation project. CVI has advanced funds of 189,972 to GFI under the promissory note, which is unsecured, bears interest at 5 per annum, and was due on December 31, 2014. As GFI was delinquent in performing certain obligations under the terms of the promissory note and our ability to recover this advance is currently uncertain, we have a provided in full against the value of this promissory note and recognized an impairment expense of 189,972 effective December 31, 2014. Cannabis Ventures, Inc. (Canada) CVI (Canada) In May 2014, CVI (Canada) entered into a contract to acquire certain property in Vancouver, Canada for 600,000 the Contract ). It is the Company s intention to facilitate the cultivation of medical marijuana on the property if it is able to acquire the necessary license from Health Canada. The property is owned personally by a director of CVI (Canada). In July 2014, CVI (Canada) filed the application with Health Canada for the MMPR License (Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations). The response to last round of comments received from Health Canada was received by CVI (Canada) in February 6, 2015. We responded on February 26, 2015 and Health Canada acknowledged receipt on February 27, 2015. The Contract had an initial term of 4 months, expiring August 31, 2014, to give the Company the time to acquire the necessary license from Health Canada. During this four month period, the Company paid the owner of the property a nonrefundable payment of 4,000 a month and this expense has been recognized in our statement of operations. The Contract had been extended on a month to month basis and as of February 2015, the Company continues to pay the property owner a reduced nonrefundable payment of 2,500 a month while it awaits the determination from Health Canada. There is no guarantee that the property owner will continue to extend the term of the Contract or that the Company will be successful in obtaining a license from Health Canada. Moreover as at the date of this report, the Company does not have the funds to complete the purchase of the property nor is there any guarantee that it will be able to raise the required funding. F-6 2. Going Concern These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at November 30, 2014, the Company has not earned any revenue, has a working capital deficit of 192,673, and an accumulated deficit of 387,071. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to successfully implement its business plan and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company s future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a) Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is November b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Nevada incorporated Cannabis Ventures Inc. (USA) and Vancouver, British Columbia incorporated Cannabis Ventures Inc. (Canada), from the date of their acquisition by the Company effective June 26, 2014. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation . c) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and investments, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As of November 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no cash equivalents. e) Development Stage Company The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and among the additional disclosures required as a development stage company are that its financial statements were identified as those of a development stage company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows disclosed activity since the date of its inception (March 15, 2010) as a development stage company. The Company has generated no revenue since inception (March 15, 2010) and is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (March 15, 2010) have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. Effective June 10, 2014 FASB changed its regulations with respect to Development Stage Entities and these additional disclosures are no longer required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 with the option for entities to early adopt these new provisions. The Company has elected to early adopt these provisions and consequently these additional disclosures are not included in these financial statements. F-7 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) f) Financial Instruments Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and amounts due to related party. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. g) Long-Lived Assets In accordance with ASC 360 , Property Plant and Equipment , the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. h) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. i) Revenue Recognition Revenue will be recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been provided, and collectability is assured. The Company is not exposed to any credit risks as amounts are prepaid prior to performance of services. F-8 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) j) Advertising Costs The Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of nil during the years ended November 30, 2014 and 2013. k) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. As at November 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not grant any stock options. l) Comprehensive Loss ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at November 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company has no items representing comprehensive income or loss. m) Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at November 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company has no potentially dilutive common shares. n) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 4. Related Party Transactions a) During the year ended November 30, 2014, the Company incurred 6,000 (2013 - nil) in management fees to the former President and Director of the Company.

During the year ended November 30, 2014, the Company incurred option expenses of 28,000 (2013 - nil) under the term of a contract to purchase property in Vancouver, Canada to a director of CVI. 5. Promissory Note Receivable On September 30, 2014, Cannabis Ventures Inc.

Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Evaluation Date"), concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives. The likelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact that human judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (" 1992 COSO Framework "). A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management concluded we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties. Our size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our internal control system. There is mainly one person involved in processing of transactions. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively segregate accounting duties. We have hired an additional administrative person and retained an outside professional firm to assist in the separation of duties on an ongoing basis. The use of the outside firm has proven successful in assisting in the separation of duties. However, additional people are not needed to do the administrative work therefore segregation of duties will continue to be an ongoing weakness.

Director Independence The OTC Bulletin Board does not have a requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. However, with respect to the definition of independence utilized by NASDAQ, our officers and directors would be deemed to be independent. Our Audit Committee is comprised of our officers and directors. NASDAQ requires at least three members on the Audit Committee, each of whom must be independent. NASDAQ also requires that, if its Chief Executive Officer s compensation is determined by its Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee must be comprised solely of independent directors. The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements. The NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder of an entity to which the company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company. The subjective test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
