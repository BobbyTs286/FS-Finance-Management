PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

 AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC (the "Company" or the
"Registrant") is a limited liability company which was organized
pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on March 14, 2005.
The registrant is comprised of AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc.
("AFM"), as the Managing Member, Robert P. Johnson, the President
and sole director of AFM, as the Special Managing Member, and
purchasers of LLC Units as Limited Members. The Company offered
for sale up to 100,000,000 of limited membership interests (the
"Units") (10,000,000 Units at 10 per Unit) pursuant to a
registration statement effective October 20, 2005. The Company
commenced operations on April 3, 2006 when minimum subscriptions
of 150,000 LLC Units 1,500,000) were accepted. The offering
terminated October 19, 2007 when the extended offering period
expired. The Company received subscriptions for 1,832,736 LLC
Units. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Limited
Members and Managing Members contributed funds of 18,327,360 and
 1,000, respectively.

 The Company was organized to acquire existing and newly
constructed commercial properties, to lease such properties to
tenants under net leases, to hold such properties and to
eventually sell such properties. From subscription proceeds, the
Company purchased eight properties, including partial interests
in five properties, at a total cost of 15,376,536. The balance
of the subscription proceeds was applied to organization and
syndication costs, working capital reserves and distributions,
which represented a return of capital. The properties are
commercial, single tenant buildings leased under net leases.

 The Company's properties were purchased without any
indebtedness. The Company will not finance properties in the
future to obtain proceeds for new property acquisitions. If it
is required to do so, the Company may incur short-term
indebtedness to finance day-to-day cash flow requirements
(including cash flow necessary to repurchase Units). The Company
may borrow to finance the refurbishing of a property.

 The Company will hold its properties until the Managing
Members determine that the sale or other disposition of the
properties is advantageous in view of the Company's investment
objectives. In deciding whether to sell properties, the Managing
Members will consider factors such as potential appreciation, net
cash flow and income tax considerations. The Company expects to
sell some or all of its properties prior to its final liquidation
and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in additional
properties. The Company reserves the right, at the discretion of
the Managing Members, to either distribute proceeds from the sale
of properties to the Members or to reinvest such proceeds in
additional properties, provided that sufficient proceeds are
distributed to the Limited Members to pay federal and state
income taxes related to any taxable gain recognized as a result
of the sale. It is anticipated that the Company will commence
liquidation through the sale of its remaining properties ten to
twelve years after completion of the acquisition phase, depending
upon the then current real estate and money markets, the economic
climate and the income tax consequences to the Members.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. (Continued)

Leases

 Although there are variations in the specific terms of the
leases, the following is a summary of the general terms of the
Company's leases. The properties are leased to various tenants
under net leases, classified as operating leases. Under a net
lease, the tenant is responsible for real estate taxes,
insurance, maintenance, repairs and operating expenses for the
property. For some leases, the Company is responsible for
repairs to the structural components of the building. At the
time the properties were acquired, the remaining primary lease
terms varied from 10 to 20 years. The leases provide the tenants
with three to four five-year renewal options subject to the same
terms and conditions as the primary term. The leases provide for
base annual rental payments, payable in monthly installments, and
contain rent clauses which entitle the Company to receive
additional rent in future years based on stated rent increases.

Major Tenants

 During 2010, five tenants each contributed more than ten
percent of the Company's total rental revenue. The major tenants
in aggregate contributed 87 of total rental revenue in 2010. It
is anticipated that, based on minimum rental payments required
under the leases, each major tenant will continue to contribute
more than ten percent of rental revenue in 2011 and future years.
Any failure of these major tenants could materially affect the
Company's net income and cash distributions.

Competition

 The Company is a minor factor in the commercial real
estate business. There are numerous entities engaged in the
commercial real estate business which have greater financial
resources than the Company. At the time the Company elects to
dispose of its properties, it will be in competition with other
persons and entities to find buyers for its properties.

Employees

 The Company has no direct employees. Management services
are performed for the Company by AEI Fund Management, Inc., an
affiliate of AFM.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Investment Objectives

 The Company's investment objectives are to acquire
existing or newly-developed commercial properties that provide
(i) regular rental income; (ii) growth in lease income through
rent escalation provisions; (iii) capital growth through
appreciation in the value of properties; (iv) reduced occupancy
risks as a result of long-term leases with creditworthy corporate
tenants; and (v) passive income that may be offset by eligible
passive losses from other investments for tax purposes. The
Company does not have a policy, and there is no limitation, as to
the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in any
one property. However, to the extent possible, the Managing
Members attempt to diversify the type and location of the
properties.

Description of Properties

 The Company's properties are commercial, single tenant
buildings. The properties were acquired on a debt-free basis and
are leased to various tenants under net leases, classified as
operating leases. The Company holds an undivided fee simple
interest in the properties.

 The Company's properties are subject to the general
competitive conditions incident to the ownership of single tenant
investment real estate. Since each property is leased under a
long-term lease, there is little competition until the Company
decides to sell the property. At this time, the Company will be
competing with other real estate owners, on both a national and
local level, in attempting to find buyers for the properties. In
the event of a tenant default, the Company would be competing
with other real estate owners, who have property vacancies, to
attract a new tenant to lease the property. The Company's
tenants operate in industries that are very competitive and can
be affected by factors such as changes in regional or local
economies, seasonality and changes in consumer preference.

The properties listed above with a partial ownership
percentage are owned with the following affiliated entities:
Sports Authority store (AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC); Advance
Auto Parts store (AEI Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC); Applebee's
restaurant in Crawfordsville, Indiana (AEI Income & Growth Fund
XXII Limited Partnership); Best Buy store (AEI Income & Growth
Fund XXI Limited Partnership and AEI Income & Growth Fund 23
LLC); and Dick's Sporting Goods store in Fredericksburg, Virginia
(AEI Income & Growth Fund 23 LLC, AEI Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC
and AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC).

 The Company accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
common with affiliated entities using the proportionate
consolidation method. Each tenant-in-common owns a separate,
undivided interest in the properties. Any tenant-in-common that
holds more than a 50 interest does not control decisions over
the other tenant-in-common interests. The financial statements
reflect only this Company's percentage share of the properties'
land, building and equipment, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

 At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining
primary lease terms varied from 10 to 20 years. The leases
provide the tenants with three to four five-year renewal options
subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term.

 Pursuant to the lease agreements, the tenants are required
to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage on the properties
they occupy. The Managing Members believe the properties are
adequately covered by insurance and consider the properties to be
well-maintained and sufficient for the Company's operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. (Continued)

 For tax purposes, the Company's properties are depreciated
under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The
largest depreciable component of a property is the building which
is depreciated, using the straight-line method, over 39 years.
The remaining depreciable components of a property are personal
property and land improvements which are depreciated, using an
accelerated method, over 5 and 15 years, respectively. Since the
Company has tax-exempt Members, the Company is subject to the
rules of Section 168(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code which
requires a percentage of the properties' depreciable components
to be depreciated over longer lives using the straight-line
method. In general, the federal tax basis of the properties for
tax depreciation purposes will be the same as the basis for book
depreciation purposes.

 At December 31, 2010, all properties listed above were
100 occupied.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
 HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

 (a) As of December 31, 2010, there were 454 holders of
record of the registrant's LLC Units. There is no other class of
security outstanding or authorized. The registrant's Units are
not a traded security in any market. During the period covered
by this report, the Company did not sell any equity securities
that are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

 Cash distributions of 28,333 and 25,009 were made to the
Managing Members and 916,092 and 916,368 were made to the
Limited Members for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
distributions were made on a quarterly basis and represent Net
Cash Flow, as defined, and a partial return of contributed
capital. These distributions should not be compared with
dividends paid on capital stock by corporations.

 (b) Not Applicable.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
 HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

 (c) Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Operating Agreement,
each Limited Member has the right to present Units to the Company
for purchase by submitting notice to the Managing Member during
January or July of each year. The purchase price of the Units is
equal to 85 of the net asset value per Unit, as of the first
business day of January or July of each year, as determined by
the Managing Member in accordance with the provisions of the
Operating Agreement. The purchase price is equal to 100 of the
net asset value per Unit in the case of Units of a deceased
investor, who purchased the Units in the initial offering and who
is a natural person, including Units held by an investor that is
an IRA or other qualified plan for which the deceased person was
the primary beneficiary, or Units held by an investor that is a
grantor trust for which the deceased person was the grantor.

 Units tendered to the Company during January and July are
redeemed on April 1st and October 1st, respectively, of each year
subject to the following limitations. The Company will not be
obligated to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total
number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no
event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the
sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would
impair the capital or operation of the Company. During the last
three months of 2010, the Company did not purchase any Units.

Other Information

 The Company is required, pursuant to FINRA Rule 2810, to
disclose in each annual report distributed to Limited Members a
per Unit estimated value, the method by which it was developed
and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value. At
December 31, 2010, the Company's Units were valued at 7.57.
This value was the aggregate estimated value of the Company's
assets less the Company's liabilities, and less the value
attributable to the interest of the Managing Members, divided by
the number of Units outstanding. The Company's cash, receivables
and liabilities were valued at face value. Each of the Company's
properties were valued by dividing their annual rental income as
of December 1, 2010 by a capitalization rate the Managing Member
believed to be representative of the retail market for the sale
of each property. The resulting value for each property was
reviewed to determine that it also reflected circumstances that
may have been unique to each specific property. No independent
property appraisals were obtained. The valuations performed by
the Managing Member were estimates only, and were based on a
number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete. In
addition, property values are subject to change and could decline
after the date of the valuations. Accordingly, this estimated
value, prepared by the Managing Member, should not be viewed as
the amount at which a Limited Member may be able to sell his
units, or the fair market value of the Company properties, nor
does it represent the amount of net proceeds Limited Members
would receive if the Company properties were sold and the
proceeds distributed in a liquidation of the Company.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

 Not required for a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 This section contains "forward-looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of
distribution, and other matters. These, and other forward-
looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a
number of factors that may affect the Company's financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

 Market and economic conditions which affect the value
 of the properties the Company owns and the cash from
 rental income such properties generate;

 the federal income tax consequences of rental income,
 deductions, gain on sales and other items and the
 effects of these consequences for Members;

 resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with
 which they may be confronted;

 the success of the Managing Members of locating
 properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

 the effect of tenant defaults; and

 the condition of the industries in which the tenants of
 properties owned by the Company operate.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing
basis, including those related to the carrying value of
investments in real estate and the allocation by AEI Fund
Management, Inc. of expenses to the Company as opposed to other
funds they manage.

 The Company purchases properties and records them in the
financial statements at cost (not including acquisition
expenses). The Company tests long-lived assets for
recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties
the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying
value. For properties held for sale, management determines
whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's
estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying
value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable
value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying
value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in
these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the
carrying value of the properties.

 AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of
the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of
hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs. They
also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of
investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to
other funds they manage. The Company reimburses these expenses
subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating
Agreement.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)

 Management of the Company has discussed the development
and selection of the above accounting estimates and the
management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
Company recognized rental income of 1,142,862 and 1,144,072,
respectively. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties
owned as of February 28, 2011, the Company expects to recognize
rental income of approximately 1,149,000 in 2011.

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated
parties of 174,243 and 177,110, respectively. These
administration expenses include costs associated with the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members. During
the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and
property management expenses from unrelated parties of 24,236
and 25,948, respectively. These expenses represent direct
payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and
other property costs.

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
depreciation expense was 375,383 and 436,708, respectively. In
2009, depreciation expense was higher as a result of
reclassifying the Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas from
held-for-sale status to held-for-use status during the fourth
quarter of 2009. At the time of reclassification, the Company
recognized 122,651 of additional depreciation expense that
represented the amount of depreciation that would have been
recognized if the property had not been classified as Real Estate
Held for Sale. This amount represented two years of depreciation
expense for the property, which was recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2009.

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
Company recognized interest income of 2,367 and 2,513,
respectively.

 Management believes inflation has not significantly
affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental
income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the
real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and
changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating
margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their
ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company's
cash balances decreased 47,754 as a result of distributions and
redemption payments paid to the Members in excess of cash
generated from operating activities. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, the Company's cash balances decreased 13,001
as a result of distributions paid to the Members in excess of
cash generated from operating activities.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from
 940,186 in 2009 to 936,172 in 2010 as a result of a decrease in
total rental and interest income in 2010 and net timing
differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and
the payment of expenses, which were partially offset by a
decrease in LLC administration and property management expenses
in 2010.

 The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than
investment in real estate, is distribution and redemption
payments to Members. The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the
distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.
The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter to quarter. Redemption payments are paid to redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
Company declared distributions of 944,425 and 941,377,
respectively. The Limited Members received distributions of
 916,092 and 916,368 and the Managing Members received
distributions of 28,333 and 25,009 for the periods,
respectively.

 The Company may acquire Units from Limited Members who
have tendered their Units to the Company. Such Units may be
acquired at a discount. The Company will not be obligated to
purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of Units
outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

 During 2010, one Limited Member redeemed a total of 5,000
Units for 38,225 in accordance with the Operating Agreement.
The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from
operations. During 2009, the Company did not redeem any Units
from the Limited Members. The redemptions increase the remaining
Limited Members' ownership interest in the Company. As a result
of this redemption payment and pursuant to the Operating
Agreement, the Managing Members received distributions of 1,182
in 2010.

 The continuing rent payments from the properties should be
adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other
obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

 The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the turmoil in the credit markets, has adversely affected many
real estate investment funds. However, the absence of mortgage
financing on the Company's properties eliminates the risks of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively impact the
value and distributions of leveraged real estate investment
funds. Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely
affect the operations of the Company's tenants and their cash
flows. If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the
Company's income would decrease, its distributions would likely
be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)

 The Company's plan is to periodically sell properties to
generate capital gains that would be included in the Company's
regular quarterly distributions and to make special distributions
on occasion. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, general
economic conditions caused the volume of property sales to slow
dramatically for all real estate sellers. During 2008, 2009 and
2010, the Company did not complete any property sales. Until
such time as economic conditions allow the Company to begin
selling properties at attractive prices, quarterly distributions
will reflect the distribution of net core rental income and
capital reserves, if any. Distribution rates in 2011 are
expected to be consistent with distribution rates in 2010.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members:
AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC
St. Paul, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of AEI Income
& Growth Fund 26 LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related statements of income,
cash flows and changes in members' equity (deficit) for the years
then ended. The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC as of December 31, 2010 and
2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 26 LLC
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(1) Organization -

 AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC ("Company"), a Limited
 Liability Company, was formed on March 14, 2005 to acquire
 and lease commercial properties to operating tenants. The
 Company's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI,
 Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing Member. Robert P. Johnson, the
 President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Special
 Managing Member. AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI
 Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the majority
 shareholder. AEI Fund Management, Inc. ("AEI"), an
 affiliate of AFM, performs the administrative and operating
 functions for the Company.

 The terms of the offering called for a subscription price of
 10 per LLC Unit, payable on acceptance of the offer. The
 Company commenced operations on April 3, 2006 when minimum
 subscriptions of 150,000 LLC Units 1,500,000) were
 accepted. The offering terminated October 19, 2007, when
 the extended offering period expired. The Company received
 subscriptions for 1,832,736 Units. Under the terms of the
 Operating Agreement, the Limited Members and Managing
 Members contributed funds of 18,327,360 and 1,000,
 respectively. The Company shall continue until December 31,
 2055, unless dissolved, terminated and liquidated prior to
 that date.

 During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which the
 Managing Members determine to distribute will be distributed
 97 to the Limited Members and 3 to the Managing Members.
 Distributions to Limited Members will be made pro rata by
 Units.

 Any Net Proceeds of Sale, as defined, from the sale or
 financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
 to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
 be paid in the following manner: (i) first, 99 to the
 Limited Members and 1 to the Managing Members until the
 Limited Members receive an amount equal to: (a) their
 Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to
 6.5 of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum,
 cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously
 distributed from Net Cash Flow; (ii) any remaining balance
 will be distributed 90 to the Limited Members and 10 to
 the Managing Members. Distributions to the Limited Members
 will be made pro rata by Units.

 For tax purposes, profits from operations, other than
 profits attributable to the sale, exchange, financing,
 refinancing or other disposition of property, will be
 allocated 97 to the Limited Members and 3 to the Managing
 Members. Net losses from operations will be allocated 99 
 to the Limited Members and 1 to the Managing Members.

AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 26 LLC
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(1) Organization - (Continued)

 For tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,
 or other disposition of property will be allocated in
 accordance with the Operating Agreement as follows: (i)
 first, to those Members with deficit balances in their
 capital accounts in an amount equal to the sum of such
 deficit balances; (ii) second, 99 to the Limited Members
 and 1 to the Managing Members until the aggregate balance
 in the Limited Members' capital accounts equals the sum of
 the Limited Members' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus an
 amount equal to 6.5 of their Adjusted Capital Contributions
 per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not
 previously allocated; (iii) third, the balance of any
 remaining gain will then be allocated 90 to the Limited
 Members and 10 to the Managing Members. Losses will be
 allocated 99 to the Limited Members and 1 to the Managing
 Members.

 The Managing Members are not required to currently fund a
 deficit capital balance. Upon liquidation of the Company or
 withdrawal by a Managing Member, the Managing Members will
 contribute to the Company an amount equal to the lesser of
 the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01 of
 the total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
 the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -

 Financial Statement Presentation

 The accounts of the Company are maintained on the accrual
 basis of accounting for both federal income tax purposes
 and financial reporting purposes.

 Accounting Estimates

 Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing
 these financial statements in accordance with generally
 accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and
 assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
 liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.
 Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 Significant items, subject to such estimates and
 assumptions, include the carrying value of investments in
 real estate.

 The Company regularly assesses whether market events and
 conditions indicate that it is reasonably possible to
 recover the carrying amounts of its investments in real
 estate from future operations and sales. A change in
 those market events and conditions could have a material
 effect on the carrying amount of its real estate.

AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 26 LLC
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

 Cash Concentrations of Credit Risk

 The Company's cash is deposited in one financial
 institution and at times during the year it may exceed
 FDIC insurance limits.

 Receivables

 Credit terms are extended to tenants in the normal course
 of business. The Company performs ongoing credit
 evaluations of its customers' financial condition and,
 generally, requires no collateral.

 Receivables are recorded at their estimated net
 realizable value. The Company follows a policy of
 providing an allowance for doubtful accounts; however,
 based on historical experience, and its evaluation of the
 current status of receivables, the Company is of the
 belief that such accounts, if any, will be collectible in
 all material respects and thus an allowance is not
 necessary. Accounts are considered past due if payment
 is not made on a timely basis in accordance with the
 Company's credit terms. Receivables considered
 uncollectible are written off.

 Income Taxes

 The income or loss of the Company for federal income tax
 reporting purposes is includable in the income tax
 returns of the Members. In general, no recognition has
 been given to income taxes in the accompanying financial
 statements.

 The tax return and the amount of distributable Company
 income or loss are subject to examination by federal and
 state taxing authorities. If such an examination results
 in changes to distributable Company income or loss, the
 taxable income of the members would be adjusted
 accordingly. Primarily due to its tax status as a
 partnership, the Company has no significant tax
 uncertainties that require recognition or disclosure.

 Revenue Recognition

 The Company's real estate is leased under net leases,
 classified as operating leases. The leases provide for
 base annual rental payments payable in monthly
 installments. The Company recognizes rental revenue
 according to the terms of the individual leases. For
 leases that contain stated rental increases, the
 increases are recognized in the year in which they are
 effective. Contingent rental payments are recognized
 when the contingencies on which the payments are based
 are satisfied and the rental payments become due under
 the terms of the leases.

AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 26 LLC
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

 Investments in Real Estate

 The Company purchases properties and records them at
 cost. The Company tests real estate for recoverability
 when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
 carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties
 the Company will hold and operate, it compares the
 carrying amount of the property to the estimated
 probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows
 expected to result from the property and its eventual
 disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash
 flows is less than the carrying amount of the property,
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss by the amount
 by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the
 fair value of the property. For properties held for
 sale, the Company determines whether impairment has
 occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value
 less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the
 carrying value is greater than the net realizable value,
 an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying
 value of the property to its net realizable value.

 Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company capitalized as
 Investments in Real Estate certain costs incurred in the
 review and acquisition of the properties. The costs were
 allocated to the land, buildings and equipment. For
 acquisitions completed on or after January 1, 2009,
 acquisition-related transaction costs will be expensed as
 incurred as a result of the Company adopting new guidance
 on business combinations that expands the scope of
 acquisition accounting.

 The buildings and equipment of the Company are
 depreciated using the straight-line method for financial
 reporting purposes based on estimated useful lives of 25
 years and 5 years, respectively.

 Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of
 a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company
 includes the operating results and sale of the property
 in discontinued operations. In addition, the Company
 reclassifies the prior periods' operating results of the
 property to discontinued operations.

 The Company accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
 common with affiliated entities using the proportionate
 consolidation method. Each tenant-in-common owns a
 separate, undivided interest in the properties. Any
 tenant-in-common that holds more than a 50 interest does
 not control decisions over the other tenant-in-common
 interests. The financial statements reflect only this
 Company's percentage share of the properties' land,
 building and equipment, liabilities, revenues and
 expenses.

AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 26 LLC
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

 The Company's properties are subject to environmental
 laws and regulations adopted by various governmental
 entities in the jurisdiction in which the properties are
 located. These laws could require the Company to
 investigate and remediate the effects of the release or
 disposal of hazardous materials at these locations if
 found. For each property, an environmental assessment is
 completed prior to acquisition. In addition, the lease
 agreements typically strictly prohibit the production,
 handling, or storage of hazardous materials (except where
 incidental to the tenant's business such as use of
 cleaning supplies) in violation of applicable law to
 restrict environmental and other damage. Environmental
 liabilities are recorded when it is determined the
 liability is probable and the costs can reasonably be
 estimated. There were no environmental issues noted or
 liabilities recorded at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Fair Value Measurements

 As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no assets or
 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
 or nonrecurring basis.

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 Management has reviewed recently issued, but not yet
 effective, accounting pronouncements and does not expect
 the implementation of these pronouncements to have a
 significant effect on the Company's financial statements.

(3) Related Party Transactions -

 The Company owns the percentage interest shown below in the
 following properties as tenants-in-common with the
 affiliated entities listed: Sports Authority store (40 -
 AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC); Advance Auto Parts store

 ======== ========

 The payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc. represents the
 balance due for the services described in 3a and b. This
 balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be
 paid in the normal course of business.

(4) Investments in Real Estate -

 The Company leases its properties to various tenants under
 net leases, classified as operating leases. Under a net
 lease, the tenant is responsible for real estate taxes,
 insurance, maintenance, repairs and operating expenses for
 the property. For some leases, the Company is responsible
 for repairs to the structural components of the building.
 At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining
 primary lease terms varied from 10 to 20 years. The leases
 provide the tenants with three to four five-year renewal
 options subject to the same terms and conditions as the
 primary term.

 The Company's properties are commercial, single-tenant
 buildings. The Sports Authority store was constructed in
 1996, renovated in 2001 and acquired in 2006. The Advance
 Auto Parts store was constructed in 2004 and acquired in
 2006. The Applebee's restaurant in Indianapolis, Indiana
 was constructed in 1997 and acquired in 2006. The
 Applebee's restaurant in Crawfordsville, Indiana was

 completed in 2008. There have been no costs capitalized as
 improvements subsequent to the acquisitions.

(6) Members' Capital -

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
 declared distributions of 944,425 and 941,377,
 respectively. The Limited Members received distributions of
 916,092 and 916,368 and the Managing Members received
 distributions of 28,333 and 25,009 for the years,
 respectively. The Limited Members' distributions represent
 0.50 and 0.50 per LLC Unit outstanding using 1,828,986 and
 1,832,736 weighted average Units in 2010 and 2009,
 respectively. The distributions represent 0.30 and 0.27
 per Unit of Net Income and 0.20 and 0.23 per Unit of
 return of contributed capital in 2010 and 2009,
 respectively.

 The Company may acquire Units from Limited Members who have
 tendered their Units to the Company. Such Units may be
 acquired at a discount. The Company will not be obligated
 to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of
 Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event
 shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the
 sole discretion of the Managing Members, such purchase would
 impair the capital or operation of the Company.

 During 2010, one Limited Member redeemed a total of 5,000
 Units for 38,225 in accordance with the Operating
 Agreement. The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash
 Flow from operations. During 2009, the Company did not
 redeem any Units from the Limited Members. The redemptions
 increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest
 in the Company. As a result of this redemption payment and
 pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Managing Members
 received distributions of 1,182 in 2010.

 After the effect of redemptions, the Adjusted Capital
 Contribution, as defined in the Operating Agreement, is
 10.03 per original 10 invested.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
 ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

 None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

 Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer,
the Managing Member of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")). Based upon that
evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer of the
Managing Member concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective in ensuring that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer
of the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

 (i) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. The Managing Member, through its management, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for performing an assessment of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
system of internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
of the Managing Member; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Management of the Managing Member performed an assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010 based upon criteria in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
Based on our assessment, management of the Managing Member
determined that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2010 based on the criteria in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. (Continued)

 This annual report does not include an attestation report
of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management's report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm
pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that
permit us to provide only management's report in this annual
report.

 (ii) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. During the most recent period covered by this report,
there has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.

 None.

PART III

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

 The registrant is a limited liability company and has no
officers, directors, or direct employees. The Managing Members
manage and control the Company's affairs and have general
responsibility and the ultimate authority in all matters
affecting the Company's business. The Managing Members are AEI
Fund Management XXI, Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing Member, and
Robert P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President and sole
director of AFM, the Special Managing Member. AFM is a wholly
owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson
is the majority shareholder. AFM has only one senior financial
executive, its Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial
Officer reports directly to Mr. Johnson and is accountable for
his actions to Mr. Johnson. Although Mr. Johnson and AFM require
that all of their personnel, including the Chief Financial
Officer, engage in honest and ethical conduct, ensure full, fair,
accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure, comply with all
applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, and report
to Mr. Johnson any deviation from these principles, because the
organization is composed of only approximately 35 individuals,
because the management of a company by an entity that has
different interests in distributions and income than investors
involves numerous conflicts of interest that must be resolved on
a daily basis, and because the ultimate decision maker in all
instances is Mr. Johnson, AFM has not adopted a formal code of
conduct. Instead, the materials pursuant to which investors
purchase Units disclose these conflicts of interest in detail and
Mr. Johnson, as the CEO and sole director of AFM, resolves
conflicts to the best of his ability, consistent with his
fiduciary obligations to AFM and the fiduciary obligations of AFM
to the Company. The director and officers of AFM are as follows:

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
 (Continued)

 Robert P. Johnson, age 66, is Chief Executive Officer,
President and sole director and has held these positions since
the formation of AFM in August 1994, and has been elected to
continue in these positions until December 2011. From 1970 to
the present, he has been employed exclusively in the investment
industry, specializing in limited partnership investments. In
that capacity, he has been involved in the development, analysis,
marketing and management of public and private investment
programs investing in net lease properties as well as public and
private investment programs investing in energy development.
Since 1971, Mr. Johnson has been the president, a director and a
registered principal of AEI Securities, Inc., which is registered
with the SEC as a securities broker-dealer, is a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and is a member
of the Security Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC). Mr.
Johnson has been president, a director and the principal
shareholder of AEI Fund Management, Inc., a real estate
management company founded by him, since 1978. Mr. Johnson is
currently a general partner or principal of the general partner
in nine limited partnerships and a managing member in five LLCs.

 Patrick W. Keene, age 51, is Chief Financial Officer,
Treasurer and Secretary and has held these positions since
January 22, 2003 and has been elected to continue in these
positions until December 2011. Mr. Keene has been employed by
AEI Fund Management, Inc. and affiliated entities since 1986.
Prior to being elected to the positions above, he was Controller
of the various entities. From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Keene was with
KPMG Peat Marwick Certified Public Accountants, first as an
auditor and later as a tax manager. Mr. Keene is responsible for
all accounting functions of AFM and the registrant.

 Since Mr. Johnson serves as the Special Managing Member of
the Company, as well as the sole director of AFM, all of the
duties that might be assigned to an audit committee are assigned
to Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson is not an audit committee financial
expert, as defined. As an officer and majority owner, through a
parent company, of AFM, and as the Special Managing Member, Mr.
Johnson is not a "disinterested director" and may be subject to a
number of conflicts of interests in his capacity as sole director
of AFM.

 Before the independent auditors are engaged, Mr. Johnson,
as the sole director of AFM, approves all audit-related fees, and
all permissible nonaudit fees, for services of our auditors.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

 Under federal securities laws, the directors and officers
of the Managing Member of the Company, and any beneficial owner
of more than 10 of a class of equity securities of the Company,
are required to report their ownership of the Company's equity
securities and any changes in such ownership to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Specific due dates
for these reports have been established by the Commission, and
the Company is required to disclose in this Annual Report on 10-K
any delinquent filing of such reports and any failure to file
such reports during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
Based upon information provided by officers and directors of the
Managing Member, all officers, directors and 10 owners filed all
reports on a timely basis in the 2010 fiscal year.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

 The Managing Member and affiliates are reimbursed at cost
for all services performed on behalf of the registrant and for
all third party expenses paid on behalf of the registrant. The
cost for services performed on behalf of the registrant is based
on actual time spent performing such services plus an overhead
burden. These services include organizing the registrant and
arranging for the offer and sale of Units, reviewing properties
for acquisition and rendering administrative, property management
and property sales services. The amount and nature of such
payments are detailed in Item 13 of this annual report on Form 10-
K.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
 MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

 The following table sets forth information pertaining to
the ownership of the Units by each person known by the Company to
beneficially own 5 or more of the Units, by each Managing
Member, and by each officer or director of the Managing Member as
of February 28, 2011:

 Name and Address Number of Percent
 of Beneficial Owner Units Held of Class

 AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. 0 0 
 Robert P. Johnson 0 0 
 Patrick W. Keene 0 0 

 Address for all:
 1300 Wells Fargo Place
 30 East 7th Street, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101

The Managing Members know of no holders of more than 5 of the
outstanding Units.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

 The registrant, AFM and its affiliates have common
management and utilize the same facilities. As a result, certain
administrative expenses are allocated among these related
entities. All of such activities and any other transactions
involving the affiliates of the Managing Member of the registrant
are governed by, and are conducted in conformity with, the
limitations set forth in the Operating Agreement of the
registrant. Reference is made to Note 3 of the Financial
Statements, as presented, and is incorporated herein by
reference, for details of related party transactions for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

 Neither the registrant, nor the Managing Member of the
registrant, has a board of directors consisting of any members
who are "independent." The sole director of the Managing Member,
Robert P. Johnson, is also the Special Managing Member of the
registrant, and is the Chief Executive Officer, and indirectly
the principal owner, of the Managing Member. Accordingly, there
is no disinterested board, or other functioning body, that
reviews related party transactions, or the transactions between
the registrant and the Managing Members, except as performed in
connection with the audit of its financial statements.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. (Continued)

 The limitations included in the Operating Agreement
require that the cumulative reimbursements to the Managing
Members and their affiliates for certain expenses will not exceed
an amount equal to the sum of (i) 20 of capital contributions,
(ii) 1 of gross revenues, plus an initial leasing fee of 3 of
gross revenues for the first five years of the original term of
each lease, (iii) 3 of Net Proceeds of Sale, and (iv) 10 of Net
Cash Flow less the Net Cash Flow actually distributed to the
Managing Members. The cumulative reimbursements subject to this
limitation are reimbursements for (i) organization and offering
expenses, including commissions and an Organization Fee, (ii)
acquisition expenses paid with proceeds from the initial offering
of Units, (iii) services provided in the sales effort of
properties, and (iv) expenses of controlling persons and overhead
expenses directly attributable to the forgoing services or
attributable to administrative services. As of December 31,
2010, these cumulative reimbursements to the Managing Members and
their affiliates did not exceed the limitation amount.

 The following table sets forth the forms of compensation,
distributions and cost reimbursements paid by the registrant to
the Managing Members or their Affiliates in connection with the
operation of the Fund and its properties for the period from
inception through December 31, 2010.
