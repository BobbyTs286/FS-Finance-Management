Morris
 Publishing Group, LLC 

Morris
 Publishing Group, LLC is a private company owned by the William S. Morris
 III
 family as part of their Morris Communications group of companies. 

Morris
 Publishing, the newspaper division, forms the core business unit of Morris
 Communications, contributing approximately 69 of Morris Communications total
 operating revenues. All of Morris Publishing s newspapers are published in the
 United States. 

Morris
 Communications' other divisions include: outdoor advertising, national
 magazines, visitor publications, radio and book publishing and distribution.
 It
 also has an online and technology division. 

The
 Morris Publishing Group owns and operates 27 daily newspapers as well
 as
 nondaily newspapers, city magazines and free community publications in
 the
 Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Alaska. Our corporate offices are located
 at
 725 Broad Street, Augusta, Georgia, 30901 and our telephone number at
 this
 address is 706-724-0851. 

For
 the
 year 2006, our newspapers had unaudited average daily and average Sunday
 paid
 circulation of approximately 640,000 and 720,000, respectively. 

Our
 largest newspapers are The
 Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville,
 Florida, The
 Augusta Chronicle, Georgia,
 The
 Topeka Capital-Journal, Kansas,
 Savannah
 Morning News, Georgia,
 Lubbock
 Avalanche-Journal, 
 Texas
 and 
 Amarillo Globe-News ,
 Texas,
 which together account for approximately 67 of our average daily circulation
 and 76 of our average Sunday circulation. 

We
 also
 print and distribute periodicals and operate commercial printing operations
 in
 conjunction with some of our newspapers. In addition, our newspaper operations
 generate revenues from both print and online media formats. 

Our
 newspapers are geographically diverse, primarily serving mid-sized to
 small
 communities in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Michigan,
 Missouri, Minnesota, Alaska, Arkansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and South
 Carolina. The majority of our daily newspapers have no significant competition
 from other local daily newspapers in their respective communities. 

Our
 total
 operating revenue for 2006 was 475.2 million and has ranged between
 433.4
 million and 465.1 million over the previous four years. 

We
 have
 two primary sources of revenue: advertising and circulation. In 2006,
 the
 advertising source, including both print and online, represented 81.9 
 of total
 operating revenues. We are constantly working to maximize our competitive
 advantage to grow our advertising revenues. Retail, classified and national
 advertising revenue represented 51.5 , 42.2 and 6.3 , respectively,
 of our
 total 2006 advertising revenue. 

Online
 advertising revenue, included in all advertising categories above, represented
 8.3 of our total 2006 advertising revenue. The average number of page
 views per
 month from all of our newspaper Web sites was 64.5 million in 2006, up
 from 55.8 million in 2005. 

Advertising
 revenue is primarily determined by the linage, rate and mix of advertisement.
 The advertising rate depends largely on our market reach, primarily through
 circulation, and readership. Circulation revenue is based on the number
 of
 newspapers sold. 

During
 2006, the circulation source represented 14.7 of total operating
 revenue. Our other revenues consist primarily of commercial printing,
 other
 online revenue, licensing fees and other miscellaneous revenue. Commercial
 printing revenue represented 2.1 of total operating revenue. 

Employee
 and newsprint expenses are the primary costs at each newspaper. Our operating
 performance is significantly affected by newsprint prices, which historically
 have fluctuated substantially.

From
 time
 to time, each individual newspaper may perform better or worse than our
 newspaper group as a whole due to certain local conditions, particularly
 within
 the retail, auto, housing and labor markets. 

History 

Morris
 Publishing was formed in 2001 as MCC Newspapers, LLC to own and operate the
 newspaper business historically operated by our parent, Morris Communications.
 We changed our name to Morris Publishing Group, LLC in July 2003. 

William
 S. Morris III joined our business in the 1950s and has been our chairman
 for
 more than three decades. William S. Morris IV, his elder son, is president
 and
 CEO of Morris Publishing. The Morris family became involved with The
 Augusta Chronicle in
 1929,
 when William S. Morris, Jr., father of today s chairman, became a bookkeeper at
 the daily newspaper, which was started in 1785 as the Augusta
 Gazette, the
 town s first newspaper. Mr. Morris Jr. purchased The
 Augusta Chronicle in
 the
 early 1940s with a partner, and later purchased his partner s half
 interest. 

With
 the
 Augusta morning and afternoon newspapers as a base, our expansion began
 in the
 1950s with the purchase of a television station in Augusta and an initial
 public
 offering of common shares, which were re-purchased in 1959. In the 1960s,
 we
 sold the television station and purchased two other daily newspapers
 in
 Georgia one in Savannah and one in Athens. In 1972, we purchased our Texas
 newspapers in Amarillo and Lubbock. In 1983, we acquired The Florida
 Publishing
 Company, which included The
 Florida Times-Union and
 other
 Florida newspapers. 

Our
 expansion continued in 1995 with the purchase of all of the outstanding
 stock of
 Stauffer Communications, Inc. This purchase included 20 daily newspapers,
 nondaily newspapers and shoppers, as well as television and radio stations
 and
 other properties that are owned, or have been disposed of, by Morris
 Communications or its other operating subsidiaries. 

In
 2005,
 we launched Bluffton
 Today ,
 a free
 daily newspaper, in Bluffton, South Carolina. This publication was a
 vehicle for
 new innovations in daily newspaper and Web publishing, with much of the
 content
 being user contributed. We are using Bluffton
 Today s 
 focus on
 reader participation as a model for the Savannah
 Morning News 
 and the
 North
 Augusta Today s 
 new
 next-generation Web sites and the future next-next generation Web sites
 at many
 of our other Morris Publications. 

Industry
 background 

Key
 revenue drivers 

The
 newspaper industry is reported to generate annual revenues of approximately
 60.2 billion primarily based on advertising and circulation. On average, 82 
 of
 its total revenue is derived from print and online advertising, while 18 comes
 from circulation. Approximately 79 of all newspaper revenue is from the print
 advertising media. 

While
 newspaper revenue is directly impacted by the level of advertising, it is
 indirectly impacted by market conditions and factors like changes in supply
 and
 demand for various products and changes in interest rates. Newspaper companies
 can affect, to some extent, the demand for advertising by influencing
 circulation and readership, and by adjusting advertising rates, sales efforts
 and customer service. 

There
 are
 three major classifications of newspaper advertising: retail, classified, and
 national: 

Retail
 advertising, also called local advertising, makes up approximately
 45 of
 total newspaper advertising. Department and discount stores, grocery
 and
 drug stores, and furniture and appliance stores are the main advertisers
 in this category. 

Classified
 advertising includes employment, real estate, automotive and other
 categories, and comprises approximately 35 of total advertising;
 it is
 the most cyclical type of newspaper
 advertising. 

National
 advertising, also known as general advertising, includes manufacturers 
 product advertising, travel and resorts. This category is the smallest,
 comprising approximately 20 of the total, and carries the highest
 rates. 

Online
 advertising revenue, included in all three categories above, makes up
 approximately 4 of total newspaper advertising. 

In
 recent
 years, newspapers in general have been reported to have increased advertising
 revenue but lost advertising market share. In 1994, the newspaper industry
 was
 reported to capture 34.1 billion in advertising revenue and to have garnered
 a
 22.8 share of advertising market expenditures; revenue was reported to rise
 to
 49 billion in 2005, but advertising market share was reported to decline
 to
 approximately 17.0 in 2005. 

-2- 

Table
 of Contents 

While
 newspapers may continue to lose advertising market share to other media,
 newspapers should remain competitive given that we believe: 

Newspapers
 are the medium most people use to check advertising before they make
 their
 purchases, 

Newspapers
 carry more local news than other media,
 and 

Newspapers
 claim the largest share of local
 advertising, 

Key
 cost drivers 

The
 two
 largest costs of a newspaper are labor and newsprint. 

Labor:
 Labor
 costs represent approximately 35-40 of total revenues. Total industry
 employment steadily declined in the 1990s, as significant investment in more
 automated production methods has led to efficiencies and higher productivity
 per
 worker. However, industry wide medical health care insurance and pension
 benefit
 costs are rising. 

Newsprint:
 Newsprint
 costs represent approximately 10-15 of newspapers total revenues. Newspapers
 continue to face volatile newsprint prices, since changing supply and demand
 factors typically control its pricing. Since 1990, quarterly average newsprint
 costs ranged from 436 to 632 per metric ton and averaged 541 per metric
 ton
 during the same period. 

In
 the
 first half of 2001, newsprint prices in the U.S. were at their highest point
 since mid-1996. Prices dropped to their lowest level in a decade in mid-2002,
 but have trended upward since then. Newsprint prices increased by almost
 9.3 on
 average during 2006 and 10.9 on average in 2005 compared to 2004. Newsprint
 prices are expected to decrease from 5.5 to 6.5 in 2007. 

Circulation
 and Readership 

Circulation
 is important to the newspaper industry in two ways. From an editorial
 perspective, increased circulation demonstrates the quality of the editorial
 product and the demand for the paper from readers. From a revenue perspective,
 advertisers are willing to pay higher rates for greater reach. 

The
 newspaper industry has faced circulation and readership declines since the
 1980s. Over the past 25 years, the total number of daily newspapers in the
 United States has decreased from 1,745 in 1980 to 1,452 in 2005. The drop
 is
 largely due to a decline in evening newspapers, principally because of the
 emergence of nightly news broadcasts, 24-hour news channels, and the Internet.
 The total number of morning newspapers has doubled and Sunday newspapers
 have
 increased by 80 . 

The
 advertising recession over the past three years has driven publishing companies
 to significantly reduce their operating costs. Consequently, the industry
 is
 experiencing a trend toward consolidation. By owning multiple properties
 in
 specific markets, newspaper publishers can spread costs and achieve greater
 efficiencies. 

Telemarketing
 rules adopted by the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications
 Commission, including the National Do-Not-Call Registry and regulations,
 have
 had an impact on our ability to source subscriptions through telemarketing.
 Previously, an estimated 70 of our new starts came from telemarketing. We
 have
 begun several programs to offset the effect of this legislation. We are focusing
 on retaining current customers through stronger retention efforts, which
 include
 increased customer service, lengthening the subscription periods for new
 and
 existing customers, and new payment methods. We have increased our circulation
 sales efforts on kiosk sales, and newspaper-in-education programs, while
 also
 looking toward other methods (direct mail, etc.) Now telemarketing accounts
 for
 about 38 of
 our
 new order starts. 

In
 addition, in order to diversify, Morris and other newspapers have begun efforts
 in circulation and advertising target marketing segmentation. This allows
 newspapers to target individual households based on various demographic and
 lifestyle characteristics, focusing on those that look like our best and most
 desired customers. We believe that this effort plus increased retention efforts
 will allow newspapers to better control circulation volumes and to grow
 circulation in the geographic and demographic groups that advertisers
 want. 

Online 

 The
 Internet provides an additional medium through which newspapers reach audiences,
 and newspapers have ventured online to increase readership and leverage their
 local brands. 

Approximately
 40 percent of Internet users looking for local news are reported to turn
 to
 online newspapers. 

The
 majority of local online advertising dollars comes from classifieds, with
 the
 Internet accounting for about 13-15 of all help wanted revenues.

We
 seek
 to utilize advanced technology and superior content to be fully engaged in
 meeting the industry imperative of building and maintaining circulation and
 readership in a competitive climate. In all of our news and information
 products, we are committed to local coverage and to the highest standards
 of
 journalism. We are dedicated to coverage that acknowledges the diversity
 of our
 readers. 

Our
 strategy is to be the pre-eminent source of news, information, and advertising
 in our markets by: 

Remaining
 an aggressive, agile, innovative and market-driven company, leading
 our
 markets by building strong
 communities. 

Creating
 marketplaces, growing market share and maintaining financial strength
 by
 creating, acquiring and continually improving products, multimedia
 platforms, services, and
 efficiencies. 

Providing
 our employees an environment that both motivates and inspires them
 to
 continue to produce superior products and to further enhance customer
 service. 

Achieving
 this strategy is based upon the following initiatives: 

Being
 the leading provider of local information. We
 believe we are the trusted source of local news, information, and
 local
 advertising in the communities we serve. Our newspapers have won
 various
 editorial awards in many of our markets. As the leading provider
 of local
 news and information in print and online formats in our markets,
 we
 believe we can both maintain and increase our share of readership
 and
 local advertising expenditures. 

Increasing
 readership. 
 We
 are committed to maintaining the high quality of our newspapers and
 their
 editorial integrity to assure continued reader loyalty. Through extensive
 market research we strive to deliver the service and content each
 of our
 markets demands. Furthermore, by introducing niche publications that
 address the needs of targeted groups and by offering earlier delivery
 times, we continue to create opportunities to introduce new readers
 to our
 newspapers. 

Growing
 advertising revenue. 
 Through targeted market research, we attempt to understand the needs
 of
 our advertisers. This market understanding enables us to develop
 programs
 that address the individual needs of our advertisers and to appeal
 to
 targeted groups of advertisers and readers with niche publications
 addressing specific areas such as real estate, automobiles, employment,
 farming, nursing, antiques, college student guides, foreign language
 markets and other items of local interest. In addition, we are dedicated
 to establishing a better trained and focused sales
 staff. 

N2 
 process implementation . We
 are aggressively pursuing innovation as the key to meeting the
 changing
 needs of consumers and customers in all of our markets. As one
 of our most
 important 2007 initiatives, we have embraced N2-The
 Newspaper Next 
 approach developed by the American Press Institute and industry
 collaborators nationwide. Developing the industry's most aggressive
 corporate implementation program that we know of, we have committed
 to
 driving the N2 process out to every level of our company in 2007
 and
 ramping up the development of new media models across all of our
 markets
 in the years to come.

Enhancing
 our Web sites to complement our daily newspapers. 
 To
 further support our readership and revenue growth initiatives, we
 have
 made a substantial commitment to enhancing our local Web sites that
 complement all of our daily newspapers. We intend to move beyond
 the
 "online newspaper" model to become the center of online community,
 featuring powerful new search tools, user-driven content and an integrated
 view of a local commercial marketplace. The Web site and the newspaper
 play complementary, non-competing roles in the process of informing
 and
 facilitating community and the Web site features profiling and
 social networking tools designed to engage a younger, more active
 audience, implementing user registration across our newspaper
 websites. 

Centralizing
 operations to support multiple publications. We
 create synergies and cost savings, including through cross-selling
 of
 advertising, centralizing newsgathering and consolidating printing,
 production and back-office activities. This consolidation involves
 producing our weekly newspapers, free distribution shoppers and
 additional
 niche or regional publications using the facilities of our daily
 newspapers. We can thereby improve distribution, introduce new
 products
 and services in a cost-effective manner and increase readership,
 offering
 advertisers expanded reach both geographically and
 demographically. 

Investing
 in strategic technologies. In
 conjunction with the Shared Services Center initiative, we will
 utilize
 technology to help streamline our back-office operations, improve
 efficiency and reduce employee headcount. Additionally, we continue
 to
 explore technologies that will enable us to more efficiently print,
 produce and deliver our newspapers. 

We
 have purchased a new printing press for our Savannah plant, which
 will
 produce higher quality color, improve printing efficiency and
 give us more
 printing flexibility. The press is scheduled to be in production
 by the
 fall of 2007. This
 press will be used to print most of our Savannah
 Morning News 
 products, Bluffton
 Today ,
 and enable us to meet and exceed the printing needs of our commercial
 print customers. 

Focusing
 on cost control. We
 now have all our newspapers live on SAP Financials, the entire company
 on
 a Web-based timekeeping system, one HR/Payroll system, and two newspapers
 on the SAP Media system, both circulation and advertising, and 
 The Augusta
 Chronicle 
 and Skirt! 
 magazines on the SAP advertising system. 

We
 have implemented a centralized call center for subscriber complaints
 and
 are taking calls for Augusta, Savannah, Topeka, Juneau, St. Augustine,
 Bluffton and Athens and as we implement the media platform, we will
 continue to add newspapers to our centralized call center.

We
 currently have all of our daily newspapers on a retention-calling
 program. 

Our
 centralized purchasing group has put into place companywide purchasing
 programs that allow our various businesses to purchase goods and
 services
 at reduced rates. Quite simply our move to shared services is paying
 off
 with lower costs of operations, both labor and materials, and our
 platform
 is providing us better information than ever that we use to more
 effectively manage our
 business. 

Some 2006
 initiatives include: 

Creation
 of a next-generation Web product at the Savannah
 Morning News 
 that engages new users in new ways. This next -generation
 Web site was built on what we have learned from the community driven
 BlufftonToday.com . 

Integration
 of Morris online/newsroom
 operations. 

Implementation
 of a Companywide database-driven information publishing and blogging
 platform. 

Implementation
 of a Feed Management System, with potential for marketplace
 sales. 

Creation
 of 
 Spotted ,
 the hottest new photo and video blogging tool on the
 market. 

Implementation
 of the ABC Sales Model at all the newspapers, leading to increased
 revenues. 

Implementation
 of an email marketing solution to sell print newspaper
 subscriptions. 

Entered
 into licensing agreement with Netlook, Inc. for Car
 Paper 
 and Career
 Paper 
 which allows the Florida
 Times-Union 
 to
 publish the two free distribution publications and include content
 on its
 Web site, Jacksonville.com .

Some
 2007 technology initiatives
 include: 

Joining
 a recently formed newspaper consortium partnering with Yahoo!,
 Inc. 
 that will allow Morris newspapers to reach a global community of
 Yahoo! 
 Online users. 

Creation
 of a 
 next-next 
 generation Web site platform capable of
 self-generation . 

Creation
 of an Ad Pay self-service classified platform, integrating web-to-print
 sales and producing higher ad order entry
 revenues. 

Use
 of video in the classified categories and as part of the newsgathering
 process. 

Implementation
 of a Before-and-After Spotted 
 Program to support new service-category revenue
 streams. 

Newspaper s
 Web sites to solicit new national ad
 sales. 

Creation
 of a digital design studio to assist our Web sites in design
 processes. 

Creation
 and/or implementation of wireless and push
 technologies. 

Implementation
 of a new search platform capable of competing with Google -quality
 search. 

Our
 operating strategy may not successfully increase revenues and cash flows,
 based
 upon a number of factors. For example, a decline in economic conditions,
 the
 effects of competition from newspapers or other forms of advertising, or
 a
 decrease in the price of local or national advertising could adversely affect
 our advertising revenues. Our circulation may be adversely affected by
 competition from other publications and other forms of media and a declining
 number of regular newspaper buyers. A decline in circulation could adversely
 affect both our circulation revenue and our advertising revenue, because
 advertising rates are dependent upon readership. Further, our efforts to
 control
 costs, especially newsprint costs, and to create operating synergies may
 not be
 as successful as we anticipate. 

Strategic
 acquisitions 

We
 may,
 from time to time, seek strategic or targeted investments, including newspaper
 acquisitions and dispositions and, in that regard, we periodically review
 newspaper and other acquisition candidates that we believe are underperforming
 in terms of operating cash flows, are in the same geographic region as one
 of
 our existing newspapers where we can achieve an efficient operating cluster
 of
 newspapers, or otherwise present us with strategic opportunities for growth.
 Acquisitions would be made in circumstances in which management believes
 that
 such acquisitions would contribute to our overall growth strategy, whether
 through revenue growth or cost reduction opportunities, and represent attractive
 values based on price. In addition, we may, in connection with such
 acquisitions, or otherwise, dispose of or realign our newspapers. This could
 be
 accomplished by dispositions, swaps, the exchange of one newspaper for another
 newspaper, or arrangements in which we and others may contribute newspaper
 properties to be owned and operated through a joint venture. We may not control
 such joint ventures and any contribution of assets to a joint venture may
 reduce
 our ability to access cash from those assets contributed to the joint venture.
 Morris Publishing currently has no commitments with respect to any material
 acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures.

The
 following daily newspapers are in our six largest markets, which together
 account for approximately 67 of our average daily circulation: 

Jacksonville. The
 Florida Times-Union, which
 we
 have operated since 1983, is our largest newspaper and serves the Jacksonville,
 Fla., designated market area of approximately 479,000 households with a
 population of approximately 1.3 million. Moreover, an estimated 38 of
 north
 Floridians in this market read The
 Florida Times-Union daily,
 55 read The
 Florida Times-Union on
 Sunday
 and 67 read The
 Florida Times-Union at
 least
 once in seven days. In this market, we publish various niche publications
 such
 as Discover
 Jacksonville, a
 newcomer s guide; Water s
 Edge, a
 lifestyle publication for affluent readers; and the St.
 Johns Sun ,
 a
 community newspaper created to serve the area of North St. Johns County.
 We also
 publish three contract military publications, two of which have been awarded
 the
 highest Navy awards for excellence. 

In
 July
 2006, the Company entered into two license agreements for Car
 Paper 
 and
 Career
 Paper 
 which
 allows us to publish the two free distribution publications and include
 their
 content on our Jacksonville-based newspaper Web site, Jacksonville.com. 

Augusta. The
 Augusta Chronicle, which
 we
 have operated since the early 1940s, is our second largest newspaper and
 serves
 the Augusta, Ga., community of approximately 190,000 households with a
 population of approximately 517,000. We expect continued growth in Augusta,
 through a city magazine, and a variety of targeted niche publications,
 as well
 as in the surrounding communities, through the purchase in 2006 of The
 People-Sentinel (Barnwell,
 S.C.), The
 Hampton County 
 (S.C.)
 Guardian ,
 The
 Citizen News (Edgefield,
 S.C.) and the Sylvania 
 (Ga.) 
 Telephone 
 weekly
 newspapers. We also own and publish The
 News and Farmer, a
 weekly
 newspaper serving Louisville, Ga., and The
 McDuffie Mirror, a
 weekly
 publication serving Thomson, Ga. Additional publications include a women s
 magazine and a family magazine. During the first quarter 2007, we began
 publishing a free weekly community newspaper, the North
 Augusta Today 
 (S.C.),
 along with starting up NorthAugustaToday.com ,
 an
 online daily companion to the printed newspaper. 

Topeka. The
 Topeka Capital-Journal, which
 we
 have operated since 1995, serves the Topeka, Kan., community of approximately
 96,000 households with a population of approximately 229,000. Through marketing
 partnerships with other Morris Communications subsidiaries, and through
 the
 development of more products such as Rock
 Kansas, At Home, and CJExtra, The Topeka Capital-Journal continues
 to be the primary news and advertising source in this market. 

The
 Topeka Capital-Journal also
 publishes a wide variety of books aimed at serving the community and its
 visitors, including a pictorial history of Topeka as well as several
 publications devoted to the University of Kansas sports teams. CJ
 Online ,
 our
 online counterpart to The
 Topeka Capital-Journal, averages
 over 7.1 million page views per month and has generated over 2.9 million
 in
 advertising revenues annually. CJ Online has
 won
 several prestigious awards, including being named the best newspaper Internet
 site by the Newspaper Association of America and Editor
 Publisher magazine. 

Savannah.
 The
 Savannah
 Morning News ,
 which
 we have operated since the 1960s, serves the Savannah, Ga., community of
 approximately 115,000 households with a population total of approximately
 312,000. During
 2004 the newspaper relocated to its new facilities near Savannah leased
 from a
 related third party. The 245,000-square-foot facility, which includes a
 145,000-square-foot production facility, has enhanced newspaper and commercial
 printing capabilities along with substantial improvements in its packaging
 and
 distribution capabilities. A new printing press that will produce higher
 quality
 color, improve printing efficiency and give us more printing flexibility
 will be
 in production by the fall of 2007. 

Lubbock. The
 Lubbock
 Avalanche-Journal, which
 we
 have operated since 1972, serves the Lubbock, Texas, community of approximately
 99,000 households with a total population of approximately 262,000. Lubbock
 Online ,
 our
 online counterpart to The
 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, averages
 over 5.4 million page views per month and has generated over 3.0 million
 in
 advertising revenue annually. 

Amarillo. The 
 Amarillo Globe-News, which
 we
 have operated since 1972, serves the Amarillo, Texas, community of approximately
 84,000 households with a population of approximately 241,000.

Morris
 Publishing management expense 

Morris
 Communications, our parent, provides management and related services to us,
 as
 well as its other operating subsidiaries. Currently, a significant portion
 of
 Morris Communications time is devoted to our affairs. 

Morris
 Communications provides senior executive management services and personnel
 (including the services of Mr. Morris III, Mr. Morris IV, Craig S. Mitchell
 and
 Steve K. Stone), as well as general and administrative services such as legal,
 accounting, finance and treasury, tax, merger and acquisition, risk management,
 human resources/personnel, employee benefits, travel and aircraft usage,
 corporate communications, real estate, online services, architectural and
 engineering, and external and internal audit functions, purchasing and
 participation in the Shared Services Center operated by MStar
 Solutions. 

As
 compensation for these services, Morris Communications is entitled to receive
 annual management fees (payable monthly) equal to the greater of 4.0 of
 our
 annual total operating revenues or the amount of actual expenses allocable
 to
 the management of our business (such allocations to be based upon time and
 resources spent on the management of our business by Morris
 Communications). 

In
 addition, as part of the initiatives to develop the Shared Services Center
 and
 technological platform, we currently pay the lesser of our allocable share
 (based upon usage) of the actual costs of operations of MStar Solutions or
 2.5 
 of Morris Publishing s total annual net operating revenues. Prior to the
 amendment to the services contract in 2005, Morris Publishing had expensed
 its
 allocable share (based upon usage) of the actual costs of operations of MStar
 Solutions. 

The
 amended services agreement will terminate in 2013 on the due date of the
 senior subordinated bonds. Morris Communications may terminate the agreement
 if
 Morris Publishing fails to pay the fees or experiences a change in control.
 We
 may terminate the agreement if Morris Communications fails to cure a material
 breach, performs dishonestly, files bankruptcy, or in certain other
 events. 

Employee-relations 

Morris
 Publishing employs approximately 3,348 full-time and 834 part-time employees,
 none of whom is covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
 our
 relations with our employees are generally good. 

Seasonality 

Newspaper
 companies tend to follow a distinct and recurring seasonal pattern. The first
 quarter of the year tends to be the weakest quarter because advertising volume
 is then at its lowest level. Correspondingly, the fourth quarter tends to
 be the
 strongest quarter as it includes holiday season advertising. 

Competition 

While
 most of our daily newspapers are the only daily newspapers published in their
 respective communities, they do compete within their own geographic areas
 with
 other weekly newspapers in their own or adjacent communities, other daily
 newspapers published in adjacent or nearby cities and towns, as well as regional
 and national newspapers. Competition for advertising and paid circulation
 comes
 from local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, radio and television
 broadcasters, cable television (national and local), direct mail, electronic
 media, including the Internet, and other forms of communication and advertising
 media that operate in our markets. Competition for advertising revenue (the
 aggregate amount of which is largely driven by national and regional general
 economic conditions) is largely based upon advertiser results, readership,
 advertising rates, demographics and circulation levels, while competition
 for
 circulation and readership is based largely upon the content of the newspaper,
 its price and the effectiveness of its distribution. Our nondaily publications,
 including shoppers, compete primarily with direct mail advertising, shared
 mail
 packages and other private advertising delivery services. 

Regulatory
 matters 

FCC
 ownership rules 

Morris
 Communications, our parent, owns other subsidiaries which in turn own radio
 broadcast stations that are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
 Commission FCC or Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, as
 amended (the Communications Act ). The ownership by such entities of radio
 broadcast stations may limit our opportunity to acquire additional newspapers
 in
 certain geographic locations. 

FCC
 rules
 include restrictions on the common ownership or control of interests in radio
 stations and certain other media interests in the same market. Among other
 restrictions, the rules limit the number of radio stations a single operator
 may
 own, certain combinations of television and radio stations, and combinations
 of
 daily newspapers and radio or television stations in the same
 market.

In
 September 2003, the FCC released a decision relaxing many of its ownership
 restrictions. However, in June 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for
 the
 Third Circuit rejected many of the Commission s 2003 rule changes. The Court
 remanded the rules to the Commission for further proceedings and extended
 a stay
 on the implementation of the new ownership rules that the agency had adopted
 in
 September 2003. As a result, the ownership restrictions in place prior to
 the
 FCC s 2003 decision generally continue to govern media transactions, pending
 completion of the remand proceedings and/or possible legislative intervention.
 However, the Third Circuit subsequently allowed certain of the Commission s 2003
 changes concerning local radio ownership to go into effect. 

In
 July
 2006, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the Further
 Notice ), to solicit comment on the issues remanded by the Third Circuit and to
 fulfill the Commission s obligation to review its media ownership rules every
 four years. Extensive comments have been filed, and the proceeding remains
 pending before the FCC. 

The
 discussion below reviews the changes relevant to us contemplated in the FCC s
 2003 decision, the Third Circuit s response to those FCC s rule revisions, and
 the issues set forth in the Further Notice. 

Local
 Radio Ownership Limit 

The
 FCC
 limits the number of radio stations that a single entity may own in a single
 market. The revised local radio ownership rule adopted by the FCC in its
 2003
 decision retained the pre-existing numerical limits on local radio ownership,
 but modified the methodology for defining a radio market. Specifically, the
 Commission opted in its 2003 decision to replace its signal contour method
 of
 defining local radio markets with a geographic approach based upon Arbitron
 market designations. In response to a rehearing petition filed by the agency,
 the Third Circuit agreed to lift its stay with respect to this aspect of
 the
 FCC s revised ownership rules. Accordingly, the Arbitron methodology is
 currently in effect. In addition, the FCC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding
 seeking comment on how to define radio markets not ranked by Arbitron. It
 does
 not appear that implementation of the new radio market definitions will require
 divestiture of any of Morris Communications stations, but those definitions
 could affect Morris Communications ability to modify the facilities of or sell
 such stations in the future. 

In
 addition, the agency determined to make radio station joint sales agreements
 JSAs attributable under the local ownership rule if the brokering party
 sells more than 15 percent of the brokered station s advertising time per week
 and owns or has an attributable interest in another broadcast station in
 the
 local market. The Third Circuit also agreed to lift its stay with respect
 to
 this aspect of the revised rules. Existing JSAs that result in attribution
 and
 cause the brokering station to exceed the ownership limits were grandfathered
 until September 2006; however, as discussed below, Morris was granted an
 extension of this deadline to permit continuation of a JSA in Amarillo, Texas
 that would have otherwise caused Morris to exceed the limits. 

Cross-Media
 Limits 

The
 newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule generally prohibits one entity from
 owning both a commercial broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same
 community. The radio/television cross-ownership rule allows a party to own
 one
 or two TV stations and a varying number of radio stations within a single
 market. The cross-media limits adopted by the FCC in 2003 would have supplanted
 both rules with three categories of restrictions based on the number of
 full-power television stations in the market. The Third Circuit remanded
 the new
 cross-media limits to the Commission for further consideration, leaving the
 previous restrictions in place. The Further Notice seeks comment on a number
 of
 issues relating to cross-media ownership, including whether, and if so, how,
 the
 Commission should attempt to measure diversity in local markets and what,
 if
 any, limitations the FCC should maintain. 

A
 Morris
 Communications subsidiary currently hold licenses for radio stations pursuant
 to
 waivers of the newspaper/broadcast ban in several of Morris Publishing s
 newspaper markets. In Topeka, Kansas, the FCC has granted Morris a waiver
 of the
 cross-ownership restriction that permits Morris Publishing to publish
 Topeka
 Capital-Journal 
 while an
 affiliate serves as the licensee of WIBW(AM) and WIBW-FM, both of which are
 licensed to Topeka, pending the final outcome of the agency s remand proceeding
 and any related judicial review. A similar waiver allows Morris Publishing
 to
 publish the Amarillo
 (Texas) Globe-News 
 while an
 affiliate serves as licensee of KGNC (AM) and KGNC-FM, both licensed to
 Amarillo. 

A
 subsidiary of Morris Communications currently has a Joint Sales Agreement
 JSA with KXGL (FM), also licensed to Amarillo, pursuant to which it sells
 more than 15 percent of KXGL s weekly advertising time. Such radio JSA
 arrangements became attributable for certain purposes under the FCC s ownership
 rules on September 3, 2006. On September 1, 2006, however, the Commission
 issued
 a decision stating that Morris need not terminate the KXGL (FM) JSA until
 six
 months after completion of the ownership proceedings on remand. 

In
 addition, a subsidiary of Morris Communications received a 12-month waiver
 to
 hold a radio broadcast license for a station it acquired in January 2004
 with a
 service contour that includes Newton, Kansas, which is also one of our newspaper
 markets. That waiver expired on January 30, 2005. Prior to that date, however,
 Morris filed a request with the agency to make the waiver permanent or,
 alternatively, to either extend it pending the final outcome of the FCC s 2003
 media ownership proceeding or to extend it for an additional 12 months. That
 request remains pending.

If
 the
 revised media ownership rule changes adopted by the Commission in 2003 are
 modified through the agency s remand proceeding, further judicial review, or
 congressional action, Morris Communications and Morris Publishing may be
 required to divest either their radio stations or their newspaper interests
 in
 one or more of these markets. Further, FCC cross-ownership rules may have
 the
 effect of preventing Morris Communications from pursuing or consummating
 a
 newspaper acquisition that our management would have otherwise pursued in
 markets in which Morris Communications owns radio stations. 

The
 foregoing does not purport to be a complete summary of the Communications
 Act,
 other applicable statutes or the FCC s rules, regulations or policies. The U.S.
 Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future
 adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters
 that could, directly or indirectly, materially adversely affect the operation
 and ownership of Morris Publishing. More generally, Congress and federal
 regulatory agencies consider proposals for additional or revised regulations
 and
 requirements from time to time. We cannot predict the effect of existing
 and
 proposed federal legislation, regulations or policies on our business or
 operations. Also, several of the foregoing matters are now, or may become,
 the
 subject of litigation, and wecannot predict the outcome of any such litigation
 or the effect on our business. 

Environmental
 matters 

Our
 newspapers use inks, photographic chemicals, solvents and fuels. The use,
 management and disposal of these substances and our operations in general
 are
 regulated by federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and
 regulations including those regarding the discharge, emission, storage,
 treatment, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well
 as
 remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws and regulations
 impose significant capital and operating costs on our business and there
 are
 significant penalties for violations. 

Certain
 environmental laws hold current owners or operators of land or businesses
 liable
 for their own and for previous owners or operators releases of hazardous or
 toxic substances. Because of our operations, the long history of industrial
 operations at some of our facilities, the operations of predecessor owners
 or
 operators of certain of our businesses, and the use, production and release
 of
 regulated materials at these sites and at surrounding sites, we may be subject
 to liability under these environmental laws. Many of our facilities have
 never
 been subjected to Phase I environmental audits or assessments. Various
 facilities of ours have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in
 the
 past and are, or may become, subject to further regulatory inspections, future
 requests for investigation or liability for past practices. 

The
 federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act
 of 1980 as amended CERCLA and similar state counterpart acts, provide for
 strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, for
 among
 other things, generators of hazardous substances disposed of at contaminated
 sites. We have received requests for information or notifications of potential
 liability from the United States Environmental Protection Agency under CERCLA
 and states under counterpart acts for a few off-site locations. We have not
 incurred any significant costs relating to these matters and we have no
 information to suggest that we will incur material costs in the future in
 responding to conditions at these sites. 

The
 nature of our operations exposes us to certain risks of liabilities and claims
 with respect to environmental matters. We believe our operations are currently
 in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 In
 many jurisdictions, environmental requirements may be expected to become
 more
 stringent in the future, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain
 necessary authorizations and approvals or result in increased environmental
 compliance costs. 

We
 do not
 believe that environmental compliance requirements are likely to have a material
 effect on us in the near future. We cannot predict what additional environmental
 legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing
 or
 future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or the amount
 of
 future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with these laws.
 There can be no assurance that future environmental compliance obligations
 or
 discovery of new conditions will not arise in connection with our operations
 or
 facilities and that these would not have a material adverse effect on our
 business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Morris
 Publishing Finance Co. 

Morris
 Publishing Finance Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morris Publishing Group,
 LLC, was incorporated in 2003 for the sole purpose of serving as a co-issuer
 of
 our senior subordinated notes in order to facilitate the offering. Morris
 Publishing Finance Co. does not have any operations or assets of any kind
 and
 will not have any revenues.

Item
 1A Risk Factors 

 The
 risks relating to our business and our industry, which could cause our operating
 results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected, are
 described below : 

A
 decline in advertising revenue, our largest source of revenue, would adversely
 affect us. 

A
 primary
 source of our revenue is advertising. For 2006 and 2005, advertising revenues,
 which include retail, national and classified advertising revenues, constituted
 approximately 81.9 and 81.3 , respectively, of our total operating revenues.
 A
 reduction in demand for advertising could result from: 

a
 general decline in economic conditions; 

a
 decline in economic conditions in particular markets where we conduct
 business, and in particular the Jacksonville, Florida market where
 we
 derived approximately 31.8 of our revenues for the year ending
 December
 31, 2006; 

a
 decline in the circulation of our
 newspapers; 

a
 decline in the popularity of our editorial
 content; 

a
 change in the demographic makeup of the population where our newspapers
 are sold; 

a
 decrease in the price of local and national
 advertising; 

the
 activities of our competitors, including increased competition
 from other
 forms of advertising-based mediums, including local, regional and
 national
 newspapers, shoppers, radio and television broadcasters, cable
 television
 (national and local), direct mail and electronic media (including
 the
 internet); and 

a
 decline in the amount spent on advertising in
 general. 

Our
 revenues are cyclical and may decrease due to an economic
 downturn. 

Newspaper
 companies tend to follow a distinct and recurring seasonal pattern. The
 first
 quarter of the year tends to be the weakest quarter because advertising
 volume
 is then at its lowest level. The fourth quarter tends to be the strongest
 quarter as it includes holiday season advertising. As a result, our consolidated
 results may not be comparable from quarter to quarter. 

Our
 advertising revenues, as well as those of the newspaper industry in general,
 may
 be cyclical and dependent upon general economic conditions. We cannot assure
 you
 that the demand for our services will continue at current levels. Historically,
 advertising revenues have increased with the beginning of an economic recovery,
 principally with increases in classified advertising for employment, real
 estate
 and automobiles. Decreases in advertising revenues have historically
 corresponded with general economic downturns and regional and local recessionary
 conditions. While we believe that the geographic diversity of our operations
 mitigates, to some degree, the effects of regional and local economic downturns,
 a decline in the national economy generally may adversely affect our operating
 results. 

A
 decline in circulation revenue would adversely affect us. 

We
 also
 rely on circulation revenue, which is affected by, among other things,
 competition and consumer trends, including declining consumer spending on
 newspapers. Circulation is a significant source of our revenue. Circulation
 revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for our print products
 are
 affected by: 

competition
 from other publications and other forms of media available in our
 various
 markets, i ncluding
 network, cable and satellite television, the internet and
 radio; 

declining
 consumer spending on discretionary items like
 newspapers; 

competing
 uses of free time; and 

declining
 number of regular newspaper buyers.

Fluctuations
 in newsprint costs, or increases in labor or health care costs could adversely
 affect our financial results. 

Newsprint,
 ink and supplements are the major components of our cost of raw materials.
 Newsprint, ink and supplements were 12.6 , 12.0 , and 11.8 of our total
 operating revenues in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Historically
 newsprint
 prices have fluctuated substantially. Accordingly, our earnings are sensitive
 to
 changes in newsprint prices. We have no long-term supply contracts and
 we have
 not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint
 or
 enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint.
 If
 the price of newsprint increases materially, our operating results could
 be
 adversely affected. In addition, substantial increases in labor or health
 care
 costs could also affect our operating results. 

Competition
 could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Revenue
 generation in the newspaper industry is dependent primarily upon the sale
 of
 advertising and paid circulation. Competition and pricing are largely based
 on
 readership, market penetration, quality and servicing the specialized needs
 of
 advertisers and readers. Currently, our daily newspapers generally do not
 directly compete in their respective communities with other daily newspapers
 covering local news. Competition for advertising and circulation, however,
 also
 comes from regional and national newspapers, radio and television broadcast,
 cable television (national and local), non-daily newspapers, direct mail,
 electronic media (including the internet) and other communications and
 advertising media that operate in our markets. Certain of our competitors
 are
 larger and have greater financial resources than we have. The extent and
 nature
 of such competition is, in large part, determined by the location and
 demographics of the market and the number of media alternatives in those
 markets. For more information on our competition and factors that could affect
 our competitive position, see Business Competition. 

We
 must constantly expand and develop new publications and services to compete
 for
 advertising dollars against competitors who may target the specific needs
 of
 advertisers. 

In
 recent
 years, newspapers have faced competition for advertising dollars from publishers
 of specialized publications targeted to specific groups of readers. To meet
 this
 competition, our future success depends in part on our ability to continue
 offering new publications and services that successfully gain market acceptance
 by addressing the needs of specific audience groups within our target markets.
 The process of internally researching, developing, launching, gaining acceptance
 and establishing profitability for a new publication or service, is inherently
 risky and costly. We cannot assure you that our efforts to introduce
 new
 publications or services will be successful. 

We
 are subject to legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, could
 adversely affect our financial results. 

We
 are
 subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
 We do not expect that the outcome of any pending legal proceedings will have
 a
 material adverse impact upon our business. However, the damages that may
 be
 claimed in these legal proceedings could be substantial, including claims
 for
 punitive or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of
 these
 legal proceedings are not favorable to us, it could adversely affect our
 future
 financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition
 or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage
 proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities
 for which we are self-insured. 

The
 interests of our parent, Morris Communications, and its ultimate owners,
 the
 Morris family, may be different than holders of our senior subordinated notes,
 and they may take actions that may be viewed as adversely affecting our business
 or the notes. 

Morris
 Communications, its ultimate parent company, Shivers Trading Operating
 Company, and the Morris family have interests in other businesses that may
 have
 conflicting business interests. Other subsidiaries of Morris Communications
 operate businesses that also derive revenue from advertising, including
 broadcast radio stations, outdoor advertising, magazines, book publishing
 and
 specialized publications. These other subsidiaries may compete with us for
 advertising revenues. Because the Morris family s interests as an equity holder
 may conflict with the interests of holders of the notes, Morris Communications
 may cause us to take actions that, in their judgment, could enhance their
 equity
 investment, even though such actions might involve risks to you as a holder
 of
 the notes. 

There
 can be no assurance that Morris Communications or the Morris family will
 exercise control in our best interests as opposed to their own best
 interests. 

The
 Morris family, including William S. Morris III, our chairman, and his son,
 William S. Morris IV, our president and chief executive officer, beneficially
 own all of the equity interests in Morris Communications, our parent company,
 through their ownership of the stock of Shivers Trading Operating Company.
 By virtue of such equity ownership, the Morris family has the sole power
 to: 

elect
 the entire board of directors of Shivers Trading Operating Company,
 Morris Communications and each of their subsidiaries, including
 us; 

control
 all of our management and policies, including as to the making
 of payments
 to Morris family members or other affiliates, whether by way of
 dividend,
 stock repurchase, compensation or otherwise or the entering into
 other
 transactions with Morris Communications, its subsidiaries or other
 affiliates, or other transactions that could result in a change
 of control
 of Morris Communications or Morris Publishing;
 and

Table
 of Contents 

determine
 the outcome of any corporate matter or transaction, including mergers,
 joint ventures, consolidations and asset sales, equity issuances
 or debt
 incurrences. 

We
 have no independent directors and no independent audit committee to review
 the
 actions of management or the Morris family. 

Currently
 five of the six directors on the boards of directors of Shivers Trading 
Operating Company, Morris Communications and each of their subsidiaries
 (including our board) are members of the Morris family
 and the sixth is Craig S. Mitchell who is also the Senior Vice President
 -
 Finance, Secretary and Treasurer of Shivers Trading Operating Company,
 Morris Communications and each of their subsidiaries. Mr. Mitchell serves
 at the
 pleasure of the Morris family. None of these boards has an audit committee
 with
 independent directors and will not necessarily have as a member a financial
 expert as defined under the rules of the Commission as a result of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We have been advised that the Morris family does
 not
 plan to appoint any non-family members to any such boards, other than the
 current single existing non-family member director, or any independent 
directors. No member of any such board of directors has been elected, or
 is
 anticipated to be elected, to represent the interests of the holders of the
 notes. 

In
 addition, as private companies, Shivers Trading Operating Company, Morris
 Communications and its subsidiaries, including Morris Publishing, have not
 been
 required to comply with the corporate governance or other provisions of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any of the corporate governance or other rules and
 regulations of any stock exchange or national stock quotation system. Morris
 Publishing has been subject to certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
 but
 those provisions do not require Morris Publishing to have independent directors
 or an audit committee. 

We
 depend upon the Morris family for management, leadership and general
 policy-making. 

The
 unavailability for any reason of the managerial services presently provided
 by
 the Morris family (particularly our chairman William S. Morris III and our
 chief
 executive officer William S. Morris IV) to Morris
 Publishing, could be disruptive to our business for some period of time.
 While
 we have been advised that the Morris family has no intention to engage in
 a
 transaction that would lead to a change of control of Shivers Trading 
Operating Company, Morris Communications or Morris Publishing, no assurances
 can
 be given that future events or other circumstances may not arise that would
 lead
 to a possible change of control. 

Various
 entities which are affiliated with Morris Communications and the Morris family
 have engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with us some
 of
 which may be viewed, from the perspective of a holder of the notes, as
 disadvantageous to us or an inappropriate use of our
 resources. 

These
 transactions may not necessarily be consummated on an arm s-length basis and
 therefore may not be as favorable to us as those that could be negotiated
 with
 non-affiliated third parties. See Certain relationships and related
 transactions for a description of such transactions, including the
 following: 

We
 are managed by Morris Communications pursuant to a management agreement
 and also participate in its Shared Services Center operated by
 its
 subsidiary, MStar Solutions, LLC. 

In
 addition to the management services, we may share other facilities
 and
 costs with Morris Communications and its other subsidiaries. Shared
 costs
 may include joint promotions or the use of facilities, equipment,
 supplies
 or employees of one division for the benefit of an affiliate and
 the costs
 will be allocated among the various entities by Morris
 Communications. 

Rental
 arrangements with a company controlled by Morris family members
 for the
 use of our Savannah, Georgia newspaper
 operation. 

In
 the ordinary course of our business, we may sell or purchase goods
 and
 services from our affiliates, such as radio or outdoor advertising
 and
 promotions, space in hotels owned by affiliates, or farm products
 from
 farms owned by affiliates, on terms that we determine to be comparable
 to
 transactions with unrelated third parties. We
 may provide loans to Morris Communications or its subsidiaries.
 Any such
 loans may utilize borrowing capacity under our credit facilities
 that may
 otherwise have been available for our business purposes. It is
 expected
 that the principal external source of liquidity for Morris Communications
 and its other subsidiaries will be loans by or distributions from
 Morris
 Publishing.

We
 are a single member limited liability company that is disregarded
 for
 federal income tax purposes and we are part of the consolidated
 tax return
 of our ultimate parent corporation and its subsidiaries. We participate
 in
 a tax sharing agreement with our affiliates whereby we are required
 to pay
 to Morris Communications an amount equal to the taxes we would
 have been
 required to pay as if we were a separate taxable corporation. We
 may
 become jointly and severally liable for all income tax liability
 of the
 group in the event other subsidiaries are unable to pay the taxes
 attributable to their operations.

Because
 of the FCC s cross-ownership limitations and Morris Communications ownership of
 radio stations, we may not be able to make acquisitions that would be favorable,
 or we may be required to dispose of existing
 newspapers. 

Rules
 of
 the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, limit the cross-ownership
 of a
 broadcast radio station and a newspaper in the same market. Morris
 Communications owns other subsidiaries which own radio broadcast licenses
 that
 are subject to regulation by the FCC. These subsidiaries currently hold,
 under
 waivers granted by the FCC, radio broadcast licenses in two of Morris
 Publishing s newspaper markets: Amarillo, Texas and Topeka, Kansas. A Morris
 subsidiary is party to a radio Joint Sales Agreement JSA in Amarillo as
 well. A subsidiary of Morris Communications also received a 12 month waiver
 (which has expired and for which a request for extension is pending) to hold
 a
 radio broadcast license for a station it acquired with a service contour
 that
 includes Newton, Kansas - another Morris newspaper market. In 2003, the FCC
 adopted ownership rules that would permit cross-ownership of a broadcast
 radio
 station and a newspaper in the same market in many instances, but these rules
 were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which
 remanded the rules to the FCC and stayed the rules effective date. In July
 2006, the FCC issued a Further
 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
 (the
 Further Notice ), to solicit comment on the issues remanded by the Third
 Circuit and to fulfill the Commission s obligation to review its media ownership
 rules every four years. When new ownership rules become effective upon
 completion of the remand proceedings, Morris may be able to hold the radio
 broadcast licenses discussed above without waivers. If, however, the Commission
 or Congress decides to enact more restrictive multiple or cross ownership
 rules
 and to require divestiture of noncompliant combinations, Morris Communications
 and Morris Publishing might need to divest either their radio broadcast station
 holdings or their newspaper interests in these markets. Further, FCC
 cross-ownership rules may have the effect of preventing us from pursuing
 or
 consummating a newspaper acquisition that our management would have otherwise
 pursued in markets in which Morris Communications owns radio
 stations. 

If
 we fail to implement our business strategy, our business will be adversely
 affected. 

Our
 future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon
 our
 ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure
 you
 that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or be
 able
 to improve our operating results. In particular, we cannot assure you that
 we
 will be able to maintain circulation of our publications, obtain new sources
 of
 advertising revenues, generate additional revenues by building on the brand
 names of our publications or raise the cover prices of our publications without
 causing a decline in circulation. 

Implementation
 of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond
 our
 control, such as increased competition, general economic conditions, legal
 developments or increased operating costs or expenses. In particular, there
 has
 been a recent trend of increased consolidation among major retailers, including
 as a result of bankruptcies of certain retailers. This trend may adversely
 affect our results of operations by reducing the number of advertisers using
 our
 products and increasing the purchasing power of the consolidated retailers,
 thereby leading to a decline in our advertising revenues. Any failure by
 us to
 successfully implement our business strategy may adversely affect our ability
 to
 service our indebtedness, including our ability to make principal and interest
 payments on the notes. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue
 certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. 

Consolidation
 in the markets in which we operate could place us at a competitive
 disadvantage . 

Recently,
 some of the markets in which we operate have experienced significant
 consolidation. In particular, the combinations of traditional media content
 companies and new media distribution companies have resulted in new business
 models and strategies. Should the revised ownership rules adopted by the
 FCC
 withstand court and Congressional challenges, they will increase the potential
 of consolidation for our sector. We cannot predict with certainty the extent
 to
 which these types of business combinations may occur or the impact that they
 may
 have. These combinations could potentially place us at a competitive
 disadvantage with respect to negotiations, sales, resources and our ability
 to
 develop and to take advantage of new media technologies.

We
 may pursue acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify attractive
 acquisition candidates, successfully integrate acquired operations or realize
 the intended benefits of our acquisitions and we may enter into joint
 ventures. 

We
 may
 pursue growth in part through the acquisition of additional newspapers or
 certain other businesses and assets and we may enter into joint ventures.
 This
 strategy is subject to numerous risks, including: 

an
 inability to obtain sufficient financing to complete our
 acquisitions; 

increases
 in purchase prices for newspaper assets due to increased competition
 for
 acquisition opportunities; 

an
 inability to negotiate definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory
 terms; 

difficulty
 in obtaining regulatory approval; 

difficulty
 in integrating the operations, systems and management of acquired
 assets
 and absorbing the increased demands on our administrative, operational
 and
 financial resources; 

the
 diversion of our management s attention from their other
 responsibilities; 

the
 loss of key employees following completion of our
 acquisitions; 

the
 failure to realize the intended benefits of our
 acquisitions; 

our
 being subject to unknown liabilities;
 and 

participation
 in joint ventures may limit our access to the cash flow of assets
 contributed to the joint venture. 

Our
 inability to effectively address these risks could force us to revise our
 business plan, incur unanticipated expenses or forego additional opportunities
 for expansion. 

We
 are subject to extensive environmental regulations. 

We
 are
 subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations concerning,
 among
 other things, emissions to the air, waste water and storm water discharges,
 handling, storage and disposal of wastes, recycling, remediation of contaminated
 sites, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Environmental
 laws and regulations and their interpretation have changed rapidly in recent
 years and may continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with present
 or
 future requirements could result in material liability to us. Some environmental
 laws impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several,
 liability
 for costs of remediation of soil and groundwater contamination at our facilities
 or those where our wastes have been disposed. Our current and former properties
 may have had historic uses which may require investigation or remedial
 measures.
 We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental
 requirements. However, we cannot guarantee that material costs and/or
 liabilities will not occur in the future including those which may arise
 from
 discovery of currently unknown conditions. 

The
 FTC Do Not Call rule has adversely affected and will continue to affect our
 ability to sell newspaper subscriptions by telephone marketing.

Risks
 relating to the notes are as follows : 

Our
 substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and prevent
 us from
 fulfilling our obligations under the notes. 

We
 have a
 substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, we had 524
 million
 of debt outstanding, consisting of approximately 224 million of senior
 debt and
 300 million of senior subordinated notes. In addition, the indenture governing
 the notes and our new credit facilities allow us to incur substantial additional
 indebtedness in the future. As of December 31, 2006, we had 119.8 million
 available to borrow under the most restrictive covenants of our senior
 credit facilities. Our substantial indebtedness may have important consequences,
 including: 

making
 it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect
 to the
 notes; 

limiting
 cash flow available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures,
 potential acquisitions or other general corporate
 requirements; 

increasing
 our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
 conditions; 

-19- 

Table
 of Contents 

limiting
 our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working
 capital,
 capital expenditures, potential acquisitions or other general corporate
 requirements; 

limiting
 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
 business
 and industry; 

placing
 us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with
 less
 indebtedness; and 

making
 it more difficult for us to comply with financial covenants in
 our credit
 facilities. 

We
 may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service
 obligations . 

Our
 ability to generate cash flow from operations to make principal and interest
 payments on our debt, including
 the notes, will depend on our future performance, which will be affected
 by a
 range of economic,
 competitive and business factors. We cannot control many of these factors,
 including general economic conditions, the reallocation of advertising
 expenditures to other available media and a decline in the amount spent on
 advertising in general. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash
 flow
 from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may need to seek
 additional capital to make these payments or undertake alternative financing
 plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets or reducing
 or delaying capital investments and acquisitions. We cannot assure you that
 such
 additional capital or alternative financing will be available on favorable
 terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
 or obtain additional capital or alternative financing on acceptable terms
 could
 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
 of operations. 

Restrictions
 in our debt agreements reduce our operating flexibility and contain covenants
 and restrictions that create the potential for defaults. 

The
 terms
 of our credit facilities and the indenture relating to the notes restrict,
 among
 other things, our ability
 to: 

incur
 or repay debt; 

dispose
 of assets; 

create
 liens; 

make
 investments; 

enter
 into affiliate transactions; and 

pay
 dividends. 

Under
 our
 credit facilities we are required to maintain specified financial ratios
 and
 levels including: 

a
 minimum interest coverage ratio; 

a
 minimum fixed charges coverage ratio;
 and 

a
 maximum cash flow ratio. 

If
 we
 fail to comply with any of these tests, the lenders have the right to cause
 all
 amounts outstanding under our credit facilities to become immediately due.
 If
 this was to occur, and the lenders decide to exercise their right to accelerate
 the indebtedness, it would create serious financial problems for us and could
 lead to an event of default under the indenture governing the notes. In such
 an
 event, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts
 due on the notes. As a result, you may receive less than the full amount
 you
 would be otherwise entitled to receive on the notes. Any of these events
 could
 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
 of operations. Our ability to comply with these restrictions, and any similar
 restrictions in future agreements, depends on our operating performance.
 Since
 our performance is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business
 conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, we may be unable
 to
 comply with these restrictions in the future.

A
 note holder s right to receive payments on the
 notes is junior to our existing senior indebtedness and the existing senior
 indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantors and possibly all of our and their
 future indebtedness and our credit facility will have the benefit of guarantees
 by Morris Communications and certain of its subsidiaries. 

The
 notes
 and the subsidiary guarantees are subordinated in right of payment to the
 prior
 payment in full of our and the subsidiary guarantors respective current and
 future senior indebtedness, including our and their obligations under our
 credit
 facilities. As of December 31, 2006, the notes were subordinated to
 approximately 224 million of senior indebtedness, not including 119.8
 million
 of senior debt that is available for borrowing under our credit facilities.
 As a
 result of the subordination provisions of the notes, in the event of the
 bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of us or any subsidiary guarantor,
 our
 assets or the assets of the applicable subsidiary guarantor would be available
 to pay obligations under the notes and our other senior subordinated obligations
 only after all payments had been made on our senior indebtedness or the
 senior
 indebtedness of the applicable subsidiary guarantor. Sufficient assets
 may not
 remain after all of these payments have been made to make any payments
 on the
 notes and our other senior subordinated obligations, including payments
 of
 interest when due. In addition, all payments on the notes and the subsidiary
 guarantees are prohibited in the event of a payment default on our senior
 credit
 facilities, and may be prohibited in any future senior
 indebtedness. 

All
 obligations under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by Morris
 Communications and certain of its subsidiaries and such guarantees are
 secured
 with substantially all of their assets. 

The
 notes and the subsidiary guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of
 our
 and our subsidiary guarantors secured indebtedness and all indebtedness of our
 non-guarantor subsidiaries. 

The
 senior subordinated notes are not secured. The lenders under our senior
 credit
 facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of our and our
 subsidiaries assets and by a pledge of the stock of all of the subsidiary
 guarantors. If we, Morris Communications or any of the subsidiary guarantors
 declare bankruptcy, liquidate or dissolve, or if payment under the credit
 facilities or any of our other secured indebtedness is accelerated, our
 secured
 lenders are entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender
 under applicable law and have a claim on those assets before the holders
 of the
 notes. As a result, the notes are effectively subordinated to our and our
 subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
 securing that indebtedness, and the holders of the notes would in all likelihood
 recover ratably less than the lenders of our and our subsidiaries secured
 indebtedness in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution.
 As of
 December 31, 2006, we had 224 million of secured indebtedness outstanding,
 not
 including 119.8 million of additional secured indebtedness that would
 have been
 available for borrowing under the most restrictive covenants of our senior
 credit facilities. 

Some
 of
 our future subsidiaries may not be guarantors on the notes and some of our
 existing subsidiaries may be released from their guarantees upon becoming
 an
 unrestricted subsidiary in the manner provided in the indenture. Payments
 on the
 notes are only required to be made by us and the subsidiary guarantors. As
 a
 result, no payments are required to be made from assets of subsidiaries which
 do
 not guarantee the notes. The notes are structurally subordinated to all of
 the
 liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. In the event
 of
 a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiary,
 holders of its indebtedness, its trade creditors and holders of its preferred
 equity are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of that
 subsidiary before any assets are made available for distribution to us. However,
 under some circumstances, the terms of the notes permit our non-guarantor
 subsidiaries to incur additional specified indebtedness. Currently, we have
 no
 non-guarantor subsidiaries. 

We
 may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of
 control. 

Upon
 the
 occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we are
 required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a price equal to
 101 
 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
 date
 of repurchase. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient
 funds
 at
 the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of notes
 or
 that restrictions in our senior credit facilities would not allow such
 repurchase. 

Federal
 and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the
 guarantees of the notes by our subsidiaries and require the holders of the
 notes
 to return payments received from the subsidiary
 guarantors. 

Under
 the
 federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer
 laws, the subsidiary guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of
 the
 subsidiary guarantees could be subordinated to all other debts of a subsidiary
 guarantor if, either, the subsidiary guarantee was incurred with the intent
 to
 hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors of the subsidiary
 guarantor or the subsidiary guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness
 evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent
 value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and the
 subsidiary guarantor either: 

was
 insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such
 incurrence; 

was
 engaged in a business or transaction for which such subsidiary
 guarantor s
 remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital;
 or 

intended
 to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability
 to pay
 such debts as they mature. 

The
 measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary
 depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a
 fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a subsidiary guarantor
 would be considered insolvent if: 

-21- 

Table
 of Contents 

the
 sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater
 than the
 fair saleable value of all of its
 assets; 

the
 present fair saleable value of its assets were less than the amount
 that
 would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing
 debts,
 including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature;
 or 

it
 could not pay its debts as they become
 due. 

On
 the
 basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other
 factors, we and each subsidiary guarantor believe that no subsidiary guarantor
 will be insolvent, will have unreasonably small capital for the business
 in
 which it is engaged or will have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay
 such
 debts as they mature. There can be no assurance, however, as to what standard
 a
 court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree
 with
 our or the subsidiary guarantors conclusions in this regard. 

An
 active trading market may not develop for the exchange
 notes. 

The
 senior subordinated notes have no established trading market and are not
 being
 listed on any securities exchange. The liquidity of any market for the notes
 depends upon various factors, including: 

the
 number of holders of the notes; 

the
 overall market for high yield
 securities; 

our
 financial performance or prospects;
 and 

the
 prospects for companies in our industry
 generally. 

Accordingly,
 we cannot assure you of a market or liquidity for the notes. Historically,
 the
 market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that
 have
 caused substantial volatility in the prices of
 securities similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market for
 the
 notes, if any, will not be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions
 may adversely affect you as a holder of the notes.

 6 Selected
 Financial Data 

Morris
 Publishing Group, LLC Morris Publishing or the Company was formed in
 November 2001 from the newspaper assets of Morris Communications Company,
 LLC
 Morris Communications or the Parent ). Between its formation and July 2003,
 Morris Publishing operated as MCC Newspapers, LLC. 

These
 consolidated financial statements of Morris Publishing, a wholly owned
 subsidiary of Morris Communications, include the consolidated financial
 statements of Morris Publishing subsequent to July 2003 and the combined
 financial statements of the Morris Communications Company, LLC Newspaper
 Business Segment for all periods prior to July 2003. In November 2001 and
 August
 2003, Morris Communications legally transferred the net assets of its newspaper
 business segment to the Company. As a result, the Company has accounted
 for the
 assets and liabilities at historical cost, in a manner similar to that
 in
 pooling of interest accounting. The assets and operations of the Morris
 Communications newspaper business segment have been presented in the
 accompanying consolidated financial statements as if they were a separate
 stand-alone entity for all periods presented. 

The
 selected historical financial data of Morris Publishing set forth below
 should
 be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including
 the
 notes thereto, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
 and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this annual report. The
 consolidated statement of income and other operating and financial information
 data for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the
 consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are derived
 from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
 this
 report. 

The
 financial information we have included in this report reflects the historical
 results of operations and cash flows of Morris Publishing with allocations
 made
 for corporate and other services provided to us by Morris Communications.
 Operating costs and expenses reflect our direct costs together with certain
 allocations by Morris Communications for corporate services, debt and other
 shared services that have been charged to us based on usage or other
 methodologies we believe are appropriate for such expenses. In the opinion
 of
 management, these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis and
 approximate all the material incremental costs we would have incurred had
 we
 been operating on a stand-alone basis; however, there has been no independent
 study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what
 the
 costs of obtaining such services would have been.

a. 

Prior
 to August 7, 2003, we were charged corporate interest and amortization
 expense based on the corporate debt and related deferred debt
 cost
 allocations of Morris Communications to Morris Publishing. The
 allocated
 portion of Morris Communications debt is presented as long term debt at
 December 31, 2002. Interest expense, including amortization of
 debt
 issuance costs, related to this debt was 14,019 and 25,056
 for the years
 ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

b. 

On
 August 7, 2003, we repaid our intercompany debt due to our parent,
 Morris
 Communications, which in turn repaid its existing senior secured
 credit
 facilities. As a result, we incurred non-cash financing loss
 on
 extinguishment of debt of approximately 5,957 related to the
 write-off of
 the unamortized deferred loan costs. Prior to this repayment,
 our debt due
 to our parent increased by 18,100, which borrowings were used to
 repay other indebtedness of our Parent. As a result, we recorded
 an
 18,100 distribution to our parent. 

c. 

Since
 August 7, 2003, we have been permitted under our various debt
 arrangements
 to loan up to 40 million at any one time to Morris Communications
 or any
 of its wholly owned subsidiaries outside the Publishing Group,
 solely for
 purposes of funding its working capital, capital expenditures
 and
 acquisition requirements. We are also permitted to invest in
 or lend an
 additional 20 million at any one time outstanding to Morris
 Communications or any other Person(s), as defined in the debt
 indenture.
 The interest-bearing portion of all loans from us to Morris Communications
 bears the same rate as the borrowings under our Credit Agreements.
 In
 2005, based on the practice of settling a significant portion
 of the
 outstanding loan receivable balances with dividends, we began
 classifying
 the intercompany loan due from Morris Communications, net of
 the interest
 accrued on the loan, as contra equity in member s deficiency in assets.
 Prior to 2005, we classified the intercompany loan as a current
 asset and
 the interest accrued on the loan as interest income. The interest
 accrued
 on these loans during 2006 and 2005, was 2,095 and 1,484,
 respectively. 

d. 

Earnings
 to fixed charges is defined as income before income taxes plus
 fixed
 charges, divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges are interest
 expense
 including amortization of debt issuance costs, plus one-third
 of rent
 expense. 

e. 

Our
 interest expense would have increased by 4,669 and 6,742, respectively,
 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002,
 assuming we
 had issued our 300 million of 7 Senior Subordinated Notes Due
 2013 at
 the beginning of such period.

g. 

Prior
 to August 7, 2003, our cash was immediately transferred to Morris
 Communications, which used the cash to meet its and our obligations.
 The
 net amounts due from Morris Communications, which have been deemed
 distributions to Morris Communications were approximately 45,695
 for the
 year, ended December 31,
 2003.

Item
 7 Management's
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations 
 The
 following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6-- Selected Financial Data , and with the consolidated
 financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Critical
 accounting policies and estimates 

The
 preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
 and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
 and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
 We
 continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowances
 for
 doubtful accounts, intangible assets, management fees, income taxes and
 post-retirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience
 and on
 various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
 circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

We
 believe the following critical accounting policies are our most significant
 judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
 statements. 

Inventory The
 cost
 of newsprint inventory is determined by the last-in, first-out method. At
 year
 end, the newsprint inventory is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of cost
 or
 market. Newsprint purchases are combined with those of other newspaper companies
 to obtain the best price available. We consider our relationship with newsprint
 producers to be good. We have not entered into any derivative contracts for
 newsprint. 

Accounts
 receivable We
 maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
 from
 the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial
 condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
 of
 their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.
 We
 assess, at least annually, the adequacy of our allowances for losses on accounts
 receivable using a combination of specific identification and the aging of
 accounts receivable. Payment in advance for some advertising and circulation
 revenue and credit background checks has assisted us in maintaining historical
 bad debt losses of less than 1.0 of revenue. 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments We estimated the fair
 values presented below using appropriate valuation methodologies and market
 information available as of year-end. Considerable judgment is required
 to
 develop estimates of fair value, and the estimates presented
 are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a
 current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimation
 methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values.
 Additionally, the fair values were estimated at year-end, and current estimates
 of fair value may differ significantly from
 the amounts
 presented. 

The
 following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
 value of each class of financial instruments: 

Cash
 and equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The
 carrying amount of these items approximates fair
 value. 

Long
 term debt .
 To
 estimate the fair
 value of our debt issues, which are not quoted on an exchange, we used
 those
 interest rates that were currently available to it for issuance of debt
 with similar terms and remaining maturities. At
 December 31, 2006, the fair value of the 300 million principal amount
 of senior
 subordinated notes was approximately 284 million and the
 fair
 value of the Tranche A term loan and revolving credit facility were estimated
 at
 171 million and 47 million, respectively. 

Goodwill
 and other intangibles We
 have
 significant intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet and the inability
 to
 sustain profitable operations in our newspapers could result in a material
 impairment of our intangible assets in the future. 

In
 accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142,
 Goodwill
 and Other Intangible Assets ,
 we are
 required to test goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment on an
 annual basis or when the facts or circumstances at any of the Company s
 reporting units indicate a possible impairment as a result of a continual
 decline in performance or as a result of fundamental changes in a market.
 We
 perform this evaluation on December 31st. 

Goodwill
 is the excess of cost over fair market value of tangible net assets acquired
 and
 is not presently amortized. The estimated value of the reporting unit to
 which
 goodwill is allocated is determined using the greater of the net present
 value
 of future cash flows and the market multiple approach. The carrying value
 of
 goodwill is considered impaired when the estimated value of the reporting
 unit
 is less than its carrying value. 

Other
 intangible assets acquired consist primarily of mastheads and licenses on
 various acquired properties, customer lists, as well as other assets. Other
 intangible assets acquired (mastheads and domain names), which have indefinite
 lives, are not currently amortized, the fair value of the mastheads and domain
 names is determined using an income or market multiple approach. The asset
 is
 considered impaired when the fair value of the intangible asset is less than
 its
 carrying value. 

We
 have
 performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived
 intangible assets as of December 31, 2006, which resulted in no
 impairments. 

Revenue
 recognition 
 Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisements are printed and
 distributed or when the advertisements are placed on our Web sites. Circulation
 revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term.
 Amounts billed for circulation and subscriptions prior to such period are
 recorded as deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated financial
 statements. Other revenue is recognized when the related product or service
 has
 been delivered.

Retiree
 health care benefits We
 have
 significant retiree health care and disability benefit plan costs and
 obligations that are allocated from Morris Communications. Inherent in these
 allocations are key assumptions including projected costs, discount rates
 and
 expected return on plan assets. We are required to consider current market
 conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions.
 Changes in the related retiree health care and health and disability costs
 or
 obligations may occur in the future because of changes resulting from
 fluctuations in our employee headcount and/or changes in the various
 assumptions. 

Income
 taxes We
 are a
 single member limited liability company and are not subject to income taxes.
 However, our results are included in the consolidated federal income tax
 return
 of Morris Communications. Tax provisions are settled through the intercompany
 account and Morris Communications makes income tax payments based on our
 results. We have entered into a formal tax sharing agreement with Morris
 Communications, under which we are required to provide for our portion of
 income taxes. Under the terms of the agreement, we remit taxes for our current
 tax liability to Morris Communications. Accordingly, we recognize an allocation
 of income taxes in our separate financial statements in accordance with the
 agreement. 

We
 account for income taxes under the provisions of the liability method, which
 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future
 tax
 consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
 carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
 bases. The recognition of future tax benefits is required to the extent that
 realization of such benefits is more likely than not. 

Contra
 equity account Prior
 to
 2005, we had reported the loan receivable from Morris Communications (see
 Note
 1 to
 consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006,
 2005,
 and 2004) as a long-term asset on our balance sheets and had reported interest
 income related to the loan receivable in the statement of income. Based on
 the
 historical practice of our settling with Morris Communications a significant
 portion of the outstanding loan receivable balance with dividends, we concluded
 that the arrangement should be considered in substance a capital distribution
 transaction and classified the loan receivable from Morris Communications
 as
 contra equity within member s deficit. In 2005 and 2006, we also have recorded
 the interest income from this loan receivable as contra equity. 

We
 did
 not reclassify this outstanding loan receivable balance from long-term asset
 to
 member s deficit at December 31, 2004 or reclass the previously reported 2004
 loan receivable interest income; as such amounts were considered
 immaterial. 

Impact
 of recently issued accounting standards 

In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers 
 Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
 Plans SFAS
 No. 158 ), an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No.
 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a retiree
 health plan in the statement of financial position, requires that changes
 in the
 funded status be recognized through comprehensive income, changes the
 measurement date for defined benefit plan assets and obligations to the
 entity s
 fiscal year-end and expands disclosures. The recognition and disclosures
 under
 SFAS No. 158 are required as of the end of the fiscal year ending after
 June 15,
 2007, while the new measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending
 after
 December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158 requires that previously disclosed but
 unrecognized gains/losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations
 of a
 retiree health plan be recognized at adoption of SFAS No. 158 as a component
 of
 shareholder s equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
 applicable income taxes. 

The
 measurement date for the Company s retiree health plan obligations is currently
 the Company s fiscal year-end so
 a
 change in measurement date is not needed .
 Had
 SFAS No. 158 been adopted at December 31, 2006, the Company s accumulated other
 comprehensive income would have decreased by 1,016 and decreased member's
 deficit by
 1,016. 

In
 September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
 Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering
 the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
 Current Year Financial Statements SAB
 No. 108 ), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2006. This
 bulletin addresses the diversity in practice in quantifying financial
 misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of
 improper amounts on the balance sheet. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not
 impact the Company at December 31, 2006. 

In
 July
 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation
 No. 48, Accounting
 for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN
 No. 48 ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Under
 FIN No. 48, companies are required to make explicit disclosures about
 uncertainties in their income tax positions, including a detailed roll forward
 of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition.
 Under FIN No. 48, the recognition of a tax benefit would only occur when
 it is
 more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained in a dispute with
 the taxing authority in the court of last resort. The Company is currently
 evaluating the impact upon adoption of Fin No. 48. 

In
 March
 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting
 for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ,
 which
 clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as
 used in
 SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. A conditional
 asset
 retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an
 asset
 retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
 conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of
 the
 entity. Therefore, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the
 fair
 value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under SFAS No. 143 if
 the
 fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 permits,
 but
 does not require, restatement of interim financial information. The provisions
 of FIN 47 were effective for reporting periods ending after December 15,
 2005.

Morris
 Publishing Group, LLC overview 

Morris
 Publishing owns and operates 27 daily newspapers as well as nondaily newspapers,
 city magazines and free community publications in the Southeast, Midwest,
 Southwest and Alaska. 

While
 most of our revenue is generated from advertising and circulation from our
 newspaper operations, we also print and distribute periodical publications
 and
 operate commercial printing operations in conjunction with our newspapers.
 In
 addition, our newspaper operations generate revenues from both print and
 online
 media formats. 

Linage,
 rate and mix of advertisement are the primary components of advertising revenue.
 The advertising rate depends largely on our market reach, primarily through
 circulation, and market penetration. The number of copies sold and the amount
 charged to our customers are the primary components of circulation revenue.
 Our
 other revenue consists primarily of commercial printing and other online
 revenue. 

During
 2006, advertising and circulation revenue represented 81.9 and 14.7 ,
 respectively, of our total net operating revenue. Commercial printing revenue
 made up 2.1 of our total net operating revenue. Our advertising revenue
 consisted of 51.5 in retail, 42.2 in classified and 6.3 in national. Online
 advertising revenue, included in all advertising categories above, represented
 8.3 of our total 2006 advertising revenue. 

From
 time
 to time, each individual newspaper may perform better or worse than our
 newspaper group as a whole due to certain local conditions, particularly
 within
 the retail, auto, housing and labor markets. 

We
 continue to see overall declines in circulation at our newspapers which is
 consistent with the industry as a whole. We continue to focus on circulation
 retention efforts through lengthened subscriptions periods, new payment methods,
 and increased service levels. 

Employee
 and newsprint costs are the primary costs at each newspaper. Our operating
 performance is affected by newsprint prices, which historically have fluctuated.
 Newsprint costs have represented 10 - 15 of total operating
 expenses. Historically,
 newsprint has been subject to significant price fluctuations from year to
 year,
 unrelated in many cases to general economic trends. Supply and demand has
 typically controlled pricing. We believe that current and future sources
 of
 newsprint will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated
 requirements. 

Recent
 events and current initiatives 

We
 view
 the changing media landscape as a great opportunity, with many of our current
 strategic initiatives embracing these changes to continue to move us forward.
 We
 are aggressively pursuing innovation as the key to meeting the changing needs
 of
 our core newspaper consumers and customers in all of our markets. While we
 continue to focus on our core business, we are enhancing and growing our niche
 publications, digital business and other technologies. 

As
 one of our most important 2007 initiatives, we have embraced N2-The
 Newspaper Next N2 
 approach developed by the American Press Institute and other industry
 collaborators nationwide. Developing the industry s most aggressive
 corporate implementation program that we know of, we have committed
 to
 driving the N2 process out to every level of our company in 2007
 and
 ramping up the development of new media models across all our markets
 in
 the years to come. 

Building
 on what we have learned from the community driven Bluffton
 Today.com 
 Web site, we have created a next-generation Web product
 at the
 Savannah Morning News 
 and the North
 Augusta Today 
 that engages users in new ways. The intent of these Web sites is
 to move
 beyond the online newspaper model to become the center of the online
 community, featuring powerful new search tools, user-driven content
 and an
 integrated view of a local commercial marketplace. 

The
 Savannah and North Augusta Web sites and the respective newspapers
 play
 complementary, non-competing roles in the process of informing and
 facilitating community and the Web site features profiling and social
 networking tools designed to engage a younger, more active audience
 implementing user registration across our newspaper Web site. We
 plan to expand this technology to our other newspaper Web
 sites.

 Yahoo! 
 Search results, Yahoo! 
 News and other content verticals. 

This
 is a transformation deal for the newspaper industry that will allow
 us to
 reach a huge audience that extends way beyond our current newspapers Web
 sites. As part of the agreement, our newspapers will create platforms
 on
 its Web sites to use Yahoo s

Since
 our 2003 acquisition of the original Charleston magazine, we have
 expanded
 Skirt! and now circulate the magazine in eight southeastern
 markets. Skirt! is a free monthly magazine for women which
 feature eye-catching graphics and layout, with essays and articles
 designed to attract women, a major consumer segment. 

During
 2006, Morris licensed Skirt! 
 magazine to The Atlanta-Journal-Constitution, a division of Cox
 Enterprises Inc. for publication in the Atlanta area and had an initial
 distribution of 100 thousand. Additionally, we have licensed it in
 Knoxville, Tennessee and are pursuing opportunities in other markets.
 Morris owns and publishes the magazines in the other six
 markets. 

The
 magazine s growth is a good indicator of how successful the magazine is in
 reaching its target market. The current licensing agreements provide
 us
 with a one time licensing fee plus periodic royalty fees based on
 a
 percentage of advertising revenues. These licensing arrangements
 may
 facilitate the magazine s expansion, in turn attracting more national
 advertising exposure and sales. 

We
 have purchased a new printing press for our Savannah plant that
 will
 produce higher quality color, improve printing efficiency and give
 us more
 printing flexibility. The press is scheduled to be in production
 by the
 fall of 2007. This
 press will be used to print most of our Savannah Morning News products,
 Bluffton Today, and enable us to meet and exceed the printing needs
 of our
 commercial print customers. 

During
 2006, we acquired four rural non-daily newspapers located in Barnwell,
 Hampton and Edgefield, South Carolina and in Sylvania, Georgia. These
 newspapers, which are located near our Augusta market area, will
 be a
 great fit for the
 Augusta
 Chronicle 
 and our other area publications.

During
 the first quarter 2007, the
 Augusta Chronicle began
 publishing a free community newspaper, the North
 Augusta Today 
 (S.C.), a weekly publication specializing in local news and journalism.
 The 
 publication
 aims to provide small town news with a heavy emphasis on people who live
 and do business in North Augusta. The initial circulation was
 approximately 15,000. In addition to the weekly publication, NorthAugustaToday.com ,
 the online companion to the printed product, will mirror the printed
 publication and post breaking news between publications.

During
 2003, The Morris Shared Services Center was created to support various
 administrative functions throughout our company. Our vision was to
 centralize, standardize, and eliminate or simplify as many accounting
 and
 administrative processes as possible in order to create labor and
 purchasing savings. 

We
 now have all of our newspapers live on SAP Financials, the entire
 company
 on a Web-based timekeeping system, one Human Resource/Payroll system,
 and
 two newspapers on the SAP Media system, both circulation and advertising,
 and The
 Augusta Chronicle 
 and all our Skirt! 
 magazines on the SAP advertising system. 

We
 have implemented a centralized call center for subscriber complaints
 and
 are taking calls for Augusta, Savannah, Topeka, Juneau, St. Augustine,
 Bluffton and Athens and as we implement the media platform, we will
 continue to add newspapers to our centralized call center.

We
 currently have all but one of our daily newspapers on a retention-calling
 program. Several other newspaper companies have expressed interest
 in
 utilizing our retention-calling services. 

Our
 centralized purchasing group has put into place companywide purchasing
 programs that allow our various businesses to purchase goods and
 services
 at reduced rates.

Excluding
 the estimated 1.1 million in 2005 advertising revenue that was directly
 attributed to the city s hosting the Super Bowl; Jacksonville s advertising
 revenue was up 5.2 million, or 4.2 , with solid gains in the retail and
 classified categories. 

Lubbock
 was up 0.6 million, or 2.3 , due to gains in the classified category. Topeka
 was up 0.2 million, or 0.9 , versus last year. 

Savannah s
 advertising revenue was down 0.8 million, or 2.6 , with significant declines
 in
 the retail and national categories. Most of these declines were
 related to the consolidation in the telecommunication and department store
 industry. 

Augusta
 and Amarillo were relatively flat versus last year. 

Total
 advertising revenue from our 21 other smaller daily newspapers was up 4.5
 million, or 5.0 , with solid gains at most of these newspapers. Advertising
 revenue for Bluffton was up 0.9 million, or 43.3 , from 2005. St. Augustine
 was
 up 1.0 million, or 10.0 , continuing its trend. Combined advertising revenue
 from our two Alaska dailies was up 0.8 million, or 10.6 , due to the increase
 in the national category. Holland was down 0.3 million, or 3.2 . 

Total
 advertising revenue from our non-daily publications, which complement the
 revenue from our daily newspapers, was up 2.4 million, or 10.8 , from last
 year. Skirt! 
 magazines advertising revenue increased 0.6 million, or 14.8 . Advertising
 revenues from The
 People-Sentinel 
 (Barnwell, S.C.), The
 Hampton County
 (S.C.)
 Guardian ,
 The
 Citizen News 
 (Edgefield, S.C.) and the Sylvania 
 (Ga.)
 Telephone ,
 the
 four non-daily newspapers acquired in the third quarter of 2006, totaled
 0.8
 million in 2006. 

The
 material variances in the advertising categories at our newspapers listed
 above
 are discussed in more detail in our results of operations summary, which
 follows. 

During
 2006, circulation revenue was 69.7 million, down 0.9 million, or 1.3 ,
 from
 the same period last year. 

Other
 income was 16.1 million, down slightly from 2005. 

Total
 labor and employee benefit costs were down 0.7 million, or 0.4 ; newsprint
 ink
 and supplements costs were up 4.0 million, or 7.1 ; and other operating
 costs,
 excluding the net pre-tax gain on the sales of fixed assets, were up 3.4
 million, or 2.7 . The net pre-tax gain on the sales of fixed assets
 was down 4.8 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was down 0.6
 million, or 2.4 . 

Our
 total
 operating costs during 2005 were unusually affected by the estimated 1.1
 million in costs directly related to Jacksonville hosting the Super Bowl
 in
 2005, our accrual of 0.7 million in potential bankruptcy losses from a large
 advertiser and our 5.0 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of the Savannah
 facility. During the fourth quarter 2006, the 0.7 million reserved for
 potential bankruptcy losses was reversed upon the advertiser s emergence from
 the bankruptcy proceedings. 

In
 addition, our total operating costs were impacted by the 7.0 increase in
 the
 average price per ton of newsprint, and the significant increase in our other
 advertising, circulation, and distribution costs. These cost increases were
 offset somewhat by the aggressive management of our other production and
 miscellaneous operating costs, and the decrease in employee benefit costs
 resulting from the reduction in healthcare insurance claims paid and the
 lower
 headcounts. 

The
 introduction of Skirt! 
 magazines into new markets, the launch of the Bluffton
 Today daily
 newspaper and the acquisition of the four new non-daily newspapers, together,
 contributed 1.8 million to the net increase in our total operating
 costs. 

Interest
 and loan amortization expense increased by 1.4 million, or 3.9 , primarily
 due
 to short-term interest rate increases. 

On
 March
 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, we declared and recorded 15 million and
 28
 million in dividends to Morris Communications, in effect, reducing the loan
 receivable from Morris Communications by the dividend amount. 

Our
 effective tax rate was 39.4 for 2006, compared to 38.7 for 2005.

 results reflect the industry s shift from ROP retail advertising to preprint and
 online advertising. During 2006, preprint retail revenue was 66.3 million,
 up
 3.7 million, or 6.0 ; while ROP retail advertising revenue was 113.5 million,
 down 7.2 million, or 6.0 , from 2005. Retail advertising revenue from specialty

 or 0.9 , from 2005. Excluding the 0.8 million in retail advertising revenue
 directly related to Jacksonville s hosting of the NFL s Super Bowl in 2005,
 Jacksonville was up 3.1 million, or 6.6 . 

Savannah
 and Amarillo were down 0.6 million, or 3.6 , and 0.5 million, or 3.7 ,
 respectively, due to reductions from grocery and department stores, banks,
 telecommunications, or losses from major retailers going out of
 business. 

Topeka
 was slightly down, a significant improvement over the 11.9 decrease last
 year
 versus 2004. 

Augusta
 and Lubbock were relatively flat, due to unfavorable comparisons to the solid
 gains last year. Augusta s retail advertising revenue was up 1.2 million, or
 5.7 , in 2005 compared to 2004. 

Retail
 advertising revenue from our 21 smaller daily newspapers was up 0.5 million,
 or
 0.9 , from last year, with St. Augustine and Bluffton up 13.2 , and 53.6 ,
 respectively. However, Holland, Kenai and Juneau were down 9.7 , 13.1 , and
 20.5 , respectively. 

Retail
 advertising revenue from our non-daily publications increased 1.5 million,
 or
 7.6 , with Skirt! 
 magazines contributing 0.5 million, or 37.3 of this net increase. Total
 retail
 advertising revenue from the four non-daily newspapers acquired in the third
 quarter of 2006 was 0.6 million in 2006. 

Classified
 advertising revenue: 

Total
 classified advertising revenue was 164.5 million, up 8.1 million, or 5.2 ,
 from 2005 due to the continued strength in the real estate and employment
 categories at most of our daily newspapers. 

Online
 classified advertising revenue was 23.4 million, up approximately 6.1 million,
 or 35.5 , with most of the increase driven by the employment category. During
 2006, classified ROP advertising revenue was 139.1 million, up 1.6 million,
 or
 1.2 . 

Classified
 advertising revenue at our six largest daily newspapers was up 3.9 million,
 or
 3.3 , with significant gains in Jacksonville, Savannah, Lubbock and Amarillo.
 Augusta and Topeka were slightly up from last year.

 Kenai and Shawnee. St. Augustine was up 0.5 million, or 9.4 . 

Our
 non-daily publications classified advertising revenue was up 0.9 million, or

National
 advertising revenue: 

Total
 national advertising revenue was 24.6 million, down 0.2 million, or 0.9 ,
 from
 2005, with most of our newspapers being adversely affected by lower corporate
 rates for a national preprint advertiser. 

The
 1.1
 million, or 5.0 , net decline in national advertising revenue from our six
 largest newspapers was partially offset by the 0.9 million, or 25.3 , net
 gain
 from our other newspapers and publications. 

Jacksonville s
 and Savannah s national advertising revenue were both down 0.5 million, or
 3.0 , and 32.2 , respectively, due to continued losses from the
 telecommunication, entertainment, automotive and airline industries and due
 to
 unfavorable comparisons to last year. 

Amarillo
 was slightly down, compared to a 0.2 million, or 20.0 , decline in 2005
 versus
 2004. Topeka was up 0.1 million, or 14.6 , rebounding from a 0.1 million,
 or
 13.6 , decline last year. 

Lubbock s
 and Augusta s national advertising revenue were both down 0.1 million, or 6.0 ,
 and 7.9 , respectively, continuing their trend. 

Juneau s
 and Kenai s national advertising revenue totaled 1.5 million, up 0.8 million
 from 2005, driven by increases in environmental advocacy advertising.

Circulation
 revenue: 

During
 2006, circulation revenue was 69.7 million, down 0.9 million, or 1.3 ,
 from
 last year, continuing the trend at most of our newspapers.

 daily single copies and home delivery copies remained soft, down approximately
 3.3 and 2.3 , respectively. 

Sunday
 circulation continued its trend down, with average single copy and home delivery
 down approximately 3.7 and 1.3 , respectively. 

Other
 revenue: 

Commercial
 printing revenue was 10.2 million, down 0.9 million, or 8.1 , and other
 online
 revenue was 1.1 million, down 0.7 million, or 38.8 , from 2005. 

During
 the first quarter of 2006, we reached an agreement with the Atlanta
 Journal-Constitution AJC to license Skirt! 
 magazine
 for the Atlanta market. We received a one-time fee during the first quarter
 of
 2006 and will continue to receive royalty fees based upon the
 agreement. 

During
 2006, other miscellaneous revenue, including the AJC license and royalty
 fees,
 totaled 4.8 million, up 1.6 million from 2005.

 follows. 

During
 2005, circulation revenue was 70.6 million, up 0.4 million, or 0.6 , from

 offsetting the continued declines in newspaper copy sales at most of our
 newspapers. 

Other
 income was 16.2 million, down 1.8 million, or 10.1 , primarily due to the
 decline in commercial printing revenues.

 labor and employee benefit costs were down 1.1 million, or 0.6 ; newsprint
 ink
 and supplements costs were up 2.1 million, or 3.9 ; and other operating

 4.6
 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was up 0.9 million, or

 of
 0.7 million in potential bankruptcy losses from a large advertiser and the
 11.4 increase in the average price per ton of newsprint. 

Interest
 and loan amortization expense increased by 3.4 million, or 10.5 , due to
 short-term interest rate increases.

 million, up 2.5 million, or 35.6 . 

Retail
 online revenue was 4.5 million, up approximately 0.4 million, or 9.7 ,
 from
 2004. 

Retail
 advertising revenue from our six largest daily newspapers was down slightly
 from
 2004. 

Excluding
 the 0.9 million in retail advertising revenue directly related to
 Jacksonville s hosting of the NFL s Super Bowl in 2005, Jacksonville was down
 0.6 million, or 1.3 . 

Augusta s
 retail advertising revenue was up 1.2 million, or 5.7 , 

Lubbock s
 and Amarillo s advertising revenues were up slightly from 2004. 

Savannah s
 market was soft, with retail advertising revenue down 0.4 million, or
 2.5 . 

During
 2005, Topeka was down 1.5 million, or 11.9 , from 2004. The Topeka market
 continued to be affected by slow retail sales growth, significant losses
 of
 major retailers, shopping leakage to Kansas City and significant industry
 closures. 

Retail
 advertising revenue from our 21 smaller daily newspapers was up 0.4 million,
 or
 0.8 , from 2004, with Juneau, Brainerd, and St. Augustine continuing to show
 strength. However, Athens and Winter Haven were down 6.4 and 16.3 ,
 respectively. 

Retail
 advertising revenue from our non-daily publications increased 1.3 million,
 or
 7 , with Skirt! 
 magazines contributing all of this net increase. 

Classified
 advertising revenue: 

Total
 classified advertising revenue was 156.4 million, up 12.3 million, or 8.5 ,
 from 2004 due to the strength in the real estate and employment categories
 at
 most of our daily newspapers. 

Online
 classified advertising revenue was 17.2 million, up approximately 5.2 million,
 or 43.3 , with most of the increase driven by the employment and real estate
 categories. During 2005, classified ROP advertising revenue was 137.5 million,
 up 6.9 million, or 5.3 . 

Classified
 advertising revenue at our six largest daily newspapers was up 8.3 million,
 or

 7.4 ,
 3.3 , 2.9 and 7.7 , respectively. Augusta was down 0.2 million, or 1.7 ,
 due
 to unfavorable comparisons with 2004.

Classified
 advertising revenue at our 21 smaller daily newspapers was up a net 4.1
 million, or 13.1 , with significant gains in Winter Haven, Independence,
 Grand
 Island, Brainerd, St. Augustine, Juneau, Bluffton, and Athens. St. Augustine
 was
 up 1.1 million, or 25.2 . 

Our
 non-daily publications classified advertising revenue was down a net 0.1
 million, or 2.8 . 

National
 advertising revenue: 

Total
 national advertising revenue was 24.8 million, down 3.1 million, or 11.2 ,
 from 2004, primarily due to the 2.1 million, or 12.4 , decline in Jacksonville.
 Jacksonville s decline was attributed to the softness in the telecommunication,
 entertainment, automotive and airline segments. 

All
 of
 our other daily newspapers, with the exception of Athens, reported significant
 declines in national advertising revenues compared to 2004. 

Circulation
 revenue: 

During
 2005, circulation revenue was 70.6 million, up 0.4 million, or 0.6 from
 2004,
 with the gains in Jacksonville, Savannah and Athens being offset somewhat
 by the
 losses in Topeka, Lubbock, Amarillo and at most of our other smaller daily
 newspapers. Augusta was flat with 2004. 

During
 2005, Savannah and Jacksonville s circulation revenue was up 3.3 and 4.4 ,
 respectively, benefiting from home delivery price increases. Topeka continued
 its decline, with circulation revenue down 5.3 from 2004. 

Average
 daily single copies and home delivery copies remained soft, down approximately
 3.4 and 4.8 , respectively. 

Sunday
 circulation continued its trend down, with average single copy and home delivery
 down approximately 2.1 and 3.2 , respectively. 

Other

During
 2005, labor and employee benefits cost was 176.8 million, down 1.1 million,
 or
 0.6 . 

Compared
 to 2004, salaries and wages were 123.1 million, up 1.2 million, or 1.0 .
 FTE s
 (or full time equivalent employees) were down by 3.5 , with significant
 reductions in the newsroom, circulation, and production
 departments. 

Commissions
 and bonuses were 23.2 million, up 0.4 million, or 2.0 ,
 from 2004. 

Employee
 medical insurance cost was 12.9 million, down 1.4 million, or 9.9 , due
 to the
 decrease in claims experience and lower headcount. 

Compared
 to 2004, post retirement benefit cost was 1.6 million, down 1.1 million,
 or
 41.3 , due to the continued decrease in the total eligible participants of
 the
 plan and the Medicare prescription drug subsidy. 

Newsprint,
 ink and supplements cost: 

During
 2005, newsprint, ink and supplements cost was 55.9 million, up 2.1 million,
 or
 3.9 . 

Compared
 to 2004, total newsprint expense was 47.0 million, up 1.6 million, or 3.5 .
 The 11.4 increase in the average price per ton of newsprint was offset somewhat
 by a 7.1 decrease in newsprint consumption. 

Ink
 expense increased 7.0 to 2.9 million, primarily due to the increase in
 color
 ink costs and consumption. Supplements expense increased 5.1 to 6.1 million
 from 5.8 million in 2004. 

Other
 operating costs: 

Total
 other operating costs, excluding the net pre-tax gain on sales of fixed assets,
 were 128.0 million, up 6.0 million, or 4.9 , from 2004, with sales and
 marketing expenses up 2.4 million, or 25.3 ; delivery and circulation expenses
 up 2.1 million, or 7.8 ; and rent expense up 1.0 million, or
 40.1 . 

Bad
 debt
 expense was down by 1.9 million, net of the 0.7 million reserved for a
 potential loss from a large advertiser s bankruptcy filing. 

We
 estimated that 0.8 million in other operating costs were directly related
 to
 Jacksonville s hosting the 2005 Super Bowl and 1.4 million in other operating
 costs were directly related to the launch of Bluffton
 Today 
 and the
 start up of new Skirt! 
 magazines. 

The
 rent
 increase was primarily from the new lease on our new Savannah facility. The
 new
 lease became effective as of November 1, 2004, with a monthly payment of
 0.1
 million. 

The
 combined technology and shared services fee from our parent and management
 fee
 charged by our parent under the management agreement totaled 30.3 million
 in
 2005, down 0.4 million, or 1.5 , from 2004.

Liquidity
 and capital resources 

We
 believe that our principal sources of liquidity, which are existing cash
 and
 cash equivalents, cash flows provided from operating activities, and the
 borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities, will be sufficient
 to meet
 our ongoing operating needs. Cash flow generated from operations is our primary
 source of liquidity. 

Our
 primary needs for cash are funding operating expense, debt service on our
 bank
 credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes, capital expenditures,
 income taxes, dividends and loans to affiliates, acquisitions and working
 capital. We have pursued, and will continue to pursue, a business strategy
 that
 includes selective acquisitions and new product development. 

Cash
 was
 7.0 million at December 31, 2006, compared with 12.5 million at December
 31,
 2005 and 20.1 million at December 31, 2004. 

Operating
 activities. 
 Net cash
 provided by operations was 50.2 million in 2006, down 1.5 million from
 51.7
 million in 2005. Net cash provided by operations in 2005, was down 4.0 million
 from 55.7 million in 2004. 

Current
 assets were 70.9 million and current liabilities were 52.8 million as of
 December 31, 2006 as compared to current assets of 84.1 million and current
 liabilities of 53.9 million as of December 31, 2005. We manage our working
 capital through the utilization of our revolving credit facility. The
 outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility is classified as a
 long-term liability, in accordance with its terms. 

Investing
 activities. Net
 cash used in investing activities was 7.9 million for 2006, down 6.5 million
 from 14.4 million in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005,
 was
 down 6.6 million from 21.0 million in 2004. 

During
 2006, we spent 9.9 million on property, plant and equipment, down from 14.2
 million in 2005 and 21.5 million in 2004. 

For
 2007,
 we expect our capital expenditures to be between 15 million and 20 million.
 These amounts will be used primarily to purchase the new printing press in
 Savannah, to build a new production facility in Yankton, and to upgrade existing
 production facilities and the technology infrastructure at our existing
 locations. 

In
 July
 2006, we entered into two license agreements and a non-compete agreement
 with
 Netlook, Inc. for Car
 Paper 
 and
 Career
 Paper 
 in order
 to allow us to publish the two free distribution publications and include
 content on our Jacksonville based newspaper Web site, Jacksonville.com .
 Both
 licenses expire on June 30, 2013 and the non-compete agreement expires in
 July
 2008. We paid a total of 0.8 million, all in cash, for the assets. 

Also
 in
 July 2006, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of
 four
 weekly newspapers in Georgia and South Carolina from Community Newspapers,
 Inc.
 The newspapers acquired were The
 Barnwell 
 (S.C.)
 People-Sentinel ,
 The
 Hampton County 
 (S.C.)
 Guardian ,
 The
 Edgefield 
 (S.C.)
 Citizen
 News 
 and the
 Sylvania 
 (Ga.)
 Telephone ,
 all of
 which will enhance our presence in our Augusta market area. The acquisition
 was
 accounted for as a purchase and had an aggregate purchase price, including
 closing costs, of approximately 4.4 million. We paid cash for the
 acquisition. 

During
 2006, the Company sold additional miscellaneous fixed assets for 0.2 million
 which resulted in a net pre-tax gain of 0.1 million. Scrapped fixed assets
 totaled 0.1 million. 

During
 the third quarter 2005, we sold Savannah s former production facility to a third
 party for 7.2 million, net of closing, and elected to have the net proceeds
 deposited into an escrow account in order to potentially fund other acquisitions
 by ourselves or our parent through a tax-deferred Section 1031 exchange.
 Our
 parent identified and acquired 0.4 million and 5.3 million in qualified
 replacement property during 2005 and 2006, respectively, with the reductions
 in
 the restricted escrow account being offset by an increase in loan receivable
 from Morris Communications. The remaining 1.5 million in escrow became
 unrestricted cash at March 27, 2006, the expiration date for the tax-deferred
 exchange. 

During
 2005 the Company also sold miscellaneous fixed assets for 0.1 million which
 resulted in a gain of 0.1 million. Scrapped fixed assets totaled 0.3 million
 and the clean up costs related to the sale of Savannah s former production
 facility totaled 0.4 million. 

During
 2004, we acquired Capital
 City Weekly ,
 a
 weekly newspaper located in Juneau, Alaska. The acquisition was accounted
 for as
 a purchase and had an aggregate purchase price, including closing costs of
 approximately 0.9 million. 

In
 2004,
 the Company received a total of 1.3 million in net proceeds from the sale
 of
 its Savannah warehouse and from the sale of other machinery and equipment.
 The
 net gain from these fixed asset sales totaled 0.6 million. Scrapped fixed
 assets totaled 0.4 million.

Financing
 activities. Net
 cash
 used in financing activities was 47.8 million for 2006, up 2.8 million
 from
 45.0 million in 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was 22.0 million
 in 2004. 

Original
 financing-2003: 

On
 August
 7, 2003, we refinanced substantially all of our long-term indebtedness
 by issuing 250 million of 7 senior subordinated notes due 2013 and entering
 into a 400 million bank credit agreement. In September 2003, an additional
 50
 million of senior subordinated notes were issued. The loss incurred on the
 extinguishment of the prior debt was 5,957 during 2003. We subsequently
 modified and replaced this 2003 Credit Agreement with a 2005 Credit Agreement
 with substantially similar terms and conditions. 

The
 300
 million in senior subordinated notes is subordinated to the rights of the
 lenders under the original and future senior credit facilities. In the event
 of
 a liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event of the
 company, the lenders of the senior debt must be paid in full for all obligations
 under the Credit Agreement (including interest accruing after the commencement
 of a bankruptcy proceeding), before any payment can be made to holders of
 the
 notes. The covenants of the Company s Credit Agreement prevent voluntary payment
 or prepayment of the senior subordinated notes, except for regularly scheduled
 payments of principal and interest. In addition, the covenants of the Credit
 Agreement require that all payments, including regularly scheduled interest
 payments, on the senior subordinated notes must be suspended in the event
 of a
 payment default on the senior credit facilities, or in the event the trustee
 of
 the notes indenture receives a Payment
 Blockage Notice 
 following any other default that would permit the senior lenders to accelerate
 the maturity of the senior debt. 

The
 2003
 bank credit agreement consisted of a Tranche B 225 million term loan and
 a 175
 million revolving credit line. The Tranche B principal payments were due
 each
 quarter commencing December 31, 2004, through December 31, 2010, with the
 final
 payment to have been due March 31, 2011. The revolving credit loan would
 have
 terminated September 30, 2010. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore
 interest at the alternative base rate (ABR) or the Eurodollar rate, plus
 applicable margin as defined. The ABR was the greater of the federal funds
 rate
 plus 0.5 or prime. The Eurodollar rate was the LIBOR rate. 

The
 2003
 Credit Agreement required, among other things, that we and Morris
 Communications on a consolidated basis (1) maintain a debt-to-cash flow ratio
 not to exceed 6.00 to 1 initially and adjusting downward periodically to
 5.50 to
 1 on September 30, 2006, and all times thereafter; (2) maintain a fixed charge
 coverage ratio greater than or equal to 1.05 to 1 initially and adjusting
 upward
 to 1.15 to 1 on March 31, 2006, and all times thereafter; and (3) maintain
 an interest coverage ratio to be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1 initially
 and adjusting upward to 2.50 to 1 on September 30, 2005, and all times
 thereafter. 

Modification
 of original bank credit facility-2004: 

In
 July
 2004, we modified the terms of our 400 million 2003 senior credit facilities,
 replacing the 225 million Tranche B Term Loans with 100 million of new
 Tranche
 A Term Loans and 150 million of Tranche C Term Loans. We also reduced our
 Revolving Credit Commitments from 175 million to 150 million. The immediate
 impact of the amendment was to reduce interest rates and the debt covenants
 generally remained unchanged. The
 final
 payments on the Tranche A and the Tranche C loans were scheduled for September
 30, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The revolving credit loan terminated
 September 30, 2010. 

The
 0.6
 million in loan origination fees associated with the modification of the
 credit
 facility were capitalized and would have been amortized along with the Tranche
 B
 loan s unamortized costs over the lives of the Tranche A and Tranche C loans in
 accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19, Debtor s
 Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments .
 We
 wrote off 0.2 million in unamortized loan costs associated with the original
 revolving credit facility in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-14, Debtor s
 Accounting for Changes in Line-of Credit or Revolving-Debt
 Arrangements ,
 and
 were to amortize the remaining 1.3 million over the term of the revolving
 credit loan. 

Refinancing
 of bank credit facility-2005: 

On
 December 14, 2005, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement for
 350 million of senior secured term and revolving credit facilities. The
 new
 credit facilities terminated and replaced our then existing 400 million
 credit
 facilities. The new credit facilities consist of a 175 million Revolving
 Credit
 Facility and a 175 million Tranche A Term Loan. The maturity date for both
 facilities is September 30, 2012. 

The
 refinancing of the Tranche A and C Term Loans resulted in an exchange of
 debt
 instruments with substantially different terms, since the present value of
 the
 cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument were greater than 10 
 different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms
 of
 the original debt instruments. Therefore, the transaction was accounted for
 as a
 debt extinguishment in accordance with the guidance outlined in EITF Issue
 No.
 96-19, Debtor s
 Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instrument ,
 and the
 unamortized costs associated with the prior Tranche A and C term loans were
 included in loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement
 of
 income. 

The
 refinancing of the existing 150 million Revolving Credit Commitment resulted
 in
 an increase in borrowing capacity and was accounted for in accordance with
 EITF
 Issue No. 98-14, Debtor s
 Accounting for Changes in Line of Credit or Revolving Debt
 Arrangements .
 Accordingly, unamortized deferred costs from the prior arrangement and the
 fees
 paid for the new credit facility were associated with the new arrangement
 and
 capitalized. 

-45- 

Table
 of Contents 

The
 2.0
 million in fees incurred for the new credit facility were paid to different
 third parties and were not related to fees paid or received to extinguish
 the
 original debt instruments. 

The
 new
 Tranche A term loan facility requires the following principal amortization
 with
 the final payment due on September 30, 2012 (dollars in
 thousands):

The
 new
 credit facility reduced our interest rate spread and also provides funds
 for
 working capital and other general corporate purposes. The debt covenants
 generally remained unchanged. A commitment fee on unborrowed funds available
 under the revolver is 0.375 . 

Year
 end debt summary: 

Total
 debt was 524 million at December 31, 2006, up 3.0 million compared to the
 end
 of 2005, with 49 million outstanding on our new revolving credit facility.
 At
 the end of 2006, we could borrow and use for general corporate purposes 119.8
 million under the most restrictive covenants of our debt
 arrangements. 

Total
 debt was 521 million at December 31, 2005, down 29 million compared to
 the end
 of 2004, with 46 million outstanding on our new revolving credit
 facility. 

We
 paid
 0.0 million, 4.9 million, and 0.0 million in principal amortization during
 the 12 months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, on the
 various term loan facilities. 

As
 of
 December 31, 2006 and 2005, our weighted cost of debt outstanding was
 approximately 6.68 and 6.35 , respectively. 

The
 fair
 value at December 31, 2006 and 2005 of the 300 million principal amount
 of
 senior subordinated notes was approximately 284 million and 283 million,
 respectively. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Tranche A term
 loan
 and revolver were estimated at 171 million and 47 million, respectively.
 At
 December 31, 2005, the fair value of the Tranche A term loan and revolver
 were
 estimated at par. To
 estimate the fair
 values of our debt issues, which are not quoted on an exchange, we used
 those interest rates that were currently available to us for issuance of
 debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 

Dividends : 

We,
 with
 certain restrictions under our indenture, may make dividend payments to our
 parent to fund its cash needs for general business purposes, capital
 expenditures and acquisitions. At December 31, 2006, we had an additional
 98.0
 million available for future restricted payments under the notes
 indenture. 

On
 March
 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, we declared and recorded 15 million and
 28
 million, respectively, in dividends to Morris Communications that, in turn,
 utilized the distribution to reduce its debt to us. 

In
 December 2005, we distributed as dividends various parcels of land unrelated
 to
 our newspaper operations located in Alaska and Augusta, Georgia valued at
 a
 total of 1.8 million to Morris Communications. 

On
 August
 31, 2004, we declared and recorded a 50 million dividend to Morris
 Communications that, in turn, utilized the distribution to reduce its debt
 to
 us. 

Loan
 receivable from Morris Communications: 

Our
 credit facility and indenture allow us to make loans to Morris Communications.
 The total loan outstanding at December 31, 2006 was 23.2 million, a 7.5
 million increase from 15.7 million at December 31, 2005. The loan outstanding
 at the end of 2004 was 1.5 million. The interest-bearing portion of all
 loans
 from us to Morris Communications bears the same rate as the borrowings under
 our
 senior credit facilities. 

Prior
 to
 2005, we had reported the loan receivable from Morris Communications as a
 long-term asset on our balance sheets and had reported interest income related
 to the loan receivable in our statement of income. Based on the historical
 practice of settling a significant portion of the outstanding loan receivable
 balance with dividends, we concluded that the arrangement should be considered
 in substance a capital distribution transaction and classified as contra-equity
 within member s deficit. As a result of this conclusion, commencing in 2005, we
 have classified the outstanding loan receivable balance as part of member s
 deficiency in assets. During 2006 and 2005, we reported the 2.1 million,
 and
 1.5 million, respectively, in accrued loan receivable interest as contra
 equity. The average annual interest rate in 2006 and 2005 was 6.089 and
 5.620 ,
 respectively, on average loan balances of 33.9 million and 23.7 million,
 respectively.

We
 have
 not reversed the previously reported 2004 loan receivable interest income,
 as
 such amounts were considered immaterial. The interest accrued and paid on
 the
 loans to Morris Communications for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004
 was
 1.2 million, on an average loan balance of 27.5 million. The average annual
 interest rate was 3.724 , for 2004. 

Morris
 Publishing Finance Co. overview 

Morris
 Publishing Finance Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morris Publishing Group,
 LLC, was incorporated in 2003 for the sole purpose of serving as a co-issuer

Inflation
 and changing prices 

The
 impact of inflation on our operations was immaterial for all periods presented.
 In the past, the effects of inflation on operating expenses have been
 substantially offset by our ability to increase advertising rates. No assurances
 can be given that we can pass such cost increases through to our customers
 in
 the future. 

Seasonality 

Newspaper
 companies tend to follow a distinct and recurring seasonal pattern. The first
 quarter of the year tends to be the weakest quarter because advertising volume
 is then at its lowest level. Correspondingly, the fourth quarter tends to
 be the
 strongest quarter as it includes heavy holiday season advertising. As a result,
 our consolidated results may not be comparable from quarter to
 quarter.

 Risk 

Interest
 rate risk 

We
 are
 exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, although a large portion
 of
 our outstanding debt is at a fixed rate. See Note 6 to our consolidated
 financial statements for December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 regarding long
 term
 debt and the discussion below. 

Fair
 Value 
 of
 Financial Instruments 

We estimated
 the fair values presented below using appropriate valuation methodologies
 and
 market information available as of year-end. Considerable judgment is required
 to develop estimates of fair
 value, and the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the
 amounts
 that we could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different
 market
 assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on
 the
 estimated fair values. Additionally, the fair values were estimated at
 year-end,
 and current estimates of fair
 value may differ significantly from the amounts presented. 

The
 carrying amount of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable
 and accounts payable approximates fair
 value. 

To
 estimate the fair
 value of our debt issues, which are not quoted on an exchange, we used
 those interest rates that were currently available to us for issuance of
 debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 

At
 December 31, 2006, the fair value of the 300 million principal amount
 of senior
 subordinated notes was approximately 284 million .
 A 100
 basis point increase in market interest rates on comparable bonds (corporate
 bonds with similar credit risk and maturities) would decrease the fair
 value of
 the senior subordinated notes by approximately 33.9 million. Conversely,
 a 100
 basis point decrease in market interest rates on comparable bonds would
 increase
 the fair value of these notes by approximately 44.5 million. 

At
 December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Tranche A term loan and revolving
 credit facility were estimated at 171 million and 47 million, respectively.
 The rates on these loans are variable and fair value of these loans is
 not
 directly affected by the change in market interest rates.

Debt
 obligations 

At
 December 31, 2006, under our 350 million bank credit facilities, we had 175
 million outstanding on our Tranche A term loan and 49 million outstanding
 under
 the 175 million revolving credit facility. The interest rates on loans under
 our bank credit facilities are determined with reference to a spread above
 the
 alternative base rate (ABR) or the Eurodollar rate, plus applicable margin
 as
 defined. The ABR is the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5 or prime.
 The Eurodollar rate is the LIBOR rate. The spread applicable to any borrowings
 under our revolving credit facility and Tranche A term loan is determined by
 reference to our trailing total debt to cash flow ratio. During 2006, the spread
 on the revolver ranged from 0.875 to 1.00 and was 0.875 at December 31,
 2006.
 During 2006, the spread on the Tranche A term loan ranged from 0.875 to 1.00 
 and was 0.875 at December 31, 2006. 

Because
 LIBOR, the federal funds rate or the JPMorgan Chase Prime Rate may increase
 or
 decrease at any time, we are exposed to market risk as a result of the impact
 that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable
 to
 borrowings under the bank credit facilities. Increases in the interest rates
 applicable to borrowings under the bank credit facilities would result in
 increased interest expense and a reduction in our net income. As of December
 31,
 2006, the interest rate on our Tranche A term loan and our revolving credit
 facility was 6.25 based upon a spread above LIBOR. For each 100-basis point
 increase in LIBOR, the annual interest expense paid on this 224 million
 of
 variable rate debt would increase 2.24 million (assuming the ABR would not
 produce a lower effective interest rate). 

Under
 the
 terms of our modified senior secured credit facility, we must maintain certain
 levels of interest rate protection. The notional amount of the interest rate
 caps plus the total fixed rate debt must total at least 40 of our total
 debt.

During
 2006, we made a commitment totaling 7.0 million
 to purchase a new printing press for our Savannah plant that is scheduled
 to be
 in production by the fall of 2007. During 2006, we made three payments against
 this commitment totaling 3.1 million. An additional 2.1 million was paid
 in
 March 2007, with the remaining 1.8 million due in five equal installments
 during the remainder of 2007.

Newsprint 

We
 consumed approximately 73,726 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2006, an expense
 representing 13.0 of our total operating expenses. A sustained price increase
 or an unavailability of supply could adversely affect our
 profitability.

REPORT 
 OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
 FIRM 

To
 Morris
 Communications Company, LLC and Morris Publishing Group, LLC: 

We
 have
 audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Morris Publishing
 Group, LLC and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and
 the related consolidated statements of income, member s deficiency in assets,
 and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
 2006. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule
 listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and
 consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
 Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
 consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule
 based on our audits. 

We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
 we plan
 and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
 statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required
 to
 have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
 financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
 over
 financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
 opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
 reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
 in
 the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
 financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
 reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
 our
 opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
 respects, the consolidated financial position of the Morris Publishing Group,
 LLC as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its
 operations, member's deficiency in assets and its cash flows for each of
 the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 Also,
 in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered
 in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole;
 present fairly in all material respects the information set forth
 therein.

 Notes
 to consolidated financial statements 

 (Dollars
 in thousands) 

1. Nature
 of operations and summary of significant accounting policies

Basis
 of presentation and nature of operations These
 accompanying consolidated financial statements of Morris Publishing Group,
 LLC
 Morris Publishing or the Company ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Morris
 Communications Company, LLC Morris Communications, or Parent ), furnished
 here reflect all adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary
 for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of
 operations. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

The
 accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 GAAP ), and present the Company s financial position, results of operations,
 and cash flows. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
 in
 consolidation. As further described in Note 9, certain expenses, assets and
 liabilities of Morris Communications have been allocated to the Company.
 These
 allocations were based on estimates of the proportion of corporate expenses,
 assets and liabilities related to the Company, utilizing such factors as
 revenues, number of employees, salaries and wages expenses, and other applicable
 factors. In the opinion of management, these allocations have been made on
 a
 reasonable basis. The costs of these services charged to the Company may
 not
 reflect the actual costs the Company would have incurred for similar services
 as
 a stand-alone company. 

The
 Company and Morris Communications have executed various agreements with respect
 to the allocation of assets, liabilities and costs. See Note 9. 

Business
 segments The
 Company owns and operates 27 daily newspapers as well as nondaily newspapers,
 city magazines and free community publications in the Southeast, Midwest,
 Southwest and Alaska. The Company operates in a single reporting
 segment, 
 and the
 presentation
 of the Company's financial condition and performance is consistent with the
 way
 in which the Company's operations are managed. 
 Use
 of estimates The
 preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
 to make
 estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
 date of
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
 during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates
 its
 estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and
 on
 various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
 circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
 estimates. 

Revenue
 recognition Advertising
 revenues are recognized when the advertisements are printed and distributed
 or
 when the advertisements are placed on the Company s Web sites. Circulation
 revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term.
 Amounts billed for circulation and subscriptions prior to such period are
 recorded as deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated financial
 statements. Other revenue is recognized when the related product or service
 has
 been delivered. 

Deferred
 circulation revenue Deferred
 circulation revenue arises as a normal part of business from prepaid
 subscription payments for newspapers and other publications. Revenue is realized
 in the period the publication is delivered. 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments The Company estimated
 the fair values presented below using appropriate valuation methodologies
 and
 market information available as of year-end. Considerable judgment is required
 to develop estimates of fair value, and the estimates presented
 are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
 realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
 or
 estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated
 fair
 values. Additionally, the fair values were estimated at year-end, and current
 estimates of fair value may differ significantly from
 the
 amounts presented. 

The
 following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
 value of each class of financial instruments: 

Cash
 and equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The
 carrying amount of these items approximates fair
 value. 

Long
 term debt .
 To
 estimate the fair
 value of our debt issues, which are not quoted on an exchange, the Company
 used
 those interest rates that were currently available to it for issuance of
 debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. At
 December 31, 2006, the fair value of the 300 million principal amount
 of senior
 subordinated notes was approximately 284 million and the
 fair
 value of the Tranche A term loan and revolving credit facility were estimated
 at
 171 million and 47 million, respectively. 

Cash
 and Cash Equivalents Cash
 is
 stated at cost and the Company considers all liquid debt instruments purchased
 with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
 Company owned or held no outstanding debt instruments at December 31,
 2006. 

Accounts
 Receivable Accounts
 receivables are mostly from advertisers and newspaper subscribers. We extend
 credit and set the appropriate reserves for receivables, which is a subjective
 decision based on the knowledge of the customer and industry. The level of
 credit is influenced by each customer s credit history with us and other
 industry specific data. In the past, the credit limits and the management
 of the
 overall credit portfolio was decentralized, however, the Company has recently
 centralized this function as part of the Company s shared services
 initiative. 

The
 Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated
 uncollectible accounts. The Company s estimate is based on regular review of
 individual account balances over 90 days, historical collection experience
 and
 consideration of other factors such as customer s financial status and other
 business risk. It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the
 allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Write-offs of uncollectible
 accounts receivable net of recoveries were 1,571, 2,176, and 3,024 in
 2006,
 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Inventories Inventories
 consist principally of newsprint, prepress costs and supplies, which are
 stated
 at the lower of cost or market value. The cost of newsprint inventory, which
 represented approximately 56 and 64 of the Company s inventory at December 31,
 2006 and 2005, respectively, is determined by the last in, first out method.
 Costs for newsprint inventory would have been 1,689 and 1,848 higher at
 December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, had the FIFO method been used for
 all
 inventories. The turnover of inventory ranges from 30 days to 60 days depending
 on availability and market conditions. Obsolete inventory is generally not
 a
 factor. 

Net
 Property and Equipment Property
 and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
 is
 recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets,
 which range from seven to 40 years for buildings and improvements, five to
 11
 years for machinery and production equipment, and five to 10 years for office
 equipment, fixtures and vehicles. 

The
 cost
 and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment that are retired
 or otherwise disposed of are relieved from the respective accounts, and the
 resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. 

Construction
 in progress CIP is progress payments on uninstalled machinery and equipment
 or newly acquired fixed assets not yet placed in service. 

Repairs
 and replacement costs on the property and equipment are expensed in the period
 the cost is incurred.

Table

Goodwill
 and Intangible Assets Intangible
 assets consist primarily of goodwill, advertiser and subscriber relationships,
 mastheads, domain names and noncompetition agreements. Mastheads have an
 indefinite life and are not being amortized. In accordance with Statement
 of
 Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
 and Other Intangible Assets, the
 Company does not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
 Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
 lives, which generally range from three to 20 years. Other finite-lived
 intangible assets, noncompetition agreements and domain names, are amortized
 on
 a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements or their
 estimated useful lives. 

The
 Company is required to test its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
 assets
 (including mastheads) for impairment on an annual basis, which occurs on
 December 31st. Additionally, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
 assets are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs
 or
 circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
 below
 its carrying value. The Company has performed the required impairment tests
 of
 goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which resulted in no
 impairments. 

Impairment
 of long-lived assets In
 accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting
 for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, 
 long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed
 for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
 carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Any unrecoverable carrying
 amounts are adjusted to fair value and any impairment losses are reported
 in the
 period in which the recognition criteria are first applied, based on the
 undiscounted cash flows. Long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be
 disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair
 value
 less cost to sell. No impairment losses have been recognized since adoption
 of
 this standard on January 1, 2002. 

Income
 taxes The
 Company is a single member limited liability company and is not subject to
 income taxes. However, the Company s results are included in the consolidated
 federal income tax return of Shivers Trading Operating Company (Morris
 Communications' ultimate parent corporation). Tax provisions are settled
 through
 the intercompany account and Morris Communications makes income tax payments
 based on results of the Company. The Company and Morris Communications have
 entered into a formal tax sharing agreement, under which the Company is required
 to provide for its portion of income taxes. Under the terms of the agreement,
 the Company remits taxes for its current tax liability to Morris Communications.
 Accordingly, the Company recognizes an allocation of income taxes in its
 separate financial statements in accordance with the agreement. 

The
 Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of the liability method
 (SFAS 109- Accounting
 for Income Taxes ),
 which
 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future
 tax
 consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
 carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
 bases. The recognition of future tax benefits is required to the extent that
 realization of such benefits is more likely than not. 

Member s
 deficit Member s
 deficit includes the original investment in the Company by Morris
 Communications, accumulated income of the Company, and the distributions
 to and
 contributions from Morris Communications, including those arising from the
 forgiveness of the net intercompany receivables and payables between Morris
 Communications and the Company. Management of the Company and Morris
 Communications has agreed that all such intercompany amounts are deemed
 distributions and contributions. (See Note 9.) 

Reclassification
 of Loan Receivable from Morris Communications Prior
 to
 2005, the Company had reported the loan receivable from Morris Communications
 (see Note 9) as a long-term asset on the Company s balance sheets and had
 reported interest income related to the loan receivable in the statement
 of
 income. Based on the historical practice of the Company and Morris
 Communications in settling a significant portion of the outstanding loan
 receivable balance with dividends, the Company concluded that the arrangement
 should be considered in substance a capital distribution transaction and
 classified as contra-equity within member s deficiency in assets. In addition,
 interest accrued on this loan receivable has been reported as contra-equity
 within member s deficiency in assets for the periods ending December 31, 2006
 and 2005. 

As
 a
 result of this conclusion, the Company has classified the outstanding 23,153
 and 15,655 loan receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
 respectively, as part of member s deficit. The Company has also accrued 2,095
 and 1,484 in loan receivable interest on this loan receivable through December
 31, 2006 and 2005 as contra equity. 

The
 Company has not reversed the previously reported 2004 loan receivable interest
 income, as such amounts were considered immaterial. 

Due
 from Morris Communications Due
 from
 (to) Morris Communications represents a net short term receivable (payable)
 that
 resulted from operating activities between the Company and its
 Parent. 

Restricted
 Cash Held in Escrow Cash
 held in escrow was comprised of proceeds from the sale of the Company s former
 Savannah newspaper facility which the Company elected to be deposited into
 an
 escrow account in order to potentially fund other acquisitions by the Company
 or
 Parent through a tax-deferred Section 1031 exchange. The Parent acquired
 460
 and 5,280 in qualified replacement property during 2005 and 2006, respectively,
 with the reductions in the restricted escrow account being offset by an increase
 in loan receivable from Morris Communications. The remaining 1,500 in escrow
 became unrestricted to the Company on the March 27, 2006 expiration date
 for the
 tax-deferred exchange. 

Performance
 Unit Grants During
 2004, Morris Publishing executed the 2004 Morris Publishing Group Performance
 Unit Grant in order to grant 1,000,000 performance units to various senior
 executive and other business unit managers, effective as of January 1, 2004,
 under the terms of the Shivers Trading Operating Company (Morris
 Communications ultimate parent company) Performance Unit Plan, dated April 1,
 2004. The 2004 Performance Unit Grants expired on December 31, 2005, which
 was
 the final valuation date. Each unit was valued annually based on the net
 operating income of the consolidated newspaper business segment, adjusted
 for
 taxes and a 10 capital charge based on the average invested capital. The
 Company accrued 200 in employee bonus costs for the total value of the
 1,000,000 performance unit grants at the final December 31, 2005 valuation
 date,
 with payment commencing in 2007 and years thereafter. The performance unit
 grants had no value at the end of 2004. 

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers 
 Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
 Plans SFAS
 No. 158 ), an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No.
 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a retiree
 health plan in the statement of financial position, requires that changes
 in the
 funded status be recognized through comprehensive income, changes the
 measurement date for defined benefit plan assets and obligations to the entity s
 fiscal year-end and expands disclosures. The recognition and disclosures
 under
 SFAS No. 158 are required as of the end of the fiscal year ending after June
 15,
 2007, while the new measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending
 after
 December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158 requires that previously disclosed but
 unrecognized gains/losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations
 of a
 retiree health plan be recognized at adoption of SFAS No. 158 as a component
 of
 shareholder s equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
 applicable income taxes. 

The
 measurement date for the Company s retiree health plan obligations is currently
 the Company s fiscal year-end so
 a
 change in measurement date is not needed .
 Had
 SFAS No. 158 been adopted at December 31, 2006, the Company s accumulated other
 comprehensive income would have decreased by 1,016 and decreased member's
 deficit by
 1,016. 

In
 September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
 Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering
 the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
 Current Year Financial Statements SAB
 No. 108 ), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2006. This
 bulletin addresses the diversity in practice in quantifying financial
 misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of
 improper amounts on the balance sheet. The adoption of this SAB had no effect
 on
 the Company at December 31, 2006.

In
 July
 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation
 No. 48, Accounting
 for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN
 No. 48 ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Under
 FIN No. 48, companies are required to make explicit disclosures about
 uncertainties in their income tax positions, including a detailed roll forward
 of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition.
 Under FIN No. 48, the recognition of a tax benefit would only occur when
 it is
 more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained in a dispute with
 the taxing authority in the court of last resort. The Company is currently
 evaluating the impact upon of adoption of FIN 48. 

In
 March
 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting
 for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ,
 which
 clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as
 used in
 SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. A conditional
 asset
 retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an
 asset
 retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
 conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of
 the
 entity. Therefore, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the
 fair
 value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under SFAS No. 143 if
 the
 fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 permits,
 but
 does not require, restatement of interim financial information. The provisions
 of FIN 47 were effective for reporting periods ending after December 15,
 2005.

2. Acquisitions 

In
 July
 2006, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities
 of
 four weekly newspapers in Georgia and South Carolina from Community Newspapers,
 Inc. The newspapers acquired were The
 People-Sentinel (Barnwell,
 S.C.), The
 Hampton County 
 (S.C.)
 Guardian, The
 Citizen News 
 (Edgefield, S.C.) and the Sylvania 
 (Ga.)
 Telephone ,
 all of
 which are in or around the Augusta market area. The acquisition was accounted
 for as a purchase and had an aggregate purchase price, including closing
 costs,
 of approximately 4,405. The Company paid cash for the acquisition. 

The
 purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the estimated fair values
 of
 assets and liabilities acquired. The excess purchase price over the fair
 value
 of the tangible and intangible net assets was allocated to goodwill. The
 excess
 consideration over the 404 fair value of the tangible net assets was allocated
 to goodwill, subscriber lists and mastheads. Such allocation to goodwill,
 subscriber lists and mastheads ere 2,360, 1,421 and 220,
 respectively. 

The
 subscriber lists are being amortized, on a straight line basis, over a 15-year
 life. The mastheads, which are considered an indefinite-lived intangible
 asset
 and goodwill are not being amortized in accordance with SFAS No.
 142. 

In
 April
 2004, Morris Communications contributed the ownership of 
 Skirt Charleston magazine,
 a monthly free women s publication, to the Company. The transfer was recorded at
 the historical carrying amounts, which approximated 1,318 as of November
 2003,
 the date of the 
 Skirt Charleston 
 magazine
 acquisition by Morris Communications. The excess capital contribution over
 the
 138 fair value of the net assets was allocated with 788 allocated to goodwill
 and 392 allocated to subscriber and advertiser relations. The Company has
 subsequently launched new Skirt!
 publications
 in Augusta, Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, Charlotte,
 North
 Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina. 

In
 March
 2004, the Company acquired Capital
 City Weekly ,
 a
 weekly newspaper located in Juneau, Alaska. The purchase price was allocated
 to
 the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. The excess purchase
 price over the 52 fair value of the tangible net assets was allocated with
 472
 allocated to goodwill, 274 allocated to subscriber and advertiser relations,
 and 50 allocated to noncompetition agreements. The subscriber and advertiser
 relations are being amortized over a 15-year life and the noncompetition
 agreement over a 5-year life. 

The
 results of operations of each of these acquisitions have been recorded in
 the
 consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition. The pro
 forma
 effect on net income had the acquisitions been reflected as of the beginning
 of
 the year acquired and the previously reported year would not have been material.
 There were no basis adjustments for income tax purposes and all goodwill
 is
 expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 

3. Gain
 on sale of fixed assets 

During
 2006, the Company sold miscellaneous fixed assets for 150 resulting in a
 net
 pre-tax gain of 13. 

On
 September 28, 2005, the Company sold Savannah s former production facility to a
 third party. At closing, the Company received proceeds, net of closing costs,
 of
 7,170. This, net of 327 in clean up costs, gave the Company net proceeds
 from
 the sale of 6,843 resulting in a net pre-tax gain of 5,018. The Company
 elected to have the 7,170 in proceeds deposited into an escrow account in
 order
 to potentially fund other acquisitions by the Company or its Parent through
 a
 tax-deferred Section 1031 exchange. See Note 1. 

During
 2005 the Company also sold miscellaneous fixed assets for 113 which resulted
 in
 a gain of 70. Scrapped fixed assets totaled 278. 

In
 2004,
 the Company received a total of 1,315 in net proceeds from the sale of its
 Savannah warehouse and from the sale of other machinery and equipment. The
 net
 gain from these fixed asset sales totaled 758. Scrapped fixed assets totaled
 577.

5. Goodwill
 and other intangible assets 

Goodwill
 is the excess of cost over fair market value of tangible and intangible
 net
 assets acquired. Goodwill is not presently amortized but tested for impairment
 annually or when the facts or circumstances at any of the Company s reporting
 units indicate a possible impairment of goodwill as a result of a continual
 decline in performance or as a result of fundamental changes in a market
 in
 accordance with FAS No. 142, Goodwill
 and Other Intangible Assets .
 The
 estimated value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated is
 determined using the greater of the net present value of future cash flows
 and
 the market multiple approach. The carrying value of goodwill is considered
 impaired when the estimated value of the reporting unit is less than its
 carrying value. 

Other
 intangible assets acquired consist primarily of mastheads on various acquired
 properties, subscriber lists, as well as other assets. Other intangible
 assets
 acquired (mastheads and domain names) which have indefinite lives and are
 not
 currently amortized, are tested for impairment annually or when facts or
 circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the intangible assets as
 a
 result of a continual decline in performance or as a result of fundamental
 changes in a market. The fair value of the mastheads and domain names is
 determined using an income or market multiple approach. The asset is considered
 impaired when the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying
 value. 

Changes
 in the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets of the
 Company
 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as

6. Long
 term debt 

Original
 financing-2003: 

On
 August
 7, 2003, the Company refinanced substantially all of its long-term indebtedness
 by issuing 250 million of 7 senior subordinated notes Notes due 2013 and
 entering into a 400 million bank credit agreement 2003 Credit Agreement ). In
 September 2003, an additional 50 million of senior subordinated notes
 were
 issued. The loss incurred on the extinguishment of the prior debt was 5,957
 during 2003. The Company subsequently modified and replaced the 2003 Credit
 Agreement with a 2005 Credit Agreement with substantially similar terms
 and
 conditions. 

The
 Notes
 are due in 2013 with interest payments due February 1 and August 1, with
 the
 first payment being paid on February 1, 2004. 

-60- 

Table
 of
 Contents 

The
 300
 million in senior subordinated notes is subordinated to the rights of the
 lenders under the original and future senior credit facilities. In the
 event of
 a liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event of
 the
 company, the lenders of the senior debt must be paid in full for all obligations
 under the Credit Agreement (including interest accruing after the commencement
 of a bankruptcy proceeding), before any payment can be made to holders
 of the
 notes. The covenants of the Company s Credit Agreement prevent voluntary payment
 or prepayment of the senior subordinated notes, except for regularly scheduled
 payments of principal and interest. In addition, the covenants of the Credit
 Agreement require that all payments, including regularly scheduled interest
 payments, on the senior subordinated notes must be suspended in the event
 of a
 payment default on the senior credit facilities, or in the event the trustee
 of
 the notes indenture receives a Payment
 Blockage Notice 
 following any other default that would permit the senior lenders to accelerate
 the maturity of the senior debt. 

The
 indenture relating to the senior subordinated note
 limits the Company's ability to pay dividends to its parent, Morris
 Communications. See the discussion of this restrictive covenant in Note
 9,
 Transactions with Morris Communications. There are no restrictions in
 the 2005 Credit Agreement on the Company's ability to pay dividends to its
 parent, which is a guarantor of the debt under this senior credit
 facility. 

The
 bank
 credit agreement dated August 7, 2003, consisted of a Tranche B 225,000
 term
 loan and a 175,000 revolving credit line. The Tranche B principal payments
 were
 due each quarter com mencing
 December 31, 2004, through December 31, 2010, with the final payment to
 have
 been due March 31, 2011. The quarterly payments were 563 with final payment
 being 210,938. The revolving credit loan would have terminated September
 30,
 2010. Borrowings under the August 7, 2003 Credit Agreement bore interest
 at
 either the alternative base rate (ABR) or the Eurodollar rate, plus applicable
 margin as defined. The ABR was the greater of the federal funds rate plus
 0.5 
 or prime. The Eurodollar rate was the LIBOR rate. 

The
 2003
 Credit Agreement required, among other things, that the Company and Morris
 Communications on a consolidated basis (1) maintain a debt-to-cash flow
 ratio
 not to exceed 6.00 to 1 initially and adjusting downward periodically to
 5.50 to
 1 on September 30, 2006, and all times thereafter; (2) maintain a fixed
 charge
 coverage ratio greater than or equal to 1.05 to 1 initially and adjusting
 upward
 to 1.15 to 1 on March 31, 2006, and all times thereafter; (3) maintain
 an
 interest coverage ratio to be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1 initially
 and
 adjusting upward to 2.50 to 1 on September 30, 2005, and all times
 thereafter. 

Modification
 of original bank credit facility-2004: 

On
 July
 16, 2004, the Company realigned various aspects of its credit facility.
 The 225
 million Tranche B Term Loan Tranche B under the August 7, 2003 agreement was
 increased by 25 million and split into two pieces, a 100 million Tranche
 A
 Term Loan Tranche A and a 150 million Tranche C Term Loan Tranche C ). At
 the same time, the revolving credit line was reduced from 175 million
 to 150
 million. The total facility remained unchanged at 400 million. The immediate
 impact of the amendment was to reduce interest rates by 0.75 on the Tranche
 A
 and 0.50 on the Tranche C, below the rate on the Tranche B. The debt covenants
 generally remained unchanged. Scheduled principal payments changed with
 the
 replacement of the single term loan with the two term loans (Tranche A
 and
 Tranche C). The final payment on the Tranche A and the Tranche C loans
 were
 scheduled for September 30, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The
 revolving
 credit loan would have terminated September 30, 2010 and the commitment
 fee on
 the unborrowed amount available against the revolving credit line was
 0.5 . 

The
 575
 in loan origination fees associated with the modification of the credit
 facility
 were capitalized and would have been amortized along with the Tranche B
 loan s
 unamortized costs over the lives of the Tranche A and Tranche C loans in
 accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19, Debtor s
 Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments .
 The
 Company wrote off 209 in unamortized loan costs associated with the original
 revolving credit facility in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-14, Debtor s
 Accounting for Changes in Line-of Credit or Revolving-Debt
 Arrangements ,
 and was
 to amortize the remaining 1,256 over the term of the revolving credit
 loan.

Refinancing
 of bank credit facility-2005: 

On
 December 14, 2005, the Company, as borrower, entered into a Credit
 Agreement for 350 million of senior secured term and revolving credit
 facilities. The refinancing terminated and replaced the 400 million credit
 facilities. The new credit facilities consist of a 175 million Revolving
 Credit
 Facility and a 175 million Tranche A Term Loan. The maturity date for
 both
 facilities is September 30, 2012, with unequal quarterly principal payments
 on the Tranche A Term Loan commencing on December 31, 2007. 

The
 refinancing of the Tranche A and C Term Loans resulted in an exchange of
 debt
 instruments with substantially different terms, since the present value
 of the
 cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument were greater than
 10 
 different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the
 terms of
 the original debt instruments. Therefore, the transaction was accounted
 for as a
 debt extinguishment in accordance with the guidance outlined in EITF Issue
 No.
 96-19, Debtor s
 Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instrument ,
 and
 the unamortized costs associated with the prior Tranche A and C term loans
 were
 included in loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement
 of
 income. 

The
 refinancing of the 150 million Revolving Credit Commitment resulted in
 an
 increase in borrowing capacity and was accounted for in accordance with
 EITF
 Issue No. 98-14, Debtor s
 Accounting for Changes in Line of Credit or Revolving Debt
 Arrangements .
 Accordingly, unamortized deferred costs from the prior arrangement and
 the fees
 paid for the new credit facility were associated with the new arrangement
 and
 capitalized. 

The
 2,046 in fees incurred for the new credit facility were paid to different
 third
 parties and were not related to fees paid or received to extinguish the
 original
 debt instruments.

The
 facilities bear interest (i) at a spread above a base rate equal to the
 higher of (x) JPMorgan Chase Bank s prime lending rate or (y) the
 applicable federal funds rate plus 0.5 ABR ), or (ii) at a spread above
 the Eurodollar rate (LIBOR). The spread applicable to borrowings will be
 determined by reference to Morris Communications Company s consolidated trailing
 total debt to cash flow ratio. The spread applicable for ABR borrowings will
 range from 0 to 0.25 . The spread applicable for Eurodollar rate borrowings
 will range from 0.675 to 1.25 . A commitment fee on unborrowed funds available
 under the revolver ranges from 0.250 to 0.375 . 

The
 loans
 are guaranteed by Morris Communications Company, LLC, and substantially all
 of
 its subsidiaries. The obligations of Morris Publishing and these guarantors
 are
 secured with substantially all of the assets of the parties, with certain
 exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains various representations, warranties
 and covenants generally consistent with the old credit facilities. Financial
 covenants require Morris Publishing to meet certain financial tests on an
 on-going basis, including minimum interest coverage ratio, minimum fixed
 charge
 coverage ratio, and maximum cash flow ratios, based upon consolidated financial
 results of Morris Communications and substantially all of its subsidiaries
 (including Morris Publishing).

8. Member s
 deficiency in assets 

 Member s
 deficiency in assets includes the original investment in the Company by Morris
 Communications, accumulated income of the Company, and the cash and property
 distributions to and cash and property contributions from Morris Communications,
 including those arising from the forgiveness of the net intercompany receivables
 and payables between Morris Communications and the Company from transactions
 described in Note 9. 

Based
 on
 the Company s practice of settling a significant portion of the outstanding loan
 receivable balances with dividends, the Company in 2006 and 2005 classified
 the
 intercompany loan due from Morris Communications and the interest accrued
 and
 paid in 2006 and 2005 on the loan as contra equity in member s deficit. (See
 Note 9) 

The
 Company has not reversed the previously reported 2004 loan receivable interest
 income, as such amounts were considered immaterial.

9. Transactions
 with Morris Communications 

Management,
 Technology and Shared Services Fees The
 Company receives certain services from, and has entered into certain
 transactions with, the Parent. 

Management
 Fee This
 fee
 compensates Morris Communications for corporate services and costs incurred
 on
 behalf of the Company, including executive, legal, secretarial, tax, internal
 audit, risk management, employee benefit administration, airplane usage
 and
 other support services. A fee equal to the greater of 4.0 of the Company s
 annual total operating revenues or the amount of actual expenses allocable
 to
 the management of the Company s business by Morris Communications (such
 allocations to be based upon time and resources spent on the management
 of our
 business by Morris Communications) is charged to the Company. 

These
 management fees totaled 19,013, 18,604, and 18,230 for the years ended
 December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has recorded
 this
 management fee within other operating costs in the accompanying consolidated
 financial statements. 

Technology
 and Shared Services Fee This
 fee
 compensates Morris Communications for certain technology and shared services.
 During 2004, these fees were based on actual costs of technology and shared
 services related costs from MStar, a subsidiary of Morris Communications,
 as
 defined in the services agreement. In the first 

quarter
 2005, the services agreement was amended, retroactive to January 1, 2005,
 allocating the costs based on the lesser of 2.5 of the Company s total net
 operating revenue or the actual technology costs allocated to Morris Publishing
 based upon usage. 

The
 technology and shared services fees paid to Morris Communications totaled
 11,883, 11,628, and 12,542, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
 and
 2004, respectively. The Company has recorded this services fee within other
 operating costs in the accompanying consolidated financial
 statements. 

The
 Company believes that these fee allocations were made on a reasonable basis,
 and
 approximate all of the material incremental costs it would have incurred
 had it
 been operating on a stand-alone basis; however, there has been no independent
 study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what
 costs
 of obtaining such services from third parties would have been. 

Employees 
 401(k) Plan The
 Company participates in Morris Communications 401(k) plan. Under this plan,
 contributions by employees to the 401(k) plan are matched (up to 5 of
 pay) by
 Morris Communications. Expenses were allocated to the Company based on
 specific
 identification of employer matching contributions of 4,275, 4,183, and
 4,265
 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Retiree
 Health Care Benefits The
 Company participates in Morris Communications retiree health care plan, which
 provides certain health care benefits for eligible retired employees and
 their
 dependents. The plan requires the Company to be separately liable for its
 portion of the postretirement health benefit obligation. Accordingly, the
 Company and Morris Communications have completed a formal actuarial valuation
 of
 the postretirement obligation for the Company as of December 31, 2006 and
 2005,
 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
 2006. 

Under
 Morris Communications plan, full-time employees who were hired before January
 1, 1992 and retire after ten years of service are eligible for these benefits.
 Full-time employees hired on or after January 1, 1992 must have 25 years
 of
 service to be eligible. Generally, this plan pays a percentage of most
 medical
 expenses (reduced for any deductible) after payments made by government
 programs
 and other group coverage. This plan is unfunded. Lifetime benefits under
 the
 plan are limited to 100 per employee. Expenses related to this plan have
 been
 allocated to the Company based on total headcount. The expenses allocated
 to the
 Company, net of the related contributions recorded were 2,008, 1,624,
 and
 2,767 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. 

The
 Company was also allocated its portion of the postretirement benefit obligation.
 The amounts allocated to the Company, based on total headcount, were 25,948
 and
 23,939 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

The
 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
 provided
 a federal subsidy which began in 2006 to postretirement medical plans that
 provide prescription drug benefits to retirees. The subsidy provides plan
 sponsors 28 of individual retirees annual prescription drug costs (in dollars)
 between 250 and 5,000 for retirees who are eligible for but opt out of
 Medicare Part D Prescription coverage. 

This
 subsidy, when integrated with current claim costs, had the effect of
 decreasing
 liabilities and costs reported under the current accounting guidance
 for plans
 that were at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit.
 At the
 end of 2005, the Company s actuary determined that the Company s plan was at
 least actuarially equivalent to Medicare D. 
 The
 amount of the subsidy has been estimated at 600 per eligible retiree
 and
 beneficiary. 
 The
 Company has reflected the effect of this subsidy in the accompanying
 financial
 statements for 2006 and 2005.

The
 principal assumptions used in determining postretirement benefit obligations
 for
 the Company s plan as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 

2006 

2005 

Discount
 rate 

5.75 

5.50 

Health
 care cost increase rate:

11.00 

12.00 

Decreasing
 to at the end of 2012 

5.00 

5.00 

As
 an
 indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend
 rate by
 1 in 2006 would have increased the benefit obligation as of December 31,
 2006,
 by 2,019 and the aggregate of benefits earned and interest components
 of 2006
 net postretirement benefit expense by 185. Decreasing the assumed health
 care
 cost trend rate by 1 in 2006 would have decreased the benefit obligation
 as of
 December 31, 2006 by 1,915 and the aggregate of benefits earned and interest
 components of 2006 net postretirement benefit expense by
 175.

Health
 and Disability Plan The
 Company has participated in Morris Communications health and disability plan
 for active employees. Accordingly, Morris Communications has allocated to
 the
 Company certain expenses associated with the payment of current obligations
 and
 the estimated amounts incurred but not reported. The expense allocated to
 the
 Company, based on total headcount, was 10,241, 12,938, and 14,357 for
 the
 years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

-65- 

Table
 of Contents 

The
 Company was also allocated its portion of the health and disability obligation.
 The amounts allocated to the Company, based on total headcount, was 2,076,
 3,108 and 2,611 as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. 

Workers 
 Compensation Expense The
 Company has participated in Morris Communications workers compensation
 self-insurance plan. Accordingly, Morris Communications has allocated to
 the
 Company certain expenses associated with the payment of current obligations
 and
 the estimated amounts incurred but not reported. The expenses allocated
 to the
 Company, based on a percentage of total salaries expense, was 2,801, 2,892
 and
 2,864 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. 

Loan
 Receivable from and restricted payments to Morris Communications

Loan
 receivable: 

Under
 its
 notes indenture, the Company is permitted to loan up to 40 million at
 any one
 time to Morris Communications or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries outside
 the Publishing Group, solely for purposes of funding its working capital,
 capital expenditures and acquisition requirements. The Company is also
 permitted
 to invest in or lend an additional 20 million at any one time outstanding
 to
 Morris Communications or any other Person(s), as defined in the debt
 indenture. 

The
 interest-bearing portion of all loans from the Company to Morris Communications
 bears the same rate as the borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Company
 distinguishes between intercompany transactions incurred in the ordinary
 course
 of business and settled on a monthly basis (which do not bear interest)
 and
 those of a more long-term nature that are subject to an interest accrual.
 Interest is accrued on the average outstanding long-term balance each month.
 For
 2006 this interest rate was as follows: 

January
 to November 

LIBOR
 + 

1.000 

December

LIBOR
 + 

0.875 

The
 amount outstanding on the intercompany loan due from Morris Communications
 was
 23,153 and 15,655 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
 interest
 accrued on the loans to Morris Communications for the 12 months ended December
 31, 2006 and 2005 and the five months ended December 31, 2004 was 2,095,
 1,484, and 1,200, respectively, on average loan balances of 33.9 million,
 23.7 million, and 27.5 million, respectively. The average annual interest
 rates were 6.089 , 5.620 , and 3.724 for the 12 month periods ended December
 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

During
 2005, the Company concluded that the arrangement should be considered in
 substance a capital distribution transaction and classified as contra-equity
 within member s deficiency in assets, given the historical practice of Morris
 Publishing and Morris Communications settling a significant portion of
 the
 outstanding loan receivable balance with a dividend. In addition, interest
 accrued on this loan receivable has been reported as contra-equity within
 member s deficiency in assets for the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
 (See Note 1) 

Restricted
 payments: 

The
 Company is permitted under its notes indenture to make restricted payments,
 which includes dividends and loans to affiliates in excess of the permitted
 limits described above, up to the sum of (1) 100 of the Company s cumulative
 consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
 Consolidated EBITDA , as defined in the indenture) earned subsequent to the
 debt s August 2003 issue date less (2) 140 of the consolidated interest expense
 of the Company for such period. 

On
 March
 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, the Company declared and recorded 15
 million
 and 28 million in dividends, respectively, to Morris Communications

In
 December 2005, the Company declared and distributed a 1,811 property dividend
 of certain land unrelated to its business operations in Alaska and Augusta,
 Georgia to Morris Communications. 

On
 August
 31, 2004, the Company declared and paid a 50 million cash dividend to
 Morris
 Communications. 

Morris
 Communications utilized all of these dividend distributions to reduce its
 loan
 receivable from Morris Publishing. 

At
 December 31, 2006, the Company had an additional 98.0 million available
 for
 future restricted payments under the credit indenture.

Leases
 In
 December 2002, the Company sold its recently completed facility in Savannah,
 Georgia to an affiliated party and entered into a 10-year operating lease
 expiring on December 31, 2012. The Company is required to make equal monthly
 payments of 92 beginning January 1, 2003, and continuing on the first
 date of
 each subsequent year during the term of this lease. Beginning on January
 1, 2004
 and January 1 of each subsequent year during the lease term the annual
 base rent
 shall increase by the lesser of (i) four percent, or (ii) the percentage
 increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar
 year. 

On
 February 21, 2005, Morris Publishing Group entered into an amendment with
 respect to its existing lease on the Savannah newspaper facilities in order
 to
 take additional space in the administration building, which was recently
 constructed by the current lessor and is adjacent to the other production
 facilities currently leased. The annual base rent for the 78,000 square
 foot
 administration building shall be 980 or a monthly rate of 82. The lease
 was
 effective as of November 1, 2004 and expires December 31, 2012, concurrent
 with
 the termination of the lease of the remainder of the facilities. Beginning
 on
 January 1, 2006 and January 1 of each subsequent year during the lease
 term the
 annual base rent shall increase by the lesser of (i) three percent, or
 (ii) the
 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar
 year.
 The lessor is an entity indirectly primarily owned by three of Morris Publishing
 Group s directors, William S. Morris IV, J. Tyler Morris and Susie M.
 Baker. 

The
 Company leases certain buildings, data processing and transportation equipment
 under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring on various dates
 through
 December 2012. Aggregate future minimum lease payments for the next 5 years
 under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2006 are as
 follows:

Litigation
 and Claims The
 Company is the defendant or plaintiff in lawsuits related to normal business
 operations. In management s opinion, the outcome of these matters will not have
 a material effect on the Company s operations or financial
 position. 

Environmental
 Matters The
 nature of the Company s operations exposes it to certain risks of liabilities
 and claims with respect to environmental matters. The Company does not
 believe
 that environmental compliance requirements are likely to have a material
 effect
 on it. The Company cannot predict what additional environmental legislation
 or
 regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws
 or
 regulations will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future
 expenditures that may be required in order to comply with these laws.
 There can
 be no assurance that future environmental compliance obligations or discovery
 of
 new conditions will not arise in connection with the Company s operations or
 facilities and that these would not have a material adverse effect on
 the
 Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Compensation
 Discussion and Analysis 

Overview 

Management
 Agreement 

Most
 of
 our executive officers, including our principal executive officer and principal
 financial officer, do not receive any part of their compensation from us.
 Their
 services are provided to us by our parent, Morris Communications, under
 our
 management agreement, pursuant to which we generally pay 4 of our total
 operating revenues to Morris Communications for corporate services and
 costs
 incurred on our behalf, including executive, legal, secretarial, tax, internal
 audit, risk management, employee benefit administration, airplane usage
 and
 other support services. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,
 and Director Independence. 

Our
 executive officers whose services are provided to us through the management
 agreement are: 

William
 S. Morris III, Chairman of the Board of Directors, 

 William
 S. Morris IV, President and CEO, 

 Craig
 S. Mitchell, Senior Vice President - Finance, Secretary and Treasurer,
 and 

 Steve
 K. Stone, Senior Vice President - CFO. 

Each
 of
 these executive officers also serves in executive officer capacities for
 some or
 all of our parent, Morris Communications, its ultimate parent, Shivers
 Trading
 Operating Company, and their other subsidiaries. 

Executive
 Vice Presidents 

Our
 only
 other executive officers are our two Executive Vice Presidents ('EVPs")
 charged
 with the operations of our newspaper business and are our only executive
 officers paid by us. Thus, the remainder of this Compensation Discussion
 and Analysis will focus on the compensation of these two
 EVPs. 

Our
 primary business financial objective is to provide a stable stream of income
 to
 our member through increases in distributable cash flow. To do so, we seek
 to
 enhance the return from, and the value of, our existing newspapers and
 other
 publications, and any additional publications we may acquire, develop or
 invest
 in. In turn, the purpose of our executive compensation program for our
 two EVPs
 has been and is to achieve our primary objectives by retaining and motivating
 these talented executives by providing incentives and economic security.
 More
 specifically, our compensation program for these EVPs is designed to reward
 favorable increases in distributable cash flow, both in absolute amount
 and
 relative to our peers, taking into consideration our competitive position
 within
 the newspaper industry and each executive s long-term career contributions to
 the company. The goal is to align the interests of our EVPs with our primary
 objectives. 

We
 and
 our parent are privately held by the Morris family and, accordingly, do
 not
 provide any stock options, grants or equity based compensation of any kind.
 Substantially all of our EVPs compensation is in the form of cash payments, the
 largest portion of which is current cash compensation through base salary.
 We
 have also rewarded long term performance and encouraged continued employment
 through a non-qualified deferred compensation agreement in which the employee
 would become vested in additional compensation amounts over several years
 of
 service, and which amounts may become forfeitable upon improper competition
 with
 our newspapers. Annual base salaries, cash bonuses and any additional deferred
 compensation amounts are set based upon individual performance, the performance
 of the newspapers, for which they are responsible, and the criteria and
 goals
 described above. We seek to provide overall compensation to the EVPs that
 is
 competitive with total compensation paid by other newspaper companies similar
 to
 us, either by size or by industry. 

The
 annual cash incentive bonus for a fiscal year is typically paid in the
 first
 quarter of the fiscal year following such fiscal year, when financial statements
 for such fiscal year become available for both the Company and other
 publicly-traded newspaper companies. For example, the Company paid the
 two
 executive vice presidents their 2006 cash incentive bonus in March
 2007. 

EVP
 compensation for 2006 primarily consisted of (i) annual cash base salary,
 and
 (ii) annual cash incentive bonus. Compensation in 2006 also included benefits
 and other perquisites, such as 401(k) plan matching, payment of health and
 welfare plan premiums, employer contributions and earnings under Morris
 Communications deferred compensation plan and imputed income for use of
 company
 vehicle. Our EVPs (and certain other employees) may elect to defer a portion
 of
 their salary under our Elective Deferred Compensation Plan, pursuant to
 which we
 will credit an employee with earnings on deferred amounts until they become
 payable in the future. 

For
 Mr.
 Cannon, a significant part of his compensation consisted of the annual
 200,000
 credit to his non-qualified deferred compensation account pursuant to his
 1999
 Deferred Compensation Agreement, plus credit for over 230,000 of deemed
 earnings on this account. Mr. Cannon will not be fully vested in this account
 until age 65, or upon his earlier death or disability. This Deferred
 Compensation Agreement credits his account with 200,000 per year during
 his
 employment for up to 10 years and was designed to reward Mr. Cannon for
 over 30
 years of service to Morris and to retain Mr. Cannon s services and loyalty until
 his retirement. 

Our
 Board
 of Directors does not maintain a compensation committee, and the functions
 of a
 compensation committee are performed by our Chairman and our Chief Executive
 Officer. The Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer make the decisions
 each
 year regarding executive compensation, including annual base salaries,
 bonus
 awards and performance unit grants. With respect to our two EVPs, the Chairman
 and the Chief Executive Officer set each Executive Officer s base salary and
 cash bonus based on criteria previously described. They do not base their
 decisions on any income, revenue, cash flow or other financial targets,
 or any
 other pre-determined formulae. For 2006, they determined the base salary
 amounts
 and bonuses for each of these two EVPs based on their assessment of each
 officer s individual performance and current level of compensation.

The
 Morris family, including William S. Morris III, our Chairman, and his son,
 William S. Morris IV, our President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially
 own all of the equity interests in Morris Communications, our parent company.
 By
 virtue of such equity ownership, the Morris family has the sole power to
 determine the outcome of any company matter or transaction, including
 compensation matters.

Components
 and Criteria of Executive Vice President Compensation 

Fiscal
 year 2006 compensation 

Base
 salary. 
 For
 2006, the base salary of each of our EVPs was based on the review of our
 chairman and chief executive officer and the following: 

An
 assessment of the scope of the EVP s responsibilities and
 leadership; 

The
 EVP s expertise and experience within the
 industry 

The
 competitive market compensation paid to executive officers in similar
 positions at public newspapers that are our peers, both by industry
 segment (newspaper publishing) and size (enterprise
 value). 

Our
 overall financial and business performance, and

The
 EVP s contributions to the company. 

The
 2006
 annual base salaries for the EVPs are provided in the Summary Compensation
 Table further below. 

Annual
 Cash Incentive Bonus. 
 The
 annual cash incentive bonus program is intended to compensate our EVPs for
 achieving our annual financial goals at both the company and individual
 newspaper levels, as well as implementing long-term plans and strategies.
 The
 annual cash incentive bonus program is based on performance and responsibility
 level rather than on the basis of seniority, tenure or other entitlement.
 This
 performance-based program encourages our officers to continually improve
 their
 capabilities to deliver short- and long-term business results. The annual
 cash
 incentive bonuses are set so that they are competitive with bonuses paid
 to
 executive officers in similar positions and with similar responsibilities
 at
 companies in our peer group. 

We
 emphasize the importance of incentive cash compensation as a component of
 total
 compensation for the EVPs. This component of our compensation program is
 an
 investment in high quality, successful employees who can improve the operational
 performance of the existing assets and generate new business opportunities
 and
 investments that create value for our member. 

Performance
 Unit Grants. In
 2004,
 we issued performance units to the EVPs and various other business unit managers
 under the terms of various Shivers Trading Operating Company (Morris
 Communications ultimate parent company) Performance Unit Plans. These
 performance units were intended to compensate the Company s senior executives
 and other business unit managers for achieving our annual financial goals
 at the
 corporate level. Each unit typically was valued annually based on the increase
 in net operating income of the consolidated newspaper segment, adjusted for
 taxes and a capital charge based on the average invested capital. These
 performance units were valued at the end of 2005 and each of our two EVPs
 will
 receive cash payments totaling 17,600 for their units. These payments were
 deferred, with the first payments being made in 2007. We did not choose to
 issue
 new units for 2006 or beyond, instead emphasizing the other components of
 compensation. 

Retirement
 Plans. In
 order
 to attract and retain key executive talent, we believe that it is important
 to
 provide the EVPs with retirement benefits, including benefits that are in
 addition to those generally provided to its employees. 

401(k)
 Plan- -
 The
 EVPs may defer specified portions of their compensation under the 401(k)
 plan
 generally available to all of our employees. The Company makes a matching
 contribution of 100 up to the first 5 of base salary (up to an annual
 compensation limit prescribed by law) on behalf of each EVP under the 401(k)
 Plan. The Company provides this match to all eligible employees to encourage
 participation and to provide a competitive retirement benefit. 

Elective
 Deferred Compensation Plan -
 We
 permit the EVPs to elect to defer a portion of their salaries under our Elective
 Deferred Compensation Plan, pursuant to which we will credit an employee
 with
 earnings on deferred amounts until they become payable in the future. Neither
 EVP elected to defer any portion of his 2006 salary under this Plan, but
 Mr.
 Currow was credited with earnings on his prior deferral amounts. 

Cannon
 non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan -
 In
 2006, we continued crediting Mr. Cannon s non-qualified unfunded deferred
 compensation account with a new annual 200,000 accrual, plus deemed earnings
 on
 all amounts deferred under the plan since 1999, in accordance with the terms
 of
 the plan. 

Postretirement
 Benefit Plan- Our
 EVPs
 may participate in our retiree health care plan, which provides certain health
 care benefits for eligible retired employees and their dependents. Full-time
 employees who were hired before January 1, 1992 (such as Mr. Cannon) and
 retire
 after ten years of service are eligible for these benefits. Full-time employees
 hired on or after January 1, 1992 (such as Mr. Currow) must have 25 years
 of
 service to be eligible. Generally, this plan pays a percentage of most medical
 expenses (reduced for any deductible) after payments made by government programs
 and other group coverage. This plan is unfunded. Lifetime benefits under
 the
 plan are limited to 100,000 per employee.

 may forfeit a portion of his non-qualified deferred compensation account if
 he

 from us,
 they were not involved in setting their own compensation from us. 

During
 2006, there was no interlocking relationship between our Board of Directors
 and
 the board of directors or compensation committee of any other
 company.

 13 --Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and
 Director Independence 

Certain
 Relationships and Related Transactions. Various entities which are
 affiliated with Morris Communications and the Morris family have engaged,
 and
 will in the future engage, in transactions with us some of which may be
 viewed,
 from the perspective of a note holder of Morris Publishing, as disadvantageous
 to us or an inappropriate use of our resources. 

These
 transactions may not necessarily be consummated on an arm s-length basis and
 therefore may not be as favorable to us as those that could be negotiated
 with
 non-affiliated third parties. 

We
 receive certain services from, and have entered into certain transactions
 with,
 Morris Communications. Costs of the services that have been allocated to
 us are
 based on actual direct costs incurred or on Morris Communications estimate of
 the proportion of expenses incurred by Morris Communications that related
 to the
 services provided to us. Morris Communications made the allocations based
 on
 usage or other factors such as percentage of revenues, number of employees
 and
 other applicable factors in estimating the proportion of corporate expenses
 to
 allocate to us. We believe that these allocations have been made on a reasonable
 basis, and approximate all of the material incremental costs we would have
 incurred had we been operating on a stand-alone basis; however, there has
 been
 no independent study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties
 to
 determine what the costs of obtaining such services from third parties
 would
 have been. The management fee and the technology and shared services fee
 aggregated 30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004; 30.2 million
 for
 the year ended December 31, 2005 and 30.9 million for the year ended December
 31, 2006. These fees do not include other transactions or shared expenses
 between Morris Publishing, on the one hand, and Morris Communications and
 its
 other subsidiaries, on the other hand, including cash management, employer
 401(k) contributions, workers compensation expense and intercompany borrowings.
 See Notes 1 and 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for December
 31,
 2006, 2005 and 2004. 

We
 will
 continue to be managed by Morris Communications pursuant to a management
 agreement and as compensation for these services, Morris Communications
 will be
 entitled to receive annual management fees (payable monthly) equal to the
 greater of 4.0 of our annual total operating revenues or the amount of
 actual
 expenses allocable to the management of our business by Morris Communications
 (such allocations to be based upon time and resources spent on the management
 of
 our business by Morris Communications). These corporate allocation expenses
 totaled 19.0 million; 18.6 million and 18.2 million for the years ended
 December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and were based on 4 of
 annual
 total net operating revenues. 

In
 addition, as part of the initiatives to move to a shared services concept,
 our
 parent created MStar Solutions, LLC, an organization that provides savings
 and
 cost efficiencies by leveraging purchasing power; centralizing, standardizing
 and simplifying back office and administrative procedures; creating and
 implementing an advanced business platform, and leveraging the technology
 platform. During 2004, we paid our allocable share (based upon usage) of
 the
 actual costs of operations of MStar Solutions. In the first quarter 2005,
 the
 services agreement was amended, retroactive to January 1, 2005, allocating
 the
 costs based on the lesser of 2.5 of our total net operating revenue or
 the
 actual technology costs allocated to Morris Publishing based upon usage.
 These
 technology and shared services expenses allocated by Morris Communications
 to
 the Company totaled 11.9 million, 11.6 million and 12.5 million for
 the years
 ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In 2005 and 2006,
 these
 fees were based on 2.5 of annual total net operating revenues. 

In
 addition to the management services, we may share other miscellaneous facilities
 and costs with Morris Communications and its other subsidiaries. Shared
 costs
 may include joint promotions or the use of facilities, equipment, supplies
 or
 employees of one division for the benefit of an affiliate and Morris
 Communications will allocate the costs among the various entities. Shared
 facilities include the home office complex of buildings in Augusta, Georgia,
 which we own for use of The
 Augusta Chronicle, 
 but
 which is also used as the home office and principal place of business of
 Morris Communications. 

In
 December 2002, we sold our then recently completed facility in Savannah,
 Georgia
 to an affiliated party and entered into a 10-year operating lease expiring
 on
 December 31, 2012. We are required to make equal monthly payments of 92,000
 beginning January 1, 2003, and continuing on the first date of each subsequent
 month during the term of this lease. Beginning on January 1, 2004 and January
 1
 of each subsequent year during the lease term the annual base rent shall
 increase by the lesser of (i) four percent, and (ii) the percentage
 increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar
 year. 

On
 February 21, 2005, Morris Publishing Group entered into an amendment with
 respect to its lease on the Savannah newspaper facilities in order to take
 additional space in the administration building, which was recently constructed
 by the current lessor and is adjacent to the other production facilities
 currently leased. The annual base rent for the 78,000 square foot administration
 building is 980,000 or a monthly rate of 81,666.67. The lease was effective
 as
 of November 1, 2004 and expires December 31, 2012, concurrent with the
 termination of the lease of the remainder of the facilities. The lessor
 is an
 entity indirectly owned primarily by three of Morris Publishing Group s
 directors, William S. Morris IV, J. Tyler Morris and Susie M.
 Baker. 

In
 the
 ordinary course of our business, we may sell goods and services to affiliates,
 including newspaper advertising, and we may purchase goods and services
 from
 affiliates, such as radio or outdoor advertising and promotions or space
 in
 hotels owned by affiliates. 

We
 participate in a tax sharing agreement with our affiliates whereby we are
 required to pay to our parent an amount equal to the taxes we would have
 been
 required to pay as a separate corporation. We are a single member limited
 liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and
 are
 part of the consolidated tax return of our ultimate parent corporation
 and its
 subsidiaries. We may become jointly and severally liable for all income
 tax
 liability of the group in the event other subsidiaries are unable to pay
 the
 taxes attributable to their operations. 

On
 September 28, 2005, the Company sold Savannah s former production facility to a
 third party for 6.4 million, net of closing and environment remediation
 costs,
 resulting in a net pre-tax gain of 5.0 million. The Company elected to
 have the
 proceeds deposited into an escrow account in order to potentially fund
 other
 acquisitions by the Company or its Parent through a tax-deferred Section
 1031
 exchange. 

Director
 Independence. We have no independent directors and no independent
 members of audit or other committees. Five of the six members of our board
 of
 directors are members of the Morris family, and the sixth member is Craig.
 S.
 Mitchell, an executive officer for us, Morris Communications, and Shivers
 Trading Operating Company, our ultimate parent. Mr. Mitchell serves at the
 pleasure of the Morris family. A member of the Morris family serves as
 our chief
 executive officer. 

Our
 audit committee consists of three executive
 officers, William S. Morris IV, our principal executive officer, Craig S.
 Mitchell, our Senior Vice President-Finance, and Steve K. Stone, our principal
 financial officer. 

Approval
 of Transactions with Related
 Persons. Our senior credit facility and our notes indenture contain
 restrictions on transactions with related persons, and generally require
 that
 any new transactions be at least as advantageous to us as we would obtain
 in a
 transaction with an unrelated person. Other than these contractual agreements,
 we have no written policies or procedures for the review, approval or
 ratification of transactions with related persons. Any such transactions
 would
 be approved by our chairman, William S. Morris III, our president, William
 S.
 Morris IV, or by our board of directors. Since we have no independent directors,
 we would not obtain approval from disinterested directors.

 rendered by Deloitte Touche, LLP in connection with tax compliance, tax
 advice, and tax planning in 2006 and 2005 were approximately 41,500 and

 benefit plans covering our corporate parent s employees, including our

 services rendered by Deloitte Touche, LLP in connection with its employee
 benefit plans in 2006 and 2005 were approximately 16,500 and 16,000,

 2005, we established an audit committee to perform all functions with respect
 to
 our audit under sections 204 and 301 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The audit
 committee has no independent representation and consists of William S.
 Morris
 IV, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and Craig S. Mitchell and Steve K.
 Stone, both Senior Vice Presidents of the Parent. 

In
 2005
 and 2006, the audit committee had no pre-approval policies and procedures
 described in paragraph(c) (7) (i) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
 S-X.
