OVERVIEW 

 Essex
Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating Partnership acquires, develops, redevelops and
manages apartment communities in selected residential areas located primarily in
the West Coast of the United States and effectively holds the assets and
liabilities and conducts the operating activities of Essex Property Trust, Inc. Essex or the Company ). The Company is a Maryland corporation that operates
as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust REIT and is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December
31, 2007 owns a 90.9 general partnership interest. In this
report, the terms we, us and our refer to Essex Property Trust, its
Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership s subsidiaries. 

The
Company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994 as the Company completed an
initial public offering on June 13, 1994. In order to maintain
compliance with REIT tax rules, the Operating Partnership utilizes taxable REIT
subsidiaries for various revenue generating or investment activities. Each of
the taxable REIT subsidiary entities are consolidated by the Operating
Partnership. 

We are
engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition,
development and redevelopment of real estate. The majority of our
real estate consists of apartment communities. As of December 31,
2007, we owned or held an interest in 134 apartment communities, aggregating
27,489 units, located predominantly along the West Coast (collectively, the
 Properties , and individually, a Property ). Our other properties included six
office buildings (totaling approximately 478,040 square feet) two recreational
vehicle parks (totaling 338 spaces), and one manufactured housing community
(containing 157 sites). We currently have six development projects with 1,079
units in various stages of active development (together with the Properties, the
 Portfolio ). 

The
Operating Partnership s and the Company s website address is http://www.essexpropertytrust.com . The
Company s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, and the Proxy Statement
for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders are available, free of charge, on our
website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC ). 

BUSINESS
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES 

The
following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies in regards
to real estate investment and management. One or more of these
criteria may be amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder
vote. 

Business
Objectives 

Our
primary business objectives are to increase unitholders value by investing in
properties located in supply constrained markets, and by improving operating
results and the value of our Properties, while maintaining a strong balance
sheet. We intend to achieve these objectives by: 

Maximizing
 property income by maintaining a high level of occupancy while increasing
 rental income; 

Expanding
 our Portfolio through acquisitions, development and, when appropriate,
 redevelopment of apartment communities in selected major
 metropolitan areas; 

Optimizing
 financial performance through a portfolio asset allocation program, and to
 increase or decrease investments in a market based on projected changes in
 regional economic and local market conditions;
 and 

Maintaining
 a strong balance sheet by identifying and utilizing capital resources that
 provide positive leverage (i.e. investment yield that exceeds capital
 cost). 

We cannot
assure our unitholders that we will achieve our business
objectives. 

1 

Business
Strategies 

Research Driven
Approach We
believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth
begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge.
Utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last two
decades, we continually assess markets where we currently operate, as well as
markets where we consider future investment opportunities by
evaluating: 

Markets
 in major metropolitan areas that have regional population primarily in
 excess of one million, thereby creating liquidity, which is an
 important element when modifying the geographic concentration of the
 Operating Partnership s portfolio in response to changing market
 conditions; 

Constraints
 on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites
 where competing housing could be built; (ii) political growth barriers,
 such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and
 expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to
 development, such as mountains or
waterways; 

Rental
 demand is enhanced by affordability of rents compared to expensive
 for-sale housing; and 

Housing
 demand that is based on proximity to jobs, high quality of life and
 related commuting factors, as well as potential job
 growth. 

Recognizing
that all real estate markets are cyclical, we regularly evaluate the results of
our regional economic, as well as, our local market research and adjust the
geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly. We seek to increase our portfolio
allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to
decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
conditions. Likewise, the Operating Partnership also seeks to increase its
portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to
decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low
relative yields. 

Property
Operations We manage our Properties by focusing on strategies that will
generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and
long-term asset appreciation. We intend to achieve this by utilizing the
strategies set forth below: 

Property Management 
 The Chief
 Operating Officer, Divisional Managers, Regional Portfolio Managers and
 Area Managers are accountable for the performance and maintenance of the
 Properties. They supervise, provide training for the on-site managers,
 manage budgeted expectations against performance, monitor market trends
 and prepare operating and capital
budgets. 

Capital Preservation 
 The Capital and Maintenance department is responsible for the planning,
 budgeting and completion of major deferred maintenance and capital
 improvement projects at our
Properties. 

Business Planning and Control
 Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with
 every investment decision. These plans include benchmarks for
 future financial performance, based on collaborative discussions between
 on-site managers and senior
management. 

Development and Redevelopment - We focus on acquiring and developing apartment
 communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping our existing
 communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of our
 communities. 

CURRENT
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 

 Acquisitions 

Acquisitions
have been a significant growth component of our business. During 2007, we
completed a series of acquisitions that added to our overall
Portfolio. 

Southern
California 

In
 March 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired two adjacent apartment
 communities aggregating 108 units located in Santa Barbara, California for
 approximately 21.2 million. Lucero Village, built in 1973, consists of
 70-units and The Continental, built in 1965, consists of
 38-units. 

In
 April 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Cardiff by the Sea
 Apartments located in Cardiff, California for 72.0 million. The
 community, which is in Northern San Diego County, consists of 300-units
 and was built in 1986. 

In
 May 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Coldwater Canyon apartments
 for 8.3 million. Built in 1979, the property consists of
 39-units located in Studio City,
California. 

2 

Northern
California 

In
 March 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Harvest Park apartments,
 built in 2004 with a condominium map for 22.5 million. This apartment
 community has 104-units and is located in Santa Rosa,
 California. 

In
 May 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Canyon Oaks apartments,
 located in San Ramon, California, for 64.3 million. Built in
 2005 and consisting of 250-units, the property is within Windermere, a
 master planned community, and is the sister property to Mill Creek at
 Windermere, acquired in September
2007. 

In
 June 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Magnolia Lane, built in
 2001, for 5.4 million. The property is a 32-unit community
 subject to a ground lease that expires in 64 years and is adjacent to
 Thomas Jefferson, another Essex community, purchased in September
 2007. 

In
 September 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired Mill Creek at
 Windermere, a 400-unit community located in San Ramon, California, for
 100.5 million. Built in 2005, the property is located within Windermere,
 a master planned community, and is the sister property to Canyon Oaks,
 acquired during the second quarter of
2007. 

The
 Operating Partnership also acquired Thomas Jefferson Apartments in
 September 2007 for 28.0 million in a DownREIT transaction that included
 issuing 7,006 DownREIT units to a related party. The community, which was
 managed by Essex before the acquisition, is a 156-unit apartment complex
 located in Sunnyvale, California. Built in 1963, the property is located
 adjacent to Magnolia Lane, another Essex community, purchased in June
 2007. 

Seattle
Metro 

In
 June 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired The Cairns, a 100-unit
 property built in 2005 and located in the Lake Union area of Seattle, for
 28.1 million. 

Dispositions 

As part
of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets,
we continually evaluate our Properties and sell those which no longer meet our
strategic criteria. We may use the capital generated from the dispositions to
invest in higher-return Properties, repurchase our common stock, or repay
debts. We believe that the sale of these Properties will not have a
material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their
sale materially affect our ongoing operations. Generally, any impact of earnings
dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact
of our acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities. 

In
 February 2007, the Operating Partnership sold the joint venture property
 City Heights Apartments, a 687-unit community located in Los Angeles,
 California for 120.0 million. The Operating Partnership s share of the
 proceeds from the sale totaled 33.9 million, resulting in a 13.7 million
 gain on sale to the Operating Partnership, and an additional 10.3 million
 for fees from the joint venture partner, both of which are included in
 income from discontinued
operations. 

The
 Operating Partnership sold the 21 remaining condominium units at Peregrine
 Point during the first three quarters of 2007, resulting in a gain of 1.0
 million net of taxes and expenses. 

In
 December 2007, the Operating Partnership sold four communities (875-units)
 in the Portland metropolitan area for 97.5 million, resulting in a gain
 of 47.6 million net of minority interest. The proceeds from
 the sale were used in a tax-free reverse exchange for the purchase of Mill
 Creek at Windermere in September
2007. 

In
 January 2008, the Operating Partnership collected 7.5 million and
 recognized income of 6.3 million from the sale of its preferred interest
 in Waterstone at Fremont Apartments, located in Fremont,
 California. 

Development
Pipeline 

The
Operating Partnership defines development activities as new properties that are
being constructed, or are newly constructed and, in the case of development
communities, are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached 

3 

stabilized
operations. As of December 31, 2007, excluding development projects
owned by Essex Apartment Value Fund II, L.P. Fund II ), the Operating
Partnership had three development projects comprised of 684 units for an
estimated cost of 236.7 million, of which 125.8 million remains to be
expended. 

The
Operating Partnership defines the predevelopment pipeline as new properties in
negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming
development activities. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating
Partnership had five development communities aggregating 1,658 units that were
classified as predevelopment projects. The estimated total cost of
the predevelopment pipeline at December 31, 2007 was 508.4 million, of which
 411.3 million remains to be expended. The Operating
Partnership may also acquire land for future development
purposes. The Operating Partnership owned five land parcels
held for future development aggregating 434 units as of December 31, 2007. The
Operating Partnership had incurred 25.5 million in costs related to these five
land parcels as of December 31, 2007.

Redevelopment
Pipeline 

The
Operating Partnership defines redevelopment communities as existing properties
owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment
by the Operating Partnership with the expectation of increased financial returns
through property improvement. During redevelopment, apartment units
may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized
operations. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had
ownership interests in thirteen major redevelopment communities aggregating
3,891 apartment units with estimated redevelopment costs of 135.6 million, of
which approximately 74.6 million remains to be expended. These
amounts exclude redevelopment projects owned by Fund II. The

(2) The redevelopment at this
community was completed in the fourth quarter of 2007, and will be added back to
Same-Property operations (as defined in Item 7) during the fourth quarter of
2008.

Partnership assumed a mortgage loan in conjunction with the acquisition of The
Cairns community in the amount of 12.0 million, with a fixed interest rate of
5.5 , which matures in May 2014. Finally, the Operating Partnership
refinanced 18.6 million of debt secured by the Highridge community with a 44.8
million fixed interest rate loan of 6.05 , which matures in June
2017. 

In July
2007, the Operating Partnership paid-off a mortgage loan secured by Monterra del
Sol for 2.6 million with a fixed interest rate of 7.56 . 

In August
2007, the Operating Partnership obtained a mortgage loan secured by the
Coldwater Canyon community purchased in May 2007 in the amount of 5.9 million,
with a fixed interest rate of 6.1 , which matures in August 2017. The
Operating Partnership also refinanced an 11.6 million mortgage loan secured by
the Capri at Sunny Hills community with a new loan in the amount of 19.2
million, with a fixed interest rate of 5.8 , which matures in August
2012. 

In
September 2007, the Operating Partnership assumed two loans in conjunction with
the acquisition of the Thomas Jefferson community. The first loan is
for 14 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.7 due in March 2017, and the
second loan is for 6.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.9 due in March
2017. 

In
December 2007, the Operating Partnership and a joint venture partner obtained a
construction loan in the amount of 17.5 million secured by the Main Street
predevelopment project in Walnut Creek, California. The loan is
variable based on LIBOR plus 125 basis points and matures in December
2009. The initial funding on this loan was approximately 12.1
million, and the remainder of the loan will be used for predevelopment
costs. 

In
January 2008, the Operating Partnership obtained a mortgage loan in the amount
of 49.9 million secured by Mirabella, a community located in Marina Del Rey,
California. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.21 , which
matures in January 2018. 

Structured
Finance 

In March
2007, the Operating Partnership originated a 6.9 million mezzanine loan
receivable for the acquisition and capital improvement of California Hill, a
153-unit, age-restricted apartment community located in Concord,
California. The floating rate note receivable is based on LIBOR
with a 5 floor for the LIBOR rate plus 4.75 . The note receivable is
due in March 2011. 

In
September 2007, the Operating Partnership originated a 14.0 million bridge loan
for the completion and lease-up of Valley View, a 146-unit apartment community
located in Vancouver, Washington. The loan refinanced a construction
loan, incorporating additional proceeds for interior upgrades to the remaining
phases; exterior and common area upgrades and interest reserves to take the
project through lease-up and stabilization. The floating rate note
receivable is based on LIBOR with a 5 floor for the LIBOR rate plus
3.38 . The note receivable is due in February 2009. 

In
October 2007, the Operating Partnership originated a 14.0 million bridge loan
secured by 301 Ocean Avenue a 47-unit apartment community located in Santa
Monica, California and the interest payments are guaranteed by the owner of the
asset. The floating rate note receivable is based on LIBOR with a 5 
floor for the LIBOR rate plus 2.95 . The note receivable is due in
April 2009. 

Derivative
Transactions 

In March
2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a ten-year forward-starting
interest rate swap for a notional amount of 50 million and a settlement date on
or before October 1, 2011, to manage interest rate exposure on 

5 

identified
future debt obligations. In April 2007, in conjunction with the
refinance of the Tierra Vista mortgage loan, the Operating Partnership settled a
 50 million forward-starting swap and received 1.3 million from the
counterparty. The accounting for the swap settlement reduces the effective
interest rate on the new Tierra Vista mortgage loan to 5.19 . 

As of
December 31, 2007 the Operating Partnership had entered into nine
forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 450 million
with interest rates ranging from 4.9 to 5.9 and settlements dates ranging from
April 2008 to October 2011. These derivatives qualify for hedge
accounting as they are expected to economically hedge the cash flows associated
with the refinancing of debt that matures between April 2008 and October
2011. The fair value of the derivatives decreased 8.0 million during
the year ended December 31, 2007 to a liability value of 10.2 million as of
December 31, 2007, and the derivative liability was recorded in other
liabilities in the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial
statements. The changes in the fair values of the derivatives are
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the Operating
Partnership s consolidated financial statements. No hedge
ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006. 

Equity
Transactions 

During
the second quarter of 2007, the Company issued and sold 1,670,500 shares of its
common stock for 213.7 million at an average stock price of 127.91 per share,
net of underwriter fees and expenses. 

In August
2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to
allow the Company to acquire shares in an aggregate of up to 200
million. The program supersedes the common stock repurchase plan that
Essex announced on May 16, 2001. During 2007, the Company repurchased
and retired 323,259 shares of its common stock for approximately 32.6 million,
net of fees and commissions. During January 2008, the Company
repurchased an additional 137,500 shares for 13.2 million, net of fees and
commissions. The Company has repurchased 460,759 shares for 45.8
million at an average stock price of 99.30 per share since the stock repurchase
plan was approved in August. 

ESSEX
APARTMENT VALUE FUNDS 

Essex
Apartment Value Fund, L.P. ("Fund I" and Fund II ), are investment funds formed
by the Operating Partnership to add value through rental growth and asset
appreciation, utilizing the Operating Partnership's development, redevelopment
and asset management capabilities. The assets in Fund I were sold
during 2004 and 2005, and Fund I was liquidated in 2007. 

Fund II
has eight institutional investors, and the Operating Partnership, with combined
partner equity commitments of 265.9 million. Essex has committed 75.0 million
to Fund II, which represents a 28.2 interest as general partner and limited
partner. Fund II utilitized debt as leverage of approximately 65 of the
estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund II invested in
apartment communities in the Operating Partnership s targeted West Coast markets
and, as of December 31, 2007, owned eleven apartment communities and three
development projects. There was no acquisition or disposition
activity in Fund II in the year ended December 31, 2007. Essex
records revenue for its asset management, property management, development and
redevelopment services when earned, and promote income when realized if Fund II
exceeds certain financial return benchmarks.

OFFICES
AND EMPLOYEES 

The
Operating Partnership is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
regional offices in Woodland Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego,
California and Bellevue, Washington. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating
Partnership had approximately 917 employees. 

INSURANCE 

The
Operating Partnership carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties with a 5.0 million
deductible per incident. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
losses, such as, for example, losses from terrorism or earthquake, for which the
Operating Partnership does not have insurance coverage. 

Substantially
all of the Properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
activity. The Operating Partnership believes it has a proactive
approach to its potential earthquake losses. The Operating
Partnership utilizes third-party seismic consultants for its acquisitions and
performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a
higher level of potential loss from an earthquake. The Operating
Partnership utilizes internal and third-party loss models to help to determine
its exposure. The majority of the Operating Partnership s Properties
are lower density garden-style apartments which may be less susceptible to
earthquake damage. The Operating Partnership will continue to monitor
third-party earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider
obtaining third-party coverage if it deems it cost effective. 

Although
the Operating Partnership may carry insurance for potential losses associated
with its Properties, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws,
it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or
losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
material. 

COMPETITION 

 There are
numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in
attracting residents. These include other apartment communities and
single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the
properties are located. The Properties also compete for residents with new and
existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the demand for our
Properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing
properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates and occupancy may drop,
which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
of operations. 

We face
competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other
entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties. Some of
the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. This
competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and/or
develop. 

WORKING
CAPITAL 

We
believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing cash balances,
availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the
ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are
sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during
2008. The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by
financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes
in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment,
which can affect our plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and
redevelopment activities. 

ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSIDERATIONS 

See the
discussion under the caption, Possible environmental liabilities in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of environmental
regulations on our operations. 

OTHER
MATTERS 

Certain
Policies of the Operating Partnership 

We intend
to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Operating Partnership has in the past
five years and may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common
stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit
and (iii) offer shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial
consideration for property acquisitions. The Operating Partnership from time to
time acquires partnership 

7 

interests
in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly through
subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, when such entities underlying assets
are real estate. In general, the Operating Partnership does not (i) underwrite
securities of other issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other
investments. 

We invest
primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal
markets within Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Seattle
metropolitan area. The Operating Partnership currently intends to continue to
invest in apartment communities in such regions. However, these
practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions are subject to
various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
recent results or from our anticipated future results. 

We depend on our
key personnel - Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain
executive officers, senior officers and company managers. There is substantial
competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of
several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us. 

Debt
financing At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 1.66 billion of
indebtedness (including 233.1 million of variable rate indebtedness, of which
 152.7 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements). We are
subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
following: 

cash
 flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and
 interest; 

inability
 to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered
 properties; 

the
 terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
 indebtedness; 

inability
 to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration of the maturity
 date; and 

repaying
 debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment
 penalties. 

Uncertainty of
our ability to refinance balloon payments - As of December 31, 2007, we
had approximately 1.66 billion of mortgage debt, exchangeable bonds and line of
credit borrowings, most of which are subject to balloon payments (see Notes 8
and 9 to the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial statements for more
details) . We do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to
make all of these balloon payments. These mortgages, bonds and lines of credit
borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon
payments: 

2008-- 125.2
million; 

 2009-- 185.7
million; 

 2010-- 154.8
million; 

 2011-- 166.5
million; 

 2012-- 32.2
million; 

 Thereafter-- 993.3
million. 

We may
not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness, bonds, or lines of
credit. The Properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed
upon or otherwise transferred to the lender. This could cause us to
lose income and asset value. We may be required to refinance the debt
at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms
of existing indebtedness. 

The
Operating Partnership s current financing activities have not been severely
impacted by the tightening in the credit markets. Our strong balance
sheet, the established relationships with our unsecured line of credit bank
group and access to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac secured debt financing have
insulated us from the turmoil being experienced by many other real estate
companies. Recently, we have experienced some expansion in credit spreads
as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s tier 4 financing are currently at approximately
200 basis points over the relevant U.S. treasury securities. 

Debt financing on
Properties may result in insufficient cash flow - Where possible, we
intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our
investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not
otherwise make. There is a risk that the cash flow from the Properties will be
insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution
requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. We may obtain additional debt financing in the future through
mortgages on some or all of the Properties. These mortgages may be recourse,
non-recourse, or cross-collateralized. 

As of
December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had 74 of its 123 consolidated
apartment communities 

8 

encumbered
by debt. Of the 74 communities, 51 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely
to those properties. With respect to the remaining 23 communities,
there are 5 cross-collateralized mortgages secured by 8 communities, 7
communities, 3 communities, 3 communities, and 2 communities, respectively. The
holders of this indebtedness will have claims against these communities and, to
the extent indebtedness is cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose
upon communities which are not the primary collateral for their loan. This may
accelerate other indebtedness secured by communities. Foreclosure of communities
would reduce our income and net asset value. 

Risk of rising
interest rates - 
Current interest rates could potentially increase rapidly, which could result in
higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness. Prolonged interest
rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and
develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to
refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates. 

As of
December 31, 2007, we had approximately 220.9 million of long-term variable
rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of
short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which mature at various dates from 2020
through 2034), 12.2 million of short-term variable rate indebtedness bearing
interest at LIBOR plus 1.25 related to a predevelopment project due in 2009,
and 169.8 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit. Of
the 169.8 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit,
 100.0 million is bearing interest at the Freddie Mac Reference Rate plus from
0.55 to 0.59 , 61.0 million is bearing interest at the underlying interest
rate based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company s corporate ratings
and is currently at LIBOR plus 0.80 , and 8.8 million is bearing interest at
the underlying interest rate based on the bank s Prime Rate less 2.0 .
Approximately 152.7 million of the long-term indebtedness is subject to
interest rate cap protection agreements, which may reduce the risks associated
with fluctuations in interest rates. The remaining 68.2 million of long-term
variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection
agreements as of December 31, 2007. An increase in interest rates may have an
adverse effect on our net income and results of operations. 

Risk of losses on
interest rate hedging arrangements Periodically, we have entered into
agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates, and
may continue to do so. Although these agreements may partially protect against
rising interest rates, they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates
decline. If a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the
indebtedness that is hedged, we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the
rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement
change independently of each other. Finally, nonperformance by the other party
to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks. In order to
minimize counterparty credit risk, our policy is to enter into hedging
arrangements only with A-rated financial institutions. 

Bond compliance
requirements may limit income from certain properties - At December 31,
2007, we had approximately 220.9 million of variable rate tax-exempt financing
relating to the following apartment communities: Inglenook Court, Wandering
Creek, Boulevard (Treetops), Huntington Breakers, Camarillo Oaks, Fountain Park,
Anchor Village and Hidden Valley (Parker Ranch). This tax-exempt financing
subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive
covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the future. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations thereunder impose
various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding interest on
qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be
made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified
percentage, generally 50 , of the median income for the applicable family size
as determined by the Housing and Urban Development Department of the federal
government. In addition to federal requirements, certain state and local
authorities may impose additional rental restrictions. These restrictions may
limit income from the tax-exempt financed properties if we are required to lower
rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test. If the
Operating Partnership does not reserve the required number of apartment homes
for residents satisfying these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the
bonds may be terminated, the obligations under the bond documents may be
accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual
liability. 

Adverse effect to
property income and value due to general real estate investment risks - 
Real property investments are subject to a variety of risks. The yields
available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income
generated and expenses incurred. If the properties do not generate sufficient
income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital
expenditures, cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders
will be adversely affected. Income from the Properties may be further adversely
affected by, among other things, the following factors: 

the
 general economic climate; 

local
 economic conditions in which the Properties are located, such as
 oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental
 housing; 

the
 attractiveness of the properties to
tenants; 

competition
 from other available space; and 

the
 Operating Partnership s ability to provide for adequate maintenance and
 insurance. 

9 

As leases
on the Properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are
less favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may be adversely
affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the
availability and terms of financing. Real estate investments are
relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly
in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite
limited. 

Economic
environment and impact on operating results - The national economy and
the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our
operating results. Some of these markets are concentrated in high-tech sectors,
which have experienced economic downturns, and could again in the future. Our
property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk
mitigation. However, we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns. Although
we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges, it is possible a
reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases
in operating costs such as advertising, turnover and repair and maintenance
expense could occur in the event of economic uncertainty. 

Due to
the Operating Partnership's concentration in supply restricted markets, the
Operating Partnership has not experienced any material adverse impact from
increases in supply of unsold single family residences. 

Risk of
Inflation/Deflation - Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures
could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating
expenses. 

Risks that
acquisitions will fail to meet expectations - We intend to continue to
acquire apartment communities. However, there are risks that acquisitions will
fail to meet our expectations. Our estimates of future income, expenses and the
costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market
an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate. We
expect to finance future acquisitions, in whole or in part, under various forms
of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units
by the Operating Partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the
Company. The use of equity financing, rather than debt, for future developments
or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the Company s existing
stockholders. If we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit,
there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute financing, the Operating
Partnership may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new
development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous
terms. 

Risks that
development and redevelopment activities will be delayed, not completed, and/or
not achieve expected results - We pursue apartment community development
and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various
governmental and other approvals, which have no assurance of being received. Our
development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks,
including the following: 

funds
 may be expended and management's time devoted to projects that may not be
 completed; 

construction
 costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the
 project economically unfeasible; 

projects
 may be delayed due to, without limitation, adverse weather conditions,
 entitlement and government regulations, labor shortages, or unforeseen
 complications; 

occupancy
 rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated;
 and 

expenses
 at projects may be higher than
anticipated. 

These
risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the Company s
stockholders. Further, the development of properties is also subject to the
general risks associated with real estate investments. For further information
regarding these risks, please see Adverse Effect to Property Income and Value
Due to General Real Estate Investment Risks. 

The geographic
concentration of the Operating Partnership s Properties and fluctuations in
local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating
results The Operating Partnership generated significant amounts of
rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, from properties
concentrated in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange, Santa
Barbara, San Diego, and Ventura counties), Northern California (the San
Francisco Bay Area), and the Seattle metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2007,
81 of the Operating Partnership s property revenues were generated
from Properties located in California. This geographic concentration could
present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations. The
economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy, market rental rates,
and expenses, as well as impact the income generated from the Properties and
their underlying asset values. The financial results of major local employers
also may impact the cash 

10 

flow and
value of certain of the Properties. This could have a negative impact on our
financial condition and operating results, which could affect our ability to pay
expected dividends to our stockholders. 

Competition in
the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental
demand for our Properties - There are numerous housing alternatives that
compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents. These include
other apartment communities and single-family homes that are available for rent
in the markets in which the Properties are located. The Properties also compete
for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If
the demand for our Properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or
acquire competing properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may
drop, which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and
results of operations. 

We also
face competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other
entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities.
Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we
do. This competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment
communities that we acquire and/or develop. 

Dividend
requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to
sustain dividends -
 We have Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series F
Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 25
million outstanding and Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Series
G Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately
 149.5 million outstanding. In addition, we are required under limited
conditions to issue Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series B
Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of 80 million and
Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series D Preferred Stock with
an aggregate liquidation preference of 50 million in each case in exchange for
outstanding preferred interests in the Operating Partnership. The terms of the
Series B, D, F and G Preferred Stock provide for certain cumulative preferential
cash distributions per each share of preferred stock. 

These
terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding, we cannot
authorize, declare, or pay any distributions on our common stock, unless all
distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid
in full. Our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our credit agreement limits
our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a
fixed charge coverage ratio. 

If the
Company wishes to issue any common stock in the future (including upon the
exercise of stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends
at current levels will be increased. The Company s ability to pay
dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current properties and
other properties that may be acquired or developed in the future. 

If the
Company cannot pay dividends on its common stock, the Company s status as a real
estate investment trust may be jeopardized. Our ability to pay dividends on our
common stock is further limited by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Under
the Maryland General Corporation Law, the Company may not make a distribution on
stock if, after giving effect to such distribution, either: 

we
 would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual
 course of business; or 

our
 total assets would be less than our total liabilities, including the
 liquidation preference on our Series B, Series D, Series F, and Series G
 preferred stock. 

Resale of shares
pursuant to our effective registration statement or that are issued upon
conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the
market price of the shares The Operating Partnership has the following
effective registration statements, which allows for the resale into the public
stock of common stock held by stockholders, as specified in the registration
statements: 

A
 registration statement, declared effective in 2003, which covers the
 resale of certain shares, including (i) up to 2,270,490 shares of common
 stock that are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in
 the Operating Partnership and (ii) up to 1,473,125 shares that are
 issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in certain other
 real estate partnerships; 

Registration
 statements, declared effective in 2006, that cover (i) the resale of up to
 142,076 shares issuable in connection with our Waterford and Vista
 Belvedere acquisitions and (ii) the resale of shares issuable in
 connection with the exchange rights of our 3.625 Exchangeable Senior
 Notes, as to which there is a principal amount of 225 million
 outstanding. 

During
the third quarter of 2006, we issued, pursuant to a registration statement,
5,980,000 shares of 4.875 Series G Cumulative Preferred Stock for estimated
gross proceeds of 149.5 million; such shares are convertible, subject to

11 

certain
conditions, into common stock, which could be resold into the public
market. 

The
resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration
statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible
preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our
shares. 

The exchange and
repurchase rights of Exchangeable Senior Notes and Series G Preferred
Stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock - The
Operating Partnership has 225 million principal amount of 3.625 Exchangeable
Senior Notes (the Notes outstanding which mature on November 1, 2025. The
Notes are exchangeable into the Company's common stock on or after November 1,
2020 or prior to November 1, 2020 under certain circumstances. The Notes are
redeemable at the Operating Partnership's option for cash at any time on or
after November 4, 2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of
the holder on November 1 st in the
years 2010, 2015 and 2020, or upon the occurrence of certain events. The Notes
are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Operating
Partnership. 

In 2006,
the Company sold 5,980,000 shares of 4.875 Series G Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock (the Series G Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 149.5
million. Holders may convert Series G Preferred Stock into shares of
the Company s common stock subject to certain conditions. The
conversion rate will initially be .1830 shares of common stock per 25 share
liquidation preference, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of
 136.62 per share of common stock (the conversion rate will be subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events). On or after July
31, 2011, the Company may, under certain circumstances cause some or all of the
Series G Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then
prevailing conversion rate. Further, if a fundamental change occurs,
as defined in the articles supplementary for the Series G Preferred Stock, then
the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their Series G
Preferred Stock subject to certain conditions. 

The
exchange of the Notes and/or Series G Preferred Stock for common stock would
dilute stockholder ownership in the Company, and such exchange could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity securities. If the Notes and
Series G Preferred Stock are not exchanged, the repurchase price of the Notes
and Series G Preferred Stock may discourage or impede transactions that might
otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock. Further, these
repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where the Company needs to
conserve its cash reserves, in which event such repurchase might adversely
affect the Company and its common stockholders. 

Our future
issuances of common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock - In order to finance our
property acquisition and development activities, we have issued and sold common
stock, preferred stock and convertible debt securities. For example,
during 2007, the Company sold 1,500,000 shares of its common stock in a public
offering for proceeds of 191.8 million, net of underwriter fees and
expenses. During 2007 and 2006, pursuant to a Controlled Equity
Offering program that the Company entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald Co.,
the Company issued and sold approximately 170,500 and 427,700 shares of common
stock for 21.9 million and 48.3 million, net of fees and commissions,
respectively. The Company may in the future sell further shares of
common stock pursuant to a Controlled Equity Offering program with Cantor
Fitzgerald Co. 

In 2006,
the Company issued 5,980,000 shares of 4.875 Series G Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately 149.5
million. In 2005, the Operating Partnership sold 225 million
principal amount of 3.625 Exchangeable Senior Notes, which are exchangeable
into the Company s common stock under certain conditions. 

During
the first quarter of 2007, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement
with the SEC, allowing the Company to sell an undetermined number of equity and
debt securities as defined in the prospectus. Future sales of common
stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder
ownership in the Company and could adversely affect the market price of the
common stock. 

Our Chairman is
involved in other real estate activities and investments, which may lead to
conflicts of interest - Our Chairman, George M. Marcus is not an employee
of the Operating Partnership, and is involved in other real estate activities
and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. Mr. Marcus owns
interests in various other real estate-related businesses and investments. He is
the Chairman of The Marcus Millichap Company, or TMMC ), which is a
holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies. TMMC
has an interest in Pacific Property Company, a company that invests in apartment
communities. 

12 

Mr.
Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in
his capacity as Chairman of the Company to any of his affiliated companies and
that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the Company s Board
of Directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of an
apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest
with any of his affiliated companies. Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr.
Marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring
and/or developing apartment communities, which competition may be detrimental to
us. In addition, due to such potential competition for real estate
investments, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of
interest with us, which may be detrimental to the interests of the Company s
stockholders. 

The influence of
executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to
holders of common stock - As of December 31, 2007, George M. Marcus, the
Chairman of our Board of Directors, wholly or partially owned 1,768,773 shares
of common stock (including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership and certain other partnerships and
assuming exercise of all vested options). This represents approximately 7.1 of
the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have
majority control over us. However, he currently has, and likely will continue to
have, significant influence with respect to the election of directors and
approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his
influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our
stockholders. 

Under the
partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of the holders
of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the
agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their ownership of
limited partnership interests and their positions with us, our directors and
executive officers, including Mr. Marcus, have substantial influence on us.
Consequently, their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the
interests of all stockholders. 

The voting rights
of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that
otherwise benefit holders of common stock - In general, the holders of
our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights.
However, if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock
for six quarterly distributions periods, the holders of preferred stock who have
not received distributions, voting together as a single class, will have the
right to elect two additional directors to serve on our Board of
Directors. 

These
voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for
the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full. At
that time, the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting
rights, and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately
terminates. While any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding, the Company
may not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of each series of preferred stock, each voting separately as a single
class: 

authorize
 or create any class or series of stock that ranks senior to such preferred
 stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon liquidation,
 dissolution or winding-up of our
business; 

amend,
 alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s Charter or Bylaws,
 including by merger or consolidation, that would materially and adversely
 affect the rights of such series of preferred stock;
 or 

in
 the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are
 exchangeable, merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer
 substantially all of its assets to another entity, except if such
 preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and has the
 same terms and in certain other
circumstances. 

These
voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to
impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common
stock. 

The redemption
rights of the Series B preferred units, Series D preferred units, Series F
preferred stock and Series G preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of
the Company s common stock - Upon the occurrence of
one of the following events, the terms of the Operating Partnership s Series B
and D Preferred Units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of
the Company s Series F Preferred Stock and the Series G Preferred Stock provide
the holders of the majority of the outstanding Series F Preferred Stock and
Series G Preferred Stock the right to require the Company to redeem all of such
stock: 

the
 Company completes a going private transaction and its common stock is no
 longer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended; 

the
 Company completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all
 of its assets and the surviving entity s debt securities do not possess an
 investment grade rating; 

the
 Company fails to qualify as a REIT;
or 

in
 the case of Series G preferred stock, The Company common stock is not
 traded on a major exchange. 

The
aggregate redemption price of the Series B Preferred Units would be 80 million,
the aggregate redemption price of the Series D Preferred Units would be 50
million, the aggregate redemption price of the Series F Preferred Stock

13 

would be
 25 million and the aggregate redemption price of the Series G Preferred Stock
would be 149.5 million, plus, in each case, any accumulated
distributions. 

These
redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be
in the interest of holders of common stock. Further, these redemption rights
might trigger situations where the Company needs to conserve its cash reserves,
in which event such redemption might adversely affect the Company and its common
holders. 

Maryland business
combination law may not allow certain transactions between the Company and its
affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law - Under Maryland law,
 business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested
stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five
years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an
asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An
interested stockholder is defined as any person (and certain affiliates of such
person) who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the
then-outstanding voting stock. The law also requires a supermajority stockholder
vote for such transactions. This means that the transaction must be approved by
at least: 

80 
 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares;
 and 

Two-thirds
 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares
 other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the
 business combination is to be
effected. 

The
statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business
combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that
the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These
voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price, as
defined under Maryland law. As permitted by the statute, the Board of
Directors of the Company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business
combination by us, George M. Marcus, William A. Millichap, who are the chairman
and a director of the Company, respectively, and TMMC or any entity owned or
controlled by Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and TMMC. Consequently, the five-year
prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to
any business combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or TMMC. As a
result, we may in the future enter into business combinations with Messrs.
Marcus and Millichap and TMMC, without compliance with the supermajority vote
requirements and other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation
Law. 

Anti-takeover
provisions contained in the Operating Partnership agreement, charter, bylaws,
and certain provisions of Maryland law could delay, defer or prevent a change in
control - While
the Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and
generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management
and control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating
Partnership agreement place limitations on the Company s ability to act with
respect to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay, defer or
prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price
for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that
could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the Company s stockholders. The
partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of
the outstanding units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, the
Company cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a majority-in-interest of
the limited partners in the Operating Partnership, transfer all or any portion
of our general partner interest in the Operating Partnership to another entity.
Such limitations on the Company s ability to act may result in our being
precluded from taking action that the Board of Directors believes is in the best
interests of the Company s stockholders. As of December 31, 2007, the limited
partners held or controlled approximately 9.1 of the outstanding units of
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, allowing such actions to be
blocked by the limited partners. 

The
Company s Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock
or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of
such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. We
may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or
prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction might involve a
premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders
of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred stock could have dividend,
voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of
common stock. 

The
Company s Charter, as well as the Company s stockholder rights plan, contains
other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control that might be in the best interest of the Company s stockholders. The
Company s stockholder rights plan is designed, among other things, to prevent a
person or group from gaining control of the Company without offering a fair
price to all of the Company s stockholders. The Bylaws may be amended by the
Board of Directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect,
although the Company presently has no such intention. The Charter contains
ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of
capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
transaction or a change in 

14 

control.
For example, subject to receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors,
potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock (other
than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9 ). This may discourage
tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit
the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common
stock. 

The
Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed
to be control shares. Under the Maryland General Corporations
Law, control shares are those which, when aggregated with any other shares
held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within
specified ranges. Although the Bylaws exempt the Company from the control share
provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law, the Board of Directors may
amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any time in the future.
Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the Bylaws may
result in the application of the control share provisions of the Maryland
General Corporations Law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the
future, but also to control shares previously acquired. If the provisions of the
Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions of the Maryland
General Corporations Law could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change
in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in
the best interests of the Company s stockholders. 

The Operating
Partnership s joint ventures and joint ownership of Properties and partial
interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the Operating
Partnership s ability to control such Properties and partial
interests - 
Instead of purchasing apartment communities directly, we have invested and may
continue to invest in joint ventures. Joint venture partners often
have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets. Therefore,
it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become
bankrupt, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent
with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action
contrary to our instructions or requests, or our policies or objectives.
Consequently, a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by
the joint venture to additional risk. Although we seek to maintain sufficient
influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives, we may be unable to
take action without our joint venture partners approval, or joint venture
partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our
consent. Should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could
become liable for such partner s share of joint venture
liabilities. 

From time
to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in corporations, limited
partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been
formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. In
certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership s interest in a particular
entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that
entity. Therefore, the Operating Partnership s ability to control the daily
operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore, the Operating
Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of
directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or partners (in
the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event that its
operations conflict with the Operating Partnership s objectives. The Operating
Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity. In
the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the Operating Partnership may
lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity. We have, and
in the future may, enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax
liabilities of partners, which contribute assets into joint ventures or the
Operating Partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which are
within our control, occur. Although we plan to hold the contributed assets or
defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules
under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, we can provide no assurance
that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can
expect to have a material impact on our financial position. 

Dedicated
investment activities and other factors specifically related to Fund II -
Fund II involves risks to us such as the following: 

our
 partners in Fund II might remove the Operating Partnership as the general
 partner of Fund II; 

our
 partners in Fund II might become bankrupt (in which event we might become
 generally liable for the liabilities of Fund
 II); 

our
 partners in Fund II might have economic or business interests or goals
 that are inconsistent with our business interests or
 goals; 

our
 partners in Fund II might fail to fund capital commitments as
 contractually required; or 

our
 partners in Fund II might fail to approve decisions regarding Fund II that
 are in the Operating Partnership s best
 interest. 

We will,
however, generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over Fund II to permit
it to achieve its business objectives. 

15 

Investments in
mortgages and other real estate securities The Operating Partnership
may invest in securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect
our ability to make distributions to stockholders. The Operating
Partnership may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and
invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations. These mortgages may be first,
second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise
guaranteed. In general, investments in mortgages include the following
risks: 

that
 the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed, causing
 realized or unrealized losses; 

the
 borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due, requiring
 us to foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with the
 foreclosure may be less than the amount
owed; 

that
 interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of
 funds; and 

in
 the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would
 eliminate the junior mortgage. 

If any of
the above were to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability to make
expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected. 

Possible
environmental liabilities - Under various federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate is liable for
the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on,
in, to or migrating from such property. Such laws often impose liability without
regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the
presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances,
or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the
owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using
such property as collateral. Persons exposed to such substances, either through
soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages.
Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation
of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such
substances or wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is owned or
operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release
of asbestos-containing materials ACMs into the air, and third parties may
seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect),
operation, management and development of real properties, the Operating
Partnership could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as
having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances
and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as
well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and costs related to
injuries of persons and property. 

Investments
in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of
the owner of such real property. We carry certain limited insurance coverage for
this type of environmental risk. We have conducted environmental studies which
revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain Properties. Such
contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated
on-site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations. The former industrial
users of the Properties were identified as the source of contamination. The
environmental studies noted that certain Properties are located adjacent to any
possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination, the
lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties. The environmental
studies also noted that at certain of these properties, contamination existed
because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks, which have been
removed. In general, in connection with the ownership, operation, financing,
management and development of real properties, we may be potentially liable for
removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and environmental
liabilities. We may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to
injuries to persons and property. 

Recently
there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of
apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the
presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have
resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The
Operating Partnership has been sued for mold related matters and has settled
some, but not all, such matters, which matters remain unresolved and
pending. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold related
liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and
pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Operating
Partnership has, however, purchased pollution liability insurance, which
includes limited coverage for mold, although the insurance may not cover all
pending or future mold claims. The Operating Partnership has adopted
programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as
guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any
impact mold might have on residents or the property. The Operating
Partnership cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold
related matters and cannot assure you that the liabilities resulting from such
current or future mold related matters will not be substantial. The
costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be
substantial. 

16 

California
has enacted legislation commonly referred to as Proposition 65 requiring that
 clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to
chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to comply with
Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely
affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65. 

Methane
gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in
several areas, particularly in the Southern California coastal areas. 
Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined spaces. 
Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the state or
federal level, some local governments, such as the County of Los Angeles, have
imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where
methane gas is known to be located. 

Methane
gas is also associated with certain industrial activities, such as former
municipal waste landfills. Radon is also a naturally-occurring gas
that is found below the surface. The Operating Partnership cannot
assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its
compliance with methane gas related requirements or litigation costs related to
methane or radon gas. 

The
Operating Partnership has almost no indemnification agreements from third
parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties. The
Operating Partnership has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of
any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the Operating Partnership. No assurance can be given that existing
environmental studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all
environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did
not create any material environmental condition not known to the Operating
Partnership, or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any
one or more of the Properties. The Operating Partnership has limited insurance
coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described
above. 

General uninsured
losses - The Operating Partnership carries comprehensive liability, fire,
extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties. There
are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as, for example,
losses for terrorism or earthquake, for which the Operating Partnership does not
have insurance coverage. Substantially all of the Properties are located in
areas that are subject to earthquake activity. In January 2007, the
Operating Partnership canceled its then existing earthquake policy and
established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC PWI ). Through PWI, the Operating Partnership is self-insured as it
relates to earthquake related losses. Additionally, as of January
2008, PWI provides property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 5.0
million of the Operating Partnership s property level insurance claims per
incident. 

Although
the Operating Partnership may carry insurance for potential losses associated
with its Properties, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws,
it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or
losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
material. In the event of a substantial loss, insurance coverage may
not be able to cover the full current market value of replacement cost of the
Operating Partnership s lost investment. Inflation, changes in
building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors
might also affect the Operating Partnership s ability to replace or renovate an
apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed. 

Changes in real
estate tax and other laws - Generally we do not directly pass through
costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or
other taxes, to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect funds
from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.
Similarly, compliance with changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the
restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent
stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant
unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures, which would
adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to
stockholders. 

Changes in
financing policy; no limitation on debt We have adopted a policy of
maintaining a debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio of less than 50 . The
calculation of debt-to-total-market-capitalization is as follows: total
indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness plus total equity market
capitalization. As used in this calculation, total equity market
capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares
of common stock (based on the greater of current market price or the gross
proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any
undistributed net cash flow), assuming the conversion of all limited partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership into shares of common stock and the gross
proceeds of the preferred units and preferred stock. Based on this calculation
(including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow),
our debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio was approximately 35.7 as of
December 31, 2007. 

17 

Our
organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness
that may be incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of The Company could
change current policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership regarding
indebtedness. If we changed these policies, we could incur more debt, resulting
in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the
Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service requirements that could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such
increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the Properties. 

We are subject to
certain tax risks - The Company has elected
to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s
qualification as a REIT requires it to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an
annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the Company s control.
Although the Company intends that its current organization and method of
operation enable it to qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot assure you that it
so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future.
Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions (any of which could have retroactive effect) could adversely the
Company s ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect its stockholders. If
it fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company would be subject
to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
its taxable income at corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct
dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income. The Company
may also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which it failed to qualify. The additional tax liability
would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to
stockholders, and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its
stockholders. Even if the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will
continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income
and property. 

The
Company has established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite the Company s
qualification as a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay U.S. federal
income tax on their taxable income. While the Company will attempt to ensure
that its dealing with its taxable REIT subsidiaries does not adversely affect
its REIT qualification, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will
successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, the Company may be subject to a
100 penalty tax, or its taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied
deductions, to the extent its dealings with its taxable REIT subsidiaries are
not deemed to be arm s length in nature. No assurances can be given
that The Company s dealings with its taxable REIT subsidiaries will be arm s
length in nature. 

From time
to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our Properties. Under
the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of Properties that
we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course
of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to
a 100 penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do
not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are
prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment
purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend
that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited
transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then
the Company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to
the Company from the prohibited transaction and the Company s ability to retain
future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized. Income from a
prohibited transaction might adversely affect the Company s ability to satisfy
the income tests for qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Therefore, no assurances can be given that the Company will
be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT.

Item
2. Properties 

Our core
apartment Portfolio as of December 31, 2007 (including partial ownership
interests) was comprised of 134 apartment communities (comprising 27,489
apartment units), of which 13,205 units are located in Southern California,
8,462 units are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5,520 units are located
in the Seattle metropolitan area, and 302 units are located in the other areas
which consists of one community in Houston, Texas. The Operating
Partnership s apartment communities accounted for 97.5 of the Operating
Partnership s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. 

18 

Occupancy
Rates 

The 134
apartment communities had an average Same-Properties occupancy (as defined in
Item 7), based on financial occupancy, during the year ended December 31,
2007, of approximately 95.9 . With respect to stabilized apartment communities
with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on financial
occupancy (the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total
possible rental revenue). Actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue
pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total
possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with
occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant
units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a
meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant
unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely
reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as
disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial
occupancy. 

As of
December 31, 2007, the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the Operating
Partnership and the Southern California office building was 100 occupied, based
on physical occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are
based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from
dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With
respect to recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or
apartment communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient
operating history, occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which
refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by
rentable units. 

For the
year ended December 31, 2007, none of the Operating Partnership s Properties had
book values equal to 10 or more of total assets of the Operating Partnership or
gross revenues equal to 10 or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Operating
Partnership. 

Apartment
Communities 

Our
apartment communities are generally suburban garden apartments and town homes
comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three
to fifteen acres of land. The apartment communities have on average of 205
units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom units. A wide
variety of amenities are available at each apartment community, including
covered parking, fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with complete fitness
facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts. 

We
select, train and supervise a full team of on-site service and maintenance
personnel. We believe that the following primary factors enhance our ability to
retain tenants: 

located
 near employment centers 

well
 built communities that have been well maintained since acquisition;
 and 

proactive
 customer service approach. 

Office
and Other Commercial Buildings 

The
Operating Partnership s corporate headquarters is located in an office building
with approximately 17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive, Palo
Alto, California. The Operating Partnership acquired the property in 1997. In
December 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired the adjacent property at 935
East Meadow Drive, and the Operating Partnership will be making improvements to
the building though the third quarter of 2008. This building is
approximately 14,500 square feet and will be solely occupied by the Operating
Partnership. The Operating Partnership also owns an office building in Southern
California (Woodland Hills), comprised of approximately 38,900 square feet
building, of which the Operating Partnership occupies approximately 11,500
square feet at December 31, 2007. The building has nine third-party tenants
occupying approximately 27,400 square feet. The largest single tenant occupies
approximately 10,900 square feet. The Operating Partnership acquired the
Woodland Hills property in 2001. The Operating Partnership has a mortgage loan
receivable on an office building with approximately 110,000 square feet located
in Irvine, California, which is consolidated in accordance with
GAAP. The Operating Partnership also has two predevelopment projects,
Cadence Campus which is an office building comprised of 262,500 square feet, and
Essex-Hollywood a commercial building currently utilitized as a production
studio of 35,000 square feet, and both properties are 100 leased to single
tenants. 

Recreational
Vehicle Parks and Manufactured Housing Community 

The
Operating Partnership owns two recreational vehicle parks (comprising of 338
spaces), acquired in the Operating Partnership s December 2002 acquisition of
John M. Sachs, Inc., located in El Cajon, California. 

19 

The
Operating Partnership also owns one manufactured housing community (containing
157 sites), acquired in the Operating Partnership s December 2002 acquisition of
John M. Sachs, Inc., and located in Vista, California.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings 

Recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against
owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real
estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary
judgments or settlements. The Operating Partnership has been sued for
mold related matters and has settled some, but not all, of such
matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability
awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold
endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Operating Partnership
has, however, purchased pollution liability insurance, which includes some
coverage for mold. The Operating Partnership has adopted programs
designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines
for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact
mold might have on residents or property. Liabilities resulting from
such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Operating Partnership s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. 

The
Operating Partnership carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however,
certain types of extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses for
terrorism or earthquake, for which the Operating Partnership does not have
insurance coverage. Substantially all of the Properties are located in areas
that are subject to earthquake activity. 

The
Operating Partnership is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course
of its business operations. Such lawsuits are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

In August
2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to
allow the Company to acquire shares in an aggregate of up to 200
million. The program supersedes the common stock repurchase plan that
Essex announced on May 16, 2001. During 2007 the Company repurchased
and retired 323,259 shares of its common stock for approximately 32.6
million. During January 2008, the Company repurchased and retired
137,500 shares of its common stock for approximately 13.2
million. Since the Company announced the inception of the stock
repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased and retired 460,759 shares for
 45.8 million at an average stock price of 99.40 per share, including
commissions. 

Unregistered
Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

During
September 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired the Thomas Jefferson
apartments in Sunnyvale, California, by acquiring ownership interests in the two
limited partnerships that collectively owned the property. In
connection with this acquisition, the limited partnerships were restructured to
provide for limited partnership units, or DownREIT units, that are redeemable
for cash, or at the Operating Partnership's sole discretion, cash or shares of
the common stock of the Company. A total of 62,873 such units were
issued. The issuance of such units was pursuant to the
exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

The
 above financial and operating information from January 1 through December
 31, 2003 reflect the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No.
 123. The results of operations for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003
 have been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations for properties
 sold subsequent to December 31,
2006. 

(2) 

Interest
 coverage ratio represents earnings before minority interests, gain on
 sales of real estate, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
 amortization adjusted EBITDA divided by interest
 expense. The Operating Partnership believes that the interest
 coverage ratio is useful to readers because it is frequently used by
 investors, lenders, security analysts and other interested parties in the
 evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, the
 Operating Partnership believes that this ratio is useful in evaluating our
 performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because
 the calculation of the adjusted EBITDA component of the interest coverage
 ratio generally eliminates the effects of financing costs, income taxes,
 and depreciation and amortization, which items may vary for different
 companies for reasons unrelated to operating
 performance. 

27 

The
adjusted EBITDA component of the interest coverage ratio, however, is not a
recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use
the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component in addition to,
and not as an alternative for, net income, as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our
presentation of the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies. Furthermore, the interest coverage ratio is not intended
to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it
does not consider certain cash requirements such as income tax payments, debt
service requirements, capital expenditures and other fixed
charges. The amounts shown for the interest coverage ratio and
adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly
titled definitions in our debt instruments, which can be further adjusted to
reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine
compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain
activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted
payments. 

(3) 

Gross
 operating margin represents rental revenues and other property income less
 property operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization,
 divided by rental revenues and other property
 income. 

(4) 

A
 stabilized apartment community, or Same-Property apartment units (as
 defined in Item 7), are those units in properties that the Operating
 Partnership has consolidated for the entire two years as of the end of the
 period set forth. The number of apartment units in such properties may
 vary at each year-end. Percentage changes in averages per unit do not
 correspond to total Same-Property revenues and expense percentage changes
 which are discussed in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. 

(5) 

Average
 Same-Property monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents total
 scheduled rent for the same property apartment units for the period
 (actual rental rates on occupied apartment units plus market rental rates
 on vacant apartment units) divided by the number of such apartment units
 and further divided by the number of months in the
 period. 

(6) 

Average
 Same-Property monthly expenses per apartment unit represents total monthly

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto. These consolidated financial statements include all
adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair
statement of the results and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. 

OVERVIEW 

The
Operating Partnership acquires, develops, redevelops and manages apartment
communities in selected residential areas located primarily in the West Coast of
the United States. The Company is a self-administered and
self-managed REIT that owns all of its interests in its real properties,
directly or indirectly, through the Operating Partnership. The
Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of
December 31, 2007, had an approximately 90.9 general partner interest in the
Operating Partnership. 

Our
investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring of
existing markets, and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the
characteristics that underlie rental growth. Our strong financial
condition supports our investment strategy by enhancing our ability to quickly
shift our acquisition, development, and disposition activities to markets that
will optimize the performance of the portfolio. 

As of
December 31, 2007, we had ownership interests in 134 apartment communities,
comprising 27,489 apartment units. Our apartment communities are
located in the following major West Coast regions: 

Southern
California (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and
Ventura counties) 

 Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area) 

 Seattle Metro 
(Seattle metropolitan area) 

 Other
Region (Houston,
Texas) 

As of
December 31, 2007, we also had ownership interests in six office buildings (with
approximately 478,340 square feet), two recreational vehicle parks (comprising
338 spaces) and one manufactured housing community (containing 157
sites). 

As of
December 31, 2007, our consolidated development pipeline was comprised of three
development projects, five predevelopment projects and five land parcels held
for future development aggregating 2,776 units, with total incurred costs of
 233.5 million, and estimated remaining project costs of approximately 537.1
million for total estimated project costs of 770.6 million. 

By
region, the Operating Partnership's operating results for 2007 and rent growth
analysis for 2008 are as follows: 

Southern
California Region : As of December 31, 2007, this region
represented 48 of our apartment units. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
Same-Property (as defined below) revenues increased 4.4 as compared to
2006. The Operating Partnership expects in 2008 new residential
supply of 12,200 single family homes and 15,600 apartment units which represents
a total new supply of 0.5 of existing stock. The Operating
Partnership expects this region to add 40,000 new jobs and generate market rent
growth ranging from 1 to 3 in 2008. 

Northern
California Region : As of December 31, 2007, this region
represented 31 of our apartment units. Same-Property revenues
increased 9.4 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Operating Partnership
expects in 2008 new residential supply of 5,800 single family homes and 7,200
apartment units which represents a total new supply of 0.4 of existing
stock. The Operating Partnership expects this region to add 38,000
new jobs and generate market rent growth ranging from 5 to 7 in
2008. 

Seattle Metro
Region : As of
December 31, 2007, this region represented 20 of our apartment
units. Same-Property revenues increase 11.0 in 2007 as compared to
2006. The Operating Partnership expects in 2008 new residential
supply of 8,000 single family homes and 4,500 apartment units which represents a
total new supply of 1.2 of existing stock. The Operating Partnership
expects this region to add 28,000 new jobs and generate market rent growth
ranging from 5 to 7 in 2008. 

Other
Region : As of December 31, 2007, the remaining 1 of our units related to
a community located in Houston, Texas. During December 2007, the
Operating Partnership sold four communities that were located in the Portland

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Comparison
of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 

Our
average financial occupancies for the Operating Partnership s stabilized
apartment communities or 2007/2006 Same-Properties (stabilized properties
consolidated by the Operating Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006) decreased 60 basis points to 95.9 for the year ended December 31,
2007 from 96.5 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Financial occupancy is
defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total
possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual rental
revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions.
Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with
occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant
units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a
meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant
unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely
reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as
disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial
occupancy.

2007/2006 Same-Property
Revenues increased by 18.5 million or 6.5 to 303.5 million for 2007
compared to 285.1 million for 2006. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in scheduled rents of 20.4 million or 7.3 as
compared to 2006. Average monthly rental rates for 2007/2006
Same-Property communities were 1,314 per unit for 2007 compared to 1,225 per
unit for 2006. The decline in occupancy of 60 basis points in 2007
compared to 2006 decreased revenues by 2.3 million of which 0.8 million was
caused by vacancy created by units that were under renovation. Bad
debt expense and rent concessions increased 0.8 million, ratio utility billing
system RUBS income increased 0.8 million, and ancillary property income
increased 0.4 million for 2007 compared to 2006. 

2007/2006 Non-Same Property
Revenues increased by 30.2 million or 60.7 to 79.9 million for 2007
compared to 49.7 million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to
twelve communities acquired since January 1, 2006. 

Management and other fees from
affiliates increased only slightly by 0.1 million to 5.1 million in
2007. These fees consist of 4.8 million in fee income primarily from
Fund II and 0.3 million in promote income from Fund I in 2007, compared to 3.8
million in fee income primarily from Fund II and 1.2 million in promote income
from Fund I in 2006. 

Total Expenses increased
 47.8 million or 16.4 to 340.0 million for 2007 from 292.1 million for
2006. Property operating expenses increased by 14.0 million or 12.3 
for 2007, which is primarily due to the acquisition of twelve communities,
annual increases in property salaries. The increase includes an
increase of real estate taxes of 4.0 million due primarily to the increase in
the number of communities, increase in assessments for the Operating
Partnership s California communities that are limited to 2 per year and large
increases in assessments of the communities located in the Seattle metropolitan
area. Depreciation expense increased by 22.3 million or 28.5 
for 2007, due to the acquisition of twelve communities after January 1, 2006 and
recording depreciation expense for the Cadence Campus and Hollywood commercial
buildings, which are predevelopment properties with short-term tenant
leases. Interest expense increased 8.1 million or 11.1 due
primarily to due to an increase in funding of redevelopment and acquisitions on
the Operating Partnership s lines of credit and an increase of outstanding
mortgage notes payable. General and administrative costs increased
 4.0 million or 18.2 due to an increase in costs related to employees working
on Fund II development and redevelopment projects that can not be capitalized by
the Operating Partnership of approximately 1.5 million, an increase in the
number of employees, annual increases in compensation and increased
bonuses. 

Other expenses of 0.8
million for 2007 consists of a 0.5 million reserve for loan loss resulting from
the write-down of an impaired mezzanine note receivable related to a condominium
project located in Sherman Oaks, California, and a 0.3 million accrual for
unpaid business taxes related to the sale of the Essex on Lake Merritt in
2004. Other expenses of 1.8 million for the year ended 2006, relate
to 1.0 million in pursuit costs related to the Operating Partnership s attempt
to acquire the Town Country REIT, and a 0.8 million impairment charge
resulting from a write-down of a community in Houston, Texas. 

Interest and other income 
increased by 4.1 million or 66.9 to 10.3 million for 2007 from 6.2 million
for 2006 due primarily to an increase in lease income of 4.7 million resulting
from the income generated from the Cadence Campus and Hollywood commercial
buildings, and an increase of 1.5 million in interest income earned from the
mezzanine/bridge loans, compared to the Operating Partnership recorded a
non-recurring gain of 1.7 million related to the sale of Town Country
REIT stock in 2006. 

Equity income (loss) in
co-investments increased by 4.6 million to 3.1 million for 2007
compared to a loss of 1.5 million for 2006, due primarily to the recording of
 2.0 million from the partial sale of the Operating Partnership s interest in
the Mountain Vista, LLC joint venture in the first quarter of 2007 plus 0.3
million of equity income recorded from Fund I, and 0.4 million of equity income
earned from its investment in Fund II during 2007. Fund II operations
for 2006 included 2.7 million in depreciation resulting in the Operating
Partnership recording a loss of 1.5 million in equity income (loss) in
co-investments related to Fund II during 2006. 

Income from discontinued
operations for 2007 includes the gain from the sale of four communities
in the Portland metropolitan region of 51.9 million, sale of the City Heights
joint venture property net of minority interest for a gain of 13.7
million, 10.3 million in fees from the joint venture partner, and the net gain
on sale of 21 condominiums at Peregrine Point for 1.0
million. During the year ended 2006, income from discontinued
operations included a gain of 8.8 million from the sale of the Vista Pointe
joint venture property and 8.2 million in fees, a gain of 3.1 million on the
sales of Vista Capri East, Casa Tierra, and Diamond Valley properties, and a
gain of 2.0 million from the sale of the first 45 condominiums at Peregrine
Point.

2006/2005 Same-Property
Revenues increased by 18.1 million or 6.9 to 279.7 million for 2006
compared to 261.6 million for 2005. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in rental rates of 17.4 million or 6.5 , an
increase of 0.7 million in RUBS revenue, an increase of 0.7 million in
ancillary property income, and a decrease in rent concessions of 0.9 million
compared to the 2005. Bad debt expense was consistent for the
two years, and occupancy decreased in 2006 by 0.9 million as compared to
2005. 

2006/2005 Non-Same Property
Revenues increased by 13.4 million or 32.2 to 55.1 million for 2006
compared to 41.7 million for 2005. The increase in non-same property
revenues was primarily due to eight properties acquired since January 1,
2005. 

Management and other fees from
affiliates decreased by approximately 5.9 million or 54.1 for 2006 due
primarily to 7.1 million in promote income recorded during the year ended 2005
related to the sale of Fund I assets, as compared to 1.2 million in promote
income from Fund I during 2006. 

Total Expenses increased
 15.1 million or 5.5 to 292.1 million for 2006 from 277.0 million for
2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in utility expense,
real estate taxes, insurance expense, and salaries. Utility expense
increased by 3.1 million over the prior year due mainly to higher natural gas
and electrical prices. Real estate taxes increased 2.8 million over
the prior year due mainly to increases in assessment of properties in the
Seattle metropolitan area and new acquisitions. Insurance expense
increased 0.9 million over prior year due to increases in earthquake and
property liability premiums. Salaries increased mainly due to an
increase in payroll salaries over the prior year, an increase in equity based
compensation expense, and higher operating expenses due to the acquisition of
eight communities in 2006. 

Interest expense increased by
 2.1 million or 3 for 2006 to 72.9 million, net of 3.9 million in capitalized
interest, compared to 70.8 million, net of 1.1 in capitalized interest for
2005. The increase was mainly due to an increase in total outstanding
debt of 57 million between 2006 and 2005, and higher short-term borrowing
rates. 

32 

Other expenses decreased 4.1
million or 69.6 to 1.8 million for the year ended 2006 compared to 5.8
million for the year ended 2005. During 2006, the Operating
Partnership incurred 1.0 million in net pursuit costs related to the Operating
Partnership s attempt to acquire the Town Country REIT in the first
quarter of 2006 and the Operating Partnership recorded a 0.8 million impairment
charge on a property in Houston, Texas during the third quarter of
2006. During 2005, the Operating Partnership recorded the following
other expenses: (i) a 1.5 million charge related to a legal settlement, (ii)
 1.4 million in incentive compensation costs related to 6.1 million in interest
income realized on The Essex on Lake Merritt participating loan in the third
quarter of 2005, (iii) an impairment loss of 1.3 million related to a property
in Houston, Texas in the fourth quarter of 2005, and (iv) pre-payment penalties
and write-off of deferred charges in the amount of 1.6 million related to the
early termination of various mortgage notes payable during the fourth quarter of
2005. 

Gain on sale of real estate
 was 0 for 2006 compared to a gain of 6.4 million recorded for 2005
resulting from the recognition of a 5.0 million deferred gain due to the sale
of The Essex on Lake Merritt and 1.4 million from taxable REIT subsidiary
activity. 

Interest and other income was
comprised of 1.7 million for a gain on the sale of the Town Country REIT
stock recorded during the first quarter for 2006, 0.7 million of interest
income earned on notes receivables, 0.2 million in forfeited deposits from a
potential disposition and approximately 1.9 million in interest income on cash
balances, as compared to 6.1 million in interest income from the Essex on Lake
Merritt participating loan recorded in the third quarter of
2005. Lease income from the RV parks was consistent for both
periods. 

Equity (loss) income in
co-investments decreased 20.1 million for 2006 primarily due to gains
from the sale of Fund I properties during the year ended 2005 totaling 18.1
million. For 2006 the Operating Partnership recorded a net loss on
its investment in Fund II of 1.5 million, and there were no property sales in
Fund I or II during 2006. 

Income tax provision
 decreased by 2.0 million during 2006 due to less taxable income related
to taxable REIT subsidiary activity. 

Income from discontinued
operations for 2006 relates primarily to the gain on sale of 45 Peregrine
Point condominiums for 2.0 million, a gain on sale of the Vista Pointe joint
venture property for 8.8 million plus fees and promote income from that sale of
 8.2 million, a gain of 3.1 million on the sales of the Vista Capri East, Casa
Tierra, and Diamond Valley properties, and a gain of 6.7 million on the sale of
Emerald Palms community. Discontinued operations for 2005
relates primarily to the sale of the Eastridge Apartments in the second quarter
of 2005, for a gain on sale of 28.5 million, a gain of 0.7 million attributed
to the sale of four small assets, and 1.2 million in rental revenues related to
the Eastridge community. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Standard
and Poor's S P has issued a corporate credit rating of BBB/Stable for
Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. 

At
December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had 10.0 million of unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flows generated by our
operations, existing cash balances, availability under existing lines of credit,
access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the
disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably
anticipated cash needs during 2008. The timing, source and amounts of
cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are
sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital
markets environment, which can affect our plans for acquisitions, dispositions,
development and redevelopment activities. 

Essex has
a 200.0 million unsecured line of credit and, as of December 31, 2007, there
was 61.0 million balance on the line at an average interest rate of 6.2 . This
facility matures in March 2009, with an option for a one-year extension. The
underlying interest rate on this line is based on a tiered rate structure tied
to an S P rating on the credit facility (currently BBB-) at LIBOR plus
0.8 . We also have a 100.0 million credit facility from Freddie Mac,
which is secured by eight apartment communities and which matures in January
2009. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had 100.0
million outstanding under this line of credit at an average interest rate of
5.4 . The underlying interest rate on this line is between 55 and 59 basis
points over the Freddie Mac Reference Rate. In 2007, the Operating
Partnership entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit for 10.0 million
with a commercial bank with an initial maturity date of March
2008. Borrowing under this revolving line of credit bears an interest
rate at the bank s Prime Rate less 2.0 . As of December 31, 2007
there was an 8.8 million balance on the revolving line of credit at an average
interest rate of 5.6 . The line is used to fund short-term working
capital needs. The Operating Partnership s line of credit agreements
contain debt covenants related to limitations on indebtedness 

33 

and
liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated earnings before
depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of minimum tangible net
worth. Certain terms and covenants of the 200.0 million unsecured
line of credit were amended during the third quarter of 2007. The
Operating Partnership was in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Fund II has a credit
facility aggregating 21.0 million. This line bears interest at LIBOR
plus 0.875 and matures on May 30, 2008. 

During
the first quarter of 2007, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement
with the SEC, allowing the Company to sell an undetermined number or amount of
certain equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus. 

In August
2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to
allow the Company to acquire shares in an aggregate of up to 200
million. The program supersedes the common stock repurchase plan that
Essex announced on May 16, 2001. During 2007 the Company repurchased
and retired 323,259 shares of its common stock for approximately 32.6 million,
net of fees and commissions. During January 2008, the Company
repurchased an additional 137,500 shares for 13.2 million, net of fees and
commissions. As of February 2008, the Company may repurchase
approximately an additional 154 million of common stock under the current
plan. 

The
Company sold 5,980,000 shares of 4.875 Series G Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 149.5 million during the third
quarter of 2006. Holders may convert Series G Preferred Stock into
shares of the Company s common stock subject to certain
conditions. The conversion rate was initially .1830 shares of common
stock per the 25 share liquidation preference, which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately 136.62 per share of common stock (the
conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
events). The conversion rate was .1836 shares of common stock per 25
per share liquidation preference as of December 31, 2007. On or after
July 31, 2011, the Company may, under certain circumstances, cause some or all
of the Series G Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of common stock at
the then prevailing conversion rate. 

The
Operating Partnership, has 225.0 million of outstanding exchangeable senior
notes (the Notes with a coupon of 3.625 due 2025. The Notes are senior
unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership, and are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. On or after November 1,
2020, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holder into cash and,
in certain circumstances at Essex s option, shares of the Company s common stock
at an initial exchange price of 103.25 per share subject to certain
adjustments. The Notes will also be exchangeable prior to November 1,
2020, but only upon the occurrence of certain specified events. On or
after November 4, 2010, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of
the Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any). Note holders
may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the
Notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Notes on November 1,
2010, November 1, 2015 and November 1, 2020. 

As of
December 31, 2007, our mortgage notes payable totaled 1.26 billion which
consisted of 1.0 billion in fixed rate debt with interest rates varying from
4.86 to 8.18 and maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2018 and 233.1 million
of tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds with a weighted average interest rate
of 4.5 . The tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds have maturity dates ranging
from 2009 to 2039, and are subject to interest rate caps. 

In
January 2008, the Operating Partnership obtained a mortgage loan in the amount
of 49.9 million secured by Mirabella, a community located in Marina Del Rey,
California. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.21 , which
matures in January 2018, and the net proceeds were used to reduce
outstanding borrowings under the Operating Partnership s lines of
credit. 

The
Company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution. Until it
is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the Operating
Partnership primarily in short-term investment grade securities or is used by
the Operating Partnership to reduce balances outstanding under its line of
credit. 

The
Operating Partnership s current financing activities have not been severely
impacted by the tightening in the credit markets. Our strong balance
sheet, the established relationships with our unsecured line of credit bank
group and access to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac secured debt financing have
insulated us from the turmoil being experienced by many other real estate
companies. Recently, we have experienced some expansion in credit spreads
as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s tier 4 financing are currently at approximately
200 basis points over the relevant U.S. treasury securities. 

Derivative
Activity 

In April
2007, the Operating Partnership settled a 50.0 million forward-starting swap
and received 1.3 million from 

34 

the
counterparty. The accounting for the swap settlement reduces the
effective interest rate on the new Tierra Vista mortgage loan to
5.19 . As of December 31, 2007 the Operating Partnership had entered
into nine forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of
 450 million with interest rates ranging from 4.9 to 5.9 and settlements dates
ranging from April 2008 to October 2011. These derivatives qualify
for hedge accounting as they are expected to economically hedge the cash flows
associated with the refinancing of debt that matures between April 2008 and
October 2011. The fair value of the derivatives decreased 7.9
million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to a liability value of 10.2
million as of December 31, 2007, and the derivative liability was recorded in
other liabilities in the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial
statements. The changes in the fair values of the derivatives are
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the Operating
Partnership s consolidated financial statements. No hedge
ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006. 

Issuance
of Common Stock 

During
April 2007, the Company issued and sold approximately 170,500 shares of common
stock for 21.8 million, net of fees and commissions, under its Controlled
Equity Offering program. Under this program, the Company may from
time to time sell shares of common stock into the existing trading market at
current market prices, and the Operating Partnership anticipates using the net
proceeds from such sales to fund development, redevelopment pipelines, and pay
down outstanding borrowings under the Operating Partnership s lines of
credit. 

During
May 2007, the Company sold 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for proceeds of
 191.9 million, net of underwriter fees and expenses. The Operating
Partnership used net proceeds from the common stock sales to reduce outstanding
borrowings under the Operating Partnership s lines of credit. 

Capital
Expenditures 

Non-revenue
generating capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades that extend the
useful life of the property. For the year ended December 31, 2007, non-revenue
generating capital expenditures totaled approximately 919 per unit. The
Operating Partnership expects to incur approximately 950 per unit in
non-revenue generating capital expenditures for the year ended December 31,
2008. These expenditures do not include the improvements required in connection
with the origination of mortgage loans, expenditures for deferred maintenance on
acquisition properties, expenditures for property renovations and improvements
which are expected to generate additional revenue, and renovation expenditures
required pursuant to tax-exempt bond financings. Revenue-generating
expenditures totaled 11.0 million during 2007, and the Operating Partnership
expects to incur approximately 6.0 million in revenue generating capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Operating
Partnership expects that cash from operations and/or its lines of credit will
fund such expenditures. However, there can be no assurance that the actual
expenditures incurred during 2008 and/or the funding thereof will not be
significantly different than the Operating Partnership s current
expectations. 

Development
and Predevelopment Pipeline 

The
Operating Partnership defines development activities as new properties that are
being constructed, or are newly constructed and, in the case of development
communities, are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized
operations. As of December 31, 2007, excluding development projects
owned by Fund II, the Operating Partnership had three development projects
comprised of 684 units for an estimated cost of 236.7 million, of which 125.8
million remains to be expended. See discussion in the section, Risks
that development activities will be delayed or not completed and/or fail to
achieve expected results in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form
10-K. 

The
Operating Partnership defines the predevelopment pipeline as new properties in
negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming
development activities. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating
Partnership had five development communities aggregating 1,658 units that were
classified as predevelopment projects. The estimated total cost of
the predevelopment pipeline at December 31, 2007 was 508.4 million, of which
 411.3 million remains to be expended. The Operating
Partnership may also acquire land for future development
purposes. The Operating Partnership owned five land parcels
held for future development aggregating 434 units as of December 31, 2007. The
Operating Partnership had incurred 25.5 million in costs related to these five
land parcels as of December 31, 2007. 

The
Operating Partnership expects to fund the development pipeline by using a
combination of some or all of the following sources: its working capital,
amounts available on its lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private
equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of properties, if
any. 

35 

Redevelopment
Pipeline 

The
Operating Partnership defines redevelopment activities as existing properties
owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment
by the Operating Partnership with the expectation of increased financial returns
through property improvement. The Operating Partnership s
redevelopment strategy strives to improve the financial and physical aspects of
the Operating Partnership s redevelopment apartment communities and to target a
10 percent return on the incremental renovation investment. Many of
the Operating Partnership s properties are older and in excellent neighborhoods,
providing lower density with large floor plans that represent attractive
redevelopment opportunities. During redevelopment, apartment units
may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized
operations. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had
thirteen major redevelopment communities aggregating 3,891 apartment units with
estimated redevelopment costs of 135.6 million, of which approximately 74.6
million remains to be expended. These amounts exclude redevelopment
projects owned by Fund II. 

Alternative
Capital Sources 

Fund II
has eight institutional investors, and the Operating Partnership, with combined
partner equity commitments of 265.9 million. Essex has committed 75.0 million
to Fund II, which represents a 28.2 interest as general partner and limited
partner. Fund II utilized debt as leverage equal to approximately 65 of the
estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund II invested in
apartment communities in the Operating Partnership s targeted West Coast markets
and, as of December 31, 2007, owned eleven apartment communities and three
development projects. Essex records revenue for its asset management,
property management, development and redevelopment services when earned, and
promote income when realized if Fund II exceeds certain financial return
benchmarks.

Variable
Interest Entities 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
46 Revised (FIN 46R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51 , the Operating Partnership consolidates 19
DownREIT limited partnerships (comprising twelve properties), and an office
building that is subject to loans made by the Operating
Partnership. The Operating Partnership consolidates these entities
because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. The total
assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities (VIEs), net
of intercompany eliminations, were approximately 222.7 million and 163.9
million as of December 31, 2007 and 178.3 million and 110.9
million as of December 31, 2006, respectively. Interest
holders in VIEs consolidated by the Operating Partnership are allocated net
income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services
rendered or distributions from cash flow. The remaining results of
operations are generally allocated to the Operating Partnership. As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Operating Partnership was involved with two
VIEs, of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Total
assets and liabilities of these entities were approximately 71.7 million and
 78.5 million and 58.3 million and 58.4 million, as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The Operating Partnership does not have a
significant exposure to loss from its involvement with these unconsolidated
VIEs. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting 

36 

principles
requires the Operating Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We define critical accounting
policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise
their most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Our critical accounting
policies relate principally to the following key areas: (i) consolidation under
applicable accounting standards of various entities; (ii) assessing the carrying
values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint
ventures and affiliates; and (iii) internal cost capitalization. The
Operating Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current
market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those
estimates made by management. 

The
Operating Partnership assesses each entity in which it has an investment or
contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a
VIE. If such an entity is a VIE, then the Operating Partnership
analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is
the primary beneficiary. If the Operating Partnership is the primary
beneficiary, then the entity is consolidated. The analysis required
to identify VIEs and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental, and the
analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal
structures. 

The
Operating Partnership assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments
by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget
for operating properties and joint ventures, and by monitoring estimated costs
for properties under development. Local market knowledge and data is used to
assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition
opportunities. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable,
the carrying amount is evaluated. If the sum of the property s expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying
amount of the property, then the Operating Partnership will recognize an
impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value
of the property. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results
of real estate investments could result in impairment charges. When the
Operating Partnership determines that a property is held for sale, it
discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property. The criteria for
determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential
financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss
could occur upon determination of held for sale status. Assets held for sale are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs
to sell. With respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and
affiliates, the Operating Partnership looks to the underlying properties to
assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those
investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties.
An impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying
value of the investment exceeds its fair value. 

The
Operating Partnership capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs,
including interest and real estate taxes, incurred during development and
redevelopment activities. Interest is capitalized on real estate assets that
require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use. The amount of
interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development
expenditures during the reporting period. Included in capitalized costs are
management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and
indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment
activities. Indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs
associated with construction administration and development accounting, legal
fees, and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under
development. 

The
Operating Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates
could be different under different assumptions or conditions.

Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including
statements regarding the Operating Partnership's expectations, hopes,
intentions, beliefs and strategies regarding the future. Forward looking
statements include statements regarding the Operating Partnership's expectations
as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects
and the stabilization dates of such projects, expectation as to the total
projected costs and rental rates of development and redevelopment projects,
beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements
and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements,
expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures, expectations as to the
amount of non-revenue generating capital expenditures, future

redevelopment pipeline, the 

37 

anticipated
performance of existing properties, anticipated results from various geographic
regions, statements regarding the Operating Partnership's financing activities,
and the use of proceeds from such activities. 

Such
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors including, but not limited to, that the Operating Partnership will
fail to achieve its business objectives, that the actual completion of
development and redevelopment projects will be subject to delays, that the
stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed, that the total projected
costs of current development and redevelopment projects will exceed
expectations, , that such development and redevelopment projects will not be
completed, that development and redevelopment projects and acquisitions will
fail to meet expectations, that estimates of future income from an acquired
property may prove to be inaccurate, that future cash flows will be inadequate
to meet operating requirements and/or will be insufficient to provide for
dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements, that the actual
non-revenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the Operating
Partnership's current expectations, that there may be a downturn in the markets
in which the Operating Partnership's properties are located, that the terms of
any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness,
as well as those risks, special considerations, and other factors discussed
under the caption Potential Factors Affecting Future Operating Results below and
those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, and those risk
factors and special considerations set forth in the Operating Partnership's
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which may
cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Operating
Partnership to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and
the Operating Partnership assumes no obligation to update this
information. 

Potential
Factors Affecting Future Operating Results 

Many
factors affect the Operating Partnership s actual financial performance and may
cause the Operating Partnership s future results to be different from past
performance or trends. These factors include those set forth under
the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and
the following: 

Development
and Redevelopment Activities 

The
Operating Partnership pursues apartment communities and development and
redevelopment projects from time to time. These projects generally require
various government and other approvals, the receipt of which cannot be assured.
The Operating Partnership's development and redevelopment activities generally
entail certain risks, including the following: 

funds
 may be expended and management's time devoted to projects that may not be
 completed; 

construction
 costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the
 project economically unfeasible; 

projects
 may be delayed due to, among other things, adverse weather
 conditions; 

occupancy
 rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated;
 and 

expenses
 at a completed development project may be higher than
 anticipated. 

These
risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the Company's
stockholders. Further, the development and redevelopment of properties is also
subject to the general risks associated with real estate
investments. 

Interest
Rate Fluctuations 

The
Operating Partnership monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is
well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective.
However, current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could
increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels. The
immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result
in higher interest expense on the Operating Partnership's variable interest rate
debt. The effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact
the Operating Partnership's ability to make acquisitions and develop properties
at economic returns on investment and the Operating Partnership's ability to
refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risks 

Interest
Rate Hedging Activities 

The
Operating Partnership s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to
interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other
identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Operating Partnership
primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging
strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve
the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over
the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal
amount. As of December 31, 2007, we have entered into nine
forward-starting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the
interest-related cash outflows on forecasted issuance of long-term
debt. The forward-starting swaps are cash flow hedges of the
variability of forecasted interest payments associated with the refinancing of
the Operating Partnership s long-term debt between 2007 and 2011. As of December
31, 2007, the Operating Partnership also had 233.1 million of variable rate
indebtedness, of which 152.7 million is subject to interest rate cap
protection. All of our derivative instruments are designated as
cash flow hedges, and the Operating Partnership does not have any fair value
hedges as of December 31, 2007. The following table summarizes the
notional amount, carrying value, and estimated fair value of our derivative
instruments used to hedge interest rates as of December 31,
2007. The notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a
particular security that is currently hedged at one time, but does not represent
exposure to credit, interest rates or market risks. The table also includes a
sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments
from an increase or decrease in 10-year Treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis
points, as of December 31, 2007.

Interest
Rate Sensitive Liabilities 

The
Operating Partnership is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result
of its line of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund
capital expenditures and expansion of the Operating Partnership s real estate
investment portfolio and operations. The Operating Partnership s interest rate
risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its
objectives the Operating Partnership borrows primarily at fixed rates and may
enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps
and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument. The Operating Partnership does not enter into derivative
or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 

The
Operating Partnership s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of
techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average
interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows.
Management believes that the carrying amounts of its LIBOR debt approximates
fair value as of December 31, 2007 because interest rates, yields and other
terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently
available to the Operating Partnership for similar instruments. Management has
estimated that the fair value of the Operating Partnership s 1.25 billion of
fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at December 31, 2007 is
approximately 1.30 billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes
payable compared to those available in the marketplace.

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December

after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect
to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during
the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest
rates.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

As of
December 31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting management
to material information relating to the Operating Partnership that is required
to be included in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

There
were no changes in the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial
reporting, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Operating Partnership s internal control over financial
reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is
included herein.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
General Partner 

 Essex
Portfolio, L.P.: 

We have
audited Essex Portfolio, L.P. s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Essex Portfolio, L.P. s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

A
company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our
opinion, Essex Portfolio, L.P. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Essex
Portfolio, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, partners capital, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and
our report dated February 27, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
General Partner 

 Essex
Portfolio, L.P.: 

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Essex Portfolio, L.P.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, partners capital, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
also audited the accompanying financial statement schedule III. These
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying financial statement
schedule III are the responsibility of the Essex Portfolio L.P. s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying financial statement schedule III based on our
audits. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Essex Portfolio, L.P. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. 

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Essex Portfolio, L.P. s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February
27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Essex
Portfolio, L.P. s internal control over financial reporting.

Organization 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Essex
Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), and its
subsidiaries. Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the Company was
incorporated in the state of Maryland in March 1994. On June 13, 1994, the
Company commenced operations with the completion of an initial public offering
(the Offering in which it issued 6,275,000 shares of common stock at 19.50
per share. The net proceeds of the Offering of 112.1 million were used to
acquire a 77.2 general partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership. 

The
Company has a 90.9 general partner interest and the limited partners own a 9.1 
interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2007. The limited
partners may convert their 2,273,472 Operating Partnership units into an
equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has reserved shares of
common stock for such conversions. These conversion rights may be exercised by
the limited partners at any time through 2024. 

As of
December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership owned or had ownership interests in
134 apartment communities, (aggregating 27,489 units), six office
buildings, two recreational vehicle parks (totaling 338 spaces), and
one manufactured housing community (containing 157 sites) (collectively, the
 Properties ). The Properties are located in Southern California (Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and Ventura counties), Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), the Seattle metropolitan area, and
other region (Houston, Texas).

Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting Policies 

(a)
Principles of Consolidation 

The
accounts of the Operating Partnership, its controlled subsidiaries and the
variable interest entities VIEs in which it is the primary beneficiary are
consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
46 Revised FIN 46R ), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51 , the Operating Partnership consolidates 19
DownREIT limited partnerships (comprising twelve properties), an office building
that is subject to loans made by the Operating Partnership, and prior to the
sale of the property during 2007, the buildings and improvements that were owned
by a third-party subject to a ground lease on land that was owned by the
Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership consolidates these
entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under FIN
46R. The consolidated total assets and liabilities related to these
VIEs, net of intercompany eliminations, were approximately 222.7 million and
 163.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and 269.5 million and
 145.5 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2006. 

The
DownREIT entities that collectively own twelve apartment communities were
investments made under arrangements whereby Essex Management Company EMC became the general partner, the Operating Partnership became a special limited
partner, and the other limited partners were granted rights of redemption for
their interests. Such limited partners can request to be redeemed and the
Operating Partnership can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by issuing
shares of the Company's common stock on a one share per unit basis. Conversion
values will be based on the market value of the Company's common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company's current dividend rate times the number of units held. As of December
31, 2007, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to meet redemption
of these DownREIT entities is 1,201,012. As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, the carrying value of the other limited partners' interests is presented
at their historical cost and is classified within minority interests in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Minority
interests include the 9.1 and 9.6 limited partner interests in the Operating
Partnership not held by the Company at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company periodically adjusts the carrying value of minority interest in the
Operating Partnership to reflect its share of the book value of the Operating
Partnership. Such adjustments are recorded to stockholders equity as a
reallocation of minority interest in the Operating Partnership in the
accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity. The
minority interest balance also includes the Operating Partnership s cumulative
redeemable preferred units (see Note 12). 

F-9 

Interest
holders in VIEs consolidated by the Operating Partnership are allocated a
priority of net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders
for services rendered or distributions from cash flow. The remaining
results of operations are generally allocated to the Operating
Partnership. 

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Operating Partnership was involved with two VIEs,
of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Total assets
of these entities were approximately 71.7 million and 78.5 million and total
liabilities were approximately 58.3 million and 58.4 million, as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Operating Partnership
does not have a significant exposure to loss from its involvement with these
unconsolidated VIEs. 

(b)
Real Estate Rental Properties 

Significant
expenditures, which improve or extend the life of an asset and have a useful
life of greater than one year, are capitalized. Operating real estate
assets are stated at cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements,
furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their
development, redevelopment and acquisition. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 

The
depreciable life of various categories of fixed assets is as
follows: 

Computer
 software and equipment 

3 -
 5 years 

Interior
 unit improvements 

5
 years 

Land
 improvements and certain exterior components of real
 property 

10 years 

Real
 estate structures 

30
 years 

In
accordance with SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations
of Real Estate Projects, the Operating Partnership capitalizes predevelopment
costs incurred in the pursuit of new development opportunities, in the
negotiation process, as well as the entitlement process with a high likelihood
of the projects becoming development activities. Predevelopment costs
for which a future development is no longer considered probable are charged to
expense. All costs incurred with the predevelopment, development or
redevelopment of real estate assets are capitalized if they are clearly
associated with the predevelopment, development or redevelopment of rental
property, or are associated with the construction or expansion of real
property. Such capitalized costs include land, land improvements,
allocated costs of the Operating Partnership s project management staff,
construction costs, as well as interest and related loan fees, property taxes
and insurance. Capitalization begins for predevelopment, development,
and redevelopment projects when activity commences. Capitalization
ends when the apartment home is completed and the property is available for a
new resident. 

In
accordance with FASB s Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 SFAS No. 141 Business
Combinations, the Operating Partnership allocates the purchase price of
real estate to land and building, and identifiable intangible assets, such as
the value of above, below and at-market in-place leases. The values of the above
and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either a decrease (in the
case of above market leases) or an increase (in the case of below market leases)
to rental revenue over the remaining term of the associated leases
acquired. The value of acquired at-market leases are amortized to
expense over the term the Operating Partnership expects to retain the acquired
tenant, which is generally 20 months. 

In
accordance with SFAS No. 141 and its applicability to acquired in-place leases,
we perform the following evaluation for properties we acquire: 

(1) 

estimate the value of the real
 estate as if vacant as of the acquisition date; 

(2) 

allocate that value among land
 and building and determine the associated asset life for each; 

(3) 

compute the value of the
 difference between the as if vacant value and the purchase price, which
 will represent the total intangible assets; 

(4) 

allocate the value of the above
 and below market leases to the intangible assets and determine the
 associated life of the above market/ below market
 leases; 

(5) 

allocate
 the remaining intangible value to the at-market in-place leases or
 customer relationships, if any, and the associated lives of these
 assets. 

Whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
property held for investment or held for sale may not be fully recoverable, the
carrying amount will be evaluated for impairment. If the sum of the property s
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
than the carrying amount 

F-10 

(including
intangible assets) of the property, then the Operating Partnership will
recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of the property. Such fair value of a property is
determined using conventional real estate valuation methods, such as discounted
cash flow, the property s unleveraged yield in comparison to the unleveraged
yields and sales prices of similar properties that have been recently sold, and
other third party information, if available. Properties held for sale
are carried at the lower of cost and fair value less estimated costs to
sell. 

During
the second quarter of 2006, the Operating Partnership recorded an impairment
loss of 0.8 million and in fourth quarter of 2005 the Operating Partnership
recorded an impairment loss of 1.3 million resulting from write-downs of a
property s value in Houston, Texas, to reduce the property s carrying value to
its estimated fair value. The impairment charges are recorded in
other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. 

In the
normal course of business, the Operating Partnership will receive offers for
sale of its Properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that
are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period
before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters
to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this
process. The Operating Partnership classifies real estate as "held
for sale" when all criteria under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
144 SFAS No. 144 ), " Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets " have been met. In accordance
with SFAS No. 144, the Operating Partnership presents income and gains/losses on
properties sold as discontinued operations net of minority interests. Real
estate investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting remain
classified in continuing operations upon disposition. (See Note 7 for
a description of the Operating Partnership s discontinued operations for 2007,
2006, and 2005). 

(c)
Co-investments 

The
Operating Partnership owns investments in joint ventures co-investments in
which it has significant influence, but its ownership interest does not meet the
criteria for consolidation in accordance with FIN 46R or Emerging Issues Task
Force Consensus No. 04-05 EITF 04-05 ), Determining Whether a General
Partner or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or
Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights . Therefore, the Operating Partnership accounts for
these investments using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method
of accounting, the investment is carried at the cost of assets contributed, plus
the Operating Partnership s equity in earnings less distributions received and
the Operating Partnership s share of losses. 

A
majority of these co-investments compensate the Operating Partnership for its
asset management services and some of these investments may provide promote
distributions if certain financial return benchmarks are
achieved. Asset management fees are recognized when earned, and
promote fees are recognized when the earnings events have occurred and the
amount is determinable and collectible. Asset management fees and promote fees
are reflected in interest and other and equity income in co-investments,
respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. 

(d)
Revenues and Gains on Sale of Real Estate 

Revenues
from tenants renting or leasing apartment units, recreational vehicle park
spaces or manufactured housing community spaces are recorded when due from
tenants and are recognized monthly as they are earned, which is not materially
different than on a straight-line basis. Units or spaces are rented
under short-term leases (generally, lease terms of 6 to 12 months) and may
provide no rent for one or two months, depending on the market conditions and
leasing practices of the Operating Partnership s competitors in each sub-market
at the time the leases are executed. Revenues from tenants
leasing commercial space are recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of
the respective lease. 

The
Operating Partnership recognizes gains on sales of real estate when a contract
is in place, a closing has taken place, the buyer s initial and continuing
investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and
the Operating Partnership does not have a substantial continuing involvement in
the property. 

(e)
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

Highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased are classified as cash equivalents. Restricted cash balances relate
primarily to reserve requirements for capital replacement at certain Properties
in connection with the Operating Partnership s mortgage debt. 

F-11 

(f) Marketable
Securities 

Marketable
securities consist of U.S. treasury or agency securities with
original maturities of more than three months when purchased. The
Operating Partnership has classified these debt securities as held-to-maturity
securities, and the Operating Partnership reports the securities at amortized
cost. Realized gains and losses and interest income are included in
interest and other income on the consolidated statement of
operations. 

(g)
Notes Receivable and Interest Income 

Notes
receivable relate to real estate financing arrangements including mezzanine and
bridge loans that exceed one year. They bear interest at a rate based on the
borrower s credit quality and are recorded at face value. Interest is recognized
over the life of the note. The Operating Partnership requires collateral for the
notes. 

Each note
is analyzed to determine if it is impaired pursuant to SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan . A note is impaired if it is probable
that the Operating Partnership will not collect all principal and interest
contractually due. The Operating Partnership does not accrue interest
when a note is considered impaired. All cash receipts on impaired notes are
applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has
been recovered and, thereafter, are recognized as interest income. 

(h)
Interest Rate Protection, Swap, and Forward Contracts 

The
Operating Partnership has from time to time used interest rate protection, swap
and forward contracts to manage its interest rate exposure on current or
identified future debt transactions. The Operating Partnership accounts for such
derivative contracts using SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, derivative
instruments are required to be included in the balance sheet at fair value. The
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are accounted for depending on the
use of the derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as a part
of a hedging relationship. 

The
Operating Partnership records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends
on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives
used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability,
or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate
risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure
to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. 

For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the
derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other
comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in
earnings. The Operating Partnership assesses the initial and ongoing
effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair
value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in
fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For
derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings. All existing instruments are considered cash flow hedges, and the
Operating Partnership does not have any fair value hedges as of December 31,
2007. 

The
Operating Partnership s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to
interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other
identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Operating Partnership
primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging
strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve
the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over
the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal
amount. 

Amounts
reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to derivatives
will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the
Operating Partnership s hedged debt. The Operating Partnership is
hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a portion of
its forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 46 months as of December
31, 2007. 

(i)
Deferred Charges 

Deferred
charges are principally comprised of loan fees and related costs which are
amortized over the terms of the related borrowing in a manner which approximates
the effective interest method. 

F-12 

(j)
Income Taxes 

In order
to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Operating Partnership utilizes
taxable REIT subsidiaries for various revenue
generating or investment activities. The taxable REIT subsidiaries are
consolidated by the Operating Partnership. The activities and tax related
provisions, assets and liabilities are not material. 

(k)
Preferred Equity 

The
Operating Partnership classifies its Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Equity Series G Preferred Equity based on Emerging Issues Task
Force Topic D-98, EITF D-98 Classification and Measurement of
Redeemable Securities. The Series G Preferred Equity contains
fundamental change provisions that allow the holder to redeem the preferred
stock for cash if certain events occur. The redemption under these
provisions is not solely within the Operating Partnership s control, thus the
Operating Partnership has classified the Series G Preferred Equity as temporary
equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

The
Operating Partnership classifies its Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Equity Series F Preferred Equity based on EITF D-98. The Series F
Preferred Stock contains fundamental change provisions that allow the holder to
redeem the preferred stock for cash if certain events occur. The
redemption under these provisions is within the Operating Partnership s control,
and thus the Operating Partnership has classified the Series F Preferred Equity
as permanent equity in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. 

(l)
Stock-based Compensation 

The
Operating Partnership accounts for share based compensation using the fair value
method of accounting. The estimated fair value of stock options
granted by the Operating Partnership is being amortized over the vesting period
of the stock options. The estimated grant date fair values of the
long term incentive plan units (discussed in Note 14) are being amortized over
the expected service periods. 

(m)
Legal costs 

Legal
costs associated with matters arising out of the normal course of our business
are expensed as incurred. Legal costs incurred in connection with non-recurring
litigation that is not covered by insurance are accrued when amounts are
probable and estimable. 

(n)
Accounting Estimates and Reclassifications 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), requires the Operating
Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Operating Partnership
evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and
assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties, its investments in
and advances to joint ventures and affiliates, its notes receivable and its
qualification as a REIT. The Operating Partnership bases its
estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be
different under different assumptions or conditions. 

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to
the current year presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact
on reported earnings, total assets or total liabilities. 

(o)
New Accounting Pronouncements 

In July
2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48 ). FIN
48 establishes new evaluation and measurement processes for all income tax
positions taken, and requires expanded disclosures of income tax
matters. The adoption of this FIN on January 1, 2007 did not have a
material impact on the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements FAS 157 ). FAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to
measure assets and liabilities. This statement clarifies the
principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. FAS 157
establishes a fair value hierarchy, giving the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. This statement
is effective in fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. 

F-13 

The
Operating Partnership believes that the adoption of this standard will not have
a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS No. 159 ). FAS 159
expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. This Statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Operating Partnership
does not plan to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair
value upon the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2008. 

In
December 2007, the FASB issued revised SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations FAS 141(R) . FAS141(R)
establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and
measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree; 

 recognizes and measures
the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the
financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. The objective of the guidance is to improve the relevance,
representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a
reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination
and its effects. FAS 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, Management is
currently evaluating the impact FAS 141(R) will have on the Operating
Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements FAS 160 ). FAS 160 establishes accounting
and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but
separate from the parent s equity; the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly
identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income;
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its
controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently;
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity
investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value; and
entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish
between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling
owners. The objective of the guidance is to improve the relevance,
comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting
entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. FAS 160 is effective
for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Management is
currently evaluating the impact FAS 160 will have on the Operating Partnership s
consolidated financial statements. 

(3)
Real Estate 

(a)
Sales of Real Estate and Assets Held for Sale 

Each
property is considered a separately identifiable component of the Operating
Partnership and is reported in discontinued operations when the operations and
cash flows of the property have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing
operations of the Operating Partnership as a result of a disposal
transaction. 

In
December 2007, the Operating Partnership sold four communities (875-units) in
the Portland metropolitan area for 97.5 million, resulting in a gain of 47.6
million net of minority interest. The proceeds from the sale were
used in a tax-free reverse exchange for the purchase of Mill Creek at Windermere
in September 2007 

In
February 2007, the Operating Partnership sold the joint venture property City
Heights Apartments, a 687-unit community located in Los Angeles, California for
 120 million. The Operating Partnership s share of the proceeds from the sale
totaled 33.9 million, resulting in a 13.7 million gain on sale to the
Operating Partnership, and an additional 10.3 million for fees from the joint
venture partner, both of which are included in income from discontinued
operations. As of December 31, 2006, City Heights was classified as
held for sale. 

For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the gain on the sale of the Eastridge apartment
community was 28.5 million. An additional 2.2 million was deferred
as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The 2.2 million was deferred
because it is due and payable to the Operating Partnership only upon the sale of
units following a condominium conversion which was still in progress as of
December 31, 2007. This transaction was included in
discontinued operations as we had no other ongoing involvement with the
Property. 

F-14 

For the
year ended December 31, 2005, 5.0 million previously deferred gain on the sale
of The Essex on Lake Merritt apartment community was recognized on the cost
recovery method when the cash was received. The 5.0 million was deferred
because it was due and payable to the Operating Partnership only upon the sale
of units following a condominium conversion. The sale transaction was included
in continuing operations as we continued to manage the rented apartment units in
the project during the conversion process. 

(b)
Co-investments 

The
Operating Partnership has joint venture investments in a number of
co-investments which are accounted for under the equity method. The joint
ventures own and operate apartment communities. 

Essex
Apartment Value Fund, L.P. Fund I ), was an investment fund organized by the
Operating Partnership in 2001 to add value through rental growth and asset
appreciation, utilizing the Operating Partnership s acquisition, development,
redevelopment and asset management capabilities. Fund I was considered fully
invested in 2003. An affiliate of the Operating Partnership, Essex VFGP, L.P. VFGP ), was a 1 general partner and was a 20.4 limited partner. The
Operating Partnership owned a 99 limited partnership interest in
VFGP. Fund I acquired or developed ownership interests in 19
apartment communities, representing 5,406 apartment units. 

Fund I
sold its apartment communities during 2004 and 2005. The Fund I
dispositions in 2005 resulted in the Operating Partnership recognizing equity
income from the gain on the sale of investments of 18.1 million, and 7.0
million in promote income. During 2006, the Operating Partnership
recorded an additional 1.2 million in promote income related to the
dispositions of assets in 2005, and during 2007 the Operating Partnership
recorded 0.3 million in gain on its investment and 0.3 million in promote
income related to the final liquidation of Fund I assets. 

Essex
Apartment Value Fund II, L.P. Fund II ), has eight institutional investors,
and the Operating Partnership, with combined partner equity commitments of
 265.9 million. Essex has committed 75.0 million to Fund II, which represents a
28.2 interest as general partner and limited partner. Fund II utilized debt as
leverage equal to approximately 65 of the estimated value of the underlying
real estate. Fund II invests in apartment communities in the
Operating Partnership s targeted West Coast markets with an emphasis on
investment opportunities in the Seattle metropolitan area and the San Francisco
Bay Area. Subject to certain exceptions, Fund II had been Essex s primary
investment vehicle during 2005 and 2006. As of October 2006, Fund II was fully
invested and closed for any future acquisitions or development. As of
December 31, 2007, Fund II owned eleven apartment communities and three
development projects. No properties have been sold by Fund
II. Consistent with Fund I, Essex records revenue for its asset
management, property management, development and redevelopment services when
earned, and promote income when realized if Fund II exceeds certain financial
return benchmarks. 

In August
2005, the Operating Partnership purchased 500,000 Series A Preferred shares in
Multifamily Technology Solutions, Inc. MTS ). The Operating
Partnership owns less than 5 of the voting stock of MTS and therefore accounts
for this investment on the cost method. 

During
2006, the Operating Partnership made a contribution to a development with a
joint venture partner totaling 3.4 million, and made additional contributions
to this joint venture of 0.7 million during 2007. The development is
located in Southern California and as of December 31, 2007 was still in the
predevelopment stage. 

During
March 2007, the Mountain Vista Apartments, LLC, a joint venture that owns the
Waterstone at Fremont apartments in Fremont, California, was recapitalized with
the inclusion of a new joint venture partner, and as part of this transaction
the Operating Partnership received 7.7 million in net distributions from the
joint venture. The Operating Partnership accounted for this
transaction as a partial sale of the Operating Partnership s investment and
recorded a gain of 2.0 million which is included in equity income in
co-investments as a result of this transaction. As of December 31,
2007, the Operating Partnership s carrying value of its remaining investment in
the amended and restated Mountain Vista Apartments, LLC joint venture was 1.2
million. During January 2008, the Operating Partnership collected
 7.5 million in connection with the return of its remaining interest in the
joint venture and recognized income of 6.3 million from its preferred
interest. 

The
Operating Partnership had a developer agreement to distribute to the general
contractor of Mirabella apartments 20 of the property s cash flow after the
Operating Partnership receives a 9 cumulative preferred return on its
investment from operating cash flow and a 12 preferred return on its investment
from capital transactions cash flow. During the third quarter
of 2007, the Operating Partnership acquired the general contractor's interest in
the Mirabella property for 9 million in lieu of distributing a percentage of
future cash flows to the general contractor per 

F-15 

the
agreement, accordingly, Mirabella became wholly owned by the Operating
Partnership.

Real Estate Under Development 

The
Operating Partnership defines real estate under development activities as new
properties that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and, in the case
of development communities, are in a phase of lease-up and 

F-16 

have not
yet reached stabilized operations. As of December 31, 2007, excluding
development projects owned by Fund II, the Operating Partnership had three
development projects comprised of 684 units for an estimated cost of 236.7
million, of which 125.8 million remains to be expended. 

The
Operating Partnership defines the predevelopment pipeline as new properties in
negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming
development activities. As of December 31, 2007, the Operating
Partnership had five development communities aggregating 1,658 units that were
classified as predevelopment projects. The estimated total cost of
the predevelopment pipeline at December 31, 2007 is 508.4 million, of which
 411.3 million remains to be expended. The Operating Partnership owns
land parcels held for future development aggregating 434 units as of December
31, 2007. The Operating Partnership had incurred 25.5 million in
costs related to these five land parcels as of December 31, 2007.

As of
December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership originated five notes receivables
totaling 47.4 million which are mezzanine or bridge loans. The
borrowers under each note receivable have the right to extend the maturity date
if certain criteria are met specific to each agreement. During August
2006, the Operating Partnership originated a loan with the owners of a 26-unit
apartment community in Sherman Oaks, California. The proceeds from the loan
financed the conversion of the units to condominiums for
sale. Effective July 1, 2007, the Operating Partnership had ceased
accruing interest on the note, due to the current velocity of sales, pricing,
and status of the interest reserve. During the fourth quarter of
2007, the Operating Partnership recorded an allowance for loan loss in the
amount of 0.5 million on this impaired note receivable, which is approximately
equal to accrued and unpaid interest recorded from inception of the note through
June 30, 2007. The Operating Partnership believes that the current
loan balance of 5.4 million is collectible through the future sales of 17
unsold condominium units.

The
Company s Chairman, George Marcus, is the Chairman of TMMC, which is a real
estate brokerage firm. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
the Operating Partnership paid brokerage commissions totaling 1.3 million, 0.8
million, and 0 to TMMC on the purchase and sales of real estate. 

Mr.
Marcus was an investor in the two partnerships that owned the Thomas Jefferson
Apartments that was acquired by the Operating Partnership during September 2007
in a DownREIT transaction. In conjunction with that transaction, Mr.
Marcus received 7,006 DownREIT units in exchange for his partnership interests
in those apartments. The Company s independent Board of Directors
approved the acquisition of the apartment community. 

Mr.
Marcus is the Chairman of the Urban Housing Group UHG ), a subsidiary of
TMMC. During December 2007, UHG sold the rights to the Operating
Partnership to acquire the Fourth Street development land parcel in Berkeley,
California for 2.8 million. The amount paid to the Urban Housing
Group included reimbursement for the costs incurred by UHG to entitle the
property for development. The Company s independent Board of Directors approved
the acquisition of the rights to the land parcel.

Discontinued Operations 

In the
normal course of business, the Operating Partnership will receive offers for
sale of its properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that
are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period
before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters
to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this
process. Essex classifies real estate as "held for sale" when all
criteria under SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets" SFAS 144 have been met. 

In
January 2005, the Operating Partnership sold four non-core assets that were
acquired for 14.9 million. The four non-core assets were: The
Riviera Recreational Vehicle Park and a Manufactured Home Park, located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, for which the Operating Partnership had previously entered into
master lease and option agreements with an unrelated entity; and two small
office buildings, located in San Diego California. The Operating
Partnership recorded a gain of 0.7 million on the sale of these
assets. The Operating Partnership has recorded the gain on sale and
operations for these assets as part of discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

In June
2005, the Operating Partnership sold the Eastridge apartments, a 188-unit
apartment community located in San Ramon, California for approximately 47.5
million. In conjunction with the sale, the Operating Partnership
deferred 2.2 million of the gain on the sale of Eastridge because Essex,
through a TRS, originated a participating loan to the buyer in the amount of
approximately 2.2 million, which allows the Operating Partnership to
financially participate in the buyer s condominium conversion
plan. The gain on the sale of the Eastridge property net of the
deferral of the 2.2 participating loan was 28.5 million. The
Operating Partnership has recorded the gain on sale and operations for Eastridge
apartments as part of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. 

In
January 2006, the Operating Partnership sold Vista Capri East and Casa Tierra
apartment communities for approximately 7.0 million and in March 2006, the

million. The Operating Partnership has recorded the gain on sale and
operations for the three properties as part of discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

In June
2006, the unconsolidated joint venture property, Vista Pointe, a 286-unit
apartment community located in Anaheim, California, was sold for approximately
 46.0 million. The Operating Partnership s share of the proceeds from the
transaction totaled 19.3 million, resulting in an 8.8 million gain on the
sale, and an additional 8.2 million for fees and a promote distribution. The
Operating Partnership has recorded the ground lease income and all related gains
and fees from the Vista Pointe joint venture as part of discontinued operations
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Partnership s share of the proceeds from the sale totaled 33.9 million,
resulting in a 13.7 million gain, net of minority interest, to the Operating
Partnership, and an additional 10.3 million for fees from the City Heights
joint venture partner are included in discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Lines of Credit 

The
Operating Partnership has three outstanding lines of credit in the aggregate
committed amount of 310.0 million as of December 31, 2007. In March
2006, the Operating Partnership renegotiated its revolving line of credit to
increase the maximum principal amount to 200.0 million from 185.0
million. Additionally, the maturity date 

F-20 

was
extended from April 2007 to March 2009, with an option for a one-year extension,
and the underlying rate, based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company s
corporate ratings, was reduced to LIBOR plus 0.8 from LIBOR plus
1.0 . Certain terms and covenants of the 200.0 million unsecured
line of credit were amended during the third quarter of 2007. The
balance on this line of credit was 61.0 million as of December 31, 2007, which
yielded an average interest rate of 6.2 . No amounts were outstanding
as of December 31, 2006. The Operating Partnership also has a 100
million credit facility from Freddie Mac, which is secured by eight of the
Operating Partnership s apartment communities. The underlying
interest rate on this line is between 55 and 59 and basis points over the
Freddie Mac Reference Rate. As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, 100.0 million and 93.0 million was outstanding under this
line of credit, respectively, which yielded an average interest rate of 5.4 and
6.2 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and matures in January
2009. During March 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into an unsecured
revolving line of credit for 10.0 million with a commercial bank with an
initial maturity date of March 2008. Borrowings under this revolving line of
credit bear an interest rate at the bank s Prime Rate less
2.0 . As of December 31, 2007, there was an 8.8 million
balance on the revolving line of credit at an average interest rate of
5.6 . The credit agreements contain debt covenants related to
limitations on indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of
consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and
maintenance of minimum tangible net worth. The Operating
Partnership was in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of December
31, 2007 and 2006. 

(10)
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

During
March 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a ten-year forward-starting
interest rate swap for a notional amount of 50 million and a settlement date on
or before October 1, 2011. 

During
April 2007, the Operating Partnership refinanced a mortgage loan for 35.7
million secured by the Tierra Vista property in the amount of 62.5 million,
with a fixed interest rate of 5.47 , which matures in April 2017. In
conjunction with this transaction the Operating Partnership settled a 50
million forward-starting swap and received 1.3 million from the
counterparty. The accounting for the swap settlement reduces the
effective interest rate on the new Tierra Vista mortgage loan to
5.19 . 

As of
December 31, 2007 the Operating Partnership had entered into nine
forward-starting interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 450 million
with interest rates ranging from 4.9 to 5.9 and settlements dates ranging from
April 2008 to October 2011. These derivatives qualify for hedge
accounting as they are expected to economically hedge the cash flows associated
with the refinancing of debt that matures between April 2008 and October
2011. The fair value of the derivatives decreased 7.9 million during
the year ended December 31, 2007 to a liability value of 10.2 million as of
December 31, 2007, and the derivative liability was recorded in other
liabilities in the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial
statements. The changes in the fair values of the derivatives are
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the Operating
Partnership s consolidated financial statements. No hedge
ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006. 

(11)
Lease Agreements 

During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Operating Partnership entered into lease and
purchase option agreements with unrelated third parties related to its five
recreational vehicle RV parks that were comprised of 1,717 spaces and two
manufactured housing communities that contain 607 sites. At the time
of agreement, the unrelated third parties had an option to purchase the assets
in approximately four years for approximately 41.7 million, which was a 5 
premium to the gross book value of the assets. The Operating Partnership
received 0.5 million as consideration for entering into the option agreement
and a non-refundable upfront payment of 4.0 million, which was recorded as
deferred revenue and has been amortized into income over the five year lease
term. Under the lease agreements, Essex receives fixed monthly lease
payments and passes through all executory costs such as property
taxes. In January 2005, the Operating Partnership sold Riviera
RV Resort and Riviera Mobile Home Park. As of December 31, 2007, the
Operating Partnership still owns two RV parks totaling 338 spaces, and one
manufactured housing community that contains 157 sites. 

The
Operating Partnership owns two predevelopment projects that it leases to
tenants. Cadence Campus is an office building, and Essex-Hollywood is
a commercial building currently utilized as a production studio, and both
properties are 100 leased to single tenants. The lease at Cadence
Campus will expire in January 2009 and the tenant has a right to two six-month
extensions, and the Essex-Hollywood lease will expire in July
2008. These two properties generated lease income totaling 4.7
million during the year ended December 31, 2007, which was recorded as net

F-21 

lease
income and included in interest and other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense is not being
capitalized on these properties while they are leased, and depreciation expense
is being recorded on these properties until the leases expire. 

The
Operating Partnership is also a lessor of an office building located in Southern
California. The tenants lease terms expire at various times through 2009 with
average annual lease payments of approximately 1.3 million. The
future minimum non-cancelable base rent to be received under the Cadence Campus,
Essex-Hollywood, the two office buildings in Southern California, the RV parks
and manufactured housing community operating leases for each of the years ending
after December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows:

In
September 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock Series F Preferred Stock at a fixed price of
 24.664 per share, a discount from the 25.00 per share liquidation value of the
shares. The shares pay quarterly distributions at an annualized rate of
7.8125 per year of the liquidation value and are redeemable by the Company on
or after September 23, 2008. The shares were issued pursuant to the
Company s existing shelf registration statement. The Company used the net
proceeds from this sale of Series F Preferred Stock to redeem all of the 9.125 
Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the Series C Preferred Units of Essex Portfolio, L.P., of which the Company is the general
partner. 

In
January 2004, the Operating Partnership restructured its previously issued
 50,000, 9.30 Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series D
Units"), and its previously issued 80,000, 7.875 Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Units"). The existing
distribution rate of 9.30 of the Series D Units continued until July 27, 2004 
the end of the non-call period. Effective July 28, 2004, the
distribution rate on the Series D Units was reduced to 7.875 . The
date that the Series D Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option was
extended by six years to July 28, 2010. The date that the Series B
Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option was extended from February
6, 2003 to December 31, 2009. 

F-22 

During
the third quarter of 2006, the Company sold 5,980,000 shares of 4.875 Series G
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 149.5
million. Holders may convert Series G Preferred Stock into shares of
the Company s common stock subject to certain conditions. The
conversion rate will initially be .1830 shares of common stock per the 25 share
liquidation preference, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of
approximately 136.62 per share of common stock (the conversion rate will be
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events). On or
after July 31, 2011, the Company may, under certain circumstances, cause some or
all of the Series G Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares
of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate. 

Common
Stock Offerings 

During
2006, the Company issued and sold approximately 427,700 shares of common
stock for 48.3 million, net of fees and commissions under its Controlled Equity
Offering program. Under this program, the Company may from time to time sell
shares of common stock into the existing trading market at current market
prices, and the Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from such sales to
primarily fund the development, redevelopment pipelines, and pay down
outstanding borrowing under the Operating Partnership s lines of
credit. 

During
April 2007, the Company issued and sold approximately 170,500 shares of common
stock for 21.8 million, net of fees and commissions, under its Controlled
Equity Offering program. 

During
May 2007, the Company sold 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for proceeds of
 191.9 million, net of underwriter fees and expenses. The Operating

Common
Stock Repurchases 

In August
2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to
allow the Company to acquire shares in an aggregate of up to 200
million. The program supersedes the common stock repurchase plan that

The
Operating Partnership has the ability and intent to redeem DownREIT Limited
Partnership units for cash and does not consider them to be common unit
equivalents. 

(1) 

On
 or after November 1, 2020, the holders of the 225 million exchangeable
 notes may exchange, at the then applicable exchange rate, the notes for
 cash and, at Essex s option, a portion of the notes may be exchanged for
 Essex common stock; the current exchange rate is 103.25 per share of
 Essex common stock. The exchangeable notes will also be
 exchangeable prior to November 1, 2020, but only upon the occurrence of
 certain specified events. During 2007, the weighted average
 common stock price exceeded the 103.25 strike price and therefore common
 stock issuable upon exchange of the exchangeable notes was included in the
 diluted share count. The treasury method was used to determine
 the shares to be added to the denominator for the calculation of earnings
 per diluted unit. 

Stock
options of 25,326, 1,014, and 22,229 for 2007, 2006, 2005, respectively, were
not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the exercise
price of the options was greater than the average market price of the common
shares for the twelve months ended and, therefore, were
anti-dilutive. 

5,980,000
shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock Series G have been excluded
from diluted earnings per share for 2007 and 2006 as the effect was
anti-dilutive.

Stock Based Compensation Plans 

Stock
Options and Restricted Stock 

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Operating Partnership adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123 Revised SFAS No. 123(R) ), Share-Based Payment , a
revision of SFAS No. 123 using the modified prospective
approach. SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to recognize in
the income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity
based compensation issued to employees. 

The Essex
Property Trust, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides incentives to attract
and retain officers, directors and key employees. The Stock Incentive Plan
provides for the grants of options to purchase a specified number of shares of
common stock or grants of restricted shares of common stock. Under the Stock
Incentive Plan, the total number of shares available for grant is approximately
1,200,000. The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation
Committee is comprised of independent directors. The
Compensation Committee is authorized to establish the exercise price; however,
the exercise price cannot be less than 100 of the fair market value of the
common stock on the grant date. The Operating Partnership s options have a life
of ten years. Option grants for officers and employees fully vest between one
year and five years after the grant date. 

Stock-based
compensation expense for options and restricted stock under the fair value
method totaled approximately 1.2 million, 1.1 million and 0.8 million, for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Stock-based compensation capitalized for options
totaled approximately 0.2 million, 0.2 million and none for the year ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The intrinsic value
of the options exercised totaled 6.3 million, 6.0 million, and 4.1 million,
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. The intrinsic value of the options outstanding and
fully vested totaled 9.9 million, 14.3 million, and 10.8 million, for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Total
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation
granted under the stock option and restricted plans totaled 0.8 million as
of 

F-24 

December
31, 2007. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 3 to 5 years for the stock option
plans. 

The
average fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 was 11.58, 17.40 and 10.06 per share, respectively, and
was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model

During
2007, the Company issued 17,178 shares of restricted stock. The unrecognized
compensation cost is expected to be recognized straight-line over a period of 7
years less an estimate for forfeitures. 

Long
Term Incentive Plan Z Units 

The Company has adopted an
incentive program involving the issuance of Series Z Incentive Units and Series
Z-1 Incentive Units (collectively referred to as Z Units of limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Vesting in
the Z Units is based on performance criteria established in the
plan. The criteria can be revised at the beginning of the year by the
Board's Compensation Committee if the Committee deems that the plan's criterion
is unachievable for any given year. The sale of Z units is
contractually prohibited and cannot be converted into Operating Partnership
units until certain conditions are met or 15 years after the inception of the
plan. The estimated fair value of a Z unit is determined on the grant
date and considers the Company's current stock price, the dividends

F-25 

that are
not paid on unvested units and a marketability discount for the 8 to 15 years of
illiquidity. Compensation expense is calculated by taking annual vesting
increases multiplied by the estimated fair value as of the grant date less its
 1.00 purchase price. 

Stock-based
compensation expense for Z Units under the fair value method totaled
approximately 1.5 million, 1.3 million and 1.6 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stock-based compensation
capitalized for Z Units totaled approximately 0.4 million, 0.3 million and
 0.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The intrinsic value of the Z Units subject to conversion
totaled 16.0 million as of December 31, 2007. Total unrecognized
compensation cost related Z Units subject to conversion in the future granted
under the Z Units plans totaled 8.1 million as of December 31, 2007. The
unamortized cost is expected to be recognized over the next 4 to 12 years
subject to the achievement of the stated performance criteria. 

The
issuance of Z Units is administered by the Compensation Committee which has the
authority to select participants and determine the awards to be made up to a
maximum of 600,000 Z Units. The conversion ratchet (accounted for as
vesting) of the Z Units into common units, will increase by up to 10 (up to 20 
in certain circumstances following their initial issuance) effective January 1of
each year for each participating executive who remains employed by the Operating
Partnership if the Company has met a specified funds from operations per share
target, or such other target as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate,
for the prior year, up to a maximum conversion ratchet of 100 . The Operating
Partnership has the option to redeem Z Units held by any executive whose
employment has been terminated with either common units of the Operating
Partnership or shares of the Company s common stock based on the then-effective
conversion ratchet. 

During
2001, the Operating Partnership issued 200,000 Series Z Incentive Units of
limited partner interest to eleven senior executives of the Company in exchange
for a capital commitment of 1.00 per Series Z Incentive Unit, for an aggregate
offering price of 200. The 2001 Z Unit grant had a conversion ratchet of 45,
55, and 65 percent as of January 1, 2005, 2006, and 2007
respectively. 

During
2004, the Operating Partnership issued 95,953 Series Z-1 Incentive Units of
limited partner interest to fourteen senior executives of the Company in
exchange for cash or a capital commitment of 1.00 per Series Z-1 Incentive
Unit, for an aggregate offering price of 96. The 2004 Z Unit grant had a
conversion ratchet of 20 percent upon issuance, and 30, 40 and 50 percent as of
January 1, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2005 an additional
27,000 Z-1 Units were granted to two senior executives pursuant to the 2004
grant terms with a 20 percent conversion ratio at issuance, and 30 and 40
percent conversion ratchet as of January 1, 2006 and 2007 . 

During
2005, the Operating Partnership issued 89,999 Series Z-1 Incentive Units of
limited partner interest to fourteen senior executives of the Company in
exchange for cash or a capital commitment of 1.00 per Series Z-1 Incentive
Unit, for an aggregate offering price of 90. The 2005 Z-1 Unit grant had
a conversion ratchet of 20 and 30 percent as of January 1, 2006 and
2007. 

Long
Term Incentive Plan Outperformance Plan 

Stock-based
compensation expense for the Outperformance Plan, (the OPP adopted in
December 2007 under the fair value method totaled approximately 0.1 million for
year ended December 31, 2007. Total unrecognized compensation cost
less an estimate for forfeitures related to the OPP totaled 5.5 million as of
December 31, 2007. The unamortized cost is expected to be recognized over
the expected service period of five years for senior officers and three years
for non-employee directors. 

Under the
2007 OPP, award recipients will share in a performance pool if the Company s
total return to stockholders for the period from December 4, 2007 (measured
based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on December 4, 2007)
through December 3, 2010 exceeds a cumulative total return to stockholders of
30 . The size of the pool will be 10 of the outperformance amount in
excess of the 30 benchmark, subject to an aggregate maximum award of 25
million. The maximum award will be reduced by the amount of any forfeited
awards. In the event the potential performance pool reaches the maximum
aggregate award between June 4, 2010 and December 3, 2010 and remains at that
level or higher for 30 consecutive days, the performance period will end early
and the performance pool will be formed on the last day of such 30-day period,
but the participants will nonetheless be subject to the time-based vesting
requirements described below. 

Each
participant s award under the 2007 OPP has been designated as a specified
percentage of the aggregate performance pool. Assuming the 30 benchmark
is achieved, the pool will be allocated among the participants in 

F-26 

accordance
with the percentage specified in each participant s award agreement. 
Individual awards were made in the form of newly created long term incentive
plan LTIP Units, which are partnership units of the Operating Partnership,
and the LTIP units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common units of
the Operating Partnership to the extent the LTIP Units become vested. Such
common units are exchangeable for shares of the Company s common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Any shares of the Company s common stock, which are
ultimately issued in connection with the 2007 OPP, will be issued pursuant to
the Company s 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. LTIP Units were granted prior to
the determination of the performance pool; however, they will only vest upon
satisfaction of performance and time vesting thresholds and will not be entitled
to distributions until after the benchmark is achieved. Distributions on
LTIP Units will equal the distributions payable on each common unit of the
Operating Partnership on a per unit basis. 

In the
case of awards granted to senior officers, if the benchmark is achieved, the
LTIP Units will vest in three substantially equal installments on December 4,
2010 and on each of the first two anniversaries thereafter, based on the
officer s continued employment through the applicable vesting date. In the
case of awards granted to non-employee directors, such awards will vest in full
on December 4, 2010 if the benchmark is achieved and only to the extent the
board members have continued to serve through such date. 

In the
event of a change of control of the Company prior to the establishment of the
performance pool, the performance period will be shortened to end on a date
immediately prior to such event and the cumulative stockholder return benchmark
will be adjusted on a pro rata basis. The performance pool will be formed
as described above if the adjusted benchmark target is achieved, and the awards
will become fully vested at such time.

401(k) Plan 

The
Operating Partnership has a 401(k) benefit plan (the Plan) for all full-time
employees who have completed six months of service. Employees may contribute up
to 23 of their compensation, limited by the maximum allowed under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Operating Partnership matches the
employee contributions for non-highly compensated personnel, up to 50 of their
contribution up to a specified maximum. Operating Partnership contributions to
the Plan were approximately 267, 226, and 98 for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006, and 2005. 

(17)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Management
believes that the carrying amounts of its variable rate mortgage notes payable,
lines of credit, notes receivable and other receivables from related parties,
and notes and other receivables approximate fair value as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, because interest rates, yields and other terms for these instruments
are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the Operating
Partnership for similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair
value of the Operating Partnership s 1.25 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes
payable and exchangeable bonds at December 31, 2007 are approximately 1.30
billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those
available in the marketplace. At December 31, 2006, the Operating
Partnership s fixed rate mortgage notes payable of 1.13 billion had an
approximate market value of 1.22 billion. Management believes that
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable
securities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, other liabilities and
dividends payable approximate fair value as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 due to
the short-term maturity of these instruments. 

(18)
Commitments and Contingencies 

At
December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had five non-cancelable ground
leases for certain apartment communities and buildings that expire between 2027
and 2080. Land lease payments are typically the greater of a stated minimum or a
percentage of gross rents generated by these apartment communities. Total
minimum lease commitments, under land leases and operating leases, are
approximately 1.8 million per year for the next five years. 

The
Operating Partnership has a performance guarantee with a commercial bank related
to the Northwest Gateway development. 

To the
extent that an environmental matter arises or is identified in the future that
has other than a remote risk, as defined in SFAS 5, of having a material impact
on the financial statements, the Operating Partnership will disclose the
estimated range of possible outcomes, and, if an outcome is probable, accrue
appropriate liability for remediation and other potential liability. The
Operating Partnership will consider whether such occurrence results in an
impairment of value on the affected property and, if so, accrue an appropriate
reserve for impairment. 

Except
with respect to three Properties, the Operating Partnership has no
indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental
clean-up costs at its Properties. The Operating Partnership has no way of
determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it
may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations
with respect to the properties formerly owned by the Operating Partnership. No
assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any
of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or
operator of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not
known to the Operating Partnership, or that a material environmental condition
does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the Properties. The Operating
Partnership has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental
liabilities described above. 

The
Operating Partnership may enter into transactions that could require the
Operating Partnership to pay the tax liabilities of the partners in the
Operating Partnership or in the DownREIT entities. These transactions
which are within the Operating Partnership s control. Although the Operating
Partnership plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on
their sale pursuant to like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the
Internal Revenue Code the Operating Partnership can provide no assurance that it
will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they may to have
a material impact on the Operating Partnership s financial
position. 

Recently
there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of
apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the
presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits
have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The
Operating Partnership has been sued for mold related matters and has settled
some, but not all, of such matters. Insurance carriers have reacted
to mold 

F-29 

related
liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and
pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Operating
Partnership has, however, purchased pollution liability insurance, which
includes some coverage for mold. The Operating Partnership has
adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as
well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to
minimize any impact mold might have on residents or
property. Liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

The
Operating Partnership carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however,
certain types of extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses for
terrorism or earthquake, for which the Operating Partnership does not have
insurance coverage. Substantially all of the Properties are located in areas
that are subject to earthquake activity. 

The
Operating Partnership is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course
of its business operations. Such lawsuits could have a material
adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

STOCKHOLDERS 

SECTION
1.1 Annual Meetings. The Corporation shall hold an annual
meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business
within its powers, either at 10:00 a.m. on the last Thursday of May in each year
if not a legal holiday, or at such other time on such other day falling on or
before the 30th day thereafter as shall be set by the Board of Directors. Except
as otherwise permitted by applicable law, any business may be considered at an
annual meeting without the purpose of the meeting having been specified in the
notice. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the
Corporation's 

 existence
or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts. 

SECTION
1.2 Special Meetings. The Chairman of the Board, the President
or a majority of the Board of Directors may call special meetings of the
stockholders. Special meetings of stockholders shall also be called by the
Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request of the holders of shares
 entitled
to cast not less than 25 of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.
Such request shall state the purpose of such meeting and the matters proposed to
be acted on at such meeting. The Secretary shall inform such stockholders of the
reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing notice of the meeting and,
upon payment to the Corporation of such costs, the Secretary shall give notice
to each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting. Unless requested by
stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at
such meeting, a special meeting need not be called to consider any matter which
is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting of the
stockholders held during the preceding twelve months. 

SECTION
1.3 Place of Meetings. Meetings of stockholders shall be held
at such place in the United States as is set from time to time by the Board of
Directors. 

SECTION
1.4 Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice. Not less than 10 nor
more than 90 days before each stockholders' meeting, the Secretary shall give
written notice of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the
meeting and each other stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting. The notice
 shall
state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting
or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting.
Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at
his residence or usual place of business, or mailed to him at his address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, each person who is entitled to notice waives notice if he before or
after the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records
of stockholders' meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by
 proxy. 

SECTION
1.5 Quorum; Voting. Unless statute or the charter of the
Corporation (the "Charter") provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the
presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of
all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a
 majority
of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to
approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a
plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is
sufficient to elect a director. 

SECTION
1.6 Adjournments. Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting
of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned
from time to time without further notice to a date not more than 120 days after
the original record date. Any business which might have been
 transacted
at the meeting as originally notified may be deferred and transacted at any such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present. 

SECTION
1.7 General Right to Vote; Proxies. Unless the Charter provides
for a greater or lesser number of votes per share or limits or denies voting
rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one
vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. In all
elections for directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many
individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the
share is entitled to be voted. A stockholder may vote the stock he owns of
 record
either in person or by written proxy signed by the stockholder or by his duly
authorized attorney in fact. Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid
more than 11 months after its date. 

SECTION
1.8 List of Stockholders. At each meeting of stockholders, a
true and complete list of all stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting,
showing the number and class of shares held by each and certified by the
transfer agent for such class or by the Secretary, shall be furnished by the
Secretary. 

SECTION
1.9 Conduct of Business and Voting. At all meetings of
stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, the proxies and
ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of
voters and the validity of proxies, the acceptance or rejection of votes and
procedures for the conduct of business not otherwise specified by these Bylaws,
the Charter or law, shall be decided or determined by the chairman of the
meeting. If demanded by stockholders, present in person or by proxy, entitled to
cast at least 10 of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, or if
ordered by the chairman, the vote upon any election or question shall be taken
by ballot and, upon like demand or order, the voting shall be conducted by two
inspectors, in which event the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all
 questions
touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies, the acceptance
or rejection of votes and procedures for the conduct of business not otherwise
specified by these Bylaws, the Charter or law shall be decided, by such
inspectors. Unless so demanded or ordered, no vote need be by ballot and
 voting
need not be conducted by inspectors. The stockholders at any meeting may choose
an inspector or inspectors to act at such meeting, and in default of such
election the chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors. No
candidate for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector
 thereat. 

SECTION
1.10 Informal Action by Stockholders. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a
meeting if there is filed with the records of stockholders' meetings a unanimous
written consent which sets forth the action and is signed by each stockholder
entitled to vote on the matter and a written waiver of any right to dissent
signed by each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting but not entitled to
vote at it. 

SECTION
1.11 Annual Meetings and Stockholder Proposals. Nominations of
individuals for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business
to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of
stockholders (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this Section 1.11, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and
who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section
1.11. 

For
nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by
a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding paragraph of this
Section 1.11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing
to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall
be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. For purposes of applying
this minimum to the 1995 annual meeting, the previous year's annual meeting
shall be deemed to have taken place on May 20, 1994; provided that this sentence
shall cease to be a part of the Bylaws after the holding of the 1995 annual
meeting and any adjournment thereof. In the event that the date of the annual
meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from
such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such
annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement
of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set
forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to 

nominate
for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person
that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of
directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")
(including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement
as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (ii) as to any other
business that the stockholder proposes to being before the meeting, a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in
such business of such stockholder and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made, (x) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (y) the number of
shares of each class of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially
and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. 

Notwithstanding
anything in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph of this Section 1.11
to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming all
of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of
Directors made by the Corporation at least 70 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice
required by this Section 1.1 shall also be considered timely, but only with
respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall
be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following on
which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation. 

Notwithstanding
the preceding two paragraphs, for nominations of individuals for election as a
"Series 1996A Director(s)" (as defined in Section 2.2), pursuant to clause (iii)
of the first paragraph in this Section 1.11, to be properly brought before a
meeting of stockholders, the holder of "Series 1996A Stock" (as defined in
Section 2.2) shall deliver his or her nomination(s) to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal executive offices not less than 60 days nor more
than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting. The Corporation shall promptly notify the holders of
Series 1996A Stock if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30
days from such anniversary date, and any nomination shall be considered timely
if delivered to the Secretary either within 60 days after receipt of such notice
or not less than 60 days prior to the date of the annual meeting as contained in
such notice. 

SECTION
1.12 Business at Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business
shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors
are to be elected (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by
or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) provided that the Board
of Directors had determined that directors shall be elected at such special
meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at
the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 1.12, who is entitled
to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 1.12. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of
Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case
may be) for election to such position as specified in the Corporation's notice
 of
meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by the second paragraph of Section
1.11 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of
the Corporation not earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and
not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such
special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement
is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by
the directors to be elected at such meeting. 

Notwithstanding
the preceding paragraph, the procedure for electing one or more Series 1996A
Directors shall be as set forth in Article First, Section 3 of the Articles
Supplementary (Series 1996A Stock) (as defined in Section 2.2). Each
request for a special meeting of the holders of Series 1996A Stock shall include
the nominees for election as Series 1996A Directors. 

ARTICLE
II. 

BOARD
OF DIRECTORS 

SECTION
2.1 Function of Directors. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors. All
powers of the Corporation may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of
Directors, except as conferred on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or
 by the
Charter or Bylaws. 

SECTION
2.2 Number of Directors. The Corporation shall have at least the
minimum number of directors required by the Maryland General Corporation
Law. The Corporation shall have a Board of Directors consisting of
eleven directors. Ten of the eleven directors, hereinafter referred to as the
"Common Directors,"
shall be elected by the holders of common stock and the holders of all classes
or series of stock who vote together with the holders of common stock and the
remaining director, hereinafter referred to as the "Series 1996A Director" shall
be elected by the holders of the 8.75 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1996A
(the "Series 1996A Stock"), voting separately as a class. The number
of directors may be increased upon certain events as provided in Article First,
Section 3 of the Articles Supplementary classifying 1,600,000 shares of Common
Stock as shares of 8.75 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1996A (or
Article FIFTH, subsection (e) of any restatement of the Charter) (the "Articles
Supplementary (Series 1996A Stock)"). All directors shall be
classified with respect to their respective terms of office as provided in
Section 2.3 and each director shall serve until the expiration of his or her
term and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies. 

SECTION
2.3 Election and Tenure of Directors. At the first annual meeting of
stockholders, the directors shall be classified, with respect to the time for
which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number
as possible, one class to hold office initially for a term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1995, another class to hold office
initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held
in 1996 and another class to hold office initially for a term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1997, with the members of each
class to hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualify. At
each annual meeting of the stockholders, the successors to the class of
directors whose term expires at such meeting shall be elected to hold office for
 a term
expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following
the year of their election and the other directors shall continue in office. If
the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each
 class as
nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of
directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

SECTION
2.4 Removal of Director. Any director or the entire Board of
Directors may be removed only in accordance with the provisions of the
Charter. 

SECTION
2.5 Vacancy on Board. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
class of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled by a
majority of the entire Board of Directors, any vacancies on the Board of
Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
other causes, except removal from office, shall be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, whether or not sufficient to constitute
a quorum, and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from removal
from office shall be filed by a vote of the stockholders or a majority of the
directors then in office, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum. A
director so elected by the stockholders shall hold office for the balance of the
term of the removed director. A director so elected by the remaining directors
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders, at which time
the stockholders shall elect a director to hold office for the balance of the
term then remaining. 

SECTION
2.6 Regular Meetings. After each meeting of stockholders at which
directors shall have been elected, the Board of Directors shall meet as soon as
practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other
business. In the event that no other time and place are specified by resolution
of the 

Board,
the President or the Chairman, with notice in accordance with Section 2.8, the
Board of Directors shall meet immediately following the close of, and at the
place of, such stockholders' meeting. Any other regular meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated from
time to time by the Board of Directors. 

SECTION
2.7 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or the President or by a
majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting, or in writing with or
without a meeting. A special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at
such time and place as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors. In the absence of designation such meeting shall be held at such time
and place as may be designated in the call. 

SECTION
2.8 Notice of Meeting. Except as provided in Section 2.6, the
Secretary shall give notice to each director of each regular and special meeting
of the Board of Directors. The notice shall state the time and place of the
meeting. Notice is given to a director when it is delivered personally to him,
left at his residence or usual place of business, or sent by telegraph,
facsimile transmission or telephone, at least 24 hours before the time of the
meeting or, in the alternative, by mail to his address as it shall appear on the
 records
of the Corporation, at least 72 hours before the time of the
meeting. Unless the Bylaws or a resolution of the Board of Directors
provides otherwise, the notice need not state the business to be transacted at
or the purposes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. No
notice of any meeting
of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who is present at the
meeting except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened, or to any director who, in writing executed and filed with
the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives
such notice. Any meeting of the Board of Directors, regular or special, may
adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and no
notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other than by
announcement. 

SECTION
2.9 Action by Directors. Unless statute or the Charter or Bylaws
require a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present
at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the action of the Board of
Directors. A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum
 for the
transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present by
majority vote and without notice other than by announcement may adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which
might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be
taken without a meeting, if a unanimous written consent which sets forth the
action is signed by each member of the Board and filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board. 

SECTION
2.10 Meeting by Conference Telephone. Members of the Board of
Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can
hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means
constitutes presence in person at a meeting. 

SECTION
2.11 Compensation. By resolution of the Board of Directors a fixed
sum and expenses, if any, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors or of committees thereof, and other compensation for
their services as such or on committees of the Board of Directors, may be paid
to directors other than directors who are full-time employees of the
Corporation. A director who serves the Corporation in any other capacity also
may receive compensation for such other services, pursuant to a resolution
of the Board of Directors. 

SECTION
2.12 Advisory Directors. The Board of Directors may by resolution
appoint advisory directors to the Board, who may also serve as directors
emeriti, and shall receive such compensation and reimbursement as the Board of
Directors shall provide. Advisory directors or directors emeriti shall
 not have
any right to vote as directors. 

ARTICLE
III. 

COMMITTEES 

SECTION
3.1 Committees. The Board of Directors may appoint from among its
members an Executive Committee and other committees composed of two or more
directors and delegate to these committees any of the powers of the Board of
Directors, except as prohibited by law. Each committee shall include the
director elected by the holders of the Series 1996A Stock pursuant to Section
3(a)(i) of the Articles Supplementary (Series 1996A Stock), upon request by such
director to the Board, unless the rules of any exchange on which the shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation are listed would preclude membership of such
director on such committee, in which case such director shall be permitted
to have
access to all meetings and proceedings of such committee and to review and
retain copies of all documentation presented to the members of such committee
relating to committee business. If the Board of Directors has given general
authorization for the issuance of stock, a committee of the Board, in accordance
 with a
general formula or method specified by the Board by resolution or by adoption of
a stock option or other plan, may fix the terms of stock subject to
classification or reclassification and the terms on which any stock may be
issued, including all terms and conditions required or permitted to be
established or authorized by the Board of Directors under Sections 2-203 and
2-208 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland. 

SECTION
3.2 Committee Procedure. Each committee may fix rules of procedure
for its business. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business, and the action of a majority of those
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the action of the
committee. The members of a committee present at any meeting, whether or not
they constitute a quorum, may appoint a director to act in the place of an
absent member. Any action required or permitted to be taken at
a meeting of a committee may be taken without a meeting, if a unanimous written
consent which sets forth the action is signed by each member of the committee
and filed with the minutes of proceedings of the committee. The
members of a committee may conduct any meeting thereof by conference telephone
 in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10. 

ARTICLE
IV. 

OFFICERS 

SECTION
4.1 Executive and Other Officers. The Corporation shall have a
President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer. It may also have a Chairman of the
Board. The Corporation may also have one or more Vice-Presidents, including
Executive Vice Presidents, as well as one or more assistant officers, and

powers of the President. If there be more than one Executive Vice-President, the

Vice-Presidents shall perform any of such duties or exercise any of such
functions, or if such determination is not made by the Board of Directors, the
chief executive officer or the President may make such determination; otherwise
any of the Executive Vice-Presidents may perform any of such duties or

 is not
made by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer or the President may
make such determination; otherwise, any of the Vice-Presidents may perform any
of such duties or exercise any of such functions. The Vice-President or
Vice-Presidents, including the Executive Vice-Presidents, shall have such other

SECTION
4.8 Election, Tenure and Removal of Officers. The Board of Directors
shall elect the officers. The Board of Directors may from time to time authorize
any committee or officer to appoint assistant and subordinate officers. Election

offices, respectively, at the pleasure of the Board. The Board of Directors (or,
as to any assistant or subordinate officer, any committee or officer authorized
by the Board) may remove an officer at any time, if the Board (or any committee
or officer authorized by the Board, as the case may be) in its judgment finds
that the best interests of the Corporation will be served thereby. The removal
of an officer does not prejudice any of his contract rights. The Board of
Directors (or, as to any assistant or subordinate officer, any committee or
officer authorized by the Board) may fill a vacancy which occurs in any office
for the unexpired portion of the term. 

SECTION
4.9 Compensation. The Board of Directors shall have power to fix the
salaries and other compensation and remuneration, of whatever kind, of all
officers of the Corporation. No officer shall be prevented from receiving such
salary by reason of the fact that he is also a director of the Corporation.
 The Board
of Directors may authorize any committee or officer, upon whom the power of
appointing assistant and subordinate officers may have been conferred, to fix
the salaries, compensation and remuneration of such assistant and subordinate
officers.

the Chairman of the Board or the President.

adopt by resolution a procedure by which a stockholder of the Corporation may

with respect to a record date or closing of the stock transfer books, the time
after the record date or closing of the stock transfer books within which the

Board of Directors may delegate such power to any officer or officers of the
Corporation. In their discretion, the Board of Directors or such officer or
officers may refuse to issue a new certificate (a) unless the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate gives a bond, with sufficient surety, to
indemnify the Corporation against any loss or claim arising as the result of the

OF AMENDMENT 

OF 

AMENDED
AND RESTATED BYLAWS 

OF 

ESSEX
PROPERTY TRUST, INC., 

a
Maryland corporation 

The
undersigned, being the duly elected, qualified and acting Assistant Secretary of
Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the Corporation does hereby certify, as
follows: 

1. 
Article VI of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation was amended at
a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, duly noticed and held on
December 4, 2007, to read in its entirety as follows: 

ARTICLE
VI. 

STOCK 

SECTION
6.1 
 Certificates . The
Corporation may issue some or all of the shares of any or all of the
Corporation's classes or series of stock without certificates if authorized by
the Board of Directors. In the event that the Corporation issues
shares of stock represented by certificates, such certificates shall be in such
form as prescribed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized officer, shall
contain the statements and information required by the MGCL and shall be signed
by the officers of the Corporation in the manner permitted by the
MGCL. In the event that the Corporation issues shares of stock
without certificates, to the extent then required by the MGCL, the Corporation
shall provide to the record holders of such shares a written statement of the
information required by the MGCL to be included on stock
certificates. There shall be no differences in the rights and
obligations of stockholders based on whether or not their shares are represented
by certificates. If a class or series of stock is authorized by the
Board of Directors to be issued without certificates, no stockholder shall be
entitled to a certificate or certificates representing any shares of such class
or series of stock held by such stockholder unless otherwise determined by the
Board of Directors and then only upon written request by such stockholder to the
secretary of the Corporation. 

SECTION
6.2 
 Transfers . All
transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation, by the holder
of the shares, in person or by his or her attorney, in such manner as the Board
of Directors or any officer of the Corporation may prescribe and, if such shares
are certificated, upon surrender of certificates duly endorsed. The
issuance of a new certificate upon the transfer of certificated shares is
subject to the determination of the Board of Directors that such shares shall no
longer be represented by certificates. Upon the transfer of
uncertificated shares, to the extent then required by the MGCL, the Corporation
shall provide to record holders of such shares a written statement of the
information required by the MGCL to be included on stock
certificates. 

The
Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share of
stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or on the
part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of
Maryland. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, transfers of shares of any class or series of stock will be
subject in all respects to the charter of the Corporation and all of the terms
and conditions contained therein. 

SECTION
6.3 Replacement
Certificate . Any officer of the Corporation may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
destroyed, stolen or mutilated, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, destroyed, stolen or
mutilated; provided, however, if such shares have ceased to be certificated, no
new certificate shall be issued unless requested in writing by such stockholder
and the Board of Directors has determined such certificates may be
issued. Unless otherwise determined by an officer of the Corporation,
the owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or
certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be required, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to
give the Corporation a bond in such sums as it may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation. 

SECTION
6.4 Closing of Transfer Books or
Fixing of Record Date . The Board of Directors may set, in
advance, a record date for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or determining stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any other
rights, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper
purpose. Such date, in any case, shall not be prior to the close of
business on the day the record date is fixed and shall be not more than 90 days
and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten days, before
the date on which the meeting or particular action requiring such determination
of stockholders of record is to be held or taken. 

In lieu
of fixing a record date, the Board of Directors may provide that the stock
transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not longer than 20
days. If the stock transfer books are closed for the purpose of
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders, such books shall be closed for at least ten days before the date
of such meeting. 

If no
record date is fixed and the stock transfer books are not closed for the
determination of stockholders, (a) the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed
or the 30th day before the meeting, whichever is the closer date to the meeting;
and (b) the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive payment of a dividend or an allotment of any other rights shall be the
close of business on the day on which the resolution of the directors, declaring
the dividend or allotment of rights, is adopted. 

When a
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any
adjournment thereof, except when (i) the determination has been made through the
closing of the transfer books and the stated period of closing has expired or
(ii) the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the record date
fixed for the original meeting, in either of which case a new record date shall
be determined as set forth herein. 

SECTION
6.5 Stock
Ledger . The Corporation shall maintain at its principal office
or at the office of its counsel, accountants or transfer agent, an original or
duplicate share ledger containing the name and address of each stockholder and
the number of shares of each class held by such stockholder. 

SECTION
6.6 Fractional Stock; Issuance
Of Units . The Board of Directors may issue fractional stock or
provide for the issuance of scrip, all on such terms and under such conditions
as they may determine. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
charter or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may issue units consisting of
different securities of the Corporation. Any security issued in a
unit shall have the same characteristics as any identical securities issued by
the Corporation, except that the Board of Directors may provide that for a
specified period securities of the Corporation issued in such unit may be
transferred on the books of the Corporation only in such unit. 

SECTION
6.7 Exemption from Control Share
Acquisition Statute . Notwithstanding any other provisions of
the Charter or these Bylaws, Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the Corporations and
Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (or any successor
statute) shall not apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of
the Corporation. This section may be repealed, in whole or in part,
at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares and, upon
such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any
prior or subsequent control share acquisition. 

2. 
Except as set forth above, the Amended and Restated Bylaws shall remain in full
force and effect.

Exhibit 14.1 

CODE
OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 

 Overview 

This Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to the Company s employees, officers and
directors. (References to employees in this Code include all employees and
officers of the Company.) 

The
Company conducts business in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations. It is critical that employees and directors observe these laws and
regulations while conducting business on the Company s behalf. The Company also
promotes and expects ethical behavior in all employees. Any employee who has
doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation should talk to a
supervisor, manager or Human Resources for guidance. 

Conflicts of Interest;
Corporate Opportunities 

Employees
and directors are expected to avoid situations that create an actual or
potential conflict. A conflict of interest exists when one s loyalties or
actions are divided between the Company s interests and those of another such as
a competitor, supplier, or customer. Employees and directors must avoid any
activity, agreement, business investment or interest that could be in conflict
with the Company s interests or could interfere with their duty and ability to
serve the Company as well as possible. 

Employees
and directors are prohibited from (a) taking for themselves personal
opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property,
information or position, (b) using corporate property, information, or position
for personal gain and (c) competing with the Company. Employees and directors
owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the
opportunity to do so arises. The Company has also developed, and publicly
disclosed, certain guidelines for potentially competitive activities by its
non-employee directors. Non-employee directors who have questions about such
guidelines should contact the President of the Company. 

Situations
of actual or potential conflict of interest are to be avoided by all employees.
Personal, financial or romantic involvement with a competitor, client, supplier,
resident or subordinate employee of the Company, which impairs an employee s
ability to exercise good judgment on behalf of the Company, creates a conflict
of interest. Supervisor-subordinate romantic or personal relationships also can
lead to supervisory problems, possible claims of sexual harassment and morale
problems. 

An
employee involved in any of the types of relationships or situations described
in this policy should immediately and fully disclose the relevant circumstances
to his/her immediate supervisor, or any other appropriate supervisor, for a
determination as to whether a potential or actual conflict exists. Employees
unsure as to whether a certain transaction, activity, or relationship
constitutes a conflict of interest should discuss it with their immediate
supervisor for clarification. If an actual or potential conflict is determined,
the Company will take appropriate corrective action. Failure to adhere to this
policy, including the failure to disclose any actual or potential conflict of
interest shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment. 

While
employed by the Company, employees are expected to devote their energies to
their jobs with the Company. For this reason, outside employment is strongly
discouraged. Prohibited forms of outside employment include, but are not limited
to: 

1.
Employment that conflicts with an employee s work schedule, duties and
responsibilities at Essex; 

2.
Employment that creates an actual conflict of interest with the employee s
employment at Essex; 

3. 

Employment
 that impairs or has a detrimental effect on the employee s work
 performance at Essex; 

4.

Employment
 that requires the employee to conduct work-related activities on Essex s
 property during working hours or the use of Essex s facilities
 and/or equipment; or 

5.
Employment that directly or indirectly competes with the business of the
Company. 

Employees
who wish to engage in outside employment must submit a written request to the
Company explaining the details of the outside employment. If the outside
employment is authorized, the Company assumes no responsibility for the outside
employment. The Company shall not provide workers compensation coverage or any
other benefit 

for
injuries occurring from or arising out of the outside employment. Authorization
to engage in outside employment can be revoked at any time. 

Confidentiality 

Each
employee and director is responsible for safeguarding information considered
proprietary or confidential by the Company. Proprietary information includes all
information relating in any manner to the business of the Company and its
affiliates, consultants, customers, clients, and business associates produced or
obtained by Company employees and directors during the course of their work. All
proprietary information that is not known generally to the public or the
industry, or is known only through improper means, is confidential information.
Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of
use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers, if
disclosed. 

In the
course of your work, you may have access to proprietary or confidential
information regarding the Company, its clients, its operations, its suppliers or
even co-workers. In addition, Federal Securities Laws generally prohibit the
private dissemination of material non-public information. It is your
responsibility not to use or divulge any such proprietary or confidential
information unless it is necessary for you to do so in the performance of your
duties. Access to confidential information should be on a need-to-know basis
and must be authorized by your supervisor. 

These
obligations remain even after an employee s employment relationship or a
director s directorship with the Company ends. On termination of such employment
or directorship, whether voluntarily or involuntary, all Company documents,
computer records, and other tangible Company property in the employee s
possession or control, or in the director s possession or control, must be
returned to the Company. Any breach of this policy will not be tolerated and
will be considered grounds for discipline, up to and including
termination. 

Quality and
Fairness 

Employees
must pursue quality in every service provided by the Company and endeavor to
earn the trust of our customers. It is important for employees to deliver what
they have promised. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through
manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of
material facts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. 

Company Business
Accounts/Company Assets 

Company
business accounts are to be used for business purposes only. Any employee who is
found to have used Company business accounts for personal use will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Theft, carelessness and
waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability. All Company assets
should be used for legitimate business purposes. Personal use of Company assets
can subject employees to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. 

Inside
Information 

No
employee or director of the Company may trade in the Company s securities (i.e.,
buy or sell shares of the Company s common stock on public stock exchanges) if
he or she has knowledge of material information concerning the Company, which
has not been disseminated to the investing public. In general, this will require
such persons to wait for at least forty-eight (48) hours after public release of
information by the Company. The Company also has a separate trading window
policy that applies to directors and certain officers of the
Company. 

Antifraud
Policy 

The
Company maintains high standards for financial reporting to its shareholders and
other users of its financial and public statements. Every employee has a duty to
adhere to these standards. The Company encourages the reporting of information
regarding any suspected improper accounting, false or misleading public
statements, securities fraud, or other similar misconduct taken by Company
employees. The Company will thoroughly and promptly investigate all such claims
and, if necessary, take appropriate corrective action. 

Company
employees who have information regarding such misconduct should immediately
report this information to their manager or supervisor or the Director of Human
Resources. An employee is not required to report to his or her manager or
supervisor if the employee believes that person is involved in the suspected or
actual misconduct, but should instead report to the Director of Human Resources.
Any supervisor or manager who receives a report of 

suspected
misconduct under this policy, or who observes such conduct, should immediately
inform the Director of Human Resources. The Company will investigate all reports
of suspected securities fraud, improper accounting or other similar misconduct,
and will handle the investigation in as confidential a manner as possible
consistent with a full and proper investigation. If any fraud, accounting
impropriety or misconduct is established, the Company will take appropriate
corrective action, which may include, among other things, disciplinary action
against the employees involved, up to and including termination of
employment. 

The
Company will not tolerate retaliation against an employee who comes forward with
a good faith report of suspected securities fraud, improper accounting or other
similar misconduct, or an employee who participates in any investigation of such
a report. Employees who believe they have been subjected to retaliation as a
result of reporting or participating in an investigation of such misconduct
should report their concerns to the Director of Human Resources. Retaliation
toward any employee who reports any suspected misconduct under this policy, or
who participates in any investigation of such reports, will result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 

Procedure For Submitting
Confidential Complaints 

Employees
may submit complaints, concerns and information regarding suspected improper
accounting, false or misleading public statements, securities fraud or other
similar misconduct taken by Company employees or its agents directly to the
General Counsel. All such submissions regarding suspected improper accounting,
false or misleading public statements, securities fraud or other similar
misconduct may be made on an
anonymous basis and shall be treated as confidential by the General
Counsel. Employees may forward complaints to the General Counsel: 

By
mail: Jordan
Ritter, General Counsel 

 C/o Essex Property Trust,
Inc. 

 925 E. Meadow Drive 

 Palo Alto, CA 94303 

By
email: Jritter@essexpropertytrust.com 

By
voicemail at: 650-494-3700 

When
submitting a complaint, employees are asked to provide the General Counsel with
as much detailed information as possible. Providing detailed, rather than
general, information will greatly assist the General Counsel in effectively
investigating complaints. This is particularly important where an employee
submits a complaint on an anonymous basis, as the General Counsel will be unable
to contact the reporting employee with requests for additional information or
clarification. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the General Counsel may
report the complaint directly to the audit committee of the board of directors
or to appropriate personnel within the Company. 

Violations and Waivers of
this Code 

Any
waiver of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for executive officers or
directors may be made only by the board of directors, or a committee thereof,
and must be promptly disclosed to shareholders. All other waivers may be granted
only by Human Resources. Employees should report any violations of this policy
or the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or any violations of laws,
rules or regulations to Human Resources. The Company will investigate any such
reports, and take appropriate corrective action, if warranted. Retaliation
against an employee who reports violations of such conduct in good faith will
not be tolerated. Changes in this Code may only be made by the Board of
Directors and must be promptly disclosed to shareholders.

 materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
 reporting; and 

5. 

The

 most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
 the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s
 board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent

a) 

All
 significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
 operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
 reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
 process, summarize and report financial data;
 and 

b) 

Any
 fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
 employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control
 over financial reporting.
