DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

The Movie Studio,
Inc. F/K/A Destination Television, Inc. the Company or DSTV or the
 Registrant is a publicly traded
vertically integrated motion picture production company that develops,
manufactures and distributes independent motion picture content for worldwide
consumption on a multitude of devices. 

The Company is a broadcast
media company that used its custom content and entertainment-based programming
along with its proprietary technology to influence the purchasing decisions of
millions of active consumers in targeted away-from-home leisure destinations. 

The Company s original core
broadcast business was Bar TV, Gym TV, and Hotel TV, which were designed and implemented
to focus on leisure destinations with entertaining and informative audio and
video content, increasing the duration and frequency of consumer visits and
duration of stay, generating incremental revenue and promoting the sale of
specific products. The Company enabled advertisers and leisure/retailers to
effectively and efficiently reach active consumers at the point of sale (POS)
where most purchase decisions are made. In addition to influencing consumer
behavior, the Company s programming was proven to be successful in generating
brand awareness and could create additional sales lift. The Company s business
motto was Leisure Destinations driving traffic to Retail Locations. 

Over the years, the Company
surveyed the media landscape, combining the best aspects of each medium into
the DSTV s business model, simultaneously applying it to a very unique physical
space. In 2008, the US advertising industry consolidated, including digital
signage space, because the industry did not provide a quantifiable measurement
platform for its advertisers; at that time, The Company began to reorganize its
business model. In 2009, The Company took the first steps in transitioning its
core business operations into a new media platform, which included
incorporating elements of its original media business model into its new
business, The Movie Studio. In 2010, the Company took the next step, when it
physically began transitioning its core business to the new platform. The Movie
Studio platform consists of three verticals that operate synergistically with
each other. Strategic Partner, is the first of the three verticals. In this
vertical, the Company enters into agreements with substantial asset partners,
wherein these partners can promote their brand, product, or service through the
Movie Studio, which can offer them, through the its vertical integration model,
a variety of opportunities, as a result of their association with the movie
business. Each partner agreement is crafted in the best interest of the
client s needs or objectives. 

Locations Pay Us is the
second vertical, wherein we get paid for filming a scene of our movie at the
location of a client. The excitement generated from motion picture production
at given location can drive traffic to the client s point of sale (POS); as a
result, the Company and the client both benefit from this arrangement . In
addition, the Company utilizes its win-a-part-in-a-movie contest at the
location; it also provides digital plates to the client s location, which can
utilize the key art shot of the location as base artwork for web, print or
television at no additional cost in perpetuity. Clients have reported that
their locations have seen double digit increases in their margins on the night
of the filming event. Product Placement is the third vertical. The motion
picture product placement industry is a two billion dollar industry; companies
utilize this platform to create worldwide brand awareness for their brand,
product or service, with the average movie impact of fifteen (15) years (in
five year distribution cycles). In addition, these companies provides us
products that we utilize at movie events for PPG (on premise promotional
giveaways); they also gain additional branding exposure in direct interaction
with the brands exact demographic. 

The value proposition for
investors is in the bi-product of manufacturing of a major motion picture asset(s),
which reduces capital expenses (CAP X) by utilizing these vertical in the
manufacturing of the intellectual property (movie) asset. The completed movie
then employs a significant expense to revenue ratio, by utilizing these metrics.
The motion picture asset is ultimately licensed to seventy (70) countries
around the world (foreign market) and domestically in the traditional media
outlet channels, movie theaters, television, DVD, pay cable, Video on Demand
(VOD) mobile etc. In addition the motion picture integrates a soundtrack, which
creates an additional revenue stream for investors. The Company has proven the
business model on all three verticals prior to opening up The Movie Studio, a
7200 Sq. Ft. state of the art production studio in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, 

4 

complete
with 24X36 green screen, infinity wall, edit suites, complete motion picture
manufacturing lighting and equipment, cameras make-up station, talent division,
and in-house marketing. The Movie Studio has manufactured its first feature
film production for Ventures Capital Partners, LLC. Is titled Exposure 
starring Corey Feldman and is currently in pre-production of the sequel Double
Exposure . In addition, The Movie Studio can generate additional revenue
streams from studio rentals and music video production. The Company 

 is currently fully
operational and implementing its business model to scale the Companies
operations in 2013 and beyond. The Company changed its name of operations from
Destination Television, Inc. to The Movie Studio, Inc. In November, 2012 and has
applied for a new stock symbol, requesting: (MOVI). 

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 

Film Studio: 

The Movie Studio, Inc. is an entertainment or motion picture company
that has its own privately owned studio facility that is used to make films,
which is handled by the production company. The majority of companies in the
entertainment industry have never owned their own studios, but have rented
space from other companies. There are also independently owned studio
facilities, which have never produced a motion picture of their own because
they are not entertainment companies or motion picture companies they are
companies who sell only studio space. 

Beginnings: 

In
1893, Thomas
Edison built the first movie studio in the United States when
he constructed the Black Maria , a tarpaper-covered structure near his
laboratories in West Orange , New Jersey , and asked
circus, vaudeville, and dramatic actors to perform for the camera. He
distributed these movies at
vaudeville theaters, penny arcades, wax museums, and fairgrounds. The
pioneering film studio was founded in New Rochelle, New York in 1909 by American theatrical
impresario Edwin
Thanhouser . The company produced and released 1,086 films between
1910 and 1917, successfully distributing them around the world. The first film serial ever, Million Dollar Mystery , was released by the Thanhouser Company
in 1914. In the early 1900s, companies started moving to Los Angeles, California .
Although electric
lights were by then widely available, none were yet powerful
enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for motion
picture production was natural sunlight. Some movies were shot on the roofs of
buildings in Downtown Los Angeles . Early movie producers also relocated
to Southern
California to escape Edison's motion picture patents company,
which controlled almost all the patents relevant to movie
production at the time. 

The
first movie studio in the Hollywood area
was Nestor
Studios , opened in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley . In the
same year, another 15 independents settled
in Hollywood. Other production companies eventually settled in the Los Angeles
area in places such as Culver City , Burbank ,
and what would soon become known as Studio City in the San
Fernando Valley . 

A n independent film i s a professional film production resulting in a feature film that is produced mostly or completely
outside of the major film
studio system. In addition to being produced
and distributed by independent entertainment companies, independent films are
also produced and/or distributed by subsidiaries of major film studios . Independent films
are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which
the filmmakers' personal artistic vision is realized. Usually, but not always,
independent films are made with considerably lower film budgets than major studio films. Generally, the marketing of
independent films is characterized by limited release ,
but can also have major marketing campaigns and a wide release . Independent films
are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals before distribution (theatrical and/or
retail release). An independent film production can rival a mainstream film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution. 

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND THEIR MARKETS 

The Movie Studio, Inc. (OTC:
SYMBOL: DSTV Requested: MOVI 

Due to the proliferation of
new mobile media platforms in society, The Movie Studio intends to enter into
the personalized content media space utilized by consumers via laptops, tablets,
smartphone s and new out-of home devices as they are developed. 

5 

The
Movie Studio intends to manufacture independent content that fits the
marketplace void including indie movies with relevant movie stars and indie
soundtracks with substantial fan bases that we can reach their demographic
on-line and sell digital downloads direct to consumers with a minimum barrier
to entry and minimum capital expenditures compared to traditional marketing
forms of content delivery. In addition to traditional marketing platforms that
we intend to sell and leverage as well, The Movie Studio intends to sell its
content and where it s available on all devices, mobile, I-Pad etc. for the
personal user with the personal playlist of unique and indie content relevant
to their interests applicable for the individual and their consumption. 

 The Movie Studio
is implementing its new proven vertically integrated revenue model: 

(a) Strategic
Partners in Motion Pictures. 

(b) Locations Pay
US a fee for placement in the movie, which can monetize our platform at their
point of sale (POS). 

(c) Product Placement: we
receive a fee for product placement in a movie, product branding, and on premise
promotional giveaways (PPG). In addition the Product Placement client receives
digital plates and the same benefits as Location Pay US a fee client receive
(see (b) above). 

(d) At the American Film
Market in November 2011, the Company established significant motion picture
arrangement for worldwide distribution, to provide investors an exit strategy
for (1) their movie partnership investment units and (2) shareholdings in the
Company. In May 1, 2012, we have entered into an exclusive worldwide distribution
agreement with Cinema Arts Entertainment, with minimum guarantees (MG s) that sales
will total 520,000 for the first 10 markets. 

(e) The completed movie then
employs a significant expense to revenue proposition by utilizing these metrics
and licenses the motion picture asset to seventy (70) countries around the
world (foreign market) as well as domestically in traditional media outlet
channels, movie theaters, television, DVD, pay cable, video on demand (VOD)
mobile etc. In addition the motion picture integrates a soundtrack that creates
an additional revenue stream for investors. 

In addition, the
Company provides locations digital plates and green screen application for use
in movies, commercials, for the location, web-applications and print that can
significantly monetize the location, while 360 degree media branding at the location
can be an applicator for the location in a variety of ways:

DISTRIBUTION METHODS 

Film
distribution Methods: A
distributor is a company or
individual responsible for the marketing of a film. The distributor may set the release date of a film and the method by which a film is to be
exhibited or made available for viewing: for example, directly to the public
either theatrically or for home viewing DVD , video-on-demand (VOD), download , television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). A distributor may do this directly,
if the distributor owns the theaters or film distribution networks, or through theatrical exhibitors
and other sub-distributors. A limited distributor may deal only with particular
products, such as DVDs or Blu-ray, or may act in a particular country or
market. 

 Theatrical
distribution: 

 If a
distributor is working with a theatrical exhibitor, the distributor secures a
written contract stipulating the amount of the gross ticket sales to be paid to the distributor
by the exhibitor (usually a percentage of the gross) after first deducting a
floor , which is called a house allowance (also known as the
nut), collects the amount due, audits the exhibitor's ticket sales , as
necessary , to ensure the gross reported by the exhibitor is
accurate, secures the distributor's share of these proceeds, and transmits the
remainder to the production company (or to any other intermediary ,
such as a film release agent). 

 The
distributor must also ensure that enough film prints are struck to service all contracted
exhibitors on the contract-based opening day , ensure their physical delivery to the
theater by the opening day, monitor exhibitors to make sure the film is in fact
shown in the particular theatre with the minimum number of seats and show
times, and ensure the prints' return to the distributor's office or other
storage resource also on the contract-based return date. In practical terms,
this includes the physical production of film prints and their shipping around the world (a process that is
beginning to be replaced by digital distribution as well as the creation of posters , newspaper and magazine advertisements , television commercials , trailers, and other types of ads. 

 The distributor is also responsible for
ensuring a full line of advertising material is available on each film which it
believes will help the exhibitor attract the largest possible audience, create
such advertising , if it is not provided by the
production company, and arrange for the physical delivery of the advertising
items selected by the exhibitor at intervals prior to the opening day. 

If the distributor is
handling an imported or foreign film, it may also be responsible for securing
dubbing or subtitling for the film, and securing censorship or other legal or
organizational approval for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory
in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending
on which studio is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices
around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute
films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native
distributor, upon release, both names will appear. The foreign distributor may
license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the
copyright of the film. 

 Early distribution windows: 

 Although there
are numerous distribution techniques today, previous to the multi-channel
transition, studios and networks did not experiment with different distribution
processes. Studios believed that the new distribution methods would cause their
old methods of revenue to be destroyed. Within time, the development of new
distribution did prove to be beneficial. The studios revenue was gained from
myriad distribution windows. These windows created many opportunities in the
industry and allowed networks to make a profit and eliminate failure. These new
distribution methods benefited audiences that were normally too small to reach
and expanded the content of television. With the new age of technology,
networks accepted the fact that it was a consumer demand industry and accepted
the new models of distribution. 

 7 

Non-theatrical
distribution: 

 This term,
used mainly in the British film industry , describes the distribution of feature films for
screening to a gathered audience, but not in theatres at which individual
tickets are sold to members of the public. The defining distinctions between a
theatrical and a non-theatrical screening are that the latter has to be to a
closed audience in some way, e.g. pupils of a school, members of a social club
or passengers on an airliner, and that there can be no individual admission
charge. Most non-theatrical screening contracts also specify that the screening
must not be advertised, except within the group that is eligible to attend
(e.g. in a membership organisation's newsletter or an in-flight magazine ). 

 The largest
market for non-theatrical distribution is probably the airlines , followed by film societies . Non-theatrical distribution is generally
handled by companies that specialise in this market, of which Filmbank [1] is Britain's largest, representing the
major Hollywood studios. Home video media is sold with a licence that permits
viewing in the home only (hence the copyright notice that appears at the start of many VHS tapes and DVDs , which states that the content must not be
shown in oil rigs, prisons or schools). Until these technologies were
widespread, most non-theatrical screenings were on 16mm film prints supplied by the distributor. Today, the
most common business model is for a distributor to sell the exhibitor
a licence that permits the legal projection of a copy of the film, which the
exhibitor buys separately on a home video format. These licences can either be
for individual, one-off screenings, or cover an unlimited number of screenings
of titles represented by that distributor for a specified time period. The
latter are often purchased by pubs and students' unions , to enable them to show occasional feature films on a
TV in their bars. 

 Home video distribution: 

 Some
distributors only handle home video distribution or some sub-set of home video
distribution such as DVD and/or Blu-ray distribution and now the fastest
growing area id Video on Demand (VOD). The remaining home video rights may be
licensed by the producer to other distributors or the distributor may
sub-license them to other distributors. 

 If
a distributor is going to distribute a movie on a physical format such as DVD,
they must arrange for the creation of the artwork for the case and the face of
the DVD and arrange with a DVD replicator to create a glass master to press
quantities of the DVD. 

 Today , some movie producers are using a process
called DVD-on-demand. In DVD-on-demand, a company will burn a DVD-R (a process
called duplication) when a copy of the DVD is ordered, and then ship in to the
customer. 

 A
distributor may also maintain contact with wholesalers , who sell and ship DVDs to retail outlets
as well as online stores, and arrange for them to carry the DVD. The
distributor may also place ads in magazines and online and send copies of the
DVD to reviewers. 

 The
newest area Video on Demand (VOD) is expected to grow as a result of new media devices, mobile
phones, PDA s, tablets and I-Pads as additional ways individuals consume
content. 

The New Hollywood/Foreign
Distribution: 

In the past, big
studios have not always used analysis, analytics, metrics or measurement; but
that is not true any longer. Companies such as Relativity Media use a new Hollywood
approach that is vastly more technical than preparing an analysis of how many
people actually attend the theater as a result of buying a ticket. Their
approach now accounts for thousands of variables, from the stars of a movie to
its release date to the type of media used in production, and compares each of
those variables to nearly every film ever made with at least one of the same
attributes. It takes four people just to operate the program that governs their
approach. 

New Hollywood
companies employ a movie-rejection system, not a movie-picking system, while
the data-intensive approach operates on a new paradigm of new media marketing
and buzzworthy elements intertwined into the infrastructure of the movie. Big
studios are swinging for the fences, and they lose money on 85 percent of the
movies they make; they don t have a hedge against those losses, so they need
the one or two franchise movies each year to make up for the money losers. New
Hollywood studios have hedges; they make movies that people will love, but also
on a financially based system. They don t take huge risks. 

8 

The New Hollywood studios can make money without a blockbuster on
its slate, if it controls upfront costs and has unique arrangements with film
distributors on the back-end. Unlike most major studios, who own their own
distribution companies, New Hollywood studios seek relationships with over 117
distributors around the globe, each of which could come under contract to buy
any movie the studio makes at a preset percentage of the film s budget. In
return, the distributors are guaranteed a piece of the back-end revenue for
each movie. For New Hollywood studios, the structure is a safety net for films
that underperform, a safety net the major studios don t have.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Lack
of Profitable Operating History 

The
Company does not have a history of profitable operation. There is no assurance
that the Company will ever be profitable. The Company s ability to achieve
profitability will depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited
to, whether the Company: 

has
funds available for working capital, project development and sales and
marketing efforts; 

 has
funds for the continuous upgrading of its production operations and facilities;

achieves
the projected sales revenues; 

 controls
the Company s operating expenses; 

 continues
to attract new business; and 

withstands competition in the Company s marketplace. 

 9 

Competition 

 The
Company s competitors are rapidly changing and may be well capitalized and
financially stronger than Destination Television. Our competitors could
reproduce the company s business model without significant barriers to entry. 

The
Company s activities may require additional financing, which may not be
obtainable. 

The Company had limited cash
deposits. Based on the Company s expectations as to future performance, the
Company considers these resources and existing and anticipated credit
facilities, to be inadequate to meet the Company s anticipated cash and working
capital needs at least through December 31, 2013. The Company, however, expects
to be able to raise capital to fund the Company s operations, current and
future acquisitions and investment in new program development. The Company may
also need to raise additional capital to fund expansion of the Company s
business by way of one or more strategic acquisitions. Unless the Company s
results improve significantly, it is doubtful that the Company will be able to
obtain additional capital for any purpose if and when the Company needs it. 

The
Company depends heavily on the Company s senior management who may be difficult
to replace. 

The Company believes that the
Company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills,
experience and efforts of its chairman, CEO, and other key executives. Any of
these executives would be difficult to replace. While all of them have
incentives to remain with the Company, they are not bound by employment
contracts, and there is no assurance that either of them will not elect to
terminate their services to us at any time. 

Increasing
the Company s business depends on the Company s ability to increase demand for
the Company s products and services. 

While the Company believes
that there is a market for its planned increase in the Company s products and
services, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its
choice of product or technology or that consumer demand will increase as the
Company anticipates. 

The
Company may be exposed to significant costs of defense and damages in
litigation stemming from current unresolved legal proceedings undertaken in the
future by and against the Company. 

The Company could be subject
of legal proceedings against the Company that could give rise to significant
exposure in costs and damages. 

The
Company s ability to operate and compete effectively requires that the Company
hires and retain skilled marketing and technical personnel, who have been in
short supply from time to time and may be unavailable to us when the Company
needs them. 

The Company s business
requires us to be able to continuously attract, train, motivate and retain
highly skilled employees, particularly marketing and other senior management
personnel. The Company s failure to attract and retain the highly trained
personnel who are integral to the Company s sales, development and distribution
processes may limit the rate at which the Company can generate sales. The
Company s inability to attract and retain the individuals the Company needs
could adversely impact the Company s business and its ability to achieve
profitability. 

The
Company may suffer from a business interruption and continuity of its ongoing
operations might be affected. 

The Company s ability to
implement its business plans may be adversely affected by any business
interruption that will affect the continuity of its operations. While the
Company may take reasonable steps to protect itself, there could be
interruptions from computer viruses, server attacks, network or production
failures and other potential interruptions that would be beyond the Company s
reasonable control. There can be no assurance that the Company s efforts will
prevent all such interruptions. Any of the foregoing events may result in an
interruption of services and a breach of the Company s obligations to its
clients and customers or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the
business of the Company. 

10 

Macro-economic
factors may impede business, access to finance or may increase the cost of
finance or other operational costs of the Company. 

Changes in the United States
and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, interest
rate fluctuations, or inflation changes, may make it more difficult for the
Company to obtain financing for its operations or investments or increase the
cost of obtaining financing. In the event that the Company is delayed in
attaining its projections, borrowing costs can be affected by short and
long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies which are
based, in significant part, on the Company s performance as measured by credit
metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Decrease in these ratios
or debt ratings would increase the Company s cost of borrowings and make it
more difficult to obtain financing. 

There
is a limitation on the officers and directors liability. 

The articles of the Company
limit the personal liability of directors and officers for breach of fiduciary
duty and the Company provides an indemnity for expenses and liabilities to any
person who is threatened or made a party to any legal action by reason of the
fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the Company unless the
action of proven to that the person was liable to be negligent or misconduct in
the performance of their duty to the Company. 

The loss of our key
officers or directors may raise substantial doubt as to the continued viability
of the Company . 

The Company s operations
depend on the efforts of key officers and directors and the loss of their
services may irreparably harm the Company in such a manner that it may not be
able to overcome any such loss in management. 

Investors
may lose their entire investment if the Company fails to implement its business
plan . 

The Company expects to face
substantial risks, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties because it is a
development stage company. The Company was formed in 1961. The Company has no
demonstrable operations record of substance upon which you can evaluate the
Company s business and prospects. The Company prospects must be considered in
light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in their early stages of development. The Company
cannot guarantee that it will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. 

As of the date of this
prospectus, the Company has had only limited startup operations and has
generated very small revenues. Considering these facts, independent auditors
have expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern in the independent auditors report to the financial statements
included in the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part. In
addition, the Company s lack of operating capital could negatively affect the
value of its common shares and could result in the loss of your entire
investment. 

Because of our new
business model, we have not proven our ability to generate profit, and any
investment in The Company is risky . 

We have very little
meaningful operating history so it will be difficult for you to evaluate an
investment in our stock. We have not sold any of our products to date. Our
auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern. We cannot assure that we will ever be profitable. Since we
have not proven the essential elements of profitable operations, you will be
furnishing venture capital to us and will bear the risk of complete loss of
your investment in the event we are not successful. 

We may be unsuccessful in
monitoring new trends. 

Our net revenue might
decrease with time. Consequently, our future success depends on our ability to
identify and monitor trends and the development of new markets. To establish
market acceptance of a new technologies, we will dedicate significant resources
to research and development, production and sales and marketing. We will incur
significant costs in developing, commissioning and selling new products, which
often significantly precedes meaningful revenues from its sale. Consequently,
new business can require significant time and investment to achieve
profitability. Prospective investors should note, however, that there can be no
assurance that our efforts to introduce new products or other services will be
successful or profitable. 

11 

We
may face distribution and product risks. 

Our future financial results
depend in large part on our ability to develop relationships with our
customers. Any disruption in our relationships with our future customers could
adversely affect our financial performance. 

We may face claims of
infringement on intellectual property rights. 

Other parties may assert
claims of ownership or infringement or assert a right to payment with respect
to the exploitation of certain intellectual properties against us. In many
cases, the rights owned or being acquired by us are limited in scope, do not
extend to exploitation in all present or future uses or in perpetuity. We
cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these claims. In addition, our
ability to demonstrate, maintain or enforce these rights may be difficult. The
inability to demonstrate or difficulty in demonstrating our ownership or
license rights in these technologies may adversely affect our ability to
generate revenue from or use of these intellectual property rights. 

If
our operating costs exceed our estimates, it may impact our ability to continue
operations . 

We believe we have accurately
estimated our needs for the next twelve months. It is possible that we may need
to purchase additional equipment, hire additional personnel, and further
develop new business ventures, or that our operating costs will be higher than
estimated. If this happens, it may impact our ability to generate revenue and
we would need to seek additional funding. We intend to establish our initial
client base via existing relationships that our directors and officers have
established in past business relationships. Should these relationships not
generate the anticipated volume of business, any unanticipated costs would
diminish our working capital. 

Competitors
with more resources may force us out of business . 

Competition in our sectors of
business come from a variety of factors, including quality, timely
commissioning of new projects, product positioning, pricing and brand name
recognition. The principal competitors for our business may do this better
than we can. Each of these competitors has substantially greater financial
resources than we do. New technologies may also present substantial
competition. We may be unsuccessful in competing with these competitors, which
may materially harm our business. 

The Company may not be
able to attain profitability without additional funding, which may be
unavailable . 

The Company has limited
capital resources. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to
finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience liquidity and
solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company
to cease operations if additional financing is not available.

ITEM 3. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company, Inc. is in possession of third party equipment as a result of a
previous company (Studione 1) that left the premises and claimed ownership of
the property. We were contacted by a third party and shareholder of Peter
Langone affiliated Company Global Branding who stated they were the owers of
the equipment and if we turned over the equipment to Peter Langone et al., they
would litigate. Peter Langone commenced litigation on the equipment and,
the third party provided discovery to the Judge, who ordered the Company to
preserve the 

12 

equipment pending the outcome of litigation or
settlement discussions between the parties or additional court order(s). The
Company, Inc. has preserved all the equipment as stated by the judge and has
never made any claim as to ownership of the property and further expects to be
dismissed of the lawsuit without prejudice once the true ownership of the
equipment can be identified by the courts.

Plan of Operation 

The Movie Studio, Inc. F/K/A Destination Television, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1961 under the name Magic Fingers, Inc. By amendment of its certificate of incorporation, the Company's name was changed in 1999 to Magicinc.com and in April 2002 to Magic Media Networks, Inc. and in February 2007 to Destination Television, Inc. In November of 2012 , the Company filed an amendment to change its name to The Movie Studio, Inc. Through the period ended October 31, 1999, the Company devoted substantially all its efforts to reorganizing its financial affairs and settling its debt obligations. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2000 and October 31, 2001, the Company was engaged primarily in the planning and development of an interactive network to provide entertainment via the Internet. Subsequent to October 31, 2001, the Company redirected its business focus to the development of a private television network, in high traffic locations such as bars and nightclubs. During the development process, the Company received incidental revenue from the sale of advertising and the production of commercials.

For the year ended October 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no revenues. 

Total expenses for the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011 were 172,319 and 192,371, respectively, a decrease of 20,052, or 10 . This decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately 13,500 in selling and general and administrative expenses and a decrease of 6,552 in interest expense. 

For the year ended October 31, 2012, interest expense decreased 6,552 to 36,464 (15 from the 43,016 reported for the year ended October 31, 2011. This decrease results from the decrease in short-term borrowings during the year ended October 31, 2012.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the year ended October 31, 2012, we used 133,000 for operating activities, as compared to 133,000 used for operations for the year ended October 31, 2011. 

Historically, we have financed our business primarily from the receipt of cash from financing activities. During the year ended October 31, 2012, we received proceeds of 133,000 from loans made to the Company by related party shareholders. 

At October 31, 2012, we reported total liabilities of 2,489,307, all of which is current and due within one year. The liability total consists of loans payable to an entity owned by a shareholder and officer of the Company, of 1,353,420. This entity assumed the debt due to Dr. Terry for an equity interest in the entity owned by the shareholder and officer. The Company is also indebted to its president and CEO in the amount of 727,705; 680,597 of this amount represents accrued wages and the balance of 47,108 represents funds he advanced to the Company for working capital purposes. 

At October 31, 2011, we reported total liabilities of 2,319,843, all of which was current and due within one year. The liability total consists of loans payable to an entity owned by a shareholder and officer of the Company, of 1,353,420. This entity assumed the debt due to Dr. Terry for an equity interest in the entity owned by the shareholder and officer. The Company is also indebted to its president and CEO in the amount of 594,705; 547,597 of this amount represents accrued wages and the balance of 47,108 represents funds he advanced to the Company for working capital purposes. 

We also owe the Internal Revenue Service approximately 375,000 for unpaid payroll taxes. The Company did submit an Offer in Compromise to substantially reduce the liability; however, the Internal Revenue Service rejected our initial Offer in Compromise. We have appealed the Internal Revenue Service s rejection, and we continue to negotiate with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all outstanding issues related to the unpaid payroll taxes. All payroll tax obligations incurred during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011 have been paid. 

Capital Expenditures 

Our requirements for capital expenditures should not exceed 10,000 for year ended October 31, 2013. 

Inflation 

We believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during 2012 and 2011. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during 2012 and 2011. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance regarding Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing 

information about fair value measurement under both U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including a consistent definition of the term "fair value." The amendments were effective beginning in the first quarter of 2012, and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 220-10 by eliminating the option of reporting other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Companies will have the option of presenting net income and other comprehensive income in a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income or presenting two separate but consecutive statements of net income and comprehensive income. The new presentation requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

15 

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment . This update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 350-20-35 by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

ASC 480, In March of 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ; primarily originated from FAS 150 and related interpretations. This subtopic establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The guidance applies to freestanding financial instruments, thus reinforcing the importance of this determination. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operation, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

 . 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheets. On an on-going basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting policies include income taxes and stock-based compensation for services. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes which requires accounting for deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax asset and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce the deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

In accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and may file income tax returns in various U.S. state and local jurisdictions. Generally the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2005. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. 

 This policy also provides guidance on
thresholds, measurement, de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is
intended to provide better financial statement comparability among different
entities. It must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial
adoption and the cumulative effect, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment
to stockholder s equity as of January 1, 2009. Based on its analysis, the
Company has determined that the adoption of this policy did not have a material
impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption. However,
management s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and
adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to,
on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations
thereof.

 Stock-Based Compensation for Services 

The Company complies with
FASB ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation, which establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in
which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be
settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. FASB ASC Topic 718 focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires an
entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an
award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award
(with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during
which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
(usually the vesting period). No compensation costs are recognized for equity
instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. The
grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be
estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics
of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar
instruments are available). If an equity award is modified after the grant
date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to
the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the
original award immediately before the modification. No employee stock options
or stock awards vested during 2012 or 2011 under FASB ASC 718. 

Nonemployee
awards 

The fair value of equity
instruments issued to a nonemployee is measured by using the stock price and
other measurement assumptions as of the date of either: (i) a commitment for
performance by the nonemployee has been reached; or (ii) the counterparty s
performance is complete. Expenses related to nonemployee awards are generally
recognized in the same period as the Company incurs the related liability for
goods and services received. The Company recorded stock compensation of
approximately -0- and -0- during the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, related to consulting services.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 The Movie Studio, Inc. (FKA Destination Television). 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of The Movie Studio, Inc. (FKA Destination Television) as of October 31, 2012 and 2011 and the statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Movie Studio, Inc. (FKA Destination Television) as of October 31, 2012 and 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, has accumulated deficits of 9.3 million, and it does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in this regard are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 OCTOBER 31, 20 12 

Note 1 Description of Business 

The Movie Studio, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Delaware 1961 under the name Magic Fingers, Inc. The company is a vertically integrated motion picture production company that develops, manufactures and distributes independent motion picture content for worldwide consumption on a multitude of devices. 

The Company has operated under various names since incorporation, most recently Destination Television, Inc. from February 2007 to November 2012, when the name was changed to The Movie Studio, Inc. 

From October 31, 2001, the Company s focus was on the developing a private television network, in high traffic locations such as bars and nightclubs. During this development period, the Company received incidental revenue from the sale of advertising and the production of commercials. In 2010, the Company began implementation of its current business model, using the technology previously developed for the private television network. 

Note 2 Summary of significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Movie Studio, Inc. (Formerly Destination Television, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary Destination Television, Inc., a Florida corporation. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiary have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Long-Lived Assets 

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. There were no impairment charges during the years ended October 31, 20 12 and 20 11 . 

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 The fair values of the Company s assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, approximate their carrying amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition at October 31, 20 12 and 20 11 . 

 Revenue recognition 

 In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, which requires accounting for deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax asset and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce the deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 OCTOBER 31, 20 12 

Note 2 Summary of significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Income Taxes (continued) 

In accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and may file income tax returns in various U.S. state and local jurisdictions. Generally the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2005. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. This policy also provides guidance on thresholds, measurement, de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial statement comparability among different entities. It must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption and the cumulative effect, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to stockholder s equity as of January 1, 2009. Based on its analysis, the Company has determined that the adoption of this policy did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption. However, management s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 

Comprehensive Income 

The Company complies with FASB ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, which establishes rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and its components. FASB ASC Topic 220 requires the Company s change in foreign currency translation adjustments to be included in other comprehensive loss, and is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity. 

S tock-Based Compensation 

 The Company complies with FASB ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation, which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. FASB ASC Topic 718 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). No compensation costs are recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available). If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the 

modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. No employee stock options or stock awards vested during 2012 or 2011 under FASB ASC 718.

Note 2 Summary of significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Stock-Based Compensation (continued) 

Nonemployee awards 

The fair value of equity instruments issued to a nonemployee is measured by using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the date of either: (i) a commitment for performance by the nonemployee has been reached; or (ii) the counterparty s performance is complete. Expenses related to nonemployee awards are generally recognized in the same period as the Company incurs the related liability for goods and services received. The Company recorded stock compensation expense of approximately -0- and -0- during the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to consulting services. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance regarding Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurement under both U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including a consistent definition of the term "fair value." The amendments were effective beginning in the first quarter of 2012, and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 220-10 by eliminating the option of reporting other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Companies will have the option of presenting net income and other comprehensive income in a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income or presenting two separate but consecutive statements of net income and comprehensive income. The new presentation requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment . This update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 350-20-35 by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operation, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASC 480, In March of 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ; primarily originated from FAS 150 and related interpretations. This subtopic establishes standards for 

how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The guidance applies to freestanding financial instruments, thus reinforcing the importance of this determination. 

Loss Per Common Share 

The Company complies with the accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share incorporates the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on an average basis during the period.

Note 3 Going Concern 

The accompany financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assume that Destination Television, Inc. will continue in operation for a least one year and realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. 

Several conditions cast doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 9.3 million as of October 31, 2012, has no cash available for payment of operating expenses, no source of revenue, and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on ongoing basis. The Company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to continued progress in the pursuit of business opportunities. The Company is actively pursuing alternative financing and has discussions with various third parties, although no firm commitments have been obtained. In the interim, the principal shareholder has committed to meeting any operating expenses incurred by the Company. The Company believes that actions it is presently taking to revise its operating and financial requirements provide it with the opportunity to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. While we believe that the actions already taken or planned, will mitigate the adverse conditions and events which raise doubt about the validity of going concern assumption used in preparing these financial statements, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. If the Company were unable to continue as a going concern, then substantial adjustments would be necessary to the carrying values of the reported liabilities. 

Note 4 - Acquired Amortizable Intangible Assets 

 As of October 31, 2006, the Company invested 3,280 in establishing trademarks associated with its concept of placing TV s in bars, hotels and gyms. The Company amortizes the costs of these intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are also tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment, at least annually, and written down to fair value as required. 

 Expected annual amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets is as follows:

Note 5 - Income Taxes 

 The Company has approximately 9.3 million in net operating loss carryovers available to reduce future income taxes. These carryovers expire at various dates through the year 20 32 . The Company has adopted FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which provides for the recognition of a deferred tax asset based upon the value the loss carry-forwards will have to reduce future income taxes and management's estimate of the probability of the realization of these tax benefits. The Company's management determined that it was more likely than not that the Company's net operating loss carry-forwards would not be utilized; therefore, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset has been established. 

 A summary of the deferred tax asset presented on the accompanying balance sheets is as follows:

 Employment Agreements 

 Gordon Scott Venters is employed as the Company's president and c hief executive officer pursuant to an employment agreement, effective November 1, 2007. The three-year employment agreement, which extended a previous agreement, provides for an annual salary of 161,662; annual increases of a minimum of 5 ; and participation in incentive or bonus plans at the discretion of the b oard of d irectors. The agreement additionally provides for certain confidentiality and non-competition provisions and a minimum payment of 18 months salary in the event of a change of control or termination without cause, or if the employee terminates for good reason.

 Note 7 - Payroll Taxes Payable 

 As of October 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately 336,386 and 299,923, respectively, for unpaid payroll taxes, interest, and penalties, for unpaid payroll taxes for periods ended prior to the year ended October 31, 2007.

In August 2007, the Company made a lump-sum payment of 48,000, and in November 2007, an additional lump sum payment of 18,600.

There is no assurance that an acceptable settlement will be reached. Payroll tax obligations for the calendar years 2007, 2008 , 2009 , 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been paid as required.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON 

 ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Our accountant is Patrick Rodgers CPA, P.A. We do not presently intend to change accountants. At no time have there been any disagreements with such accountant regarding any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

- Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly 

 reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

- Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

 - Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent 

 limitations. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of
the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to
design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As of October 31, 2012
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on
that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report,
such internal controls and procedures were not effective. 

This annual report does not
include an attestation report of the Corporation's registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report
was not subject to attestation by the Corporation's registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the
Corporation to provide only the management's report in this annual report.
