 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
 Organization 
 EastGroup Properties, Inc. (the Company or EastGroup) is an equity real estate investment trust (REIT) organized in 1969. The Company has elected to be taxed and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), as amended. 
 
 Available Information 
 The Company maintains a website at eastgroup.net. The Company posts its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, the Company's website includes items related to corporate governance matters, including, among other things, the Company's corporate governance guidelines, charters of various committees of the Board of Directors, and the Company's code of business conduct and ethics applicable to all employees, officers and directors. The Company intends to disclose on its website any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of this code of business conduct and ethics applicable to the Company's directors and executive officers that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange. Copies of these reports and corporate governance documents may be obtained, free of charge, from the Company's website. Any shareholder also may obtain copies of these documents, free of charge, by sending a request in writing to: Investor Relations, EastGroup Properties, Inc., 190 East Capitol Street, Suite 400, Jackson, MS 39201-2152. 
 
 Administration 
 EastGroup maintains its principal executive office and headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi. The Company also has regional offices in Orlando, Houston and Phoenix and asset management offices in Charlotte and Dallas. EastGroup has property management offices in Jacksonville, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and San Antonio. Offices at these locations allow the Company to provide property management services to all of its Florida (except Fort Myers), Texas (except El Paso), Arizona, Mississippi and North Carolina properties, which together account for 77 of the Company s total portfolio on a square foot basis. In addition, the Company currently provides property administration (accounting of operations) for its entire portfolio. The regional offices in Florida, Texas and Arizona provide oversight of the Company's development program. As of February 15, 2013 , EastGroup ha d 65 full-time employees and 3 part -time employees. 
 
 Operations 
 EastGroup is focused on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties in major Sunbelt markets throughout the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. The Company s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the 5,000 to 50,000 square foot range. EastGroup s strategy for growth is based on the ownership of premier distribution facilities generally clustered near major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets. Over 99 of the Company s revenue consists of rental income from real estate properties. 
 
 During 2012 , EastGroup increased its holdings in real estate properties through its acquisition and development programs. The Company purchased three warehouse distribution complexes (878,000 square feet) and 109.8 acres of development land for a total of 64.7 million. Also during 2012 , the Company began construction of nine development projects containing 757,000 square feet in Houston and Orlando and transferred four properties (273,000 square feet) in Houston from its development program to real estate properties with costs of 18.0 million at the date of transfer. 
 
 EastGroup incurs short-term floating rate bank debt in connection with the acquisition and development of real estate and, as market conditions permit, replaces floating rate debt with equity and/or fixed-rate term loans. In prior years, EastGroup primarily obtained secured debt. In January 2013, Fitch affirmed the Company's credit rating of BBB, and Moody's assigned the Company a credit rating of Baa2. The Company intends to obtain primarily unsecured fixed rate debt in the future. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital. EastGroup also may, in appropriate circumstances, acquire one or more properties in exchange for EastGroup securities. 
 
 EastGroup holds its properties as long-term investments but may determine to sell certain properties that no longer meet its investment criteria. The Company may provide financing in connection with such sales of property if market conditions require. In addition, the Company may provide financing to a partner or co-owner in connection with an acquisition of real estate in certain situations. 
 
 3 

Subject to the requirements necessary to maintain EastGroup s qualifications as a REIT, the Company may acquire securities of entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over those entities. 
 
 The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code. To maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders. If the Company has a capital gain, it has the option of (i) deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax-deferred exchange, (ii) declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax, or (iii) retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long-term capital gain, with shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long-term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the Company. 
 
 EastGroup has no present intention of acting as an underwriter of offerings of securities of other issuers. The strategies and policies set forth above were determined and are subject to review by EastGroup's Board of Directors, which may change such strategies or policies based upon its evaluation of the state of the real estate market, the performance of EastGroup's assets, capital and credit market conditions, and other relevant factors. EastGroup provides annual reports to its stockholders, which contain financial statements audited by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property. Many such laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knows of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to use such property as collateral in its borrowings. EastGroup s properties have been subjected to Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) by independent environmental consultants and as necessary, have been subjected to Phase II ESAs. These reports have not revealed any potential significant environmental liability. Management of EastGroup is not aware of any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on EastGroup s business, assets, financial position or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business. The Company refers to itself as "we", "us" or "our" in the following risk factors. 
 
 Real Estate Industry Risks 
 We face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties. We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions. For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us. Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include: 

population and demographic trends; 
 
 employment and personal income trends; 
 
 income tax laws; 
 
 changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing; 
 
 increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; and 
 
 construction costs. 
 
 We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants . The real estate business is highly competitive. We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have. Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners. All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition. We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth. 
 
 We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities. Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities. Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Future 
 4 

legislation may impose additional requirements. We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation. 
 
 Risks Associated with Our Properties 
 We may be unable to lease space. When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it. We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all. The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease. We also develop some properties with no pre-leasing. If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected. 
 
 We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays. At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties. As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease. We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under long-term leases. If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs. If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant. We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises. If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant. A tenant s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution. 
 
 We face risks associated with our property development. We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment. Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations. Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include: 

the availability of favorable financing alternatives; 
 
 the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable; 
 
 construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor; 
 
 construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs; 
 
 expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete; 
 
 fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and 
 
 complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits. 
 
 We face risks associated with property acquisitions . We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: 

when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price; 
 
 acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; 
 
 the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates; 
 
 acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; 
 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and 
 
 we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. 
 
 5 

Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses . We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located. However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance. In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. 
 
 We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity. Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us. Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry. 
 
 We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited. In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties. If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company. 
 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate. They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination. Contamination may adversely affect the owner s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned. Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property. A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability. Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties. Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. 
 
 Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with green building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties. Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities. The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events. 
 
 Financing Risks 
 We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as balloon payments. Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt. 
 
 We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings 
 6 

and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio. Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders. 
 
 Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition . The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 
 Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. 
 
 Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations and value of our stock. As of December 31, 2012 , we had approximately 76.2 million of variable interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2012 , the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 1.12 . We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher rates. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock. 
 
 A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged . Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase. 
 
 Other Risks 
 The market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions. The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets. The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates. Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends. 
 
 The current economic situation may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations. However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make. Additionally, the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. No assurances can be given that the effects of the current economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates. In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification. Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. To 
 7 

qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements. We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions. In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification. We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT. 
 
 There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts . Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors. 
 
 We face possible adverse changes in tax laws. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends. 
 
 Our Charter contains provisions that may adversely affect the value of EastGroup stock . Our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8 (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8 of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders. 
 
 The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel. Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties. The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel. In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. 
 
 We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company. If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination. These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us. 
 
 Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval . Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests. 
 
 Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us . Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations. The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition. Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director. Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law. 
 
 8 

The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation. 
 
 The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter. "Control Shares" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power. A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value. If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.

 As permitted under the Company's equity compensation plans, these shares were withheld by the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for those employees who elected this option in connection with the vesting of shares of restricted stock. Shares withheld for tax withholding obligations do not affect the total number of remaining shares available for repurchase under the Company's common stock repurchase plan. 
 
 (2) 
 During the first quarter of 2012, EastGroup's Board of Directors terminated its previous plan which authorized the repurchase of up to 1,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. Under the common stock repurchase plan, the Company purchased a total of 827,700 shares for 14,170,000 (an average of 17.12 per share).

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 EastGroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the 5,000 to 50,000 square foot range. The Company acquires, develops and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions. The Company s core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. 
 
 The operations of the Company improved during 2012 compared to 2011. The Company believes its current operating cash flow and lines of credit provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company for 2013. The Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain mortgage and term loan financing from insurance companies and financial institutions as evidenced by the closing of a 54 million, non-recourse first mortgage loan in January 2012, the closing of an 80 million unsecured term loan in August 2012, and the continuous common equity offering programs, which provided net proceeds to the Company of 109.6 million during 2012 , as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources . In addition, the Company's 225 million lines of credit were repaid and replaced in January 2013 with new credit facilities totaling 250 million, also as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 
 The Company s primary revenue is rental income; as such, EastGroup s greatest challenge is leasing space. During 2012 , leases expired on 5,451,000 square feet (17.8 of EastGroup s total square footage of 30,651,000, and the Company was successful in renewing or re-leasing 81 of the expiring square feet. In addition, EastGroup leased 2,048,000 square feet of other vacant space during the year. During 2012 , average rental rates on new and renewal leases increased by 0.7 . Property net operating income (PNOI) from same properties, defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period, increased 0.8 for 2012 compared to 2011 . 
 
 EastGroup s total leased percentage was 95.1 at December 31, 2012 compared to 94.7 at December 31, 2011 . Leases scheduled to expire in 2013 were 17.1 of the portfolio on a square foot basis at December 31, 2012 . As of February 15, 2013 , leases scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2013 were 13.7 of the portfolio on a square foot basis. 
 
 The Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisition and development programs. During 2012 , EastGroup purchased three warehouse distribution complexes (878,000 square feet) and 109.8 acres of development land for a total of 64.7 million. The operating properties are located in Dallas (722,000 square feet), Hayward, California (84,000 square feet), and Tampa (72,000 square feet). The development land is located in Houston (71.4 acres), Tampa (18.0 acres), Chandler (Phoenix) (10.5 acres), Denver (5.8 acres) and Dallas (4.1 acres). 
 
 EastGroup continues to see targeted development as a contributor to the Company s long-term growth. The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity. During 2012 , the Company began construction of nine development projects containing 757,000 square feet in Houston and Orlando. Also in 2012 , EastGroup transferred four properties (273,000 square feet) in Houston from its development program to real estate properties with costs of 18.0 million at the date of transfer. As of December 31, 2012 , EastGroup s development program consisted of 14 buildings (1,055,000 square feet) located in Houston, San Antonio and Orlando. The projected total cost for the development projects, which were collectively 61 leased as of February 15, 2013 , is 80.4 million, of which 29.0 million remained to be invested as of December 31, 2012 . 
 
 Typically, the Company initially funds its acquisition and development programs through its 250 million lines of credit (as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources ). As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt to replace short-term bank borrowings. In prior years, EastGroup primarily obtained secured debt. In January 2013, Fitch affirmed the Company's credit rating of BBB, and Moody's assigned the Company a credit rating of Baa2. The Company intends to obtain primarily unsecured fixed rate debt in the future. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital. 
 
 EastGroup has one reportable segment industrial properties. These properties are primarily located in major Sunbelt regions of the United States, have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria permitting the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment. The Company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) property net operating income (PNOI), defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses (excluding interest expense, depreciation expense on buildings and improvements, and amortization expense on capitalized leasing costs and in-place lease intangibles), and (2) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (FFO), defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 13 

(GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company calculates FFO based on the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition. 
 
 PNOI is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the Company s real estate investments. The Company believes the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of PNOI provides a supplemental indicator of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts (REITs). The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses. The Company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases. 
 
 PNOI is comprised of Income from real estate operations , less Expenses from real estate operations . PNOI was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .

Income from real estate operations is comprised of rental income, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees. Expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees, other operating costs and bad debt expense. Generally, the Company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance. Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company s total leases). Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases. Modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable. The Company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered. The following table presents reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .

The Company believes FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance for equity REITs. The Company believes excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of FFO is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions. FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company s financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company s liquidity or indicative 
 14 

of funds available to provide for the Company s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. In addition, FFO, as reported by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition. The Company s key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed above), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expense. The following table presents reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders to FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company. 
 
 Real Estate Properties 
 The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. The purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable. 
 
 During the period in which a property is under development, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes, and other direct and indirect costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development properties based on construction activity. 
 
 The Company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired, a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value. Real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs. The evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property. Currently, the Company s management knows of no impairment issues nor has it experienced any impairment issues in recent years. EastGroup currently has the intent and ability to hold its real estate investments and to hold its land inventory for future development. In the event of impairment, the property s basis would be reduced, and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Valuation of Receivables 
 The Company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, the Company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts. Management specifically analyzes aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented. In the event the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off, additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Tax Status 
 EastGroup, a Maryland corporation, has qualified as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intends to continue to qualify as such. To maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders. If the Company has a capital gain, it has the option of (i) deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax-deferred exchange, (ii) declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax, or (iii) retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long-term capital gain, with shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long-term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the Company. The Company distributed all of its 2012 , 2011 and 2010 taxable income to its stockholders. Accordingly, no significant provisions for income taxes were necessary.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 EastGroup s assets were 1,354,102,000 at December 31, 2012 , an increase of 67,586,000 from December 31, 2011 . Liabilities decreased 17,981,000 to 862,926,000 , and equity increased 85,567,000 to 491,176,000 during the same period. The following paragraphs explain these changes in detail. 
 
 Assets 
 Real Estate Properties 
 Real Estate Properties increased 69,333,000 during the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to the purchase of the operating properties detailed below, capital improvements at the Company's properties and the transfer of four properties from Development , as detailed under Development below. These increases were offset by the sale of four properties during the year. Two properties in Tampa, which were held in the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary, sold for 578,000; the Company recognized an after-tax gain of 167,000 in connection with the sale. The Company also sold a property in Phoenix for 7,019,000 and recognized a gain of 1,869,000. In addition, the Company sold a property in Tulsa for 10,300,000 and recognized a gain of 4,474,000.

Also, the Company incurred costs of 1,338,000 on development properties subsequent to transfer to Real Estate Properties ; the Company records these expenditures as development costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Development 
 EastGroup s investment in development at December 31, 2012 consisted of properties in lease-up and under construction of 51,422,000 and prospective development (primarily land) of 96,833,000 . The Company s total investment in development at December 31, 2012 was 148,255,000 compared to 112,149,000 at December 31, 2011 . Total capital invested for development during 2012 was 55,404,000 , which consisted of costs of 52,499,000 and 1,567,000 as detailed in the development activity table below and costs of 1,338,000 on development properties subsequent to transfer to Real Estate Properties .

EastGroup's variable rate interest expense decreased by 349,000 for 2012 as compared to 2011 due to a decrease in the Company's average bank borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the Company's weighted average variable interest rate. 
 
 The Company's fixed rate interest expense increased by 1,900,000 for 2012 as compared to 2011 . The increase in fixed rate interest expense was primarily due to two unsecured term loans obtained by the Company: one in December 2011 for 50,000,000 with a fixed interest rate of 3.91 and a seven-year term, and the other in August 2012 for 80,000,000 with an effective interest rate of 2.92 (rate may vary based on EastGroup's leverage or credit ratings) and a six-year term. The Company expensed 2,724,000 for unsecured term loan expense during 2012 compared to 59,000 for 2011. 
 
 The increase in term loan interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage loan interest expense. The Company recognized mortgage loan interest expense of 34,733,000 in 2012 compared to 35,606,000 in 2011. 

21 

The decrease in fixed rate mortgage loan interest expense was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates, mortgage note repayments and regularly scheduled principal amortization.

The Company s weighted average variable interest rates in 2011 were slightly lower than in 2010. The slight decrease in interest rates was offset by higher average bank borrowings in 2011 compared to 2010.

 EastGroup s fixed rate interest expense decreased by 302,000 in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in fixed rate interest expense primarily resulted from lower interest rates on the refinancing of two mortgage loans in 2011, partially offset by higher average mortgage loan balances in 2011 compared to 2010.

Interest costs incurred during the period of construction of real estate properties are capitalized and offset against interest expense. Capitalized interest increased 158,000 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased activity in the Company s development program in 2011. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization expense from continuing operations decreased 1,049,000 for 2011 compared to 2010 . In 2010, there was a rise in early vacates, resulting in the write-off of specific assets and therefore increased Depreciation and Amortization expense for 2010. In 2011, early vacates decreased significantly. Excluding the change resulting from early vacates, Depreciation and Amortization expense did not change significantly from 2010 to 2011.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 EastGroup has evaluated all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that the following ASUs apply to the Company. 
 
 In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , which provides guidance about how fair value should be applied where it is already required or permitted under U.S. GAAP. The ASU does not extend the use of fair value or require additional fair value measurements, but rather provides explanations about how to measure fair value. ASU 2011-04 requires prospective application and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012. 
 
 27 

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income , which eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity and requires that all nonowner changes in equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 requires retrospective application and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-05 and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012. 
 
 In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This ASU defers the effective date of the requirement in ASU 2011-05 to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income for all periods presented. A final ASU on presentation and disclosure of reclassification adjustments is expected in early 2013. 
 
 In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU, an entity is not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 was effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 91,808,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The primary other sources of cash were from bank borrowings, proceeds from common stock offerings, proceeds from the unsecured term loan payable executed in August 2012, proceeds from the mortgage note payable executed in January 2012 and proceeds from sales of real estate investments. The Company distributed 61,297,000 in common stock dividends during 2012 . Other primary uses of cash were for bank debt repayments, mortgage note repayments, the construction and development of properties, purchases of real estate and capital improvements at various properties. 
 
 Total debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is detailed below. The Company s bank credit facilities and unsecured term loans have certain restrictive covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage, and the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

The Company had a 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of seven banks that matured in January 2013. The interest rate on the facility was based on the LIBOR index and varied according to total liability to total asset value ratios (as defined in the credit agreement), with an annual facility fee of 15 to 20 basis points. The interest rate on each tranche was usually reset on a monthly basis and as of December 31, 2012 , was LIBOR plus 0.85 with an annual facility fee of 0.20 . At December 31, 2012 , the weighted average interest rate was 1.065 on a balance of 71,000,000 . The Company had an additional 129,000,000 remaining on the line of credit at that date. 
 
 The aforementioned credit facility was repaid and replaced in January 2013 with a new four -year, 225 million unsecured credit facility with a group of nine banks with options for a one -year extension and a 100 million expansion. As of February 15, 2013 , the interest rate was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.385 with an annual facility fee of 0.225 . The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. 
 
 The Company also had a 25 million unsecured revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A. that matured in January 2013. This credit facility was customarily used for working capital needs. The interest rate on this working capital line was based on the 
 28 

LIBOR index and varied according to total liability to total asset value ratios (as defined in the credit agreement), with no annual facility fee. The interest rate was reset on a daily basis and as of December 31, 2012 , was LIBOR plus 1.65 . At December 31, 2012 , the interest rate was 1.859 on a balance of 5,160,000 . The Company had an additional 19,840,000 remaining on the line of credit at that date. 
 
 The 25 million credit facility was repaid and replaced in January 2013 with a new four -year, 25 million unsecured credit facility that automatically extends for one year if the extension option in the new 225 million revolving facility is exercised. As of February 15, 2013 , the interest rate, which resets on a daily basis, was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.377 with an annual facility fee of 0.225 . The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. 
 
 As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt to replace the short-term bank borrowings. The Company believes its current operating cash flow and lines of credit provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company for 2013. The Company also believes it can obtain mortgage financing from insurance companies, unsecured debt from financial institutions, and issue common and/or preferred equity. In prior years, EastGroup primarily obtained secured debt. In January 2013, Fitch affirmed the Company's credit rating of BBB, and Moody's assigned the Company a credit rating of Baa2. The Company intends to obtain primarily unsecured fixed rate debt in the future. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital. 
 
 On January 4, 2012, EastGroup closed a 54 million, non-recourse first mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of 4.09 , a 10-year term and a 20-year amortization schedule. The loan is secured by properties containing 1.4 million square feet. The Company used the proceeds of this mortgage loan to reduce variable rate bank borrowings. 
 
 On March 1, 2012, the Company repaid a mortgage loan with a balance of 3.5 million, an interest rate of 5.68 , and a maturity date of June 1, 2012. On April 2, 2012, EastGroup repaid a mortgage loan with a balance of 8.7 million, an interest rate of 7.98 , and a maturity date of June 1, 2012. On May 1, 2012, the Company repaid a mortgage loan with a balance of 1.9 million, an interest rate of 6.43 , and a maturity date of May 15, 2012. On June 4, 2012, the Company repaid a mortgage loan with a balance of 31.7 million, an interest rate of 6.86 , and a maturity date of September 1, 2012. On September 4, 2012, the Company repaid a mortgage loan with a balance of 4.1 million, an interest rate of 5.64 , and a maturity date of January 1, 2013. 
 
 On August 31, 2012, EastGroup closed an 80 million unsecured term loan with a six-year term and interest-only payments. It bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points subject to a pricing grid for changes in the Company s leverage or credit ratings. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap to convert the loan s LIBOR rate to a fixed interest rate, providing the Company an effective fixed rate on the term loan of 2.92 per annum as of December 31, 2012 . The Company used the proceeds of this loan to reduce variable rate bank borrowings. See Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Company's interest rate swap. 
 
 In March 2011, the Company entered into Sales Agency Financing Agreements with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Raymond James Associates, Inc. pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell up to two million shares of its common stock from time to time. The Company completed this continuous equity program during the second quarter of 2012. During the duration of the program from July 2011 through June 2012, the Company sold a total of 2,000,000 shares at an average price of 48.18 per share with net proceeds to the Company of 95 million. 
 
 In September 2012, EastGroup entered into Sales Agency Financing Agreements with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Raymond James Associates, Inc. pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell up to two million shares of its common stock from time to time. 
 
 During 2012 , the Company issued and sold 2,179,153 shares of common stock under its continuous equity programs at an average price of 50.94 per share with gross proceeds to the Company of 110,999,000. The Company incurred offering-related costs of 1,411,000 during the year, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of 109,588,000 . As of February 19, 2013 , the Company has 1,233,870 shares of common stock remaining to sell under the program.

 The Company s variable rate debt changes depending on the Company s cash needs and, as such, both the principal amounts and the interest rates are subject to variability. At December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate was 1.12 on the variable rate debt that matured in January 2013. The debt was replaced with a new four -year, 225 million unsecured credit facility with options for a one -year extension and a 100 million expansion and a new four -year, 25 million unsecured credit facility that automatically extends for one year if the extension option in the new 225 million revolving facility is exercised. As of February 15, 2013 , the interest rate on the 225 million facility was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.385 with an annual facility fee of 0.225 , and the interest rate on the 25 million facility, which resets on a daily basis, was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.377 with an annual facility fee of 0.225 . The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings.

 The Company anticipates that its current cash balance, operating cash flows, borrowings under its lines of credit, proceeds from new mortgage debt and unsecured term loans and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments will be adequate for (i) operating and administrative expenses, (ii) normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties, (iii) debt service obligations, (iv) maintaining compliance with its debt covenants, (v) distributions to stockholders, (vi) capital improvements, (vii) purchases of properties, (viii) development, and (ix) any other normal business activities of the Company, both in the short-term and long-term. 

30 

INFLATION AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Most of the Company's leases include scheduled rent increases. Additionally, most of the Company's leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation. In the event inflation causes increases in the Company s general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates, such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 
 
 EastGroup's financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company's properties are located. The current state of the economy, or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions, could result in the inability of some of the Company's existing tenants to make lease payments and may therefore increase bad debt expense. It may also impact the Company s ability to (i) renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire, or (ii) lease development space. In addition, an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or decline in rents the Company can charge to re-lease properties upon expiration of current leases. In all of these cases, EastGroup s cash flows would be adversely affected. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long-term debt maturities. This debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company s real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, the Company borrows at fixed rates but also has two variable rate bank lines as discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources . In addition, the Company uses interest rate swaps (also discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates for both the fixed rate and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2012 .

 The fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers. 
 (2) 
 The variable rate debt matured in January 2013 and was replaced with a new four -year, 225 million unsecured credit facility with options for a one -year extension and a 100 million expansion and a new four -year, 25 million unsecured credit facility that automatically extends for one year if the extension option in the new 225 million revolving facility is exercised. As of February 15, 2013 , the interest rate on the 225 million facility was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.385 with a n annual facility fee of 0.225 , and the interest rate on the 25 million facility, which resets on a daily basis, was LIBOR plus 1.175 1.377 with an annual facility fee of 0.225 . The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. 
 (3) 
 The fair value of the Company s variable rate debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates. The fair value at December 31, 2012 approximated the book value since the debt matured in early January 2013. 
 (4) 
 Represents the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2012 .

As the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2012 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. If the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by 10 or approximately 11 basis points, interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately 85,000 annually.

Risk Factors in Part I of this report. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions at the time made, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will be achieved. The Company assumes no obligation whatsoever to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS 
 EASTGROUP PROPERTIES INC.: 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EastGroup Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EastGroup Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 19, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 EastGroup s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, EastGroup conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The design of any system of internal control over financial reporting is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on EastGroup s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework , management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS 
 EASTGROUP PROPERTIES INC.: 
 
 We have audited EastGroup Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 In our opinion, EastGroup Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of EastGroup Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 , and our report dated February 19, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 (a) 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EastGroup Properties, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and its investment in any joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling interest. At December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010, the Company had a controlling interest in two joint ventures: the 80 owned University Business Center and the 80 owned Castilian Research Center. The Company records 100 of the joint ventures assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses with noncontrolling interests provided for in accordance with the joint venture agreements. The equity method of accounting is used for the Company s 50 undivided tenant-in-common interest in Industry Distribution Center II. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 (b) 
 Income Taxes 
 EastGroup, a Maryland corporation, has qualified as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intends to continue to qualify as such. To maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders. If the Company has a capital gain, it has the option of (i) deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax-deferred exchange, (ii) declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax, or (iii) retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long-term capital gain, with the shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long-term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the Company. The Company distributed all of its 2012 , 2011 and 2010 taxable income to its stockholders. Accordingly, no significant provisions for income taxes were necessary. The following table summarizes the federal income tax treatment for all distributions by the Company for the years ended 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .

EastGroup applies the principles of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, when evaluating and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. With few exceptions, the Company s 2008 and earlier tax years are closed for examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, the Company had no significant uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . 
 
 The Company s income may differ for tax and financial reporting purposes principally because of (1) the timing of the deduction for the provision for possible losses and losses on investments, (2) the timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the sale of investments, (3) different depreciation methods and lives, (4) real estate properties having a different basis for tax and financial reporting purposes, (5) mortgage loans having a different basis for tax and financial reporting purposes, thereby producing different gains upon collection of these loans, and (6) differences in book and tax allowances and timing for stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 (c) 
 Income Recognition 
 Minimum rental income from real estate operations is recognized on a straight-line basis. The straight-line rent calculation on leases includes the effects of rent concessions and scheduled rent increases, and the calculated straight-line rent income is recognized over the lives of the individual leases. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, including straight-line rents receivable, based upon estimates determined by management. Management specifically analyzes aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
 
 Revenue is recognized on payments received from tenants for early terminations after all criteria have been met in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. 
 45 

 EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate in accordance with the principles set forth in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment . Upon closing of real estate transactions, the provisions of ASC 360 require consideration for the transfer of rights of ownership to the purchaser, receipt of an adequate cash down payment from the purchaser, adequate continuing investment by the purchaser and no substantial continuing involvement by the Company. If the requirements for recognizing gains have not been met, the sale and related costs are recorded, but the gain is deferred and recognized by a method other than the full accrual method. 
 
 The Company recognizes interest income on mortgage loans on the accrual method unless a significant uncertainty of collection exists. If a significant uncertainty exists, interest income is recognized as collected. Discounts on mortgage loans receivable are amortized over the lives of the loans using a method that does not differ materially from the interest method. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal on each of its loans to determine whether the loans are impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of loss is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate or to the fair value of the underlying collateral (if the loan is collateralized) less costs to sell. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , there was no significant uncertainty of collection; therefore, interest income was recognized, and the discount on mortgage loans receivable was amortized. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company determined that no allowance for collectibility of the mortgage loans receivable was necessary. 
 
 (d) 
 Real Estate Properties 
 EastGroup has one reportable segment industrial properties. These properties are concentrated in major Sunbelt markets of the United States, primarily in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina, have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment. 
 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows (including estimated future expenditures necessary to substantially complete the asset) expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company determined that no impairment charges on the Company s real estate properties were necessary. 
 
 Depreciation of buildings and other improvements, including personal property, is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of generally 40 years for buildings and 3 to 15 years for improvements and personal property. Building improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized. Depreciation expense for continuing and discontinued operations was 51,564,000 , 48,648,000 and 48,442,000 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. 
 
 (e) 
 Development 
 During the period in which a property is under development, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development properties based on construction activity. As the property becomes occupied, depreciation commences on the occupied portion of the building, and costs are capitalized only for the portion of the building that remains vacant. When the property becomes 80 occupied or one year after completion of the shell construction (whichever comes first), capitalization of development costs ceases. The properties are then transferred to real estate properties, and depreciation commences on the entire property (excluding the land). 
 
 (f) 
 Real Estate Held for Sale 
 The Company considers a real estate property to be held for sale when it meets the criteria established under ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including when it is probable that the property will be sold within a year. A key indicator of probability of sale is whether the buyer has a significant amount of earnest money at risk. Real estate properties held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are not depreciated while they are held for sale. In accordance with the guidelines established under the Codification, the results of operations for the operating properties sold or held for sale during the reported periods are shown under Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Interest expense is not generally allocated to the properties held for sale or whose operations are included under Discontinued Operations unless the mortgage is required to be paid in full upon the sale of the property.

(g) 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 EastGroup applies ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which requires all entities with derivative instruments to disclose information regarding how and why the entity uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the entity s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. See Note 13 for a discussion of the Company's derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
 
 (h) 
 Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 
 
 (i) 
 Amortization 
 Debt origination costs are deferred and amortized over the term of each loan using the effective interest method. Amortization of loan costs for continuing operations was 1,203,000 , 1,053,000 and 1,056,000 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. 
 
 Leasing costs are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Leasing costs paid during the period are included in Changes in other assets and other liabilities in the Investing Activities section on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Leasing costs amortization expense for continuing and discontinued operations was 7,082,000 , 6,487,000 and 6,703,000 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Amortization expense for in-place lease intangibles is disclosed below in Business Combinations and Acquired Intangibles . 
 
 (j) 
 Business Combinations and Acquired Intangibles 
 Upon acquisition of real estate properties, the Company applies the principles of ASC 805, Business Combinations , which requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. The Codification also provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties. The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. 
 
 The purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable. 
 
 Amortization of above and below market leases decreased rental income by 404,000 in 2012 , 341,000 in 2011 and 478,000 in 2010 . Amortization expense for in-place lease intangibles was 3,628,000 , 2,316,000 and 3,205,000 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Projected amortization of in-place lease intangibles for the next five years as of December 31, 2012 is as follows:

The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820. Intangibles associated with the purchase of real estate were allocated as follows: 3,118,000 to in-place lease intangibles, 923,000 to above market leases and 31,000 to below market leases. During 2010 , the Company expensed acquisition-related costs of 72,000 in connection with these acquisitions. 
 
 The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of goodwill (at least annually) and the recoverability of other intangibles (on a quarterly basis) for possible impairment. In management s opinion, no impairment of goodwill and other intangibles existed at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . 
 
 (k) 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company has a management incentive plan which was approved by the stockholders and adopted in 2004. The Plan was further amended by the Board of Directors in September 2005 and December 2006. This plan authorizes the issuance of common stock to employees in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock units, performance shares, bonus stock or stock in lieu of cash compensation. Typically, the Company issues new shares to fulfill stock grants or upon the exercise of stock options. 
 
 EastGroup applies the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , to account for its stock-based compensation plans. Under the modified prospective application method, the Company continues to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for awards that precede January 1, 2006, when guidance was updated so that performance-based awards are determined using the graded vesting attribution method. The cost for performance-based awards after January 1, 2006, is determined using the graded vesting attribution method which recognizes each separate vesting portion of the award as a separate award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. This method accelerates the expensing of the award compared to the straight-line method. The cost for market-based awards after January 1, 2006, and awards that only require service are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. 
 
 The total compensation cost for service and performance based awards is based upon the fair market value of the shares on the grant date, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value for awards that are subject to a market condition are determined using a simulation pricing model developed to specifically accommodate the unique features of the awards. 
 
 During the restricted period for awards not subject to contingencies, the Company accrues dividends and holds the certificates for the shares; however, the employee can vote the shares. For shares subject to contingencies, dividends are accrued based upon the number of shares expected to vest. Share certificates and dividends are delivered to the employee as they vest.

(l) 
 Earnings Per Share 
 The Company applies ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , which requires companies to present basic earnings per share (EPS) and diluted EPS. Basic EPS represents the amount of earnings for the period attributable to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. The Company s basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 
 
 Diluted EPS represents the amount of earnings for the period attributable to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Company calculates diluted EPS by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock and stock options had the options been exercised. The dilutive effect of stock options and their equivalents (such as unvested restricted stock) was determined using the treasury stock method which assumes exercise of the options as of the beginning of the period or when issued, if later, and assumes proceeds from the exercise of options are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. 
 
 (m) 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses during the reporting period and to disclose material contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 (n) 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 The state of the overall economy can significantly impact the Company s operational performance and thus impact its financial position. Should EastGroup experience a significant decline in operational performance, it may affect the Company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, service debt, or meet other financial obligations. 
 
 (o) 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 EastGroup has evaluated all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) released by the FASB through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that the following ASUs apply to the Company. 
 
 In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , which provides guidance about how fair value should be applied where it is already required or permitted under U.S. GAAP. The ASU does not extend the use of fair value or require additional fair value measurements, but rather provides explanations about how to measure fair value. ASU 2011-04 requires prospective application and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012. 
 
 In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income , which eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity and requires that all nonowner changes in equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 requires retrospective application and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-05 and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012. 
 
 In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This ASU defers the effective date of the requirement in ASU 2011-05 to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income for all periods presented. A final ASU on presentation and disclosure of reclassification adjustments is expected in early 2013. 
 
 In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU, an entity is not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 was effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted the provisions and provided the necessary disclosures beginning with the interim period ended March 31, 2012.

 UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT 
 
 In November 2004, the Company acquired a 50 undivided tenant-in-common interest in Industry Distribution Center II, a 309,000 square foot warehouse distribution building in the City of Industry (Los Angeles), California. The building was constructed in 1998 and is 100 leased through December 2014 to a single tenant who owns the other 50 interest in the property. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and had a carrying value of 2,743,000 at December 31, 2012 , and 2,757,000 at December 31, 2011 . At the end of May 2005, EastGroup and the property co-owner closed a non-recourse first mortgage loan secured by Industry Distribution Center II. The 13.3 million loan has a 25 -year term and an interest rate of 5.31 through June 30, 2015 , when the rate will adjust on an annual basis according to the A Moody s Daily Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average. The lender has the option to call the note on June 30, 2015 . EastGroup s share of this mortgage was 5,475,000 at December 31, 2012 , and 5,660,000 at December 31, 2011 .

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The shares were able to be purchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Under the common stock repurchase plan, the Company purchased a total of 827,700 shares for 14,170,000 (an average of 17.12 per share). The Company has not repurchased any shares under this plan since 2000. 
 
 (11) 
 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
 
 The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , to account for its stock-based compensation plans. ASC 718 requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that the cost be measured on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. 
 
 Equity Incentive Plan 
 The Company has a management incentive plan which was approved by the stockholders and adopted in 2004. The Plan was further amended by the Board of Directors in September 2005 and December 2006. This plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,900,000 shares of common stock to employees in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock units, performance shares, bonus stock or stock in lieu of cash compensation. Total shares available for grant were 1,330,619 shares, 1,406,156 shares and 1,481,850 shares at December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively. Typically, the Company issues new shares to fulfill stock grants or upon the exercise of stock options. 
 
 Stock-based compensation cost was 4,087,000 , 2,486,000 and 1,801,000 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, of which 920,000 , 304,000 and 43,000 were capitalized as part of the Company s development costs for the respective years. 
 
 Equity Awards 
 The purpose of the restricted stock plan is to act as a retention device since it allows participants to benefit from dividends on shares as well as potential stock appreciation. The vesting periods of the Company s restricted stock plans vary; the vesting period begins on the date of grant and generally ranges from 2.5 years to 9 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock is granted to executive officers subject to both continued service and the satisfaction of certain annual performance goals and multi-year market conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock is granted to non-executive officers subject only to 
 58 

 EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

continued service. Under the modified prospective application method, the Company continues to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for awards that precede January 1, 2006. The cost for performance-based awards after January 1, 2006 is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method which recognizes each separate vesting portion of the award as a separate award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. This method accelerates the expensing of the award compared to the straight-line method. The cost for market-based awards after January 1, 2006 and awards that only require service is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. 
 
 The total compensation expense for service and performance based awards is based upon the fair market value of the shares on the grant date, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value for awards that have been granted and are subject to a future market condition (total shareholder return) is determined using a simulation pricing model developed to specifically accommodate the unique features of the awards. 
 
 In March 2012, the Compensation Committee evaluated the Company's performance compared to a variety of goals for the year ended December 31, 2011. Based on the evaluation, 44,789 shares were awarded to the Company s executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of 48.75 per share. These shares vested 20 on the dates shares were determined and awarded, 20 on December 19, 2012, and will vest 20 per year on January 1 in years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The shares will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. 
 
 Also in March 2012, the Committee evaluated the Company s absolute and relative total stockholder return for the five-year period ended December 31, 2011. Based on the evaluation, 47,418 shares were awarded to the Company s executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of 48.75 per share. These shares vested 25 on the dates shares were awarded, 25 on December 19, 2012, and will vest 25 per year on January 1 in years 2014 and 2015. The shares will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2012, the Company s Board of Directors approved an equity compensation plan for its executive officers based upon the attainment of certain annual performance goals. These goals are for the year ended December 31, 2012, so any shares issued upon attainment of these goals will be determined by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of 2013. The number of shares to be issued on the grant date could range from zero to 51,369 . These shares will vest 20 on the date shares are determined and awarded and generally will vest 20 per year on each January 1 for the subsequent four years. 
 
 Also in the second quarter of 2012, EastGroup s Board of Directors approved an equity compensation plan for the Company s executive officers based on EastGroup s absolute and relative total stockholder return compared to the NAREIT Equity Index, NAREIT Industrial Index and Russell 2000 Index for the five-year period ended December 31, 2012, so any shares issued pursuant to this equity compensation plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of 2013. The number of shares to be issued on the grant date could range from zero to 54,335 . These shares will vest 25 on the date shares are determined and awarded and generally will vest 25 per year on each January 1 in years 2014, 2015 and 2016. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares issued to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, David H. Hoster II, and Chief Financial Officer, N. Keith McKey, will become fully vested no later than January 1, 2015 and April 6, 2016, respectively. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2012, 19,525 shares were granted to certain non-executive officers subject only to continued service as of the vesting date. These shares, which have a grant date fair value of 48.96 per share, will vest 20 per year on January 1 in years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
 
 During the restricted period for awards no longer subject to contingencies, the Company accrues dividends and holds the certificates for the shares; however, the employee can vote the shares. For shares subject to contingencies, dividends are accrued based upon the number of shares expected to be awarded. Share certificates and dividends are delivered to the employee as they vest. As of December 31, 2012 , there was 7,293,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.58 years. 
 
 Following is a summary of the total restricted shares granted, forfeited and delivered (vested) to employees with the related weighted average grant date fair value share prices for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . Of the shares that vested in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , 36,195 shares, 3,564 shares and 19,668 shares, respectively, were withheld by the Company to satisfy the tax obligations for those employees who elected this option as permitted under the applicable equity plan. As shown in the table below, the fair value of shares that were granted during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was 5,451,000 , 3,576,000 and 5,002,000 , respectively. As of the vesting date, the fair value of shares that vested during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was 6,630,000 , 613,000 and 3,591,000 , respectively.

 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
 
 The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risk, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and, to a limited extent, the use of derivative instruments. 
 
 Specifically, the Company has entered into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative instruments, described below, are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to certain of the Company's borrowings. 
 
 The Company's objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage exposure to interest rate movements and add stability to interest expense. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
 61 

 EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company currently has one interest rate swap outstanding that is used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with its variable-rate debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings (included in Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income). 
 
 During 2010, EastGroup settled an interest rate swap with the repayment of its 8,770,000 mortgage loan on the Tower Automotive Center. The Company recognized income (included in Other Comprehensive Income(Loss) related to the derivative of 318,000 during 2010. 
 
 The Company entered into one 80,000,000 interest rate swap on July 20, 2012 but did not designate the swap for hedge accounting purposes until August 27, 2012. All of the changes in fair value of the swap from July 20, 2012 leading up to the designation date were marked to market through current earnings. On August 27, 2012, the Company designated the swap for hedge accounting in an off-market hedging relationship and has concluded that the hedging relationship will be highly effective by performing a regression assessment at inception. Ineffectiveness related to the off-market hedging relationship will be recorded directly into earnings as described above. During 2012 , the Company recognized total expenses resulting from the interest rate swap mark to market designation and interest rate swap ineffectiveness of 269,000 . 
 
 Amounts reported in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to Interest Expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that an additional 592,000 will be reclassified from Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) as an increase to Interest Expense over the next twelve months. 
 
 As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk:

See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulting from its interest rate swap. 
 
 Derivative financial agreements expose the Company to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements. The Company believes it minimizes the credit risk by transacting with major credit-worthy financial institutions. 
 
 The Company has an agreement with its derivative counterparty containing a provision stating that the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. 
 
 As of December 31, 2012 , the fair value of derivatives in a liability position related to these agreements was 645,000 . If the Company breached any of the contractual provisions of the derivative contract, it would be required to settle its obligation under the agreement at the swap termination value. As of December 31, 2012 , the swap termination value was a liability in the amount of 610,000 .

 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also provides guidance for using fair value to measure financial assets and liabilities. The Codification requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, including measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active (Level 2), and significant valuation assumptions that are not readily observable in the market (Level 3). 
 
 The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

 Carrying amounts shown in the table are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the indicated captions, except as indicated in the notes below. 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. 
 Mortgage loans receivable, net of discount (included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets): The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities (Level 2 input). 
 Mortgage notes payable: The fair value of the Company s mortgage notes payable is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers (Level 2 input). 
 Unsecured term loans payable: The fair value of the Company s unsecured term loans payable is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers (Level 2 input). 
 Notes payable to banks: The fair value of the Company s notes payable to banks is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates (Level 2 input). 
 Interest rate swap liability (included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets): The instrument is recorded at fair value based on models using inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, observable for substantially the full term of the contract (Level 2 input). See Note 13 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swap.
