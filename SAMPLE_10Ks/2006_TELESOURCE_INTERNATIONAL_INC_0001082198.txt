ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Telesource International
is an international company engaged primarily in the operation of energy
conversion power plants. The company previously operated as an international
engineering and construction company and is in the process of completing open
construction projects. The Company has changed its marketing strategy in the
construction market. The Company may
seek new projects on a limited basis in coordination with other companies in
possible joint venture partnerships. The
primary partner in these projects would most likely be with Sayed Hamid
Behbehani Sons Co. W.L.L. SHBC ), which owns in excess of 85 of the
Company s outstanding shares. 

Telesource International
corporate headquarters are located in Lombard, Illinois. Telesource
International conducts its operations through two subsidiaries: (i) Telesource
CNMI, which manages construction and management of the energy conversion
facilities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and operated a
branch office in Guam (closed during 2005); (ii) Telesource Fiji, Limited, which
manages the power generation activities in Fiji. Telesource s Palau operations
(closed in 2004) were carried out by Telesource International. 

Telesource has historically
operated in three main business segments: power generation and construction of
power plants, construction services and brokerage of goods and services. The
power generation management and the construction of power plant business
segments commenced in March 1999. 

Telesource International,
Inc. was formed in 1994 to facilitate various intra-corporate activities and,
until July 1999, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sayed Hamid Behbehani 
Sons Co. W.L.L. SHBC ), a Kuwait-based civil, electrical and mechanical
construction company. 

Construction Services 

As noted above,
Telesource is in the process of implementing a new strategy for the
construction market. This decision was
based upon the amount of losses incurred by the company in the construction
market. Telesource International s
Micronesian construction services were primarily carried out through Telesource
International s Mariana subsidiary, Telesource CNMI. 

Active Construction
Projects and Services 

In February 2002, through a competitive bidding process, Telesource was
awarded a contract to construct a 334-bed prison in accordance with the
requirements specified by the U.S. Department of Justice. This contract is
valued at 18.5 million and was 90.8 complete as of December 31, 2004. The
prison project has been completed as of December 2005. 

3 

In January 2003,
Telesource received a Notice of Award for a 5.9 million contract for
construction services on the second phase of the Palau National Capitol
Relocation Project. Funding for the project has come through a grant from the
Government of Taiwan. The project is for the supply and installation of
claddings and ornamental trims to the President s Building, the Executive
Building, the Legislative Building, and the Judiciary Building. The project
also includes the construction of a mechanical and electrical yard, a drainage
system with wastewater handling and a pumping station. The contract, with
change orders is valued at 6.5 million and was 87.5 complete at December 31,
2004. This project was substantially completed by August 2005 and the Company s
office in Palau was closed. 

In March 2003, Telesource
received a Notice of Award for a 5.7 million contract to expand an existing
radio relay broadcast station located in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana
Islands for an agency of the U.S. Government Department of State; the
Broadcasting Board of Governors International Broadcasting Bureau. The existing
station was constructed by Telesource and began operations in 2000. The
expansion of this radio relay station was for the addition of two short wave
antennas. This contract, with change orders had a total value of 5.9 million
was 96.6 complete at December 31, 2004. 
This project was completed during 2005. 

In May 2002, Telesource
received a contract to design and construct a 10-year landfill in the Republic
of Palau. In December 2002, the scope of this contract was modified to call for
the design and permitting of a 50-year landfill and construction of a road to
the landfill. The contract was valued at 1.1 million and was 99.4 complete at
December 31, 2004. During 2005, due to financial limitations of the client the
project was discontinued. After a
prolonged delay, the Company negotiated a release on the project during 2005
whereby, the Company agreed to close the project upon full payment by the
client of all amounts invoiced to date totaling 1,057,843. The balance due
from the client has been collected and the project is now closed. 

Completed Construction
Projects and Services 

In July 2002, Telesource
received a Notice of Award for a contract to construct the New Belau National
Museum project in the Republic of Palau. Funding for the project has come
through a grant from the Government of Taiwan. The project consists of the
renovation of the small original Museum building and the design and
construction of a museum building totaling approximately 15,500 square
feet. The project also includes the development of an outdoor
amphitheater and terraced seating into the natural grade of the project site.
The design phase of the project began in late July 2002 with physical
construction starting in March 2003. The contract is valued at 2.3 million and
was complete at December 31, 2004. 

In 2000, through a competitive bidding process,
Telesource International was awarded a contract to construct a 7,800 linear
foot airport runway on the Island of Tinian. This contract is valued at 19.1
million and was completed on March 11, 2004. The Commonwealth Port Authority (CPA) and
Telesource are currently in negotiations over the final billing for the West
Tinian Airport Project (WTA). The Company and the CPA reached an agreement in
August 2005 whereby the Company is to receive 50 of the retention within 90
days and the balance in the first quarter of 2006. As of December 31, 2004, Telesource has reflected
approximately 1.8 million of retentions in accounts receivable related to the
WTA. Of this amount, approximately .9
million has been collected.

Specialized Construction
Processes 

Building an airport or a
broadcasting facility is not like the construction of a more conventional
building. Because of the high levels of radio frequency emissions or the
generation of electrical currents, every part of the structure is integrated
into the overall design and plays a role in making the overall facility safer
and more efficient. 

The building of these
specialized structures requires additional engineering skills, the knowledge of
specialized construction techniques and relationships with specialized subcontractors.
The situation is made more difficult when building offshore, where distance
from raw materials and subcontractors becomes a risk factor. 

Past and Present Power
Generation Construction Projects 

Telesource International s
power generation business involves: 

Building the power plants 

Operating the power plants for a contracted period of time 

Selling wholesale power to the client to be distributed on their power grid 

The transfer of the ownership of the properties to the client at the end of the
contract. 

In 1997, a governmental
agency located in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, awarded
Telesource CNMI a contract to design, build and operate a 10-30 megawatt power
plant. 

The initial 10 megawatts
power plant was completed within budget and on time and the plant has been
operational since March 1999. The second phase of the project was completed in
March 2000, also within budget and on time. The third phase will be constructed
at Telesource CNMI s discretion as the demand for power increases. Accordingly,
if power demand fails to meet Telesource International s projections, this
phase may never be constructed. 

In March 2003, Telesource
was awarded a 20-year, multi-million dollar, energy conversion agreement with
the Fiji Electric Authority for the operation and maintenance of three diesel
power plants with generation capacity of 78 MW. The two power plants are
located in Kinoya, Vuda and Labasa, Fiji. Telesource and the Fiji Electric
Authority has completed and executed the Energy Conversion Agreement. 

In 2000, Telesource
International was contracted to expand two existing power stations in Fiji, and
to add additional power generators with a combined production capacity of 32
Mwh for a fixed price of approximately 12.1 million. This project was
completed in late 2001 at a cost of 11.1 million. Performance for this
contract was divided between Telesource International and Telesource Fiji,
Ltd., a subsidiary of Telesource International, based on the location and type
of service to be performed. The contract with the customer reflected this
arrangement. This contract 

5 

was a performance pay
contract (i.e., as specified milestones were reached, Telesource billed the
customer and receives payments within 30 days). 

Power Plant Operation and
Maintenance 

Our agreement with the
governmental agency in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is for
the management of one of their power plants. Under the terms of this agreement,
Telesource International designed, financed and built the power plant.
Telesource International obtained financing for the project through a
 25,000,000 line of credit from the Commercial Bank of Kuwait, New York branch. For the construction of the first phase of
this power plant, Telesource International is paid 180,000 per month for ten
years by the governmental agency. Each monthly payment is secured by a
promissory note in the amount of 180,000 issued by the Commonwealth Utilities
Corporation. 

Telesource International
has a 20-year lease on the land on which the power plant is built, plus title
to the entire plant and a two-month escrow account of no less than 360,000 on
which Telesource International has a first lien. In the event of the governmental
agency is unable to meet its obligations either to make payments of monthly
maintenance fees or on the promissory notes, Telesource International may sell,
lease, assign or transfer the power plant or any part of the plant equipment. 

In the first phase of the
project, the governmental agency also pays Telesource a production fee based
upon a fixed fee per kilowatt-hour for each kilowatt-hour produced on its
behalf for the first 5,140,000-kilowatt hours per month. In the second phase,
which added 10-megawatts of capacity, the governmental agency has agreed to pay
Telesource International an additional production fee per kilowatt-hour
produced over the initial 5,140,000-kilowatt hours per month. In addition, the
governmental agency pays Telesource a service fee of 50,000 per month for
operating and maintaining the power plant. 

In May 2001, the
governmental agency and Telesource executed Change Order No. 3 to the Tinian
Power Plant Contract. Change Order No. 3 provides a suspension in the Escalator
on the variable payments from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2005. This Change
Order extends the term of the contract from an expiration of 10 years following
commissioning of the last constructed phase (currently Phase II was
commissioned in March 2000 and therefore the contract was to have expired in
March 2010) to an new expiration date of March 31, 2020. Change Order No. 3
does not include an expansion of the power generation capacity of the power
plant. The power plant will continue to operate at its current maximum
generation capacity of 20 Mwh. Effectively, the contract has been extended for
an additional 10 years. Power rates agreed to under the original contract and
Change Order No. 1 remain unchanged. Change Order No. 3 does provide the
customer with an early termination option related to the extended agreement
beginning on March 31, 2010 and available annually thereafter; however, the
customer is required to give a six-month notice and to pay an early termination
fee of 6,000,000. Change Order No. 3 prohibits the customer from purchasing
power from any source other than Telesource for the first 30 MW. The expanded
agreement executed under Change Order No. 3 only extends the power generation
contract term and does not require additional performance by Telesource, with
respect to building additional power generation capacity. Change Order No. 3 does require Telesource to
upgrade the power distribution system in certain 

6 

areas of the Tinian
Island. The Company is responsible for
the costs of the upgrade which include labor and material. The Company estimates the cost of this
upgrade to be approximately in the range of 800,000 to 1.3 million and to be
completed in 2006. 

Potential Future Power
Plant Construction and Power Supply 

Based on previous
experience, management believes there will be a growing demand for power around
the world; however competition and deregulation could eliminate the financial
feasibility of these projects and thereby prevent Telesource International from
taking advantage of the expected growth in demand. In the U.S., two-thirds of the country s
installed plants are 25 or more years old and need to be replaced and
re-powered, principally with new gas combustion turbines. The world s use of
electricity is projected to increase by two-thirds over the forecast horizon,
from 13 trillion kilowatt hours in 1999 to 22 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2020.
The strongest growth rates in electricity consumption are projected for the
developing world. The most rapid expansion in electricity use is expected for
developing Asia and Central and South America, with average annual growth rates
exceeding 3.5 percent between 1999 and 2020. In the industrialized world,
electricity consumption is expected to grow at a more modest pace. Slower
population and economic growth, along with the market saturation of certain
electronic appliances (such as washers and dryers) and efficiency gains from
electrical appliances help to explain the expected slower growth of electricity
use in the industrialized nations, although growing computer usage and the
introduction of new electronic devices could modulate that trend in the future.
Telesource International also believes that those situations where the local
governments lack the up-front funding to build the additional power plants will
represent an opportunity for Telesource International to find alternative
solutions up to and including having Telesource International locate the needed
project financing. Without the additional energy, Telesource International
believes that many of the infrastructure upgrades envisioned by local
governments will be unable to occur. In Telesource International s experience,
in return for securing project financing in a manner similar to that obtained
for the project in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, local
governments will be willing to enter into contracts which guarantee Telesource
International a minimum amount of power consumption, coupled with long-term
operation and maintenance contracts. 

Telesource International
anticipates that these contracts will generally be secured by governmental
guarantees, promissory notes, liens and collateral on the land and in the
physical power plants. 

Sales and Marketing
Strategies 

The company has
determined that it will be very selective and enter into new construction
projects in a joint venture with SHBC. 
Meanwhile, a significant focus of its marketing efforts will be in the
power generation business. Telesource
International s power generation projects are obtained through a public bid
process, and clients are either governments or governmental agencies. In
obtaining contracts: 

7 

Telesource International reviews market trends in the geographic locations it
presently operates, specifically Fiji and Saipan. Telesource International s research also
includes analyzing numerous government documents and reviewing previous and
current requests for management of power generation facility bids. 

Telesource International is actively involved in public relations with the
governments and agencies that might contract for Telesource International s
services. Much of this effort is informational, learning the specific needs of
each governmental agency while at the same time explaining what services
Telesource International has to offer. 

Telesource International has created and provides to potential clients a survey
to help governmental agencies evaluate whether Telesource International s
resources and services might be more efficient and cost-effective than their
current system. 

Competition 

The independent power
industry has grown rapidly over the past twenty years. There are a large number
of suppliers in the wholesale market and a surplus of capacity, which has led
to intense competition in this market. The principal sources of competition in
this market include traditional regulated utilities that have excess capacity,
unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, energy brokers and traders,
energy service companies in the development and operation of energy-producing
projects and the marketing of electric energy, equipment suppliers and other
non-utility generators like Telesource International. Competition in this
industry is substantially based on price with competitors discovering lower
cost alternatives for providing electricity. 
The electric industry is also characterized by rapid changes in
regulations, which Telesource International expects could continue to increase
competition. Telesource International
does not believe the Tinian power plant would be significantly impacted by
competition in the wholesale energy market since its revenues are subject to
contracted rates which are substantially fixed for several years. 

Telesource International
also competes in the market to develop power generation facilities. The primary
bases of competition in this market are the quality of development plans, the
ability of the developer to finance and complete the project and the price. In some cases, competitive bidding for a
development opportunity is required. 
Competition for attractive development opportunities is expected to be
intense as there are a number of competitors in the industry interested in the
limited number of opportunities. Many of
the companies competing in this market have substantially greater resources.
Telesource International believes its project development experience and its
experience in creating strategic alignments with other development firms with
greater financial and technical resources could enable Telesource to continue
to compete effectively in the development market if and when opportunities
arise. Presently, Telesource International believes there are a number of
opportunities for project development worldwide for projects similar to those
previously developed by Telesource. 
However, Telesource International is currently evaluating whether it
should seek development opportunities in other areas outside of the South
Pacific to diversify its activities. 

Presently, there is
significant merger and consolidation activity occurring in the electric
industry. From time to time, Telesource
International may consider merger and acquisition proposals 

8 

when they appear to
present an opportunity to enhance stockholder value. Telesource International
is not involved in any of these discussions or negotiations at this time and
there can be no assurance that any opportunities will develop. 

Energy Regulation 

Telesource International s
projects are subject to regulation under federal and local energy laws and
regulations. Telesource International is
subject to the requirements established by its permitting authorities, i.e. the
Department of Environmental Quality DEQ and the Environmental Protection
Agency EPA ). 

Presently, neither the
Customer Choice Act nor proposed legislation dealing with U.S. energy policy
directly impacts Telesource International because the legislation and
restructuring plan pertain to the retail market or new contracts in the
wholesale market. However, as discussed
above, Telesource International could be impacted in the future by, among other
things, increases in competition as a result of deregulation. Telesource International is actively
monitoring these developments in energy proceedings in order to evaluate the
impact on existing projects and also to evaluate new business opportunities
created by the restructuring of the electric industry. 

Environmental Regulation 

Telesource International s
projects are subject to regulation under federal, foreign and local
environmental laws and regulations and must also comply with the applicable
laws pertaining to the protection of the environment, primarily in the areas of
water and air pollution. These laws and
regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining
and maintaining licenses, permits and approvals from federal and local
agencies. As regulations are enacted or
adopted in any of these jurisdictions, Telesource International cannot predict
the effect of compliance therewith on its business. Telesource International s failure to comply
with all applicable requirements could result in delays in proceeding with any
projects under development or require modifications to operating
facilities. During periods of
non-compliance, Telesource International s operating facilities may be forced
to shutdown until the instances of non-compliance are corrected. Telesource International is responsible for
ensuring compliance of its facilities with applicable requirements and,
accordingly, attempts to minimize these risks by dealing with reputable
contractors and using appropriate technology to measure compliance with the
applicable standards. 

Insurance and Bonding 

Telesource International
maintains general and excess liability, construction equipment, and workers 
compensation insurance; all in amounts consistent with industry practices.
Telesource International believes its insurance programs are adequate subject
to deductibles some of which are approximately 3.0 million. 

Telesource International
was required to provide bonding for the airport runway project on the island of
Tinian. This project has partial funding from the U.S. Government (the Federal
Aviation Administration FAA and consequently, U.S. Treasury Listed Bonding
was required. During 2002, Telesource was required to provide bonding for the
prison project on the island of 

9 

Saipan. This project has
partial funding from the U.S. Government and therefore, U.S. Treasury Listed
Bonding was required. In order to secure the required bonding, Telesource s
largest shareholder, SHBC, provided a letter of credit to the surety equal to
100 of the contract value of 17 million. Telesource International s ability
to obtain additional surety bonding depends upon its capitalization, working
capital, past performance, management expertise and other factors, which may
change from time to time. During 2005, the Company was released from the
bonding requirement and consequently, SHBC was also released from the letter of
credit requirements. 

Employees 

Telesource International,
as of January 2005, employed 137 people, consisting of 11 employees in
management, 8 engineers and technical staff members, 25 support staff members
and 104 hourly employees. All of Telesource International s employees are
nonunion workers, although Telesource International may employ union
subcontractors from time to time. 

Ninety percent of
Telesource International s project teams include engineers and technical staff,
due to the technical nature of its construction contracts. Working on a power
plant, broadcasting facility or other technical construction site requires a
higher level of expertise and a greater attention to safety issues. 

Telesource International s
non-engineering level employees are hourly workers, while its engineering and
supervisory staffs are on monthly salaries.

10 

Investment
Considerations 

Telesource International has risk
related to its ability to continue as a going concern. 

As of December 31, 2004, the Company s current
liabilities exceeded its current assets by 4.6 million and its total
liabilities exceed total assets by 15.7 million. The Company relies heavily on
bank financing and equity infusion from its principle stockholder, SHBC and
affiliated companies, to support its operations. The equity infusion from SHBC and affiliated
companies, and its ability to refinance its existing bank debt is critical to
provide funding to satisfy the Company s obligations as they mature. As of
December 31, 2004 the Company had total outstanding debt of 25,405,964 of
which 5,332,340 is due in 2005. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had
an accumulated deficit of 54.1 million and total stockholders deficit of 15.7
million. 

The Company incurred operating losses of 12,406,488,
 5,217,223, and 3,118,300 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively. The Company incurred net losses of 13,711,315, 6,629,441,
 4,886,397 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 

The Company has experienced several years of net
working capital deficiencies, increasing stockholders deficit, recurring
losses, and negative cash flows from operations. Management intends to work to
address these uncertainties by continuing its efforts to raise additional
capital, increase revenues, and control costs with the goal of achieving
profitability. Subsequent to the year-end, the Company completed private
placements of the Company s common stock with net proceeds of 6.4 million in
additional capital. Management expects the increase in revenues to be achieved
by focusing its efforts in the power plant operation and maintenance agreements
and/or from existing long-term power plant operation and maintenance agreements
as a result of continued expansion on the island of Tinian and in the country
of Fiji. However, no assurance can be given that such increased revenues will
be achieved. Although management believes that the Company will be cash flow
positive in 2005 including debt payments, the Company has and expects to
continue to seek support from its principal stockholder, SHBC and affiliated
companies, for its operations, and for working capital needs, debt repayment,
and business expansion as may be required. SHBC has continued its support of
the Company. SHBC has agreed to guarantee or provide letters of credit covering
 22,622,333 of the Company s total debt of 25,405,964. 

The Company s ability to continue operations is dependent
upon raising capital through debt and equity financing. There can be no assurance that the Company
will successfully raise the required future financing on terms desirable to the
Company. If the Company does not obtain
the needed funds, it will likely be required to delay development of its
operations, alter its business plan, or in the extreme situation, cease
operations. 

Telesource
International - Risks related to power generation activities 

Telesource
International s power-generating facility could be shut down unexpectedly,
making it difficult to sustain revenues and cash flow. 

Telesource
International owns a diesel fired electric generating facility with a maximum
power generation capacity of 20 mega-watts (Mw) located on the island of Tinian,
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. possession. This
facility from time to time may experience both scheduled and unscheduled
shutdowns. Periodically, the facility will incur scheduled shutdowns in order
to perform maintenance procedures to equipment that cannot 

11 

be
performed while the equipment is operating. The facility may also incur
unscheduled shutdowns or may be required to operate at reduced capacity levels
following the detection of equipment malfunctions, or following minimum
generation orders received by the utility. 
During periods when the facility is shutdown or operating at reduced
capacity levels, Telesource International may incur losses due to the loss of
its operating revenues and/or due to additional costs which may be required to
complete any maintenance procedures. It is not possible for it to predict the
frequency of future unscheduled shutdowns or to predict the extent of
maintenance that may be required during shutdowns related to equipment
maintenance. 

Telesource
International depends on two customers for power-generation revenues. The loss
of either single customer could cause Telesource International s revenues to
decline. 

Since March 1999,
Telesource International began deriving a portion of its revenues from the sale
of electric power. Under Telesource International s agreement with a
governmental agency, the electrical power generated at Telesource International s
power generation facility is owned by the governmental agency. Telesource International is paid a fee to
produce the electric power. The
governmental agency in turn sells the electric power to the various users throughout
the Island of Tinian. If the end-user
customer defaults or increases in power use do not materialize as anticipated,
Telesource International s revenue base may not grow to support other
operations. 

During 2003, Telesource
added the operation of two additional power plants for a period of 20 years
within Fiji for one customer, the Fiji Electric Authority. Telesource is to
operate the two power plants in Fiji by converting fuel provided by the
customer into electricity for which Telesource receives a fee. The Fiji
Electric Authority in turn sells the power produced to various users in Fiji.
If the end-user customer defaults or increases in power use do not materialize
as anticipated, Telesource International s revenue base may not grow to support
other operations. 

Telesource
International s insurance or reserves may be insufficient to cover future
claims on Telesource International s power generation activities. 

Telesource
International s power generation activities involve significant risks of
environmental damage, equipment damage and failures, personal injury and fines and
costs imposed by regulatory agencies. Though management believes its insurance
programs are adequate, if a liability claim is made against it, or if there is
an extended outage or equipment failure or damage at Telesource International s
power plant for which it is inadequately insured or subject to a coverage
exclusion, and Telesource International is unable to defend against these
claims successfully or obtain indemnification or warranty recoveries,
Telesource International may be required to pay substantial amounts, which
could have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition. 

Telesource
International - Risks related to construction activities 

12 

Telesource
International will likely experience significant fluctuation in quarterly
results, which makes it difficult for investors to make reliable
period-to-period comparisons of its business. 

Telesource International s
quarterly operating results will depend on revenues from contracts for major
projects. Telesource International can only undertake a specific number of
projects at any one time. Furthermore, Telesource International has implemented
a plan to seek new construction projects on a limited basis in coordination
with other companies in possible joint venture partnerships. The primary partner in these projects would
most likely be with Sayed Hamid Behbehani Sons Co. W.L.L. SHBC ), which
owns in excess of 85 of the Company s outstanding shares. Consequently revenues and results of operations
within the quarter and possibly subsequent periods will be unfavorable during
this transition. Customers may also cancel or defer existing contracts resulting
in reduced revenues for a quarter. Though management intends to take steps to
adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue
shortfalls, it may not be successful. For example staffing reductions cannot be
implemented quickly due to local labor and employment laws in the Commonwealth
of Northern Mariana Islands, which limit our ability to release employees at
will, and losses could result. Accordingly, any such revenue shortfalls could
result in continued operating losses. 

Telesource International s revenues are derived mainly from fixed-price contracts that may lead to variations in profits due to a failure to control costs. 

All of Telesource International s construction revenues are derived from fixed-price contracts. Because Telesource International assumes the risk of performing such contracts at the stipulated price, any change in the estimate of ultimate costs to be incurred under the contract or to control costs during contract performance could result in losses or reduced profits for particular fixed-price contracts, which, in turn, could result in periods of operating losses. 

Telesource
International s principal market is highly competitive, and if Telesource
International is unable to compete successfully in this market, it may be
unable to increase its operations or become profitable. 

The
market for energy related services is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Telesource International competes directly with other firms that focus on
providing general operation, maintenance and related construction services for power
plants. Many of Telesource International s competitors have well-established
reputations for building and operating plants with longer operating histories
and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other
resources than Telesource International. Telesource International is subject to
competition that is expected to increase in the future. If Telesource
International does not successfully compete in its market, its growth
opportunities will be limited and its business will not grow and its revenues
may be reduced. 

Telesource
International relies on third parties for important raw materials and technical
expertise. Telesource International s ability to enter into new engagements or
to conduct the business in a profitable manner will be harmed if its access to
these important resources is limited or becomes too costly. 

Telesource
International relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials like wood,
steel and concrete; for fabrication of technical equipment subsystems including
diesel generation and technical expertise. Telesource International s ability
to obtain cost-effective raw materials, 

13 

fabrication
services and technical assistance is subject to a number of external factors
which are outside of its control, including: 

Third
parties may increase the price of the raw materials, fabrication services or
technical assistance they provide. 

Third-party
raw material suppliers, fabricators or technical expertise providers may decide
not to provide Telesource International with materials or services. 

Telesource
International has no long-term contracts with third-party suppliers of raw
materials, fabrication services or technical expertise providers. 

Telesource
International s third-party contracts are usually short term in duration and
are cancelable by such third party. 

If
Telesource International fails to obtain what it needs from these providers, it
may not be able to successfully compete for new business or to complete
existing engagements profitably. 

Telesource
International is subject to substantial claims for warranty coverage which, if
such claims arise, could harm its financial condition. 

Telesource
International offers warranties on its construction services and power
generating plants. Telesource International does not maintain any material
warranty reserves because these warranties are usually backed by warranties
from its vendors. Should Telesource International be required to cover the cost
of repairs not covered by the warranties of Telesource International s vendors
or should one of Telesource International s major vendors be unable to cover
future warranty claims, Telesource International could be required to outlay
substantial funds, which could harm its financial condition. 

Telesource
International - Other risks 

Telesource
International is subject to several inherent risks of conducting business
internationally. 

Telesource
International s international operations are subject to the inherent risks of
doing business abroad. The loss of any or all of Telesource International s
international suppliers and customers could harm Telesource International s
ability to deliver Telesource International s construction services and power
services on time and cause Telesource International s sales to decline.
Telesource International s financial performance could be harmed by many events
and circumstances relating to international operations, including: 

Shipping
delays and cancellations; 

 Increases
in import duties and tariffs; 

 Foreign
exchange rate fluctuations; 

 Changes
in foreign laws and regulations; and 

 Political
and economic instability. 

14 

Telesource
International is subject to government regulation. Both the costs of compliance
and the penalties imposed for a failure to comply could be substantial. 

Although
management does not believe that compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements has harmed Telesource International s operations in the past
relative to its competitors, government regulations can change, which could
increase Telesource International s costs of compliance with these
requirements. In addition, Telesource International s power generation
operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies.
Telesource International believes that tighter regulations for the protection
of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to
obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more
restrictive conditions than currently exist. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations could result in fines, additional licensing requirements or the
revocation of Telesource International s licenses in the particular
jurisdiction. The costs of compliance could affect adversely operating results.
If a substantial fine or other penalty is imposed, Telesource International s
business and financial condition could be harmed. 

If
Telesource International does not manage its growth effectively, its future
business prospects could be harmed. 

Telesource
International will need to expand in anticipation of a growing user base and
larger demand for Telesource International s services. The focus on development
of new business could cause disruptions of existing operations adversely affecting
Telesource International s business. Expansion will require Telesource
International to make significant up front expenditures for increasing
Telesource International s sales and marketing efforts and to hire and train
additional project managers, engineers and facilities operators as well as
incur costs in connection with constructing power plants to be owned by
Telesource. Telesource may not be successful in expanding its operations or
maintaining adequate management, financial and operating systems and controls
of its larger business base. 

Telesource
International s largest stockholder and its affiliates own approximately 85 of
the common stock and their interests may not be the same as the minority
stockholders who will have little or no influence over Telesource International s
activities. 

The
largest stockholder, SHBC, is able to control the outcome of all matters
submitted to a vote of the holders of common stock, including the election of
directors, amendments to Telesource s certificate of incorporation and approval
of significant corporate transactions. SHBC owns beneficially approximately 85 
of the common stock. 

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

Properties 

Telesource International
maintains leased office space and leases land for storage of construction
equipment. Telesource International s Mariana subsidiary s head office in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is leased for a term which
extended through December 2004 and is 

15 

currently on a
month-to-month renewal. In the corporate
offices in Illinois, Telesource has an office space leased through April, 2007.
The Company s office in the Republic of Palau was closed in August 2005.
Management believes its existing arrangements for its office facilities are
adequate. 

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of its business Telesource becomes involved from
time to time in legal proceedings and claims asserted by and against
Telesource. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of
these routine pending matters will not have a materially adverse impact on the
Company. 

The Commonwealth Port Authority CPA and Telesource are currently in
negotiations over the final billing for the West Tinian Airport Project WTA ).
As of December 31, 2004, Telesource has reflected approximately 1.8 million of
retentions in accounts receivable related to the WTA. Approximately 891,000 of the outstanding
retention receivable was collected in 2005 as partial settlement agreement was
entered into in August 2005. Telesource claims that in addition to the
remaining unpaid retentions receivable recorded under the original contract
terms and related to work performed through 2003 that it is also due additional
amounts for work performed outside of the original scope of the contract. No
revenue for this additional work has been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Although CPA has acknowledged that work was
performed outside of the original contract scope, it has requested additional
documentation before it will make a final determination regarding payment on
the additional work and the retentions. CPA claims they are due approximately
 468,000 in liquidated damages related to delay of completion. Telesource is
disputing those claims and believes that the resolution of this matter will not
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The Company has a continuing warranty
obligation for three years from the date of final acceptance, not yet determined.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company agreed
to convert all of the preferred stock into common stock on a one-for-one basis
plus accumulated dividends as of December 31, 2004 and the present value of
future preferred dividends at a conversion price of 1.00 per share. 

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to
receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors. Telesource is
precluded from declaring or paying dividends on common stock unless all
required dividends have been paid in full on Series A Preferred Stock. 

The Company had 9.8 million shares of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (The Preferred Shares) outstanding prior
to the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock into common stock at
December 31, 2004. Holders of the
Preferred Shares were entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the
annual rate of 6.5 or 6.0 per share payable semi-annually, when and if
declared by the Board of Directors. 

The Preferred Shares were convertible, in whole or in
part, at the option of the holders thereof, into shares of common stock on a
one-for-one basis for a period of five years from the closing date of the
Preferred Shares agreement. The Company
had the option to force conversion to common stock for a period of time as
defined by each agreement. All
accumulated dividends plus any dividends earned up through the forced conversion
date would have been payable to the holder at the time of forced conversion. 

Holders of the Preferred Shares had no voting rights
and the Preferred Shares rank senior as to dividends and upon liquidation to
the common stock. 

At December 31, 2004, and December 31, 2003, the
Company owed accrued dividends of 0 and 204,358, respectively. An unpaid
preferred divided in the amount of 477,500 plus the present value of future
preferred dividends in the amount of 2,596,229 were converted into common stock
on December 31, 2004 at a conversion price of 1.00 per share. During 2004,
Telesource had declared and paid 477,750 of dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock. No dividends were paid on Telesource s common stock during
2004 or 2003, and Telesource does not anticipate that it will pay dividends on
its common stock in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

HIGHLIGHTS 

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
 20.7 million, compared to 20.0 million and 20.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net loss to common stockholders was
 17.5 million for 2004, an increase of 10.3 million, or 142.4 from the loss
of 7.2 million for 2003. Basic and
diluted net loss to common stockholders per share was 0.83 per share for 2004,
compared to 0.48 per share for 2003 and 0.33 per share for 2002. 

Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2004,
the Company s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 4.6 million
and its total liabilities exceed total assets by 15,740,798. The Company relies heavily on equity sales
and bank financing to support its operations. 
The Company s ability to refinance its existing bank debt is critical to
provide funding to satisfy the Company s obligations as they mature. As of
December 31, 2004 the Company had total outstanding debt of 25.4 million of
which 5.3 million is due in 2005. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had an
accumulated deficit of 54.1 million and total stockholders deficit of 15.7
million. 

The Company incurred
operating losses of 12,406,488, 5,217,223 and 3,118,300 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company incurred net losses
to common stockholders of 17,451,244, 7,198,916 and 4,886,397 for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

Cash used in operating
activities was 7,358,063, 6,283,959, and 2,031,793 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Funds provided by net
borrowings and stock sales amounted to 7,683,542, 8,187,300, and 2,200,000
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

During 2004 management
worked to address the operating and working capital deficits by continuing its
efforts to eliminate unprofitable business segments, specifically construction.
As reported in Item 5, herein, management has raised 6.4 million in 2005
through the issuance of common stock. In
addition, the Company was previously able to raise 6.3 million and 2.0
million through the sale of common stock during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
each case such sales were made in private, unregistered sales of the Company s
securities. The additional equity raised
during 2005 was used to pay down debt and fund continuing operations. Much of
the debt obligations coming due during 2005 are project financing based and the
Company repaid a portion of these obligations with cash generated through the
collection of project receivables and billings. 
These collections on the projects along with the expected additional
equity are believed by management to be sufficient to cover Telesource s 2005
obligations. The Company has and expects
to continue to seek support from its principal stockholder, SHBC, for its
operations, for working capital needs, debt repayment, and business expansion
as may be required. SHBC has continued its support of the Company. SHBC has
agreed to guarantee or provide letters of credit covering 22,622,333 of the
Company s total debt of 25,405,963.

OPERATING SEGMENTS 

Telesource s business consists of the following
operating segments: power generation and construction of power plants, trading,
and construction services. Revenue of the power generation and construction of
power plants segment includes sales-type lease revenues. The power generation
activities occurred in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.
territory, CNMI and construction of power plants occurred in Fiji.
Construction services occurred in the CNMI and the Republic of Palau while
trading activities occurred in the United States and the CNMI. Telesource is
committed to completing the construction projects currently under contract;
however, Telesource as noted earlier, is changing its construction strategy.
Telesource is concentrating its efforts on expanding its power generation
services in the Pacific region. 

OVERVIEW 

During 2004, our cost of
construction projects as a percentage of construction revenues increased to 119.4 
from 110.4 in 2003. The increase in
costs as a percentage of construction revenues was due to project delays and
additional unforeseen costs incurred on the projects. As noted earlier, we are altering
our strategy in the construction segment of our business due to these losses. 

The following information is based on, and should be
read with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated gross profit decreased
to a gross loss of 5,361,314) in 2004 from a gross profit of 869,332 in
2003. Our consolidated net loss increased to 13.7) million in 2004 from 6.6)
million in 2003, primarily due to the lower margin recognized on our
construction segment. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

REVENUES 

Overview 

Telesource
International is an international engineering and construction company, which
has among its operations power generation and specialty construction services
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Republic of Palau.
Telesource International operates a diesel fired electric power generation
plant for the sale of electricity to the local power grid in CNMI. Telesource
signed an agreement to take over the operation and maintenance of three diesel
fired electric power generation plants in Fiji beginning in 2003 for a period
of 20 years. Telesource International s facility in Lombard, Illinois handles
the procurement, export and shipping of U.S. fabricated products for use by
Telesource International s subsidiaries or for resale to customers outside of
the mainland. 

Telesource International
was formed in 1994 to facilitate various intra-corporate activities and, until July 1999, was a wholly owned subsidiary of
SHBC, a Kuwait-based civil, electrical and mechanical construction company. Operations
are conducted primarily through subsidiaries. Telesource International
currently has two subsidiaries. 
Telesource CNMI, Inc. handles construction and management for the power
facilities in the Commonwealth of the Northern 

24 

Mariana Islands.
Telesource CNMI, Inc. had branch offices in Guam, Telesource Pacifica and
Pacifica Power Resources. Telesource Fiji, Ltd. was established to oversee
Telesource International, Inc. s power plant construction activities within
Fiji, which currently involves the installation of additional power generators
for existing power plants in Fiji. Construction activities in the Republic of
Palau were managed through Telesource International. 

Telesource International has three main operating segments: power
generation and construction of power plants, construction services and trading
activities. 

Revenue from construction and construction of power plants is
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting based upon
costs incurred and projected costs. Construction revenue includes revenues
recognized by Telesource International, Inc. s power plant construction segment
and from other projects ranging from housing development to the construction of
airports and prisons. The construction of power generation plants is considered
by management to be a part of Telesource International, Inc. s power generation
and construction of power plants segment. Cost of revenue consists of direct
costs on contracts, including labor and materials, amounts payable to
subcontractors, direct overhead costs, equipment expense (primarily
depreciation, maintenance and repairs), and interest associated with
construction projects and insurance costs. Depreciation is provided using
straight-line methods for construction equipment. Contracts frequently extend
over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates
during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts
that require the revision become known. Losses on contracts, if any, are provided
when determined, regardless of the degree of project completion. Claims for
additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable
that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably
estimated. The foregoing as well as the stage of completion and mix of
contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between
periods. 

Construction revenues on power plants are recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based upon costs incurred and
projected costs. This revenue is separated on the face of the consolidated
financial statements due to its origin within Telesource International s power
generation and construction of power plants segment. Cost of revenue consists
of direct costs on contracts, including labor and materials, amounts payable to
subcontractors, direct overhead costs, equipment expense (primarily depreciation,
maintenance and repairs), and interest associated with construction projects
and insurance costs. Depreciation is provided using straight-line methods for
construction equipment. Contracts frequently extend over a period of more than
one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are
reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision
become known. Losses on contracts, if any, are provided in total when
determined, regardless of the degree of project completion. Claims for
additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable
that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably
estimated. The foregoing as well as the stage of completion and mix of contracts
at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods. 

Telesource accounts for its leasing activities in accordance with the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Revenue associated with the sale of
the Tinian power plant constructed and sold under a sales-type lease, measured
as the present value of non-cancelable rents, was recognized in connection with
recording the loss on sale in 1997 and 1998. Telesource recognizes finance
lease revenue on the resulting sales-type lease 

25 

receivable at a constant rate using the interest method. Service
revenues received from operating and maintaining the Tinian power plant for the
duration of the lease are recognized as earned based on actual kilowatt hours
of electricity produced and delivered to the lessee s customers. To the extent
that variable payments based on kilowatt-hours of production exceed the fair
value of operation and maintenance services provided, Telesource recognizes
such contingent payments as additional finance lease revenue as they are
earned. 

Sales revenues are derived from brokering of U.S.
fabricated goods and management of various projects outside of Telesource International s
construction and power generation segments. Sales of goods exported are
recognized at the time of shipment. When an order is received, the customer s
product specifications are sent to the manufacturer and upon completion the
goods are shipped from the manufacturer directly to the customer. In most
cases, the risk of loss during shipping is either borne by the manufacturer or
the customer. Telesource International is responsible for payment to the
manufacturer; however, Telesource normally collects payment from the customer
before the manufacturer is paid. The sales revenues are recognized net of cost
of goods sold. In 1999, Telesource entered into an agreement with its primary
customer, SHBC, to charge a flat fee of 7.5 of the invoice amount for all
orders executed by Telesource on behalf of SHBC. 

Service revenues are recognized in the period in which
the work is performed. Service revenues consist of amounts billed to SHBC for
project management of the radio relay station and for other types of services
provided to local customers for small projects. Rental income consists of fees
collected on rental of equipment to SHBC for use in construction of the radio
relay station as well as to local customers. 
The rental fees are billed on a monthly basis for equipment used during
the billing period. Telesource recognizes rental revenue on the accrual basis
pursuant to contractual arrangements between Telesource and its customers. 

Finance lease revenues are recognized on the amortization of the minimum
lease payments for the power plant located on the Island of Tinian that were
discounted upon execution of the contract in June of 1997 at an interest rate
of 6.74 . The amortization of the minimum lease payments began in March 1999 at
an effective interest rate of 9.40 and will fully amortize in March 2010. 

Construction costs are comprised of both variable and semi-variable
expenses, including labor and materials, amounts payable to subcontractors,
direct overhead costs, equipment expense (primarily depreciation, maintenance
and repairs), interest associated with construction projects and insurance
costs. Depreciation is provided using straight-line methods for construction
equipment. 

Construction costs on power plants are comprised of both variable and
semi-variable expenses, including labor and materials, amounts payable to
subcontractors, direct overhead costs, equipment expense (primarily
depreciation, maintenance and repairs), interest associated with construction
projects and insurance costs. Depreciation is provided using straight-line
methods for construction equipment. These costs are disclosed separately from
construction costs due to their origin within the power generation segment. 

Operations and maintenance costs power generation plant consist of
labor, direct overhead costs, equipment expense (primarily maintenance and
repairs), and insurance costs. These costs are recognized as incurred. 

26 

Salaries and employee benefits consist of all wages
and benefits for management and staff wages and benefits that are not directly
associated with a particular project, that is, idle costs for employees are
charged to general and administrative expense. Telesource s principal market,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, allows employers to import
guest employees. The local labor laws require employers importing guest
employees, principally from the Philippines, to execute a one-year employment
contract with the guest employee. Since Telesource has a few large contracts,
this can lead to short periods of inactivity for some employees. As Telesource
continues to grow, this issue is expected to be minimized; however, it may have
a significant impact on Telesource s operating results. 

Occupancy and equipment expense consist of rent, utilities and office
equipment for Telesource International s offices in Illinois, CNMI, Guam and
Fiji. 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation,
telephone expense, insurance, travel, financial and legal expenses and a gross
revenue tax incurred on Telesource International s operations in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 

Telesource International, Inc., Telesource CNMI, Inc. and Telesource
Fiji, Ltd. file separate corporate income tax returns. Telesource
International, Inc. is a U.S. corporation that files U.S. corporate tax
returns. Telesource CNMI, Inc. is a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island
corporation and files a corporation tax return for this commonwealth. Telesource
Fiji, Ltd. is a Fijian corporation and files a Fijian corporation tax return. 

Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective income tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

TINIAN POWER PLANT 

Phase I 

In June 1997, Telesource
International entered into a contract to construct and operate a power plant on
the island of Tinian. The June 1997 agreement (hereafter referred to as Phase
I) called for Telesource International to construct a 10Mwh power generation
plant with the capacity to add an additional 20Mwh of power at later dates, and
to operate the power plant for a period of 10 years from the date of
commissioning. Phase I was commissioned in March 1999. The terms for Phase I
call for fixed payments of 180,000 per month plus a production fee charged per
Kwh produced for the first 5,140,000 Kwh produced each month (hereafter
referred to as the Base Load). The agreement also provides that Telesource
International will receive a monthly service fee of 50,000 for a period of 10
years from the date of commissioning. Following the conclusion of that 10-year
period, the only payments Telesource International will receive for the Base
Load only the production fee charged on the amount of Kwh produced, as adjusted
for inflation per the agreement. 

27 

Phase II 

In November 1998,
Telesource International received a change order instructing Telesource to add
an additional 10Mwh of power generation capacity (hereafter referred to as
Phase II). This change order provided for Telesource International to receive
only variable payments in the form of a production fee produced in excess of
the Base Load (hereafter referred to as the Expansion Rate) and for these
payments to occur over a ten-year period commencing upon the commissioning of
Phase II. After the completion of the ten-year period, the production fee
changes will decrease for all power produced. Phase II was commissioned in
March 2000 and increased the power plant s total generation capacity to its
maximum current level of 20Mwh. The
plant only operates at the 10 Mwh level and will continue until demand
increases to higher levels. It is not
known, if and when additional demand may increase on Tinian. 

Expanded Agreement 

In May 2001, Telesource
International received a third change order extending the term of the agreement
for an additional ten years or to March 31, 2020 (hereafter referred to as the
Expanded Agreement). The Expanded Agreement leaves the option to expand the
power plant by adding an additional 10Mwh of generation capacity unchanged. The
power generation plant currently has 20Mwh of production capacity, which can be
increased to 30Mwh by installing the appropriate power generators. The
production rates for the Base Load and the Expansion Rate do not change from
the amounts originally agreed upon. In
addition, the expanded agreement requires Telesource to upgrade the existing
overhead power distribution system. The
Company is responsible for the costs of the upgrade which include labor and
materials. The Company estimates the
cost of this upgrade to be approximately in the range of 800,000 to 1.3
million and to be completed in 2006.

Telesource accounts for its leasing activities in
accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Revenue
associated with the sale of the Tinian power plant constructed and sold under a
sales-type lease, measured as the present value of non-cancelable rents, was
recognized in connection with recording the loss on sale in 1997 and 1998.
Telesource recognizes finance lease revenue on the resulting sales-type lease
receivable at a constant rate using the interest method. Service revenues
received from operating and maintaining the Tinian power plant for the duration
of the lease are recognized as earned based on actual kilowatt hours of
electricity produced and delivered to the lessee s customers. To the extent
that variable payments based on kilowatt-hours of production exceed the fair
value of operation and maintenance services provided, Telesource recognizes
such contingent payments as additional finance lease revenue as they are
earned. 

The original net
investment in sales-type lease was recognized in June 1997, the date the
contract was executed. The components of the net investment in sales-type lease
at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

When Telesource
recognized the net investment in sales-type lease at the inception of the
agreement in June 1997, Telesource also recognized a loss on the sale of Phase
I in the amount of 1,748,713. In 1998, Telesource recognized a loss on the
sale of Phase II in the amount of 12,521,457 (equal to the entire amount of
the construction costs for Phase II, as there were no additional minimum lease
payments related to this phase). The loss recognized on the sale of Phase II
was recognized when the contract for Phase II was executed in November 1998. 

Phase I of the power
plant was commissioned in March of 1999. Phase II was commissioned in March of
2000. Telesource recognized power generation revenues of 1,078,392,
 1,131,144, and 1,130,172 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. No power generation income was recognized during 1998. 

Revenues for this
contract consist of the present value of the total contractual minimum lease
payments, which were recognized at lease inception. The minimum lease payments
were discounted using an interest rate of 6.74 and the minimum lease payments
are comprised of a guaranteed monthly payment along with an operation and
maintenance fee. Interest earned on the minimum lease payments, which is
recognized over the lease term so as to yield a constant percentage return on
the net investment in the lease beginning in March 1999, is included in finance
lease revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Telesource also receives
variable monthly payments as compensation for its production of power. The
variable payments are recognized based upon power produced and billed to the
customer as earned during each accounting period. 

The total construction costs for the
power plant were 32,120,170. A substantial portion (approximately 14,270,000)
of the repayment to Telesource International for these construction costs is
expected to come from the variable production fees that will be recognized as
revenue when power is produced and billed to the customer. Due to the fact that
the agreement does not provide for any minimum production fees, there is no
guarantee that Telesource International will recover all of the construction
costs incurred to construct the power plant; however, the agreement does
require the customer to purchase 100 of its power from Telesource
International until the maximum power generation capacity has been reached each
month. The future minimum lease payments to be collected by Telesource are
 2,760,000 each year through 2008 and 460,000 in 2009. 

Future revenue related to
the construction and operation of the power plant will be recorded as service
fees until the amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the services
performed. 

29 

Amounts in excess of the
fair value of the services performed will be accounted for as additional
finance lease revenue.

Backlog 

The following schedule
shows a reconciliation of backlog representing the amount of revenue Telesource
International expects to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted
contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting
in progress at December 31, 2004: 

Balance at
 December 31, 2003

 Construction contract revenue recognized for 2004 

16,023,844 

Balance at
 December 31, 2004 

219,252 

The backlog balance represents work under contract
which remains to be completed. The decrease in the amount of the backlog from
 15.1 million as of December 31, 2003 to .2 million at December 31, 2004, is a
result of management s efforts to complete existing projects and implement its
new strategy as discussed above and concentrate future growth in the power
generation segment. 

Comparison of
the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 

Construction
Revenues . Construction revenues, including related party,
increased 11.4 to 16.0 million in 2004 from 14.4 million in 2003. The
increase in construction revenues is attributed to management s efforts to wrap
up its construction segment activities on the adult correctional facility
project, the radio relay station expansion project and the three construction
projects in the Republic of Palau. As noted earlier the backlog of remaining
construction projects was only .2 million at December 31, 2004 reflecting management s
efforts to complete existing contracts and implement its new strategy of joint
venturing with SHBC on new projects. Telesource is committed to completing the
construction projects currently under contract and Telesource is not actively
bidding on additional construction contracts. Construction revenues are expected
to decrease in future periods. 

Service Fees - Power Generation Plant . Service
fees - power generation plant increased 8.7 to 3.2 million in 2004 from 3.0
million in 2003. The increase in service fees - power generation plant is
attributed to the 2.3 million in revenues from the operation and maintenance
of two diesel power plants in Fiji which was awarded to the Company by Fiji
Electric Authority during May 2003 and covers a period of 20 years. The energy
conversion agreement covered the take-over and operation of the two facilities
in Kinoya, and Vuda, Fiji. Telesource is concentrating its efforts on growing
revenues from power generation and expects to see additional growth in future
periods. The power generation revenues at the Tinian power plant were unchanged
at 1.1 million for 2004 and 2003. 

Sales Revenues, Net . Sales decreased 46 to
 23,573 in 2004 from 43,636 in 2003. Sales to SHBC were 89,940 and 0 in 2004
and 2003, respectively. Sales to SHBC are not expected to increase in future
periods. 

32 

Rental Income . Rental income decreased to
 288,899 in 2004 from 919,063 in 2003. The decrease in rental income was a
result of short term lease agreement signed in 2003 with the Guam Power Authority
to assist the local utility in clean up efforts from a super typhoon, Pongsona,
which struck Guam in December 2002. The short term lease agreement with the
Guam Power Authority was completed in April 2003. Rental income during 2004 was
a result of the Company leasing company owned equipment in its local markets. 

Service Fees . Service fees decreased to 72,215 in 2004 from
 571,776 in 2003. The decrease is due to the completion of a broadcast survey
performed by the Company during 2003. During 2004, the Company did not have any
significant service fee revenues. 

Finance Lease Revenues . Finance lease revenues
decreased 13.9 to 1.0 million in 2004 from 1.1 million in 2003. Finance
lease revenue for the Tinian power plant will decrease each year until the
investment in sales type lease is fully amortized in March 2009. 

Expenses 

Construction Costs . Total construction costs
(includes related party and third party) increased 20.5 to 19.3 million as
compared to 15.9 million for 2003. While construction cost increased 20.5 
during 2004 as compared to 2003, construction revenues increased 11.4 .
Construction cost as a percentage of revenues were 120.6 for 2004 as compared
to 110.4 for 2003 which was due to cost overruns attributed to unforeseen
delays encountered on the projects and potential warranty claims. The increase
in cost resulted in lower margins and increased losses realized on construction
projects. 

Provision for Warranty Expense: Provision for warranty
represents a contingent liability for the Koblerville project. 

Provision for Losses in Progress . Provision for losses on contracts increased
to 1,985,557 in 2004 compared to 0 in 2003. 
This was a result of cost estimates exceeding total revenue and the loss
being recorded in 2004. 

Provision for Unbilled and Uncollected Contracts. Provision for unbilled
contracts in progress increased to 1,329,058 from 0 as a result of a direct
write-off of accounts receivable. 

Operation and Maintenance Costs Power Generation Plant .
Operation and maintenance costs power generation plant increased 11.2 to
 2.9 million in 2004 from 2.6 million in 2003. The increase in operation and
maintenance costs was due to 1.7 million in costs from Fiji s operation and
maintenance of two power plants during 2004 as compared to similar costs of
 1.3 million during 2003. The increase in operation and maintenance cost for
the power generation plants in Fiji was due to a full year of operations in
2004 versus approximately one-half year of operations in 2003, the year the
contract went into effect. 

Salaries and Employee Benefits . Salaries and employee benefits decreased slightly 13,456 and 0.8 from 2003 to 2004 reflecting management s continuing efforts
to reduce costs during 2004 through staff reductions. 

Occupancy and Equipment . Occupancy and equipment
expenses decreased 15.8 to 320,533 in 2004 from 380,576 in 2003. The
decrease in occupancy and equipment expense is attributed to a reduction in
office space in Guam and Palau during 2004. 

33 

General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses increased
21.7 to 4.8 million in 2004 from 3.98 million in 2003. The increase is
attributed to higher professional fees during 2004 related to the 2004 and 2003
audit and legal fees. 

Other Expense,
Net . Other expense increased slightly to 1.4 million in 2004
from 1.3 million in 2003. 

Income Tax Expense . Telesource recognized an income
tax credit of 74,435 in 2004 resulting from the reversal of a 2003 tax accrual
which had occurred due to compliance with Fijian Internal Revenue Department
tax regulations. Telesource had net operating loss carry forwards for U.S.
purposes at December 31, 2004 of approximately 8.5 million. The Company has approximately 32.9 million
of net operating loss carry forwards for the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana
Islands and 215,000 for Fiji. 

Comparison of the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 

Construction Revenues . Construction revenues,
including related party, decreased 17.4 to 14.4 million in 2003 from 17.4
million in 2002. The decrease in construction revenues is attributed to the
completion of the airport expansion project and the lower revenues from the
prison project. The backlog was 15.1 million at December 31, 2003 and was
 17.5 million at December 31, 2002. Telesource is committed to completing the
construction projects currently under contract; however, Telesource is not
actively bidding on additional construction contracts. Construction revenues
are expected to decrease in future periods. 

Service Fees - Power Generation Plant . Service
fees - power generation plant increased 162.6 to 3.0 million in 2003 from
 1.1 million in 2002. The significant increase in service fees - power generation
plant is attributed to the 2.0 million revenues from the operation and
maintenance of two diesel power plants in Fiji which was awarded to the Company
by Fiji Electric Authority during 2003 and covers a period of 20 years. The
energy conversion agreement covered the take-over and operation of the two
facilities in Kinoya, and Vuda, Fiji. Telesource is concentrating its efforts
on growing revenues power generation and expects to see additional growth in
future periods. 

Sales Revenues, Net . Sales revenues decreased
89 to 43,636 in 2003 from 397,376 in 2002. Sales to SHBC decreased to none
in 2003 from 89,998 in 2002. Sales to SHBC are not expected to increase in
future periods. 

Rental Income . Rental income increased to
 919,063 in 2003 from 68,209 in 2002. The increase in rental income was a
result of short term lease agreement signed in 2003 with the Guam Power
Authority to assist the local utility in clean up efforts from a super typhoon,
Pongsona, which struck Guam in December 2002. 

Service Fees . Service fees increased to 571,776 in 2003 from
 34,640 in 2002. The increase is a result of Telesource providing project
management services to third parties. 

Finance Lease Revenues . Finance lease revenues
decreased 11 to 1.1 million in 2003 from 1.3 million in 2002. Finance lease
revenue for the Tinian power plant will decrease each year until the investment
in sales type lease is fully amortized in March 2010. 

34 

Expenses 

Construction Costs . Total construction costs
(includes related party and third party) were flat at 15.9 million for 2003
and 2002. While construction cost remained flat during 2003 as compared to
2002, construction revenues decreased 17.4 or from 17.4 million down to 14.4
million in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Construction cost increased as a
percentage of revenue due to unforeseen delays encountered on the projects. The
increase in cost resulted in lower margins and losses realized on construction
projects. 

Operation and Maintenance Costs Power Generation Plant .
Operation and maintenance costs power generation plant increased 112 to
 2,588,752 in 2003 from 1,224,202 in 2002. The increase in operation and
maintenance costs was due to 1.4 million in additional costs from Fiji s
operation and maintenance of two power plants during 2003. 

Salaries and Employee Benefits . Salaries and employee benefits decreased 3 
to 1.65 million in 2003 from 1.7 million in 2002. The decrease in salaries
and employee benefits is attributed to management s continuing efforts to
reduce costs during 2003. 

Occupancy and Equipment . Occupancy and equipment
expenses increased 11 to 380,576 in 2003 from 342,189 in 2002. The increase
in occupancy and equipment expense is attributed to additional occupancy
expense incurred in Palau in the amount of 82,813 and 34,092 in Fiji during
2003. 

General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses decreased
7 to 4.0 million in 2003 from 4.3 million in 2002. The decrease is attributed
to lower bank service charges and decreased taxes and licenses. 

Other Expense, Net . Other expense decreased
24 to 1.3 million in 2003 from 1.8 million in 2002. The decrease is a result
of lower interest expense due to a reduction in borrowings. 

Income Tax Expense . Telesource recognized
income tax expense on revenues recognized in Fiji for 2003 in the amount of
 68,446. Telesource had net operating loss carry-forwards for U.S. purposes at
December 31, 2003 of approximately 32,000,000. 

Liquidity and Capital 

Since 1994, Telesource International s primary sources of operating
funds have been bank borrowings, contributions of equity capital and profits
realized on projects completed. On December 31, 2004, 49,568,519 shares of
Telesource International s common stock were issued or issuable. Telesource had
17,000,000 shares issued and outstanding on December 31, 2003. The increase in
outstanding shares reflects the Company s strategy to obtain additional funds
through stock issuance. 

Cash used in operating activities during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 7.4 million and 6.3 million, respectively. The
cash used in operating activities was principally due to the net loss produced
from construction activities. 

Cash provided by investing activities was 192,458 for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004 as compared to cash used in investing activities
of 660,784 for the twelve months ended 

35 

December 31, 2003. The cash provided by investing activities during
2004 is attributed to 460,330 of proceeds from the sale of equipment net of
the purchase of equipment used within the construction and power generation
operations. The cash used in investing activities during 2003 is attributed to
capital purchases of 795,784 related to the purchase of seven bucket trucks
used on the super typhoon cleanup efforts on Guam. 

Cash provided by
financing activities generated 7.7 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to 8.2 million for 2003. The cash generated by
financing activities during 2004 came from the proceeds from the sale of 6.4
million in common stock. Proceeds from
debt financing in 2004 was 6.8 million and debt repayment was 5.0 million.
The cash generated by financing activities during 2003 was produced through the
sale of 11.7 million worth of preferred stock and 2 million of common stock.
Debt repayments resulted in a net reduction in amount of debt held by 5.1
million. 

Telesource International
had a working capital deficit of 4.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 5.6
million at December 31, 2003. The decrease in the deficit is attributed mainly
to a current portion of long term debt being re-financed and a 1.9 million
provision for costs in excess of billings on the remaining construction
projects. 

Telesource is substantially dependent upon SHBC to provide resources
for operating, working capital, and business expansion. To address the working
capital deficit and reduce its dependence on debt financing obtained with the
support of SHBC, Telesource plans on making some reductions on existing lines
and renewing existing credit lines. The amount of the reductions is dependent
upon the amounts of capital raised by Telesource International within the next
twelve months. 

Telesource International currently expects that its existing cash
balances, credit lines, additional borrowings secured in the first eleven
months of 2005 and the sale of additional common stock in the amount of 6.4
million subsequent to year end, together with funds available through SHBC will
be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12
months. 

The Company will continue to seek additional
funding through sale of its common stock, primarily to SHBC. There can be no assurance that Telesource
will be successful in such efforts. If Telesource International sells
additional shares of common stock to raise funds, the terms and conditions of
the issuances and any dilutive effect may have an adverse impact on the
existing stockholders. If additional financing beyond current levels becomes
necessary, there can be no assurance that the financing can be obtained on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In this event, Telesource International could be
required to restrict its operations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Telesource
believes its most critical accounting policies are related to revenue
recognition on long-term contracts and the recoverability of long-lived assets. 

36 

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts 

Telesource
uses the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Percentage of
completion accounting is the preferred method of accounting for long-term
contracts under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, and accordingly, is the method used for revenue recognition within
Telesource s industry. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the
ratio of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs
for each contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. 

Application
of percentage-of-completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts within the
consolidated balance sheets. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
on uncompleted contracts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets arise
when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the
terms of the contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from customers upon
achievement of various measures of performance, including achievement of
certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of the
contract. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts also includes amounts Telesource seeks to collect from customers or
others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract
change orders once approved as to both scope and price, or other
customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Such
amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value when the scope and price
have been agreed to by the client and Telesource. 

Due
to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply
percentage-of-completion accounting, it is possible that estimates will be
revised as project work progresses. Application of percentage of completion
accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in
the consolidated financial statements prospectively. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The investment in sales-type lease along with our property, plant and
equipment are considered to be long-lived assets. When we undergo changes in
our business, including the closure or relocation of facilities, we may have
equipment and other assets that are no longer needed in our business. When this
occurs, we estimate how much we believe we are likely to receive upon disposal
of the assets and we record an impairment charge if this amount is less than
the net carrying value. If actual market conditions for these assets are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional impairment charges may
be required. During 2004 and 2003 Telesource recognized an asset impairment
charge of 341,392 and 76,186, respectively, related to certain equipment held
by Telesource. Telesource did not incur any impairment of long-lived assets for
equipment or other assets during 2002. 

NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities , which addresses how a business enterprise should
evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through
means other than 

37 

voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the
entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities , which was issued in January 2003. The Company
will be required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in VIEs created after
December 31, 2003. For variable
interests in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be
applied beginning on January 1, 2005. For any VIEs that must be consolidated
under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities
and non-controlling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their
carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the
balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying
amounts is not practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be
used to measure the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the
VIE. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123R
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
 Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, 
and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement
of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is
similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer
an alternative. Statement 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005.
Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have
not yet been issued. We expect to adopt Statement 123(R) on July 1, 2005.
Statement 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one
of two methods: (1) A modified prospective method in which compensation cost
is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements
of Statement 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective
date and (b) based on the requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted
to employees prior to the effective date of Statement 123(R) that remain
unvested on the effective date. (2) A modified retrospective method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized
under Statement 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior
periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. 

The Company is currently evaluating the adoption alternatives
and expects to complete its evaluation by December 31, 2005. As permitted by
Statement 123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using Opinion 25 s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally
recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption
of Statement 123(R) s fair value method may have a significant impact on our
result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial
position. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at
this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in
the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as
described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in
Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Statement 123(R) also requires
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating
cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption.
While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future
(because they depend on, 

38 

among other things, when employees exercise stock options),
there were no operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess
tax deductions. 

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS 

The Company has paid off its credit facility
with Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait on May 29, 2005 prior to its maturity date of
September 30, 2005. On March 22, 2005, the Company repaid a 7.5 million credit
facility it had with the Commercial Bank of Kuwait by transferring the loan to
the Arab Banking Corporation of Bahrain ABC ). The new credit facility with
ABC is for one year and has an interest rate of 4.63 for six months which will
be adjusted to ABC s prime rate at September 29, 2005. 

On August 22, 2005, the Company hired Greg Grosvenor to serve
as the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Previous Chief Financial Officer, Bud
Curley, resigned to pursue other interests. 

On September 1, 2005, the Company named Nidal
Zayed acting Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Zayed was previously
Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer of Telesource
International. Mr. Zayed replaces Mr. K.J. Semikian, whose contract was not
renewed by the Board. 

During 2005, the Company issued an additional
24,186,543 shares of common stock to existing shareholders, which resulted in
approximately 8,993,271 of proceeds of which approximately 2,593,000 was used
to repay principal and interest due to Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait. 

On November 9, 2005 the Company issued
19,683,078 shares of common stock in exchange for outstanding payables and debt
due SHBC in the amount of 3,936,616. 

In October 2005, the Company entered into a
credit facility agreement up to approximately FJD 350,000 with Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Limited ANZBGL ). 
Interest will be charged at 7.75 per annum. This facility is revolving and is subject to
annual review. Also in addition to the
revolving credit facility the Company entered into a FJD 200,000 master lease
agreement to purchase motor vehicles.

ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Telesource is
exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under some
of its credit facilities, which bear interest at variable rates. Because these
facilities bear interest at variable rates, the fair value of the borrowings
are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. A change in interest rates of 1.0 at December
31, 2004 would affect Telesource s interest expense on variable rate loans by
approximately 226,000 per year. 

Amounts invested
in Telesource s foreign operations (Telesource Fiji, Ltd.) are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss, a
component of stockholders equity, in the consolidated balance sheets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Telesource International, Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Telesource International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders deficit and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Telesource International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors Telesource International, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Telesource International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan a
nd perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Telesource International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and the results of their operation
s and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, dependency on its major shareholder for financial support and its net working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not incl
ude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(1) Background 

Telesource International, Inc. Telesource or the Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1994. Telesource was formed to facilitate various
intra-corporate activities and, until July 1999, was a wholly owned
subsidiary of Sayed Hamid Behbehani Sons Co. W.L.L. SHBC ), a Kuwait-based
civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering and construction company.
Telesource entered into contracts as an international engineering and
construction company for various projects including airport runways as well as
moving large radio broadcast towers. In
addition, Telesource also constructed and manages the operation of energy
conversion power plants. In Tinian, an island in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands (U.S. Territory), the Company operates a diesel fired
electric power generation plant for the sale of electricity to the local power
grid. In Fiji, the Company operates two diesel fired electric power generation
plants for the sale of electricity to the local power grid. The Company s
facility in Lombard, Illinois, handles the procurement, export, and shipping of
U.S. fabricated products for use by the Company s subsidiaries or for resale to
customers outside of the mainland. 

The Company conducts its operations through two subsidiaries. The
Company s Mariana subsidiary, Telesource CNMI, Inc., handles construction and
management of the Company s energy conversion facilities in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands and operated a branch office in Guam. The
Company s second subsidiary, Telesource Fiji, Ltd., handles the Company s power
generation activities in Fiji. The Company s Palau operations were handled
directly by the Company. 

Telesource has three main operating segments: power generation and
construction of power plants construction services and brokerage of goods and
services. The power generation activities commenced in March 1999. 

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

(a) Principles
of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Telesource CNMI Inc., Commsource
International, Inc., and Telesource Fiji, Ltd. All significant intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 

(b) Liquidity
and Deficits 

As of December 31, 2004, the Company s current liabilities
exceeded its current assets by 4.3 million. The Company relies heavily on
financing from banks as well as its principle investors, SHBC to support its
operations. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had total outstanding debt
of 25.4 million of which 5.3 million is due in 2005. As of December 31,
2004 the Company had an accumulated deficit of 54.1 million and total
stockholders deficit of 15.7 million. 

The Company incurred a net loss to common stockholders of 17,451,244,
 7,198,916 and 4,886,397 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively. 

Cash used in operating activities was 7,358,063, 6,283,959, and
 2,031,793 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Funds provided by net borrowings and stock sales amounted to
 7,683,542, 8,187,300, and 2,200,000 for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

TELESOURCE
INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Although the Company has been experiencing a net working capital
deficiency, as well as recurring losses and negative cash flows from
operations, the Company continues to raise the necessary funding from its
principle shareholder, SHBC. Subsequent
to year-end, the Company completed 28 private common stock placements with net
proceeds of 12.9 million in additional capital. During 2005, a new management
team was promoted and hired to develop a plan to improve operations. The new management team has begun to assess
all business segments and is developing a strategy to improve the financial
condition of the Company. Management
will continue to obtain necessary funds and expects to improve profitability
and cash flow by reducing costs and securing additional projects. Furthermore, the Company expects to increase
revenues from existing long-term power plant operation and maintenance
agreements as a result of continued expansion on the island of Tinian and in
the country of Fiji. However, no assurance can be given that such increased
revenues will be achieved. The Company
has and expects to continue to seek support from its principal stockholder,
SHBC, for its operations, and for working capital needs, debt repayment, and
business expansion as may be required. SHBC has continued its support of the
Company. 

The
Company s ability to continue operations is dependent upon raising capital
through debt and equity financing. There
can be no assurance that the Company will successfully raise the required
future financing on terms desirable to the Company. If the Company does not obtain the needed
funds, it will likely be required to delay development of its operations, alter
its business plan, or in the extreme situation, cease operations. 

(c) Cash
Equivalents 

Telesource records as cash equivalents all highly liquid short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 

(d) Foreign
Currency 

All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs, and expenses
are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.
Translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders 
equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in the consolidated statements of operations. 

(e) Deposits in
Excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Insurance 

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has cash deposits at financial institution
exceeding Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s insurance limits by
 1,666,154. 

(f) Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue from construction contracts and construction revenues on power
plants, with the exception of the power plant constructed on Tinian which is
accounted for using the sales-type lease method of accounting as
discussed below, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, based upon costs incurred and estimated total projected
costs. Cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts, including labor
and materials, amounts payable to subcontractors, direct overhead costs,
equipment expense (primarily depreciation, maintenance, and repairs), interest
associated with construction projects, and insurance costs. Contracts
frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and
profit estimates during construction are recognized in the accounting period in
which the facts that require the revision become known. Losses on contracts 

F - 8 

TELESOURCE
INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

are provided for in total when determined, regardless of the degree of
project completion. Claims for additional contract revenue are recognized in
the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 

The Company accounts for its leasing activities in accordance with the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases . Revenue associated
with the sale of the Tinian power plant constructed and sold under a sales-type
lease, measured as the present value of noncancelable rents, was recognized in
connection with recording the loss on sale in 1997 and 1998. The Company
recognizes finance lease revenue on the resulting sales-type lease
receivable at a constant rate using the interest method. Service revenues
received from operating and maintaining the Tinian power plant for the duration
of the lease are recognized as earned based on actual kilowatt hours of
electricity produced and delivered to the lessee s customers. To the extent
that variable payments based on kilowatt-hours of production exceed the
fair value of operation and maintenance services provided, the Company
recognizes such contingent payments as additional finance lease revenue as they
are earned. 

The Company also receives variable monthly payments as compensation for
its production of power. The variable payments are recognized based upon power
produced and billed to the customer as earned during each accounting period. 

Revenue from the Company s brokering of U.S. fabricated goods is
recognized at the time of shipment. The sales revenues for U.S. fabricated
goods are recognized net of costs of goods sold due to title transferring from
the manufacturer directly to the Company s customer, with the risk of loss
borne by the customer at the time of transfer. The Company recognizes
management fees and energy sales revenue in the period in which the commodity
is delivered or at the time the work is performed. Telesource recognizes rental
revenue on the accrual basis pursuant to contractual arrangements between the
Company and its customers. 

(g) Property,
Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method at rates sufficient to depreciate the cost over the estimated economic
lives of the assets. Depreciable lives used for financial reporting purposes
are as follows: 

Asset description 

Estimated 
 useful life 

Leasehold
 improvements 

Lesser of lease 
 term or 7 years 

Automobiles 

5 years 

Construction
 machinery and equipment 

10 years 

Office
 furniture and fixtures 

5 years 

Computer and
 communication equipment 

5 years 

Cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts when
assets are sold or retired and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
operations in the year of disposition.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(h) Impairment
of Long-lived Assets 

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets . This statement requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell. During 2004 and 2003 Telesource recognized an asset impairment
charge of 341,392 and 76,186, respectively, related to certain construction equipment held by
Telesource. See Note 6. 

(i) Income
Taxes 

Telesource International, Inc., Commsource International, Inc.,
Telesource CNMI, Inc., and Telesource Fiji, Ltd. file separate corporation
income tax returns. Telesource International, Inc. and Commsource
International, Inc. are U.S. corporations that file separate U.S. corporate
income tax returns. Telesource CNMI, Inc. is a Commonwealth of Northern Mariana
Islands corporation and files a corporation tax return for this commonwealth.
Telesource Fiji, Ltd. is a Fijian corporation and files a Fijian corporation
tax return. There is no corporate income tax in Palau. 

Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective income tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

A valuation reserve is recorded to offset a portion of the deferred tax
benefit if management has determined it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

The Company s subsidiary, Telesource CNMI, Inc., in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) prepares its corporate income tax returns
based on the local tax code. The tax code used is outlined in the Covenant to
Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union
with the United States, which adopted the Internal Revenue Code as the local
territorial income tax regime. Beginning January 1, 1985, 95 of any
income tax due on the CNMI source income is rebated to the extent that it
exceeds local business gross receipts taxes. In 1995, the rebate percent was
decreased and currently ranges from 90 decreasing to 50 depending upon the
amount of taxable income. The amounts paid for the gross receipts tax amounted
to 1,081,722, 400,509, and 1,037,861 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively,
and are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. 

(j) Use of
Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 

F - 10 

TELESOURCE
INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Significant estimates used in preparing these financial statements
include those assumed in computing profit percentages under the
percentage-of-completion revenue recognition method. It is at least reasonably probable that the
estimates used will change within the next year as the construction projects
are completed. 

(k) Fair Value
of Financial Instruments 

The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, short-term debt, accounts payable, and long-term debt.
The gross carrying amount of the notes receivable related to the sales-type
lease approximates fair value as the notes have been discounted at a rate
approximating the Company s borrowing rate. The carrying amount of the long-term
debt approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates. The carrying
amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value
because of the short maturities of those instruments. 

(l) Stock
Based Compensation 

 The Company has stock incentive plans that provide for stock-based employee compensation, including the granting of stock options to certain key employees. The plans are more fully described in note 12. The Company accounts for the stock incentive plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related Interpretations. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Under the Company s stock incentive plans, stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the market value of the underlying common
 stock on the date of grant. Therefore, no compensation expense related to stock options is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair-value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS 123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the fair value-based rec
ognition provisions of SFAS 123 had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period: F - 11

(m) Maintenance of

The Company s power generation equipment has required maintenance
schedules based upon hours of service and capacity. The Company accounts for this maintenance as

(3) Customer Concentrations 

The Company has a concentration of risk with four significant
customers. The Company was contracted by the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation
(CUC) to construct and operate a power generation facility. In March 1999, the
power generation plant became operational. Power revenues from this plant began
in March 1999 and are earned under the terms of a long-term power energy
conversion agreement with this customer. Revenues from the CUC were 2.1
million, 2.3 million, and 2.4 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Another significant
customer is the Commonwealth Ports Authority (CPA). In 2001, the Company was
contracted to construct an airport expansion project on the island of Tinian by
the CPA. The Company recognized revenues of 250,000, 1.8 million, and
 10.8 million from the CPA for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The

(7) Investment
in Sales-type Lease 

The Company s contract with Commonwealth Utilities
Corporation (CUC) for the construction and operation of a power plant on the
island of Tinian is accounted for as a sales-type lease. The minimum lease
payments due under the agreement began upon commissioning of the first phase of
the power plant and are comprised of a guaranteed monthly payment of 180,000
for one hundred and twenty (120) months, and an operation and maintenance fee
of 50,000 due monthly for one hundred and twenty (120) months. These minimum
lease payments were discounted at an interest rate of 6.74 , which was the ten-year
U.S. Treasury note rate in June 1997, the time of contract execution.
Amortization of the minimum lease payments began in March 1999 when the
plant was commissioned and the Company began collecting payments on the
promissory notes and service fees for operating the plant. The Company also
receives variable monthly production fee payments based upon the Kwh produced
plus an additional fee for Kwh produced in excess of the first 5,140,000 Kwh
produced each month. The variable payments are recognized based upon power
produced and delivered to the customer as earned during each accounting period.
Service fees earned in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were not in excess of the estimated
fair value of the services performed. 

The
original net investment in sales-type lease was recognized in June 1997, the

On March 31, 2003,
the Company and Al Soor agreed to restructure the Certificate of Designation
underlying the Series A preferred stock sold to Al Soor in December of
2002. The restructuring involved the elimination of the collateral provided to
Al Soor, elimination of the redemption feature (the preferred stock was to
have been redeemed by payment of 6.0 million to Al Soor by the Company at
maturity in March 2008 provided that Al Soor had not converted the
preferred stock prior to maturity), added a provision to allow the Company to
force a conversion of the preferred stock to common stock at any time from January 1,
2008 to March 31, 2008, and increased the coupon rate for dividends from
6.0 to 6.5 . Accumulated dividends are due and payable upon conversion of the
preferred stock into common stock. As a result of the restructuring of the
agreement, the preferred stock, which was classified as debt as of December 31,

conversion.

Shares had no voting rights and the Preferred Shares rank senior as to
dividends and upon liquidation to the common stock.

(12) Stock
Option Plans 

The Company has adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Had compensation
cost for the Company s stock option plans been determined using the fair value
method of accounting described in SFAS 123, the Company s net loss would
have been equal to the pro forma amounts indicated in note 2 of the notes
to consolidated financial statements.

For purposes of calculating the compensation cost
consistent with SFAS 123, the fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the following

2000 Incentive
Stock Option Plan 

In January 2001, the
Company s board of directors adopted the 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan that
provides for the issuance of qualified stock options to employees. Under the
terms of this plan, under which 888,000 shares of common stock were reserved
for issuance, options to purchase common stock are granted at not less than
fair market value, become exercisable over a 3 year period from the date
of grant (vesting occurs annually on the grant date at 33.3 of the grant), and

(13) Financial
Instruments With Off-balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Derivative financial
instruments Historically the Company has not engaged in hedging activities
and currently does not hold any hedging instruments to minimize foreign
exchange rate or interest risk. 

Standby letters of credit
and financial guarantees The Company is liable for its obligations, some of
which are further secured under letters of credit obtained by SHBC on behalf of
the Company, and other financial guarantees totaling approximately 9.1 million
and 15.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company s
management does not believe it is practicable to estimate the fair values of
these financial instruments and does not expect any losses from their
resolution. 

(14) Related-party
Transactions 

Certain of the Company s
executive officers, directors, and major stockholders are also owners,
officers, and/or directors of SHBC located in Kuwait. SHBC is a civil,
electrical, and mechanical engineering firm and construction contractor with
750 employees and over 30 years of experience. SHBC and its
affiliates were the sole stockholder of Telesource International prior to July 1999
and now own approximately 85 of the common stock outstanding. SHBC and
Telesource International bid and compete within the same industries; however,
SHBC has agreed, in writing, not to bid projects within the United States and
its possessions. Additionally, SHBC and its majority stockholders, Fouad Behbehani
and Nasrallah Behbehani, have signed as guarantors on Telesource CNMI s
promissory note with the Commercial Bank of Kuwait, New York Branch. SHBC and
its majority stockholders have also signed as guarantors on a 1,250,000 letter
of credit issued to the Bank of Hawaii to secure a 1,250,000 credit facility.
These credit facilities were used to finance the construction activities on the
power plant, the West Tinian Airport expansion project, and to provide
financing for other projects. See note 8. 

Additionally, from time
to time the Company may hire, on a part time or temporary basis,
individuals employed by SHBC to provide assistance to Telesource on certain
projects in the Northern Mariana Islands. During 2003, the Company hired SHBC
employees to provide assistance on a service contract to complete a survey of
radio transmissions in Iraq. The rates paid did not exceed the fair market
value of similar services provided by unrelated third parties. The Company did
not hire any SHBC employees to provide assistance on contracts during 2004.

on behalf of Telesource for use on the airport and prison projects. In
addition, the Company purchased various materials and equipment from SHBC in
the amount of 5.2 million and 2.2 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively.
These materials and equipment were primarily for the prison project in Saipan
and the projects on Guam and Palau.

performance, and payment bonds for the Company s projects. Telebond is not a
U.S. Treasury listed bonding company. Most bid, performance, and payment bonds
for the Company are secured from third party vendors. The Company s former

The foreign tax expense
(benefit) was incurred in connection with the Company s operations in Fiji and
is based upon earnings (loss) within Fiji. The average tax rate for Fiji was
31 . In 2004, 2003, and 2002 the Company recorded a loss for financial
reporting purposes as well as a loss for income tax reporting purposes and
therefore, no current U.S. income tax expense has been reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The difference between
the expected income tax benefit and the actual is attributable to the valuation
allowance. 

The valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 14,912,500
and 12,604,716 respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was an increase of
 2,307,784 and an increase of 2,790,154, respectively. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management believes that the valuation allowance
reduces the recognition of deferred tax assets to a level that reflects the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized, considering the tax
planning strategies available to the Company. 

At December 31,
2004, the Company has total net operating loss carryforwards from U.S.
operations of approximately 9 million and approximately 33 million and
 215,000 from its operations in the Commonweath of Northern Mariana Islands and
Fiji, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years
2017 through 2024. Certain of these net operating losses may be subject to
a limitation on future utilization due to ownership changes or foreign tax
laws.

The Company is involved
in various litigation proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results
of operations, or liquidity. 

The
Commonwealth Port Authority CPA and Telesource are currently in
negotiations over the final billing for the West Tinian Airport Project WTA ).
As of December 31, 2004, Telesource has reflected approximately 1.8
million of retentions in accounts receivable related to the WTA. Approximately 891,000
of the outstanding retention receivable was collected in 2005 in connection
with a partial settlement agreement was entered into in August 2005.
Telesource claims that in addition to the remaining unpaid retentions
receivable recorded under the original contract terms and related to work
performed through 2003 that it is also due additional amounts for work
performed outside of the original scope of the contract. No revenue for this
additional work has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Although CPA has acknowledged that work was performed outside of
the original contract scope, it has requested additional documentation before
it will make a final determination regarding payment on the additional work and
the retentions. CPA claims they are due approximately 468,000 in liquidated
damages related to delay of completion. Telesource is disputing those claims
and believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition. The Company had a continuing
warranty obligation for three years from the date of final acceptance for which
there were no material claims. 

The Company, in 1999 was
awarded a contract to build 45 housing units for the Northern Marina Housing
Agency, a government unit. The houses were built and subsequently occupied. Certain
homeowners in this housing project have threatened a lawsuit against Telesource
and two other parties. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company was required to record an estimated liability of
 300,000 for certain unsubstantiated claims. These claims involve allegations
of various construction defects. Telesource has denied any liability and will
aggressively defend itself to dismiss these claims. 

Telesource International s
power generation activities involve significant risks of environmental damage,
equipment damage and failures, personal injury and fines and costs imposed by
regulatory agencies. Though management believes its insurance programs are
adequate, if a liability claim is made against it, or if there is an extended
outage or equipment failure or damage at Telesource International s power plant
for which it is inadequately insured or subject to a coverage exclusion, and
Telesource International is unable to defend against these claims successfully
or obtain indemnification or warranty recoveries, Telesource International may be
required to pay substantial amounts, which could have a materially adverse
effect on its financial condition. Although the equipment is covered under its
insurance, the Company is liable for the deductible of 5,000,000 FJD
(approximately 3,042,000 USD at December 31, 2004). 

Telesource International
offers warranties on its construction services and power generating plants. Telesource
International does not maintain any material warranty reserves because these
warranties are usually backed by warranties from its vendors. Should Telesource
International be required to cover the cost of repairs not covered by the
warranties of Telesource International s vendors or should one of Telesource
International s major vendors be unable to cover future warranty claims,
Telesource International could be required to outlay substantial funds, which
could harm its financial condition. 

The Company has an
agreement with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to manage one
of their power plants. In accordance with Change Order No. 3 of this
agreement, the Company is required to upgrade the power distribution system in
certain areas of the Tinian Island. The Company is responsible 

F - 28 

TELESOURCE

for the costs of the
upgrade which include labor and material. The Company estimates the cost of
this upgrade to be approximately in the range of 800,000 to 1.3 million and
to be completed in 2006.

Statements 

During 2005, the Company issued an
additional 24,186,543 shares of common stock to existing shareholders, which
resulted in approximately 8,993,271 of proceeds of which approximately
 2,593,000 was used to repay principal and interest due to Al Ahli Bank of
Kuwait. 

On August 22, 2005, the
Company hired Greg Grosvenor to serve as the Company s Chief Financial Officer.
Previous Chief Financial Officer, Bud Curley, resigned to pursue other
interests. 

On September 1, 2005, the Company
named Nidal Zayed acting Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Zayed
was previously Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer of
Telesource International. Mr. Zayed replaces Mr. K.J. Semikian, whose
contract was not renewed by the Board . 

On November 9,
2005 the Company issued 19,683,078 shares of common stock in settlement of

The Company is completing the
construction projects currently under contract, however, they are not actively
bidding on additional construction contracts. 

(19) Additional Subsequent Events 

The Company accounts for its construction
contracts in accordance with SOP 81-1 which requires when the current estimates
of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss, a provision for
the entire loss on the contract should be made. Provisions for losses should be
made in the period in which they become evident. Additional information that
enhances and refines the estimating process obtained after the balance sheet
date but before the issuance of the financial statements should result in an
adjustment of the unissued financial statements. In March 2006, the
Company determined that approximately 145,000 additional costs were incurred
on a project than originally estimated and this project would now result in a
loss. A provision for this additional loss of approximately 68,000 has been
accrued in the accompanying financial statements.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Change in
Registrants Certifying Accountants 

As reported in the
Company s August 2, 2004 Form 8K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Company changed auditors from the previous firm of KPMG LLP
effective with their resignation on July 28, 2004. 

In connection with
the audits of the previous two fiscal years ended December 2003, and through
the date of KPMG LLP s resignation on July 28, 2004, there were no
disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if
not resolved to KPMG LLP s satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make
reference in connection with their opinion of the subject of the disagreement. 

Effective July 28,
2004, the Company engaged LJ Soldinger Associates, LLC as its new independent
registered public accountants. The
decision to engage LJ Soldinger Associates, LLC was made and approved by the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

During the most
recent fiscal years and through July 28, 2004, the Company has not consulted
with LJ Soldinger Associates, LLC either: 1) the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the
type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial
statements or ii) any matter that was either subject of a disagreement, as that
term is defined in Item 304 (a) (1) (iv) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Telesource International is committed to maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives and are subject to certain limitations, including the
exercise of judgment by individuals, the difficulty in identifying unlikely
future events, and the difficulty to eliminate misconduct completely. As a
result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all errors or fraud or ensure that all material information will
be made known to management in a timely manner. 

42 

Deficiencies in the Company s Controls and Procedures 

In connection with the review of the Company s
financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, L J Soldinger
Associates LLC, the independent registered accounting firm, notified the Audit
Committee and management, of certain deficiencies they identified that existed
in the design and operation of our internal controls that L J Soldinger
Associates LLC considers to be material weaknesses in the effectiveness of the
Company s internal controls pursuant to standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
A material weakness is a reportable condition in which the design or
operation of one or more of the specific internal control components has a
defect or defects that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data in the
financial statements in a timely manner. 
The material weaknesses identified by the independent registered
accounting firm included the following weaknesses in various financial areas of
the Company: 

Failed to maintain its accounting
records in an accurate, orderly, timely manner which precluded the Company from
meeting the regulatory filing deadlines. 

 Maintaining an inefficient
consolidation process which fails to provide readily identifiable information,
or transparency, as to the source of the accounting data and related
consolidating adjustments made - both at the parent and subsidiary levels. 

 Recording various journal entries at
the consolidation level but not recording them at the subsidiary level
resulting in accumulated differences between the consolidated trial balances
and subsidiary trial balances. 

 Failing to timely perform an internal
review of the general ledger account balances in order to i) identify and
correct bookkeeping errors, ii) make required period end accruals, and iii)
reconcile supporting detail to account balances. 

 Lack of appropriate procedures to
establish and maintain appropriate cost estimates for construction projects. 

 Lack of appropriate controls related
to maintaining a current accurate backlog schedule. 

 Maintaining accounting records for
the Guam office on spreadsheets outside of the Company s standard accounting
software. 

 Failure to prepare orderly and
concise supporting detail records for amounts comprising expense accruals. 

 Lack of certain controls relating to
monitoring and investigating intercompany balances and related differences and
elimination of the intercompany balances in the consolidation process. 

During the course of their audit of our Consolidated Financial
Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, our previous
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, advised management and the Audit Committee of
our Board of Directors that they had identified deficiencies in internal
control. The deficiencies are considered to be material weaknesses as defined
under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. The material weaknesses
identified are as follows: 

The monthly and quarterly closing
procedures did not provide information on a timely basis in order to meet
financial reporting requirements, namely, the financial statements required by
Form 10-K. 

43 

The monthly monitoring process for
certain projects in Saipan did not provide accurate project information on a
timely basis for financial reporting purposes. 

We have taken measures to improve the effectiveness of our internal
controls and we believe these efforts address the matters described above.
Certain measures we have taken through September 30, 2005 include, but are not
limited to, the following: 

Appointed Nidal Zayed as Chief
Executive Officer; 

 Appointed Greg Grosvenor as Chief
Financial Officer; 

 centralized our United States
regional finance organization, with direct reporting responsibilities to the
Chief Financial Officer; 

 exited the construction related
business which contributed to our losses as well as many of the related
internal control weaknesses. 

 established training plans for
personnel. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, Telesource has
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures. The evaluation examined those disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2004, the end of the period covered by this
report. Based upon the evaluation and the communication from our independent
registered accounting firms, Telesource s management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, Telesource s
disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. 

It will take some time before we have in place the rigorous disclosure
controls and procedures, including internal controls and procedures, that our
Board of Directors and senior management are striving for. As a result of our
efforts, however, we believe that our Consolidated Financial Statements fairly
present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented and that this
Form 10-K, and that this report contains the information required to be
included in accordance with the Exchange Act. 

During 2005, we continued to make improvements in our financial
reporting by continuing to hire qualified personnel and refine our formal
review processes. We will continue to assess our internal controls and
procedures and will take any further actions that we deem necessary. 

Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During 2004, there were no changes in our internal control over the
financial reporting or in other factors that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting during the period covered by this Report. 

CEO and CFO Certifications The Certifications of our CEO and CFO
which are attached as Exhibits 31(1) and 31 (2) to this Report include
information about our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting. These
Certifications should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
this Item 9a for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the
Certifications.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
TRANSACTIONS 

Certain of the Company s executive officers, directors, and
major stockholders are also owners, officers, and/or directors of SHBC located
in Kuwait. SHBC is a civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering firm and
construction contractor with 750 employees and over 30 years of
experience. SHBC and its affiliates were the sole stockholder of Telesource
International prior to July 1999 and now own approximately 85 of the common
stock outstanding. SHBC and Telesource International bid and compete within the
same industries; however, SHBC has agreed, in writing, not to bid on projects
within the United States and its possessions. Additionally, SHBC and its
majority stockholders, Fouad Behbehani and Nasrallah Behbehani, have signed as
guarantors on Telesource CNMI s promissory note with the Commercial Bank of
Kuwait, and as guarantors on a 7,500,000 credit facility for Telesource with
the Arab Banking Corporation of Bahrain. SHBC and its majority stockholders
have also signed as guarantors on a 1,250,000 letter of credit issued to the
Bank of Hawaii to secure a 1,250,000 credit facility. 

48 

These credit facilities were used to finance the construction
activities on the power plant, the West Tinian Airport expansion project, and
to provide financing for other projects. See note 8. 

Additionally, from time to time the Company may hire, on a
part time or temporary basis, individuals employed by SHBC to provide
assistance to Telesource on certain projects in the Northern Mariana
Islands. During 2003, the Company hired
SHBC employees to provide assistance on a service contract to complete a survey
of radio transmissions in Iraq. The rates paid did not exceed the fair market
value of similar services provided by unrelated third parties. The Company did
not hire any SHBC employees during 2004. 

The Company paid Computhink, Inc. 84,623 in 2004 for rent,
and computer support. The Company shares
office space with Computhink in its Lombard office. Nidal Zayed, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer, and K.J. Semikian its former Chief Executive Officer served on the
Board of Directors for Computhink. 

The Company held an investment in Telebond Insurance
Corporation at December 31, 2003 in the amount of 77,695 which was sold
in 2004. The Company purchased insurance from Telebond and paid premiums of 45,863,
 59,760, and 23,566 during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Telebond provides employment bonds along with bid, performance,
and payment bonds for the Company s projects. Telebond is not a U.S. Treasury
listed bonding company. Most bid, performance, and payment bonds for the
Company are secured from third party vendors. The Company s former President
and CEO, K.J. Semikian, served on Telebond Insurance Corporation s board of
directors and as President of Telebond, and owns 10 of the stock of Telebond.
