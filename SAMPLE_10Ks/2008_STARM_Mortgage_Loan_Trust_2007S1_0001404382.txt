The information regarding this Item has been previously filed in a 424(b)(5)

Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.

The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for
asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments
of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15.

The following party has reported one or more instances of material noncompliance
with applicable servicing criteria in its report on assessments of compliance:

SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. has assessed its compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria as of and for the 12- month period ending December 31, 2007 and has
identified two instances of noncompliance with the servicing criteria as set out
in Section 229.1122(d)(1)(iv) and Section 229.1122(d)(2)(vii), respectively. In
regards to the former, SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. did not strictly maintain the
required fidelity bond coverage amount at all times during 2007. And, in regards
to the latter, certain bank reconciliations contained items that required
enhanced explanations and that were not fully resolved within 90 calendar days
of original identification. Suntrust Mortgage, Inc. has determined that none of
the items requiring enhanced explanations adversely impacted the amounts
available to satisfy the issuing entity's obligations under the transaction
documents.

As to the issue identified at Section 229.1122(d)(1)(iv), SunTrust Mortgage,
Inc. maintained fidelity bond coverage in the amount of 150MM throughout
calendar year 2007, which was determined to be insufficient according to
applicable FNMA transaction agreement terms. This deficiency was an issue
for limited portions of the year and resulted from an increase in the volume
of the servicing portfolio. SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. has requested a waiver from
FNMA stating this coverage amount is adequate without regard for the size of
the residential servicing portfolio, subject to an annual FNMA review. FNMA
has verbally agreed to this request, and SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. is working to
formalize this agreement. Regarding the issue identified at Section
229.1122(d)(2)(vii), SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. has enhanced its procedures and
controls around the relevant reconciliation process to prevent any future
compliance concerns.

APPENDIX B 

1. The Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with Applicable Servicing
 Criteria for the Reporting period and has identified two instances of
 noncompliance with the servicing criteria as set out in Section
 229.1122(d)(1)(iv) and Section 229.1122(d)(2)(vii), respectively. In regards
 to the former, the Asserting Party did not strictly maintain the required
 fidelity bond coverage amount at all times during 2007. And, in regards to
 the latter, certain bank reconciliations contained items that required
 enhanced explanations and that were not fully resolved within 90 calendar
 days of original identification.

2. As to the issue identified at Section 229.1122(d)(1)(iv), SunTrust Mortgage
 maintained fidelity bond coverage in the amount of 150MM throughout
 calendar year 2007, which was determined to be insufficient according to
 applicable FNMA transaction agreement terms. This deficiency was an issue
 for limited portions of the year and resulted from an increase in the volume
 of the servicing portfolio. SunTrust Mortgage has requested a waiver from
 FNMA stating this coverage amount is adequate without regard for the size of
 the residential servicing portfolio, subject to an annual FNMA review. FNMA
 has verbally agreed to this request, and SunTrust Mortgage is working to
 formalize this agreement. Regarding the issue identified at Section
 229.1122(d)(2)(vii), SunTrust Mortgage has enhanced its procedures and
 controls around the relevant reconciliation process to prevent any future
 compliance concerns.

Accountant's attestation report covers only paragraph 1 of this Appendix B.

Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding any
publicly issued transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the
U.S. government or any government sponsored entity, and further excluding the
transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all material
servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the "Platform").

Item 1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, or
required by the Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities

to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies
and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendors and related criteria.

With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

Servicing Criteria.

Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB.

3. Based on such assessment as of and for the Period, the Company has complied,
in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report with respect to the Company's assessment of compliance as of and for
the Period.

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

For the calendar year ending December 31 2007, or portion thereof (the
"Period"), ZC Sterling Insurance Agency, Inc. ("ZCSIA") has been a
subcontractor for Servicers (also referred to as "Clients" within this report)
identified in Appendix A and the Platform noted therein.

The undersigned Senior Vice Presidents of ZCSIA, have sufficient authority to
make the statements contained in this Assertion and are responsible for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to ZCSIA. ZCSIA has
used the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) (1) (iv), Item 1122 (d)
(2) (vi), Item 1122 (d) (4) (xi), Item 1122 (d) (4) (xii), and Item 1122 (d) (4)
(xiii) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB servicing
criteria, which are applicable to the activities performed by ZCSIA with respect
to the Clients and the Platform covered by this report. The remaining servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB are not applicable to the activities performed by ZCSIA with
respect to the Clients and the Platform covered by this report. As a
subcontractor for Servicer, ZCSIA has determined that it complied in all
material respects with the servicing criteria listed below. ZCSIA engaged Ernst
& Young, LLP ("E&Y"), a registered public accounting firm, to review ZCSIA's
assessment, and E&Y has issued an attestation report on ZCSIA's assessment of
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Period.

1. ZCSIA maintained a fidelity bond and errors & omissions policy in
effect on ZCSIA throughout the reporting period in the amount of coverage
required by the transaction agreements between the Servicer and ZCSIA (1122(d)
(1)(iv)).

2. To the extent that ZCSIA prints checks for Servicer or otherwise has
Servicer's checks or check stock, unissued checks are safeguarded so as to
prevent unauthorized access (1122(d)(2)(vi)).

3. Payments made on behalf of Servicer's obligor for insurance premiums
are made on or before the related penalty or expiration dates, as indicated on
the appropriate bills or notices for such payments, provided that such support
has

(page)

been received by the Servicer at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to these
dates, or such other number of days specified in the transaction agreements
between Servicer and ZCSIA (1122(d)(4)(xi)).

4. Any late payment penalties in connection with any payment for insurance
to be made on behalf of Servicer's obligor are paid from the Servicer's funds
or ZCSIA's funds and not charged to Servicer's obligor, unless the late payment
was due to the obligor's error or omission (1122(d)(4)xii)).

5. File(s) provided to Servicer from which Servicer may make disbursements
made on behalf of Servicer's obligor are provided to Servicer on an accurate
and timely basis and the information thereon is subject to such controls as are
specified in the transaction agreements between Servicer and ZCSIA (1122(d)(4)
(xiii)).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors
SunTrust Bank

We have examined management's assertion included in the accompanying report of
Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that
SunTrust Bank (the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(ii) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the residential mortgage loan servicing
platform of SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007. Refer to management's assertion for the asset backed transactions
covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007 for the residential mortgage loan servicing platform is fairly stated, in
all material respects.

forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB
for the residential mortgage loan servicing platform, except for the instances
of material noncompliance described therein, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2007, and except for criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing
platform covered by this report. Refer to management's assertion for the asset
backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other

Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected

this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with servicing
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) applicable to the Company during the
year ended December 31, 2007, respectively:

 The Company did not maintain appropriate coverage of fidelity bond and errors
 and omission insurance throughout the year as the size of the platform
 increased.
 The Company did not identify all reconciling items on reconciliations of
 custodial bank accounts and did not clear all reconciling items within 90 days

(page)

The information in the Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria under paragraph 2 of Appendix B regarding remediation
activities is presented by the Company for information purposes. Such
information has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination
of management's assertion as described above, and accordingly, we express no
opinion on it.

In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the third
paragraph, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007
for the residential mortgage loan servicing platform is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:

We have examined the accompanying management's assertion, that The Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for publicly-issued (i.e.,
transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, for which the
Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration or paying
agent services, excluding transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality
of the U.S. government or any government sponsored entity and further excluding
the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the Platform),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Management is responsible
for the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's
compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying management's Assessment of Compliance With
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has

(logo) KPMG

asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i)
for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described
above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report
on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that ZC Sterling Insurance Agency, Inc.
('the Company' or 'ZCSIA') complied with certain servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for
the ZC Sterling Integrated Product Solution (ZIPS) Hazard Insurance Outsourcing
Platform (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
Company has determined that only certain servicing criteria
Item 1122(d)(1)(iv), Item 1122(d)(2)(vi), Item 1122(d)(4)(xi), Item
1122(d)(4)(xii), and Item 1122(d)(4)(xiii) are applicable to the activities
performed by them with respect to the Platform covered by this report. The
Company has determined that the remaining servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB are not
applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the Platform
covered by this report. See Appendix A of management's assertion for the
Platform and Servicers covered by this report. Management is responsible for
the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the
Platform, and determining whether the Company performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the Platform. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Attention: STARM 2007-S1

Re: Annual Compliance Statement for STARM 2007-S1

In connection with the loans serviced by SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. (the
"Company") pursuant to the Company's Servicing Agreement(s)/Purchase and Sale
Agreement(s) with UBS Real Estate Securities and any applicable Reconstitution
Agreement(s) (together, the "Transaction Agreements"), I, the undersigned
officer, hereby certify the following as of December 31, 2007:

(i) The Company conducted a review of its activities during the immediately
 preceding calendar year (or applicable portion thereof) and of its
 performance under the Transaction Agreements during such period has been
 made under my supervision; and

(ii) To the best of my knowledge, based on such review, the Company has
 fulfilled all of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements in all
 material respects throughout such calendar year (or applicable portion
 thereof), except as follows:

 SunTrust Mortgage did not maintain the required fidelity bond coverage
 amount in accordance with Section 229.1122(d)(i)(iv) at all times during
 2007. The Company maintained fidelity bond coverage in the amount of
 150MM throughout calendar year 2007, which was determined to be
 insufficient according to applicable FNMA transaction agreement terms.
 This deficiency was an issue for limited portions of the year and resulted
 from an increase in the volume of the servicing portfolio. SunTrust
 Mortgage has requested a waiver from FNMA stating this coverage amount is
 adequate without regard for the size of the residential servicing
 portfolio, subject to an annual FNMA review. FNMA has verbally agreed to
 this request, and SunTrust Mortgage is working to formalize this
 agreement.

 SunTrust Mortgage were out of compliance in accordance with Section
 229.1122(d)(2)(vii) certain bank reconciliations contained items that
 required enhanced explanations and that were not fully resolved within 90
 calendar days of original identification. The Company has enhanced its
 procedures and controls around the relevant reconciliation process to
 prevent any future compliance concerns.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I do hereby certify the foregoing as of the date hereof.
