PART I 

ITEM 1. 

 Business 

Mewbourne Energy Partners 07-A, L.P. (the Registrant 
or the Partnership is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 1, 2007 (date
of inception). Mewbourne Development Corporation MD ), a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Registrant s
managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Registrant. 

Limited and general
partner interests in the Registrant were offered at 5,000 each to accredited investors in a private placement pursuant to Section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, with a maximum offering amount of 70,000,000 (14,000
interests). On August 13, 2007, the offering of limited and general partnership interests in the Registrant was closed, with interests
aggregating 70,000,000 originally being sold to accredited investors of which 65,710,000 were sold to accredited investors as
general partner interests and 4,290,000 were sold to accredited investors as limited partner interests. During 2009 all general
partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. 

 The Registrant engages primarily in oil and
gas development and production and is not involved in any other industry segment. The Program is governed by a Drilling Program
Agreement between the Registrant, MD and Mewbourne Oil Company MOC ), the program manager and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of MD. MD does not make any capital contributions directly to the Registrant;
rather, MD makes its capital contributions directly to the Program. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a
summary of the Registrant s revenue, income and identifiable assets. 

The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced
by the Registrant will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant s control. These factors include
the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions.
It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Registrant. 

The market for crude oil is such that the Registrant
anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural gas will be sold to gas marketers and end users on
the spot market. The spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas without long-term contractual commitments. The future
market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may experience delays in marketing
natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices. 

Many aspects of the Registrant s activities
are highly competitive including, but not limited to, the acquisition of suitable drilling prospects and the procurement of drilling
and related oil field equipment, and are subject to governmental regulation, both at Federal and state levels. The Registrant s
ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing general partner s staff and facilities, none of
which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry as a whole.
Federal and state regulation of oil and gas operations generally includes operational activity, drilling and spacing of wells on
producing acreage, the imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of income and other items, and the protection
of the environment. 

The Registrant does not have any employees
of its own. MD is responsible for all management functions. Mewbourne Oil Company MOC ), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant s managing general partner, has been appointed Program
Manager and is responsible for activities in accordance with a Drilling Program Agreement entered into by the Registrant, MD and
MOC. At March 31, 2015, MOC employed 404 persons, many of whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant s
business during the period for which this report is filed. 

The production of oil and gas is not considered
subject to seasonal factors although the price received by the Registrant for natural gas sales will generally tend to increase
during the winter months. Order backlog is not pertinent to the Registrant s business. 

3 

ITEM 1A. 

 Risk Factors 

Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. An
absence of significant price increases could adversely affect the Registrant s financial position, financial results, and
cash flows . 

Revenues, operating results, and profitability
depend primarily upon the prices received for oil and natural gas sales. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for
distribution. Absent significant price increases, cost ceiling write-downs may be necessary in the future. 

Historically, the markets for oil and natural
gas have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may result
from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and other factors that are
beyond the Registrant s control, including: 

worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas; 

weather conditions; 

the level of consumer demand; 

the price and availability of alternative fuels; 

the proximity, accessibility and capacity of natural gas pipelines
and other transportation facilities; 

regional imbalances in supply and demand; 

the price and level of foreign imports; 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 

the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; 

political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;
and 

overall domestic and global economic conditions. 

These factors and the volatility of the energy
markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Declines in oil and
natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue, but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced economically
and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrant s financial condition, results of operations and
reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2014, a 10 change in the price received for oil and gas production would have had an
approximate 441,000 impact on revenue. 

The actual quantities and present value of
proved reserves may prove to be lower than estimated. 

This report contains estimates of proved reserves.
These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices,
drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural
gas reserves is complex. The process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological,
geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. 

Actual future production, oil and natural gas
prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves
most likely will vary from these estimates. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities
and present value of proved reserves. In addition, the Registrant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production
history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which
are beyond the Registrant s control. The Registrant s properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from
production by operators on adjacent properties. 

4 

The absence of significant future price increases may result in
a write-down of asset carrying values. 

The Registrant utilizes the full-cost method
of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all such costs (for both productive and nonproductive
properties) are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit-of-production
method. However, these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present
value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10 plus the lower of cost or market
value of unproved properties. The full-cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the oil and gas pricing guidelines
established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The absence of significant price increases in oil and natural gas prices
from current levels or the presence of other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write-down of
capitalized costs and a non-cash charge against future earnings. 

The Registrant s ceiling test calculations
indicated no impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

Oil and natural gas drilling and producing
operations can be hazardous and may expose the Registrant to environmental liabilities. 

Oil and natural gas operations are subject
to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable
flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, and other environmental hazards and risks. If any of these risks occurs, the Registrant
could sustain substantial losses as a result of: 

injury or loss of life; 

severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and
equipment; 

pollution or other environmental damage; 

clean-up responsibilities; 

regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal
penalties; and 

injunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations. 

There is inherent risk of incurring significant
environmental costs and liabilities in exploration and production operations due to generation, handling, and disposal of materials,
including wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. The Registrant may incur joint and several, strict liability under applicable U.S.
federal and state environmental laws in connection with releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from leased
or owned properties, some of which have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for a number of
years, often by third parties not under the Registrant s control. While the Registrant maintains insurance against some,
but not all, of the risks described above, the Registrant s insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities.
Also, in the future the Registrant may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. 

5 

In addition, in response to studies suggesting
that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere, many states are beginning to consider
initiatives to track and record these gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases, with several states having
already adopted regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural
gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are included among the types of gases targeted by greenhouse
gas initiatives and laws. This movement is in its infancy but regulatory initiatives or legislation placing restrictions on emissions
of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states of the United States could adversely affect operations of oil
and gas wells and the demand for oil and gas products. 

ITEM 1B. 

 Unresolved Staff Comments 

None. 

ITEM 2. 

 Properties 

Property Interests 

The Registrant s properties consist primarily of interests
in properties on which oil and gas wells are located. Such property interests are often subject to landowner royalties, overriding
royalties and other oil and gas leasehold interests. 

Fractional working interests in developmental
oil and gas prospects, located primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and the Permian Basin
of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the Registrant, resulting in the Registrant s participation in the drilling
of oil and gas wells. At December 31, 2014, the Registrant owned working interests in 119 producing wells. The Registrant had no
drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

Third Party Review of Reserves Estimate 

The reserves estimate shown herein has been
independently evaluated by Forrest A. Garb Associates, Inc. Their reserves estimate is filed with this report as Exhibit
99.1. The qualifications of William Donald Harris III, P.E., the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing his firm s

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimate 

 MD, the Registrant s managing general
partner, maintains internal controls such as the following to ensure the reliability of reserves estimation: 

No employee s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves
booked. 

 Comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies are followed to determine
and report proved reserves. 

 Reserves estimate is made by experienced reservoir engineers or under
their direct supervision. 

 The reservoir engineers review all the Partnership s reported
proved reserves at the close of each quarter. 

ITEM 3. 

 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Registrant may be a
party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these events cannot
be predicted with certainty, the Partnership does not expect these matters to have a material effect on its financial position
or results of operations.

 Market for Registrant s
Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters 

At March 31, 2015, the Registrant had 14,000
outstanding limited partnership interests held of record by 1,776 subscribers. There is no established public or organized trading
market for the partner interests. 

Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the
managing general partner, are not required to meet the Registrant s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least
quarterly in accordance with the Registrant s Partnership Agreement. Distributions of 3,117,425 and 3,130,369 were made
to partners during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

 Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

The Registrant was organized as a Delaware
limited partnership on March 1, 2007. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began May 1, 2007 as a part of
an offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 07 Drilling Program. The offering of limited and general partner
interests in the Registrant concluded August 13, 2007, with total investor partner contributions of 70,000,000. 

The Registrant was formed to engage primarily
in the business of drilling development wells, to produce and market crude oil and natural gas produced from such properties, to
distribute any net proceeds from operations to the general and limited partners and to the extent necessary, acquire leases which
contain drilling prospects. The economic life of the Registrant depends on the period over which the Registrant s oil and
gas reserves are economically recoverable. 

7 

Results of Operations 

The following is a comparative discussion
of the results of operations for the periods indicated. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
related notes to the financial statements, which begin on page 20. As a result of declines in prices for commodities, the results
of our operations for 2014 may not be indicative of results in 2015 as realized prices for production may remain low or continue
to decline.

year ended December 31, 2013:

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above
table, total oil and gas sales fell by 450,829, a 9.3 decrease, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to year ended
December 31, 2013. 

Of this decline, 300,541 and 425,325 were
due to decreases in the volumes of oil and gas sold, respectively. The volumes sold decreased by 3,440 barrels (bbls) and 80,872
thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Also contributing to the decline in revenue
was 149,807 from a decrease in the average price of oil sold. The average price fell to 87.37 from 94.54 per bbl for the year
ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. 

These decreases were partially offset by an
increase of 424,844 due to a rise in the average price of gas sold. The average price increased to 5.26 from 4.58 per mcf for
the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Lease operations. Lease operating expense during
the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to 987,154 from 1,065,559 for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to fewer well repairs
and workovers. 

Production taxes. Production taxes during the
year ended December 31, 2014 fell to 245,483 from 260,844 during the year ended December 31, 2013 due to lower overall oil and
gas revenue. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization fell to 844,046 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 979,555 for the year ended December 31,
2013 due to lower oil and gas production. 

8 

Absent significant price increases, the sustained
lower oil prices experienced in the second half of 2014 and the current year will continue to impact our proved reserves adversely
as the prices used for such estimates under SEC rules are based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average prices, which were
substantially higher at December 31, 2014 than current oil prices. Lower prices used in estimating proved reserves may result
in a reduction in volumes due to economic limits, which in turn, may make it more likely that we will in the future incur impairment
charges under full cost accounting. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash increased by 58,064 during the year ended
December 31, 2014. Cash flows from operating activities were utilized primarily for cash distributions to partners. All wells for
which funds have been committed have been drilled. Any incidental future capital expenditures incurred will be paid with current
available cash and revenues generated through oil and gas sales. Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner,
are not required to meet the Registrant s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least quarterly in accordance
with the Registrant s Partnership Agreement. 

Critical Accounting
Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant s
financial statements include the estimate of oil and gas reserves and future abandonment costs. Changes in oil and gas prices and
the changes in production estimates could have a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact
the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant s
oil and gas properties. 

All financing activities of the Registrant
are reported in the financial statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally,
the Registrant has no contractual obligations but has a financial obligation to plug and abandon non-producing properties as discussed
below. 

Full Cost Method
of Accounting 

The Registrant follows the full-cost method
of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying
the oil and gas properties. Oil and gas properties are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate
of the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. The
present value of future net cash flows has been prepared by using the oil and gas pricing guidelines established by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, projected development and production costs and a 10 percent annual discount rate. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Partnership has recognized an estimated
liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and abandonment
costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated
with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.

The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging
and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted
risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives,
or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection
with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well. 

A reconciliation of the Partnership s
liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is as follows:

Organization and Related Party Transactions 

The Partnership was organized on March 1, 2007
in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware. MD, a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Registrant s
managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Registrant. MOC is operator of oil and gas properties owned
by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC. 

In the ordinary course of business, MOC will
incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will receive
their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator
charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed
rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which will be included in the full cost pool
pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Amounts accrued for and paid to MOC for operator charges totaled 556,777 and 546,959
for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the Program and Partnership
Agreements. 

10 

In accordance with the Partnership agreement,
during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not
exceed the greater of (a) 3.5 of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during
each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of 50,000 plus .25 
of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Administrative expenses can only be paid out of funds available for
distributions. Under this arrangement, 168,634 and 164,095 were allocated to the Partnership during the years ended December
31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

The Partnership participates in oil and gas
activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the Program ). The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program
Agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows: 

Partnership 
 MD 
 
 Revenues: 

Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties 
 70 
 30 
 
 All other revenues 
 70 
 30 
 
 Costs and expenses: 

Organization and offering costs (1) 
 0 
 100 
 
 Lease acquisition costs (1) 
 0 
 100 
 
 Tangible and intangible drilling costs (1) 
 100 
 0 
 
 Operating costs, reporting and legal expenses, general and 

administrative expenses and all other costs 
 70 
 30 

(1) As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100 
of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20 of total capital costs. To the extent
that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 20 of total capital costs, MD is responsible for
tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 20 . The Partnership s
financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.

 Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, MD s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of MD s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, MD s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Registrant s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Registrant to disclose material information
otherwise required to be set forth in the Registrant s periodic reports. 

(b) MD Management s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

MD s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of MD s management, including MD s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, MD conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on MD s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework , MD s management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2014. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Registrant s independent registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by
the Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permit the Registrant to provide only management s report in this annual report. There have been no changes in MD s
internal controls for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 or in other factors which have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect the internal controls over financial reporting.

WITH REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

As of and for the years ended December

18 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Partners of Mewbourne Energy Partners 07-A, L.P. and to the Board of Directors of Mewbourne Development Corporation 

 Tyler,
Texas 

 We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mewbourne Energy Partners 07-A, L.P. (Partnership) as of December 31, 2014 and
2013 and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Partnership at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Description of Business 

Mewbourne Energy Partners
07-A, L.P., (the Registrant or the Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership engaged primarily in
oil and gas development and production in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on March 1, 2007. The offering of limited
and general partner interests began May 1, 2007 as a part of a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and concluded August 13, 2007, with total investor contributions of 70,000,000
originally being sold to accredited investors of which 65,710,000 were sold to accredited investors as general partner interests
and 4,290,000 were sold to accredited investors as limited partner interests. During 2009 all general partner equity interests
were converted to limited partner equity interests. The managing general partner has no significant equity interest in the Partnership. 

 The Program s sole business is the development
and production of oil and gas. A substantial portion of the Program s gas production is being sold regionally in the spot
market. Due to the highly competitive nature of the spot market, prices are subject to seasonal and regional pricing fluctuations.
In addition, such spot market sales are generally short-term in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services
provided by pipelines. The prices received for the Program s oil and gas are subject to influences such as global consumption
and supply trends. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant s
financial statements include the estimate of oil and gas reserves and future abandonment costs. Changes in oil and gas prices and
the changes in production estimates could have a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact
the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant s
oil and gas properties. 

Full Cost Accounting 

The Partnership follows the full-cost method
of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying
the oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 all capitalized costs were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments
would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are
subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net cash flows
of proved reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of the-month oil and natural gas prices, discounted
at 10 , and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. If unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess
is charged to expense in the period the excess occurs. There were no cost ceiling write-downs during the years ended December 31,
2014 or 2013. 

24 

Cash 

The Partnership maintains all its cash in one
financial institution. At various times throughout the year, the cash amount may be in excess of the amount insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued guidance on determining the estimated fair value for financial instruments. This disclosure states that the fair value
of financial instruments is determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. Such estimates involve
uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximates their carrying value due to their short-term nature. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Partnership has recognized an estimated
liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and abandonment
costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated
with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology. 

The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging
and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted
risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives,
or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection
with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well. 

A reconciliation of the Partnership s liability for well plugging
and abandonment costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is as follows: 

2014 
 2013 
 
 Balance, beginning of period 
 500,468 
 459,898 
 
 Liabilities incurred 
 
 9,729

 Accretion expense 
 34,220 
 31,801 
 
 Balance, end of period 
 534,688 
 500,468 

25 

Oil and Gas Sales 

The Program s oil and condensate production
is sold and revenue recognized at or near the Program s wells under short-term purchase contracts at prevailing prices in
accordance with arrangements which are customary in the oil industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Program s interest are
recorded as revenue when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales contracts covering the Program s
interest in gas reserves. The Partnership uses the sales method to recognize oil and gas revenue whereby revenue is recognized
for the amount of production taken regardless of the amount for which the Partnership is entitled based on its working interest
ownership. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, no material gas imbalances between the Partnership and other working interest owners
existed. 

Substantially all of the Partnership s
accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry. This concentration
of customers may impact the Partnership s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes
in economic and other conditions. Historically, the Partnership has not experienced significant credit losses on such receivables.
No bad debt expense was recorded in 2014 or 2013. The Partnership cannot ensure that such losses will not be realized in the future. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income is defined as a change
in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-partner sources
and includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by partners and distributions to partners.
The Partnership has no items of comprehensive income, other than net income, in any period presented. Therefore, net income as
presented in the statements of operations equals comprehensive income. 

Income Taxes 

The Partnership is treated as a partnership
for income tax purposes and, as a result, income of the Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the partners and no recognition
is given to income taxes in the financial statements. The Partnership s financial reporting basis of its net assets exceeded
the tax basis of its net assets by 12,620,880 and 12,949,573 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

The Partnership accounts for uncertainty in
income taxes in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and recognizes the effects of those positions only if they are more
likely than not of being sustained. As no liability had been recognized as of December 31, 2014 or 2013, the Partnership did not
accrue for any interest or penalties. 

3. Organization and Related Party Transactions: 

The Partnership was organized on March 1, 2007
in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware. Mewbourne Development Corporation MD ), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Registrant s managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Registrant.
Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent
of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC. 

26 

In the ordinary course of business, MOC will
incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will receive
their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator
charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed
rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which will be included in the full cost pool
pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Amounts accrued for and paid to MOC for operator charges totaled 556,777 and 546,959
for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the Program and Partnership
Agreements. 

In accordance with
the Partnership agreement, during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership
by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5 of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of 50,000 plus
..25 of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Administrative expenses can only be paid out of funds available
for distributions. Under this arrangement, 168,634 and 164,095 were allocated to the Partnership during the years ended December
31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

 The Partnership participates in oil and gas
activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the Program ). The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program
Agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows: 

Partnership 
 MD 
 
 Revenues: 

Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties

 100 
 0 
 
 Operating costs, reporting and legal expenses, general and 

administrative expenses and all other costs 
 70 
 30 

(1) As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100 
of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20 of total capital costs. To the extent
that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 20 of total capital costs, MD is responsible for
tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 20 . The Partnership s
financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.

Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and
Gas Reserves: 

Reserve estimates as well as certain information
regarding future production and discounted cash flows were determined by the Partnership s independent petroleum consultants,
Forrest A. Garb Associates Inc., in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the FASB s accounting standard. The Partnership considers reserve estimates to be reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties
and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of oil and gas reserves are imprecise and subject to change over time as additional
information becomes available. 

These reserve estimates have been prepared
using projected costs and the average first-of-the-month natural gas and oil prices for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014
and the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. 

28 

There have been no favorable or adverse events
that have caused a significant change in estimated proved reserves since December 31, 2014. The Partnership has no long-term supply
agreements or contracts with governments or authorities in which it acts as producer nor does it have any interest in oil and gas
operations accounted for by the equity method. All reserves are located onshore within the United States. All proved reserves are
developed; therefore, the Partnership has no proved undeveloped properties for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Technologies Used in Reserves Estimation 

Proved reserves are those quantities of oil
and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government
regulations. The term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil technologies
that an entity can use to establish reserves. The SEC now allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production
from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable
certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field
tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being
evaluated or in an analogous formation. To achieve reasonable certainty, our technical team employs technologies that have been
demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of
our proved reserves may include, but are not limited to, empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance, well
logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data, well test data and reservoir simulation modeling.

Re: SEC Filing Letter
 MEP07A 

Dear Mr. Buckley: 

At your request, Forrest
A. Garb Associates, Inc. (FGA) has estimated the proved reserves and future net revenue, as of December 31, 2014, attributable
to interests owned by Mewbourne Energy Partnership 07A, L.P. (MEP07A) and managed by Mewbourne Development Corporation (MDC). It
is our understanding that the proved reserves in this report constitute 100 percent of all proved reserves owned by MEP07A. These
reserves are associated with certain oil and gas properties located in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. This evaluation was completed
on January 27, 2015 and includes proved, probable, and possible reserves. This report has been prepared for MEP07A s filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

This report has been prepared
using the SEC s definitions and guidelines, and with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conforms to the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas. These guidelines specify the use of
a 12-month first-of-the-month average benchmark price, a 10 percent discount factor, and constant prices and costs. 

The following table summarizes
the estimated net reserves and revenue as of December 31, 2014:

ENGINEERING 

Proved oil and gas reserves
are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty
to be economically producible from a given date forward. The basis for estimating the proved producing reserves was the extrapolation
of historical production having an established decline trend. Volumetrics and/or analogy were used for forecasting properties where
insufficient data were present for production decline extrapolation. Production histories were provided by MDC and checked using
published production data and state reporting records. The reserves for other reserve categories were estimated by the volumetric
method considering well logs, core analyses, geologic maps, etc., and/or by analogy to adjacent comparable wells. The available
geologic and engineering data were furnished by MDC for FGA s review. 

The analysis and findings
presented in this report represent FGA s informed judgments based on accepted standards of professional engineering practice,
but are subject to the generally recognized and unforeseen risks associated with the interpretation of geological, geophysical,
and engineering data. Future changes in federal, state, or local regulations may adversely impact the ability to recover the future
oil and gas volumes expected. Changes in economic and market conditions from the assumptions and parameters used in this study
may cause the total quantity of future oil or gas recovered, actual production rates, prices received, operating expenses and capital
costs to vary from the results presented in this report. 

Gas volumes are expressed
in millions of cubic feet (MMcf) at standard temperature and pressure. Gas sales imbalances have not been taken into account in
the reserve estimates. The oil reserves shown in this study include crude oil and/or condensate. Oil volumes are expressed in thousands
of barrels (MBbl), with one barrel equivalent to 42 United States gallons. 

ECONOMICS 

The benchmark oil and gas
prices used in this study are the average of the first-day-of-the-month regional posted prices for the 2014 calendar year, per
SEC guidelines. Oil prices are modeled by well, and are based on regional prices posted for the producing area. Oil prices
have been adjusted by lease for gravity and transportation fees. Gas prices per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) are modeled by
well, and are based on regional prices posted for the producing area. Gas prices have been adjusted by lease for Btu content, natural
gas liquids value, transportation fees, and fuel usage. 

MDC furnished data on the
product prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, and payout balances. FGA reviewed the estimated operating costs, capital
expenses, and pricing structure used in the analysis for reasonableness and accepted the data as represented. All costs have been
held constant for this evaluation. Existing or potential liabilities stemming from environmental conditions caused by current or
past operating practices have not been considered in this report. No costs are included in the projections of future net revenue
or in our economic analyses to restore, repair, or improve the environmental conditions of the properties studied to meet existing
or future local, state, or federal regulations.

The estimated future net
revenues shown represent what should be realized from the sale of estimated oil and gas reserves after deduction of severance taxes,
ad valorem taxes, and direct operating costs. No deductions have been made for federal income taxes or other indirect costs, such
as interest expense and loan repayments. Surface and well equipment salvage values have not been considered in the revenue projections.
The estimated reserves included in the cash flow projections have not been adjusted for risk. The reserves included in this study
are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Future conditions may affect recovery of estimated reserves
and revenue, and all categories of reserves may be subject to revision as more performance data become available. 

MDC provided ownership
interest in the properties, and FGA accepted the extent and character of ownership (working interest and net revenue interest)
as represented. Our staff conducted no independent well tests, property inspections, or audits of completion and operating expenses
as part of this study.

DEFINITIONS FOR OIL AND GAS RESERVES 

(1) Acquisition of properties. Costs
incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease
properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers 
fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. 

 (2) Analogous reservoir. Analogous
reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature,
and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and
thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support
proved reserves, an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the
reservoir of interest: 

 (i) Same geological formation (but not
necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); 

 (ii) Same environment
of deposition; 

 (iii) Similar geological
structure; and 

 (iv) Same drive mechanism. 

 (3) Bitumen. Bitumen, sometimes referred
to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise
measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually
contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. 

 (4) Condensate. Condensate is a mixture
of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in
the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. 

 (5) Deterministic estimate. The method
of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering,
or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 

 (6) Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed
oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: 

 (i) Through existing wells with existing
equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new
well; and 

 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

These Reserves Definitions are those included in the Securities
and Exchange Commission 

 Regulation S-X as of January 1, 2010.

(7) Development costs.
 Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing
the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment
and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to: 

 (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations
for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground,
draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved
reserves. 

 (ii) Drill and equip development wells,
development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing,
tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. 

 (iii) Acquire, construct, and install
production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage
tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems. 

 (iv) Provide improved
recovery systems. 

 (8) Development project. A development
project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development
of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several
fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. 

 (9) Development well. A well drilled
within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 

 (10) Economically producible. The term
economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected
to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point
of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. 

 (11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR).
 Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date. 

 (12) Exploration costs. Costs incurred
in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing
oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration
costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after
acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support
equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are: 

 (i) Costs of topographical, geographical
and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists,
geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical
or G G costs.

FORREST A. GARB ASSOCIATES, INC. 

(ii) Costs of carrying
and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and
the maintenance of land and lease records. 

 (iii) Dry hole contributions
and bottom hole contributions. 

 (iv) Costs of drilling
and equipping exploratory wells. 

 (v) Costs of drilling
exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. 

 (13) Exploratory well. An exploratory
well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas
in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well,
or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. 

 (14) Extension well. An extension well
is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. 

 (15) Field. An area consisting of a
single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic
condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening impervious, strata, or laterally
by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated
as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are
intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest,
etc. 

 (16) Oil and gas producing activities.
 (i) Oil and gas producing activities include: 

 (A) The search for crude oil, including
condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations; 

 (B) The acquisition of property rights
or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties; 

 (C) The construction, drilling, and production
activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction, installation,
and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as: 

 1 

 Lifting the
oil and gas to the surface; and 

2 

 Gathering,
treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and 

(D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons,
in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended
to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction.

(17) Possible reserves.
 Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 

 (i) When deterministic methods are used,
the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible
reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total quantities ultimately
recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. 

 (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned
to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively
less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and
vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. 

 (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental
quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for
probable reserves. 

 (iv) The proved plus probable and proved
plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations
within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects. 

 (v) Possible reserves may be assigned
where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may
be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and
that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with
the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved
area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 

 (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii)
of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated
gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the
higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not
meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties
and pressure gradient interpretations. 

 (18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves
are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves,
are as likely as not to be recovered. 

 (i) When deterministic methods are used,
it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves.
When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal
or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. 

Definition - 4 

FORREST A. GARB ASSOCIATES, INC. 

(ii) Probable reserves
may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are
less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty
criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication
with the proved reservoir. 

 (iii) Probable reserves estimates also
include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed
for proved reserves. 

 (iv) See also guidelines
in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section. 

 (19) Probabilistic estimate. The method
of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each
unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated
probabilities of occurrence. 

 (20) Production costs. (i) Costs incurred
to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support
equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become
part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are: 

 (A) Costs of labor to
operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (B) Repairs and maintenance. 

 (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed
and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable
to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (E) Severance taxes. 

 (ii) Some support equipment or facilities
may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining, and marketing activities. To
the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their depreciation and applicable
operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization
of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil
and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. 

 (21) Proved area. The part of a property
to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. 

Definition - 5 

FORREST A. GARB ASSOCIATES, INC. 

(22) Proved oil and
gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs,
and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic
or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator
must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

 (i) The area of the reservoir
considered as proved includes: 

 (A) 

 The area identified
by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 

(B) 

 Adjacent undrilled
portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible
oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 

 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts,
proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience,
engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

 (iii) Where direct observation from well
penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves
may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable
technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically
through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved
classification when: 

 (A) 

 Successful
testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the
operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes
the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

(B) 

 The project
has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

 (v) Existing economic conditions include
prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during
the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average
of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions.

(23) Proved properties.
 Properties with proved reserves. 

 (24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic
methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased
availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate
recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. 

 (25) Reliable technology. Reliable
technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been
demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an
analogous formation. 

 (26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated
remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application
of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there
will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related
substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

 Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves
should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated
and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation
by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such
areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

 (27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable
underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water
barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

 (28) Resources. Resources are quantities
of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable,
and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. 

 (29) Service well. A well drilled or
completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection,
water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for
in-situ combustion. 

 (30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic
test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such
wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes
tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified
as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area. 

Definition - 7 

FORREST A. GARB ASSOCIATES, INC. 

(31) Undeveloped oil
and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new
wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall
be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless
evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 

 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified
as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within
five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 

 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates
for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery
technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous
reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable
certainty. 

 (32) Unproved properties. Properties
with no proved reserves.
