Item 1 BUSINESS 

Chase General Corporation was incorporated November 6, 1944 for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. In 1970, Chase General Corporation acquired a 100 interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. (Chase General Corporation and Dye Candy Company are sometimes referred herein as the Company ). This subsidiary is the main operating company for the reporting entity. 

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION 

The subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment for inclusion in this filing. 

The principal products produced are as follows: 

Chase Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces a candy bar under the trade name of Cherry Mash . The bar is distributed in the following six case sizes: 

(1) 

60 count pack 

(2)

(3) 

200 count shipper box 

(4) 

100 count shipper box 

(5) 

100 # 2 box Counter Display 

(6)

(5) 12 - 12 oz. bags 

(6) 6 - 4 # jars 

(7) 24 - 12 oz. clamshell containers 

3 

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION (CONTINUED) 

Seasonal Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. These products are distributed in bulk or packaged. Principal products include: 

(1) 

Coconut Bon-Bons 

(6) Peanut Brittle 

(2) 

Coconut Stacks 

(7) Peanut Clusters 

(3) 

Home Style Poe Fudge 

(8) Champion Cr me Drops 

(4) 

Peco Flake 

(9) Jelly Candies 

(5) 

Peanut Squares 

(10) Frosted Pretzels 

The Champion Creme Drops, Frosted Pretzels and Jelly Candies are not produced by the Company, but repackaged for wholesale distribution. 

All products are shipped to customers by commercial haulers. 

COMPETITION AND MARKET AREA 

The Chase Candy Products division bars are sold primarily to wholesale candy and tobacco jobbing houses, grocery accounts, vendors and repackers. Cherry Mash bars are marketed in the Midwest region of the United States. For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, this division accounted for 61 and 57 , respectively, of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company. 

The Seasonal Candy Products division is sold primarily on a Midwest regional basis to national syndicate accounts, repackers, and grocery accounts. For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, this division accounted for 39 and 43 , respectively, of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company. 

The Company has no government contracts, foreign operations or export sales. In addition, all domestic sales are primarily in the Midwest region of the United States. 

The Company is a seasonal business whereby the largest volume of sales occur in August through December of each year. The net income per quarter of the Company varies in direct proportion to the seasonal sales volume. 

Due to the seasonal nature of the business, there is a heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months of the year when the Company is building its inventories in anticipation of August through December sales. The fluctuation of demand on working capital due to the seasonal nature of the business is common to the confectionery industry. If necessary, the Company has the ability to borrow short-term funds to finance operations prior to receiving cash collections from fall sales. The Company occasionally offers extended payment terms of up to sixty days. Since this practice is infrequent, the effect on working capital is minimal. 

4 

COMPETITION AND MARKET AREA (CONTINUED) 

Prompt service and efficient service are traits demanded in the confectionery industry, which results in a continual low volume of back-orders. Therefore, at no time during the year does the Company have a significant amount of back-orders. 

The confectionery market for the type of product produced by the divisions of Dye Candy Company is very competitive and quality minded. The confectionery (candy) industry in which the divisions operate is highly competitive with many small companies and, within certain specialized areas, a few competitors dominate. In the United States, the dominant competitors in the coconut candy industry are Crown Candy Company, Vermico Candy Company, and the Seasonal Candy Products division of Dye Candy Company with approximately 70 of the market share among them. In the United States, Old Dominion has approximately 80 of the market share of the peanut candy business in which the Seasonal Candy Products division operates. Dye Candy Company sells approximately 95 of its products in the Midwest region with seasonal orders being shipped to the Southern and Eastern regions of the United States. Except for the coconut candy industry, Dye Candy Company is not a dominant competitor in any of the candy industries in which it competes. Dye Candy Company s market share in the coconut industry does not vary significantly from year to year. 

Principal methods of competition the Company uses include quality of product, price, reduced transportation costs due to central location, and service. The Company s competitive position is positively influenced by labor costs being lower than industry average. Chase General Corporation is firmly established in the confectionery market and through its operating divisions has many years of experience associated with its name. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The Company has not developed any new products during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. 

RAW MATERIALS AND PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS 

Raw materials and packaging materials are produced on a national basis with products coming from locations throughout the United States. Raw materials and packaging materials are generally widely available, depending on common market influences. For the year ended June 30, 2014, one supplier accounted for 11 of the cost of sales. For the year ended June 30, 2013, two suppliers accounted for 22 of the cost of sales. No other supplier accounted for more than 10 of the Company s cost of sales in fiscal years 2014 and 2013. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

The largest single revenue producing product, the Cherry Mash bar, is protected by a trademark registered with The United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company considers this trademark significant to operations. This trademark expires in the year 2023. The Company and its legal representatives do not expect any impediment to renewing this trademark prior to its expiration. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of June 30, 2014, the Company had 20 full time employees. This expands to approximately 31 full time personnel during the busy production months of August through December. 

5 

CUSTOMERS 

For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, one customer accounted for 29 and 32 , respectively, of gross sales, and 16 and 15 , respectively, of trade receivables. For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, another customer and its affiliates accounted for 21 and 16 , respectively, of gross sales and 46 and 43 , respectively, of trade receivables. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company s sales in fiscal years 2014 and 2013. 

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE EFFECT ON PROBABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ON THE BUSINESS 

Except as described in the paragraph below and to the best of management s knowledge, the Company is presently in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations and does not anticipate any future expenditures in this regard. 

In April 2012, the Company received a demand letter from the Public Building Commission of Chicago Chicago PBC related to a site acquired and remediated by the Chicago PBC that the Chicago PBC alleged was previously operated by a predecessor to the Company. The letter from the Chicago PBC demanded that the Company, as a successor, reimburse the Chicago PBC for approximately 822,000 that the Chicago PBC spent for environmental remediation at the site. On June 30, 2014, the Company and the Chicago PBC executed a settlement agreement in which the Company agreed to pay 100,000 and, to the extent allowed by law, assign potential rights to insurance claims relating to the site, to the Chicago PBC. The Chicago PBC agreed to release and discharge the Company from any and all claims it may have related to the site. The Company made the required settlement payment on July 7, 2014. 

NEED FOR GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES 

The Company is required to meet the FDA guidelines for proper labeling of its products and for contents of its products. 

REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS 

The Registrant is not required to send the annual audit report, annual 10-K report and quarterly 10-Q reports to security holders since the stock is not actively traded. These reports are available at the Registrant s registered office or they are available on-line on the SEC s EDGAR website.

Item 2 PROPERTIES 

We conduct our operations from two buildings as follows: 

Chase Warehouse - This building is located in St. Joseph, Missouri and is owned by Dye Candy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant. The facility is currently devoted entirely to the storage of supplies, and the warehousing and shipping of candy products. This warehouse is over seventy years old, is in fair condition and adequate to meet present requirements. The warehouse has approximately 15,000 square feet and is not encumbered. 

Chase General Office and Dye Candy Company Operating Plant - This building is located in St. Joseph, Missouri and contains the general offices (of approximately 2,000 square feet) for Chase General Corporation, Dye Candy Company and its divisions. The production plant of Dye Candy Company occupies the remainder of the building or 18,000 square feet. The building, specifically designed for the Company, is leased from an entity owned by the Vice-President and Director of the Company and his spouse. The annual rental expense of this facility was 78,000 for each year ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. 

The net book value of our premises, land and office, and production equipment was 303,045 and 361,825, respectively, for fiscal years ending June 30, 2014 and 2013. 

We believe both facilities are adequately covered by insurance.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains statements that plan for or anticipate the future. Forward-looking statements may include statements about the future of our products and the industry, statements about our future business plans and strategies, and other statements that are not historical in nature. In this report, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words anticipate, plan, believe, expect, estimate, and the like. Readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. These forward-looking statements are based on the information available to, and the expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by, the Company at the time the statements are made. These expectations, assumptions and uncertainties include: the Company s expectation of heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months in anticipation of August through December sales; our belief that the Company has stabilized its customer base; will continue its efforts to expand the existing market area and increase sales to customers; and maintain tight control of all expenditures. 

OVERVIEW 

During fiscal year ended 2014, the Company s net sales were 3,243,951, as compared to net sales of 3,190,787 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. This 1.7 increase in volume combined with a 0.4 decrease in cost of sales resulted in increased profitability during the year, as reflected in the income from operations of 157,330 for fiscal year 2014 compared to 130,018 for fiscal year 2013. Working capital increased 57,815 to 621,127 for the current year from 563,312 for the fiscal year 2013 due to increases in prepaid expenses, increases in trade receivables, increases in cash, decreases in accounts payable, and decreases in current maturities of notes payable offset by increases in accrued expense, increases in income taxes payable, and decreases in inventory. 

The following information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

GENERAL 

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

9 

GENERAL (CONTINUED) 

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 

Other than the legal proceedings disclosed in item 3, there have been no other events that have occurred subsequent to June 30, 2014, through the date of filing this form, that would require disclosure in the Form 10-K or would be required to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of or for the year ended June 30, 2014. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company recognizes revenues as product is shipped to customers. Net sales are comprised of the total sales billed during the period less the estimated returns, customer allowances, and customer discounts. 

TRADE RECEIVABLES 

Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations which generally require payment within thirty days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount as no interest is charged to the customer for any past due amounts. Payments of trade receivables are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer s remittance advice or, if unspecified, to the earliest unpaid invoices. 

The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the trade receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience, management s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible, or to require an excessive collection cost, are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

INVENTORIES 

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out basis of accounting. Finished goods and goods in process include a provision for manufacturing overhead. 

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts of such assets to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.

The 8.5 increase in gross sales of Chase Candy of 156,409 for the year ended June 30, 2014 over the same period ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to the net effect of the following: 1) increased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division by approximately 85,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to two customers increasing orders; 2) increased sales of the L212 Mini Mash division by approximately 38,000 versus the same period a year ago due to one customer increasing orders; 3) increased sales of the Cherry Mash Merchandisers division by approximately 22,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to four customers increasing orders; 4) increased sales of the L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash division by approximately 22,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to one customer increasing orders; 5) various other fluctuations netting an increase of approximately 1,000; and offset by 6) decreased sales of the L260 Changemaker Jar division by approximately 6,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to two customers decreasing orders; and 7) decreased sales of the L278 Mini Mash division by approximately 6,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to one customer decreasing orders. 

The 6.8 decrease in gross sales of Seasonal Candy of 93,913 for the year ended June 30, 2014 over the same period ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to the following: 1) decreased orders from various customers in the bulk seasonal division netting approximately 15,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due a sales price decrease of approximately 5 ; 2) decreased orders from various customers in the clamshell seasonal division totaling approximately 114,000 versus the same period a year ago due to decreased orders and a sales price decrease of approximately 5 ; 3) various other fluctuations netting a decrease of approximately 5,000; and offset by 4) increased orders in the generic seasonal division by approximately 40,000 due to increased sales to one customer. 

COST OF SALES 

Cost of sales for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013, decreased by 0.4 . The cost of sales decreased 8,162 to 2,237,838 while decreasing to 69.0 of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2014, compared to 2,246,000 or 70.4 of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2013. 

The 0.4 decrease in cost of sales of 8,162 is primarily due to slight decreases in the raw material costs of peanuts, chocolate, and sugar compared to the same period ended June 30, 2013 offset by an increase of 25,199 in freight expense. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. 

Labor costs, including wages, vacation pay and payroll taxes of 438,481 for the year ended June 30, 2014, decreased 0.2 or 801 as compared to 439,282 for the period ended 2013. 

Freight expense, including shipping and handling costs on goods shipped of 175,986 for the year ended June 30, 2014, increased 16.7 or 25,199 as compared to 150,787 for the period ended 2013 due primarily the 1.7 increase in net sales, an increase in fuel costs, and an increase in refrigeration costs due to weather conditions.

GROSS PROFIT ON SALES 

The gross profit increased 6.5 or 61,326 to 1,006,113 increasing to 31.0 of related net sales for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 944,787 or 29.6 of related net sales for the year ended June 30, 2013, as a result of the overall increase in net sales and decrease in cost of sales described above. 

Finished goods inventory as of June 30, 2014 of 258,726 increased 334 or 0.1 from the June 30, 2013 finished goods inventory of 258,392. Raw materials inventory as of June 30, 2014 of 80,088 decreased 1,427 or 1.8 from the June 30, 2013 raw materials inventory of 81,515.

Goods in process inventory as of June 30, 2014 of 11,950 increased 1,008 or 9.2 from the June 30, 2013 goods in process inventory of 10,942. Inventory levels vary based primarily on sales and purchases. 

SELLING EXPENSES 

Selling expenses for the year ended June 30, 2014 decreased 8,120 to 398,127, which is 12.3 of net sales, compared to 406,247 or 12.7 of net sales for the year June 30, 2013. This decrease is primarily due to lower premium promotions. Premium promotions, which are paid to customers for various marketing reasons, decreased 8,425 or 11.9 to 62,408 for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 70,833 for the year ended June 30, 2013. 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 

General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2014 increased 19,787 to 450,563, which is 13.9 of net sales, compared to 430,776 or 13.5 of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2013. The increased costs are primarily because of a 4,337 increase in professional fees, a 2,992 increase in office salaries, a 9,151 increase in insurance expense and a 3,037 increase in various other administrative expenses. Professional fees increased 4,337 or 3.0 to 146,562 for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 142,225 for the year ended June 30, 2013. Office salaries increased 2,992 or 4.2 to 74,769 for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 71,777 for the year ended June 30, 2013. Insurance expense increased 9,151 or 6.4 to 151,809 for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 142,658 for the year ended June 30, 2013. 

INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS 

Income (loss) from operations for the year ended June 30, 2014 was 4.9 of net sales, as compared to 4.1 of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2013 for the reasons previously described above. 

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 

Other income (expense), net, reflects net expense of (100,386) for the year ended June 30, 2014 , as compared to net expense of (5,401) for the year ended June 30, 2013 . This increase of (94,985) in other income (expense) was primarily due to the settlement in the amount of 100,000 discussed previously under Item 3 in legal proceedings.

INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 

Income before income taxes was 56,944 for the year ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 124,617 for the year ended June 30, 2013. The reasons for the decrease of 67,673 have been previously discussed above.

The table below presents the summary of cash flow for the fiscal year indicated.

Net cash used in financing activities 

(67,772) 

(109,245) 

Operating Activities 

The positive cash flow of 230,410 generated from operations is a result of increases in net sales and the Company continuing to monitor raw material pricing, and when a price increase or decrease is anticipated, adjustments to inventory levels are made accordingly. During the year ended June 30, 2014, sales, net of returns and allowances, increased 53,164 or 1.7 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013. Total inventory as of June 30, 2014 of 495,810 decreased 13,322 or 2.6 from the June 30, 2013 total inventory of 509,132. The timing of inventory purchases and collections from customers impact cash flow generated from operations. 

Investing Activities 

The 28,767 of cash used in investing activities was the net result of capital expenditures and disposal of equipment for the current fiscal year. Machinery and equipment cash purchases of 28,767 and 3,749 were made during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depending on results of operations and cash flows, the Company has plans to replace two cookers at an anticipated cost of 40,000 in the next several years, with no set target date. 

14 

Financing Activities 

The Company borrowed 290,000 and 310,050, respectively, on its line-of-credit during the fall of 2013 and 2012 busy seasons. Payments of 290,000 and 350,050, respectively, were paid for years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. The Company entered into a 350,000 line-of-credit agreement expiring on January 3, 2015, with a variable interest rate at prime but not less than 5 . The line-of-credit is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. Management anticipates renewal of the line-of-credit agreement at similar terms upon expiration. 

Loan payments were 67,772 and 69,245 for years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Overall cash and cash equivalents increased 133,871 to 162,435 at June 30, 2014 from 28,564 at June 30, 2013. 

At June 30, 2014, the Company s accumulated deficit was 5,638,311, compared to an accumulated deficit of 5,688,579 as of June 30, 2013. Working capital as of June 30, 2014 increased 57,815 to 621,127 from 563,312 as of June 30, 2013. 

The Company s lease on its office and plant facility is effective through March 31, 2025, with an option to extend for an additional time of five years, and currently requires payments of 6,500 per month. At the end of each five year period, the base rent may be increased an amount not greater than 30 , at the sole discretion of lessor. The facility is leased from an entity owned 100 by the Vice-President and Director and his spouse. 

In order to maintain funds to finance operations and meet debt obligations, it is the intention of management to continue its efforts to expand the present market area and increase sales to its customers. Management also intends to continue tight control on all expenditures. 

There has been no other material impact from inflation and changing prices on net sales, or on income from continuing operations for the last two fiscal years.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors 

CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chase General Corporation and Subsidiary (the Company as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement . The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Chase General Corporation and Subsidiary as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Chase General Corporation (the Company) was incorporated on November 6, 1944 in the State of Missouri for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. The Company grants credit terms to substantially all customers, consisting of repackers, grocery accounts, and national syndicate accounts, who are primarily located in the Midwest region of the United States. 

Significant accounting policies are as follows: 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

SEGMENT REPORTING OF THE BUSINESS 

The subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment in these consolidated financial statements. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company recognizes revenues as product is shipped to customers. Net sales are comprised of the total sales billed during the period, including shipping and handling charges to customers, less the estimated returns, customer allowances and customer discounts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS 

Shipping and handling costs for freight expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales. Freight expense on goods shipped for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was 175,986 and 150,787, respectively. 

TRADE RECEIVABLES 

Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations which generally require payment within thirty days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount as no interest is charged to the customer for any past due amounts. Payments of trade receivables are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer s remittance advice or, if unspecified, to the earliest unpaid invoices. 

The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the trade receivables If there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience, management s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible, or that require an excessive collection cost, are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

INVENTORIES 

Inventories
are carried at the lower of cost or market value with cost being determined on the first-in,
first-out basis of accounting. The cost of finished goods and goods in process inventories include an estimate for
manufacturing overhead. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

The Company s property and equipment is recorded at cost and is being depreciated on straight-line and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives: 

Buildings 
 
 39 years 

Machinery and equipment 

5 - 7 years

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. 

INCOME TAXES 

Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting. Temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets are only recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates of enactment. 

The Company s policy is to evaluate uncertain tax positions under the guidance as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes . As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The Company had no accruals for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2014 and 2013. 

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share shall be computed by including contingently issuable shares with the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. When inclusion of the contingently issuable shares would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share, diluted earnings per share will be calculated in the same manner as basic earnings per share.

NOTE 2 - FORGIVABLE LOAN AND DEFERRED INCOME 

During 2004, the Company received a 25,000 economic development incentive from Buchanan County, which is a five year forgivable loan at a rate of 5,000 per year. The Nodaway Valley Bank established an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit in the amount of 25,000 as collateral for this loan, with a maturity date of January 3, 2010. The Company met the criteria of occupying a 20,000 square foot building and creating a minimum of two new full-time equivalent jobs during the first year of operation in the new facility. In addition, the Company maintained 19 existing jobs during the five year term. Notice was received February 6, 2009 from the Buchanan County Commission, that the Company had fulfilled its minimum loan requirements so that the loan was forgiven in full and has no further obligations. Since the Company was no longer legally required to return the monies, the liability was reclassified as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the lease term of the new facility. Deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term of 20 years. During the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, deferred revenue of 1,299 was amortized into income for each year.

In
April 2012, the Company received a demand letter from the Public Building Commission of Chicago ("Chicago PBC") related to a
site acquired and remediated by the Chicago PBC that the Chicago PBC alleged was previously operated by a predecessor to the
Company. The letter from the Chicago PBC demanded that the Company, as a successor, reimburse the Chicago PBC for
approximately 822,000 that the Chicago PBC spent for environmental remediation at the site. On June 30, 2014, the Company
and the Chicago PBC executed a settlement agreement in which the Company agreed to pay 100,000 and, to the extent
allowed by law, assign potential rights to insurance claims relating to the site, to the Chicago PBC. The Chicago PBC agreed
to release and discharge the Company from any and all claims it may have related to the site. The 100,000 settlement is
included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2014 and in miscellaneous expense on the
consolidated statements of income for the year ended June 30, 2014. The Company made the required settlement
payment on July 7, 2014.

Item 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s principal executive officer, who is also the chief financial and accounting officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, such officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including those officers, and to members of the Board of Directors, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management has assessed the Company s internal control over financial reporting in relation to criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 

(c) Changes in Internal Controls 

There were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that in management s estimates are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal controls over financial reporting subsequent to the date of the evaluation.
