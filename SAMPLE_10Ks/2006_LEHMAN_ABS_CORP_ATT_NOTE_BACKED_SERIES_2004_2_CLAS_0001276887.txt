Re: Corporate Backed Trust Certificates, AT&T Note-Backed Series 2004-2 Trust
 (the "Trust")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have examined assertions of Lehman ABS Corporation (the "Depositor") and
U.S. Bank National Association, (the "Trustee" and, together with the
Depositor, the "Management") that the Depositor and the Trustee have complied,
in all material respects, with the provisions of the Standard Terms for Trust
Agreements dated as of January 16, 2001, as supplemented by a series
supplement dated as of January 21, 2004 (together, the "Trust Agreement") in
respect of the Corporate Backed Trust Certificates, AT&T Note-Backed Series
2004-2 Trust (the "Trust"), during the period covered by the annual report on
Form 10-K filed by the Depositor on behalf of the Trust for the year ended
December 31, 2005 (the "Annual Report"). Management is responsible for
compliance with the Trust Agreement. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on Management's assertions based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Depositor's and the Trustee's
compliance with the Trust Agreement and performing such other procedures as
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the Depositor and the Trustee have complied, in all material
respects, with the Trust Agreement during the period covered by the Annual
Report and Management's assertions with respect to such compliance are fairly
stated, in all material respects, for the year ended December 31, 2005.
