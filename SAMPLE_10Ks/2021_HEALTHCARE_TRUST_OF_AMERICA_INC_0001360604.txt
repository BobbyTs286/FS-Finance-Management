Explanatory Note 
 This annual report combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020, of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. HTA ), a Maryland corporation, and Healthcare Trust of America Holdings, LP HTALP ), a Delaware limited partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Annual Report to we, us, our, the Company or our Company refer to HTA and HTALP, collectively, and all references to common stock shall refer to the Class A common stock of HTA. 
 HTA operates as a real estate investment trust REIT and is the general partner of HTALP. As of December 31, 2020, HTA owned a 98.4 partnership interest in HTALP, and other limited partners, including some of HTA s directors, executive officers and their affiliates, owned the remaining partnership interest (including the long-term incentive plan LTIP Units)) in HTALP. As the sole general partner of HTALP, HTA has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for HTALP s day-to-day management and control, including its compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filing requirements. 
 We believe it is important to understand the few differences between HTA and HTALP in the context of how we operate as an integrated consolidated company. HTA operates as an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which HTALP and its subsidiaries hold substantially all of the assets. HTA s only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of HTALP. As a result, HTA does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of HTALP, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debts of HTALP. HTALP conducts the operations of the business and issues publicly-traded debt, but has no publicly-traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by HTA, which are generally contributed to HTALP in exchange for partnership units of HTALP, HTALP generates the capital required for the business through its operations and by direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of its partnership units OP Units ). 
 Noncontrolling interests, stockholders equity and partners capital are the primary areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of HTA and HTALP. Limited partnership units in HTALP are accounted for as partners capital in HTALP s consolidated balance sheets and as a noncontrolling interest reflected within equity in HTA s consolidated balance sheets. The differences between HTA s stockholders equity and HTALP s partners capital are due to the differences in the equity issued by HTA and HTALP, respectively. 
 We believe combining the Annual Reports of HTA and HTALP, including the notes to the consolidated financial statements, into this single Annual Report results in the following benefits: 
 enhances stockholders understanding of HTA and HTALP by enabling stockholders to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure in this Annual Report applies to both HTA and HTALP; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of a single combined Annual Report instead of two separate Annual Reports. 
 In order to highlight the material differences between HTA and HTALP, this Annual Report includes sections that separately present and discuss areas that are materially different between HTA and HTALP, including: 
 the Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Item 5 of this Annual Report; 
 the Selected Financial Data in Item 6 of this Annual Report; 
 as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), the Funds From Operations FFO and Normalized FFO in Item 7 of this Annual Report; 
 the Controls and Procedures in Item 9A of this Annual Report; 
 the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report; 
 certain accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report, including Note 8 - Debt, Note 12 - Stockholders Equity and Partners Capital, Note 14 - Per Share Data of HTA, and Note 15 - Per Unit Data of HTALP, Note 17 - Tax Treatment of Dividends of HTA, Note 18 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data of HTA and Note 19 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data of HTALP; and 
 the Certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer included as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this Annual Report. 
 In the sections of this Annual Report that combine disclosure for HTA and HTALP, this Annual Report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although HTALP (directly or indirectly through one of its subsidiaries) is generally the entity that enters into contracts, holds assets and issues or incurs debt, management believes this presentation is appropriate for the reasons set forth above and because the business of the Company is a single integrated enterprise operated through HTALP.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 HTA, a Maryland corporation, and HTALP, a Delaware limited partnership, were incorporated or formed, as applicable, on April 20, 2006. 
 HTA is a publicly-traded REIT and is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings MOBs in the United States U.S. ). We focus on owning and operating MOBs that serve the future of healthcare delivery and are located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in community core outpatient locations. We also focus on key markets that have attractive demographics and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to enhance the value of our real estate assets through our dedicated asset management and leasing platform, which generates consistent revenue streams and manageable expenses. As a result of our core business strategy, we seek to generate stockholder value through consistent and growing dividends, which are attainable through sustainable cash flows. 
 We invest in MOBs that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare in a changing environment. Healthcare is one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy, with an expected average growth rate of approximately 6 annually through 2028. Overall U.S. spending is expected to increase by approximately 20 of gross domestic product GDP by 2028 according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services. In addition, healthcare is experiencing the fastest employment growth in the U.S., a trend that is expected to continue over the next decade. These high levels of demand are primarily driven by an aging U.S. population and the long-term impact of an increasing number of insured individuals nationwide. This increase in demand, combined with advances in less invasive medical procedures, is driving many healthcare services to lower costs and to more convenient outpatient settings that are less reliant on hospital campuses. As a result, HTA believes that well-located MOBs should provide stable cash flows with relatively low vacancy risk, resulting in consistent long-term growth. 
 Since inception, the Company has invested 7.5 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets that are primarily located in 20 to 25 high quality markets that possess above average economic and socioeconomic drivers. Our portfolio consists of approximately 25.4 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 67 of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. We believe these key locations and affiliations create significant demand from healthcare related tenants for our properties. Further, our portfolio is primarily concentrated within major U.S. metropolitan statistical areas MSAs that we believe will provide above-average economic growth and socioeconomic benefits over the coming years. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in ten of our top 20 key markets and approximately 94 of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Hartford/New Haven being our largest markets by investment. 
 Our principal executive office is located at 16435 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 320, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, and our telephone number is (480) 998-3478. We maintain a website at www.htareit.com where additional information about us can be accessed. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in, or otherwise a part of this filing. We make our periodic and current reports, as well as any amendments to such reports, available free of charge at www.htareit.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with the SEC. These reports are also available in hard copy to any stockholder upon request by contacting our investor relations staff at the number above or via email at info@htareit.com.

 Portfolio Performance 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, our leased rate (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) was 89.8 by GLA, and our occupancy rate was 89.1 by GLA. The leased rate for our Same-Property portfolio was 90.5 . 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we executed 3.9 million square feet of GLA of new and renewal leases, or 15.2 , of the total GLA of our portfolio. Re-leasing spreads increased to 4.7 and tenant retention continued to be strong at 87 for the Same-Property portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Tenant retention is defined as the sum of the total leased GLA of tenants that renewed a lease during the period over the total GLA of leases that renewed or expired during the period. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, HTA closed on approximately 191.7 million of MOB investments totaling approximately 600,000 square feet of GLA, with expected year-one contractual yields of approximately 6.0 . These properties were approximately 94 leased as of closing, and are located within HTA's key markets. 
 During 2020, HTA had the following development and redevelopment projects in place: 
 Completed: During 2020, HTA completed its initial ground-up development in Raleigh, North Carolina. Total construction costs on this development were approximately 44 million and totaled approximately 127,000 square feet of GLA and is currently 77 leased. 
 Developments: During 2020, HTA continued to develop three new on-campus MOBs located in the key markets of Miami, Florida; Bakersfield, California; and Dallas, Texas. In total, HTA has development projects in process of approximately 110 million and totaling approximately 244,000 square feet of GLA. They are expected to be more than 79 pre-leased upon completion. 
 Redevelopments: During 2020, HTA continued to redevelop two MOBs located in Los Angeles, California with estimated costs of approximately 20 million and totaling approximately 105,000 square feet of GLA. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, HTA completed the disposition of one MOB for an aggregate gross sales price of 16.8 million, representing approximately 69,000 square feet of total GLA, and generating a net gain of approximately 7.6 million. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold part of our interest in undeveloped land in Miami, Florida for a gross sales price of 7.6 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately 2.0 million. 
 Capital Asset and Liquidity 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we remained focused on positioning our balance sheet to be poised for future investments. In September 2020, HTALP issued 800.0 million of unsecured senior notes due 2031 at 2.00 per annum, allowing us to eliminate short-term revolver borrowings and near-term debt maturities until 2023 and beyond. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had total leverage, measured as debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, of 32.3 . Total liquidity was 1.4 billion, inclusive of 1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility, 277.5 million of forward equity agreements, and cash and cash equivalents of 115.4 million as of December 31, 2020.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
 Corporate Strategies 
 Invest in and Maintain a Portfolio of Properties that are Valuable for the Future of Healthcare Delivery 
 The Company is focused on investing in and maintaining a real estate portfolio that consists of well-located MOBs that allow for the efficient delivery of healthcare over the long-term. To date, we have invested 7.5 billion to create one of the largest portfolios (based on GLA) of healthcare real estate that is focused on the MOB sector in the U.S. We intend to allocate capital to properties that exhibit the following key attributes: 
 Located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S . We seek to invest in properties that we believe have long-term value for healthcare providers, including those that benefit from their proximity to and/or affiliation with prominent healthcare systems. These healthcare systems typically possess high credit quality and are capable of investing capital into their campuses. We believe our affiliations with these health systems helps ensure long-term tenant demand. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 67 of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. 
 Located in core community outpatient locations . We seek to invest in properties that we believe will have long-term value for healthcare providers, including those that are located in key outpatient medical hubs. These properties benefit from their proximity to attractive patient populations, maintain a mix of physician practices and specialties, and are convenient for patients and physicians alike. In addition, these properties and medical hubs can be centers for healthcare away from hospital campuses while benefiting from the advancement of healthcare technology, which allow for lower cost settings, more services and procedures to be performed away from hospitals, and the growing requirement for convenient healthcare. We believe these factors support long-term tenant demand. At December 31, 2020, approximately 33 of our portfolio was located in core community outpatient locations. 
 Attractive markets where we can maximize efficiencies through our asset management and leasing platform . We seek to own MOBs in markets that we believe possess attractive demographics, economic growth and high barriers to entry which support growing tenant demand. We have developed a strong presence across 20 to 25 key markets since our inception, with approximately 94 of our total GLA located in the top 75 MSAs as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we have developed scale in these key markets, reaching approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in ten of our top 20 key markets, and approximately 0.5 million square feet of GLA in 17 of our top 20 key markets. Our scale in markets has allowed us to create the largest, institutionally owned asset management platform in the sector, which includes leasing, property management, building maintenance, construction, and development capabilities. In each of these markets, we have established a strong full-service operating platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities and regional development companies that have led to investment and leasing opportunities for us. Our asset management platform utilizes our scale to provide services to our properties at cost effective rates and with a focus on generating cost efficiencies and superior service for our tenants. 
 Occupied with limited near term leasing risks . We seek to invest in and maintain well-occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare within that specific market. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 89.8 leased. We believe this creates tenant demand that supports higher occupancy and drives strong, long-term tenant retention as hospitals and physicians are generally reluctant to move or relocate, as evidenced by our Same-Property portfolio tenant retention rate of 87 as of the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Diversified and synergistic mix of tenants . Our primary focus is placed on ensuring an appropriate and diversified mix of tenants from different practice types, as well as complimentary practices that provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campuses. We actively invest in both multi-tenant properties, which generally have shorter-term leases in smaller spaces, and single-tenant properties, which generally have longer-term leases in larger spaces. The multi-tenant buildings typically provide for lower lease rollover risks in any particular year and typically allow rents to reset to current market rates that may be higher than the in-place rental rates. We believe single-tenant buildings provide steady long-term cash flow, but generally provide for more limited long-term growth. 
 Credit-worthy tenants . Our primary tenants are healthcare systems, university medical centers and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance, which we believe helps ensure stability in our long-term rental income and tenant retention. As of December 31, 2020, 60 of our annual base rent was derived from credit-rated tenants, primarily health systems. A significant amount of our remaining rent comes from physician groups and medical healthcare system tenants that are credit-worthy based on our internal underwriting and due diligence, but do not have the size to benefit from a formal credit rating by a nationally recognized rating agency.

Key Market Focused Strategy and Investments 
 We plan to continue to grow externally through targeted investments and developments that improve the quality of our portfolio and are accretive to our cost of capital. To achieve this growth in competitive markets we seek: 
 Targeted property investments, generally located within our key markets where we have in-place scale where we expect to see continued growth and synergies. These transactions allow us to focus on the quality of individual properties and to seek to ensure that they are accretive to our cost of capital. 
 Long-term relationships with key industry participants. We will continue our emphasis on long-term relationship building as we have since inception. These relationships are cultivated by our senior management team with key industry participants, including health systems as well as local and regional developers, each of whom have traditionally provided us with valuable investment opportunities. 
 Local knowledge through our internal full-service operating platform. Our local personnel participate in local industry activities that can provide insights and access to potential opportunities. 
 Internal Growth through Proactive In-House Property Management and Leasing 
 Our asset management and leasing platform manages directly approximately 24.6 million square feet of GLA, or 97 of our total portfolio. This is a significant increase since our public listing on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in 2012 when we managed directly approximately 8.8 million square feet, or 70 , of our GLA. We believe this direct asset management approach allows us to maximize our internal growth by improving occupancy, achieving operating efficiencies and creating long-term tenant relationships at our properties, resulting in optimized rental rates. Specific components of our overall asset management strategy include: 
 Maintaining regional offices in markets where we have a significant presence. HTA has 31 local offices primarily located within our key markets across the U.S., including our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
 Creating local relationships with local healthcare providers, including national and regional healthcare systems, physicians and other providers. 
 Maintaining or increasing our average rental rates, actively leasing vacant space and reducing leasing concessions. These leasing results contributed to an average of 1.6 of Same-Property Cash NOI growth each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Improving the quality of service provided to our tenants by being attentive to their needs, managing expenses and strategically investing capital to remain competitive within our markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio of 87 . 
 Maintaining a portfolio of high-quality MOBs that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare now and in the future, while enhancing our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator. 
 Utilizing local and regional economies of scale to focus on operating cost efficiencies for our properties and utilizing our building service operations to generate profits for our stockholders while providing more efficient services. 
 Actively Maintain Conservative Capital Structure 
 We have and continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maintain an attractive investment grade credit rating, to maintain conservative leverage and to preserve financing flexibility, which ultimately hedges against inherent risk and provides us with attractive capital sources that allow us to take advantage of strategic external growth opportunities. In addition, we may also strategically dispose of properties that we believe no longer align with our strategic growth objectives in order to redeploy the capital generated by these dispositions into higher yielding MOBs that we believe have better longer-term growth prospects. The strength of our balance sheet is demonstrated by our investment grade credit ratings. To maintain our strong and conservative balance sheet, we: 
 Maintain a low leverage ratio. Our leverage ratio, measured as debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, was 32.3 as of December 31, 2020. 
 Maintain a high level of liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1.4 billion of liquidity, primarily consisting of 1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility, 277.5 million of forward equity agreements, and 115.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
 Utilize multiple capital sources, including public debt and equity, and unsecured bank loans. 
 Maintain well-laddered debt maturities, which extend through 2031 with no significant exposure in any one year. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 7.2 years.

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY 
 Healthcare Sector Growth 
 We operate MOBs within the healthcare industry, which are benefiting from several significant macroeconomic drivers, such as an aging population, millennials beginning to form families, and an increase in the insured population. These trends are driving growth in healthcare spending at a rate significantly faster than the rate of growth in the broader U.S. economy. 
 The U.S. population is experiencing significant aging of its population, as advancements in medical technology and changes in treatment methods enable people to live longer. This is expected to drive healthcare utilization higher as individuals consume more healthcare as they age. Between 2020 and 2030, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to increase by almost 31 and total over 20 of the U.S. population. Individuals of this age spend the highest amounts on healthcare, averaging more than 6,800 per individual over the age of 65 according to a 2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey. This compares to healthcare expenditures of approximately 1,500 per year for individuals 25 and under. The older population group will increasingly require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments. We believe much of this increased care will take place in lower cost outpatient settings, which we believe should continue to support MOB demand in the long term. 

In addition, the large millennial generation is just now starting to reach their thirties and form families. During this age period, healthcare expenditures double on average. As this large generation utilizes additional healthcare services, it is expected they will do so in more convenient outpatient settings, typically in MOBs.

The number of insured individuals in the U.S. continues to increase, as the population grows and as a result of the impact of U.S. government actions, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the Affordable Care Act ). Since 1999, the number of individuals covered by healthcare insurance in the U.S. has increased over 24 . In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President, and in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. As a result of these electoral developments, we believe that it is unlikely that continued legislative efforts will be pursued to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, we believe that it is possible that legislation will be pursued to enhance or reform the Affordable Care Act. We are not able to state with certainty at this time what the impact of potential legislation will be on our business. Thus far, the removal of the individual mandate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA has seen limited impact. 

As a result of these factors, the healthcare sector is one of the fastest growing sectors of the U.S. economy and is growing faster than GDP. According to the latest data from 2019, Americans spent nearly 3.8 trillion, or 17.7 , of total GDP, on healthcare expenditures in 2019, an increase of 4.0 over the previous year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services project that total healthcare expenditures will reach approximately 6.0 trillion by 2028. Healthcare expenditures are projected to grow an average of 5.6 annually through 2028 and account for 19.7 of GDP by 2028. This growth in healthcare expenditures reflects the increasing demand for healthcare. It is also driving demand for cost effective healthcare which generally takes place in outpatient settings such as MOBs.

Employment in the healthcare industry has steadily increased for at least 20 years despite three recessions during that period. Healthcare-related jobs are among the fastest growing occupations, projected to increase by 15 between 2019 and 2029, significantly higher than the general U.S. employment growth projection of 4 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects ten out of the top twenty occupations with the highest growth for workers will be in the healthcare sector. We expect the increased growth in the healthcare industry will correspond with a growth in demand for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. 

Medical Office Building Supply and Demand 
 MOBs are less susceptible to changes in the general economy than traditional commercial real estate due to secular drivers supporting the healthcare sector and the defensive nature of healthcare expenditures during economic downturns. For this reason, we believe MOB investments provide more consistent rental revenue streams, higher occupancies and tenant retention that could potentially translate into a more stable return to investors compared to other types of real estate investments. We also believe that demand for MOBs will increase due to a number of MOB specific factors, including: 
 The MOB sector is highly fragmented with approximately 13 of the MOBs owned by public REIT investors. There is significant opportunity to expand within the industry given the lack of institutional ownership compared to other real estate sectors.

Healthcare delivery continues to shift to outpatient settings driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences and lower costs. For 2021, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services ("CMS") added eleven new procedures to the list of ambulatory surgery center covered surgical procedures. Additionally, CMS is increasing payment rates for certain qualifying ambulatory surgery centers resulting in a total estimated payment increase of approximately 120 million to ambulatory surgery centers for 2021 compared to 2020 Medicare payments, further supporting the shift of healthcare delivery to outpatient settings. By 2021, the volume of procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers is expected to increase by 35 when compared to 2015. 

An increase in medical office visits due to the overall rise in healthcare utilization which in turn has driven hiring within the healthcare sector. Additionally, the rate of employment growth in physicians offices and outpatient care facilities has outpaced employment growth in hospitals during the past decade, further supporting the trend of increased utilization of healthcare services outside of the hospital. This trend is forecast to continue, with the number of healthcare providers, particularly nurses, physicians, and technical specialists, growing significantly faster than the U.S. average for the other occupations. 
 High credit quality of physician tenants. In recent years, MOB tenants have increasingly consisted of larger hospital and physician groups. These groups utilize their size and expertise to obtain high rates of reimbursement and share overhead operating expenses which creates significant rent coverage, or an ability to pay rent. We believe these larger groups are generally credit-worthy and provide stability and long-term value for MOBs. 
 Construction of new MOBs relative to the overall MOB supply continues to be constrained, with new market participants experiencing significant costly barriers to entry in markets in which we invest.

Creating strong demand for our MOBs. In addition, new development is primarily focused on off campus locations and in markets with growing populations. 

Medical Office Buildings and COVID-19 
 During 2020, the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic had a dramatic impact on the delivery of outpatient care. In response to state and local restrictions and in an effort to accommodate community mitigation measures, many healthcare practices postponed elective visits and increased their use of telemedicine. While the evolution of healthcare delivery began prior to the pandemic, we believe COVID-19 has highlighted the need for dynamic healthcare providers with the ability to shift with changes in market conditions. In addition, we believe that the pandemic has accelerated the shift in medical care towards lower-cost outpatient settings. Although outpatient visits fell by approximately 60 in the spring of 2020, by late summer 2020, many restrictions on travel and nonessential services were lifted. By September 2020, outpatient visits had rebounded, returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, future impacts to market dynamics as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are not certain at this time.

PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES 
 As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of approximately 25.4 million square feet of GLA, with a leased rate of 89.8 (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced). 
 Our properties were primarily located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S. These properties include leading health systems, such as Highmark-Allegheny Health Network, Baylor Scott White Health, Hospital Corporation of America, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, and Ascension. The Company is the largest owner of on-campus or adjacent MOBs in the country, with approximately 17.0 million square feet of GLA, or 67 , of our portfolio located in these locations. The remaining 33 are located in core community outpatient locations where we believe healthcare is increasingly being delivered.

 COMPETITION 
 We compete with many other real estate investment entities, including financial institutions, pension funds, real estate developers, other REITs, other public real estate companies, and private real estate investors for the acquisition of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. During the acquisition process, we compete with others who may have a competitive advantage over us at this time in terms of size, capitalization, local knowledge of the marketplace and extended contacts throughout the region. Any combination of these factors may result in an increased purchase price for properties or other real estate related assets of interest to us, which may reduce the number of opportunities available to us that meet our investment criteria. If the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria are limited, our ability to increase stockholder value may be adversely impacted. 
 We face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchase opportunities. 
 We believe our focus on MOBs, our experience and expertise, and our ongoing relationships with healthcare providers provide us with a competitive advantage. We have established an asset identification and acquisition network with healthcare providers and local developers which provides for the early identification of and access to acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe this broad network allows us to effectively lease available space, retain our tenants, and maintain and improve our assets.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 Healthcare-Related Regulations 
 
 Overview. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, fraud and abuse, relationships with physicians and other referral sources, and reimbursement. Changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our tenants to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making lease payments to us. 
 Healthcare Legislation. In March 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (the ACA into law. The ACA, along with other healthcare reform efforts, has resulted in comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. The laws are intended to reduce the number of individuals in the U.S. without health insurance and significantly change the means by which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. The ACA expanded reporting requirements and responsibilities related to facility ownership and management, patient safety, quality of care, and certain financial transactions, including payments by the pharmaceutical and medical industry to doctors and teaching hospitals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, our tenants may be regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. If they do not comply with the additional reporting requirements and responsibilities, our tenants ability to participate in federal healthcare programs may be adversely affected. Moreover, there may be other aspects of the comprehensive healthcare reform legislation for which regulations have not yet been adopted, which, depending on how they are implemented, could adversely affect our tenants and their ability to meet their lease obligations to us. 
 The ACA has faced numerous judicial, legislative and executive challenges. Although there continue to be judicial challenges to the ACA, the Supreme Court has thus far upheld the ACA, including in their June 25, 2015 ruling on King v. Burwell . However, President Trump and Congressional Republicans promised they would seek the repeal of the ACA. While no full repeal bills have passed both chambers of Congress, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the tax penalty associated with a key provision of the ACA known as the individual mandate beginning January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a Texas federal district court judge, in the case of Texas v. Azar, declared the ACA unconstitutional, reasoning that the individual mandate tax penalty was essential to and not severable from the remainder of the ACA. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA s individual mandate was unconstitutional but sent the case back to the District Court for further analysis of whether the entire ACA is also rendered unconstitutional. In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President, and in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. As a result of these electoral developments, we believe it is unlikely that continued legislative efforts will be pursued to repeal the ACA. Instead, we believe it is possible that legislation will be pursued to enhance or reform the ACA. We are not able to state with certainty at this time what the impact of potential legislation will be on our business. 
 Reimbursement Programs. Sources of revenue for our tenants may include the federal Medicare program, TRICARE, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements and self-insured employers, among others. Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid programs, as well as numerous private insurance and managed care plans, generally require participating providers to accept government-determined reimbursement levels as payment in full for services rendered, without regard to facility charges. Changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could result in a substantial reduction in our tenants revenues. 
 In previous years, Medicare s physician fee-for-service reimbursements were subject to a significant, automatic reduction in rates. Congress repeatedly enacted temporary legislation postponing the implementation of these physician rate cuts. In April 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted rules that establishes physician reimbursement rates that allow for steady increases in rates over the near future. 
 Despite this doc-fix legislation, we cannot predict whether future Congressional proposals will seek to reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other such payors to reduce healthcare costs will likely continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. 
 Amendments to the ACA and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133 of the federal poverty level. While the federal government agreed to pay the Medicaid expansion costs for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016, the federal government s portion began declining in 2017. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court held in 
 16 

Table of Contents 

2012 that states could not be required to expand their Medicaid programs, which has resulted in some states deciding not to expand their Medicaid programs. In some other cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Efforts to reduce costs will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our tenants. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us. 
 Various laws and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS initiatives and rules may also reduce or change medical provider compensation and reimbursement. 
 These new laws, initiatives and CMS rules reflect an ongoing effort to reduce healthcare costs and reimburse medical providers based on criteria other than fee-for-service. Although their impact is difficult to predict, these laws, initiatives and CMS rules may adversely impact medical providers reimbursement and our tenants ability to make rent payments to us. 
 In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President, and in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. At this time, we are not able to state with certainty what the impact of any potential legislation may have on our business. 
 Fraud and Abuse Laws. There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are in a position to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, the ACA includes program integrity provisions that both create new authorities and expand existing authorities for federal and state governments to address fraud, waste and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our lease arrangements with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, among others: 
 the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral or recommendation for the ordering of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid; 
 the Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, which: (1) requires hospital landlords of facilities with financial relationships to charge a fair market value rent that does not take into account the volume or value of referrals and subject to specific exceptions; and (2) restricts physicians from making referrals for specifically designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare and Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship; 
 the False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, including claims paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts and regulatory violations and to exclude violators from participating in federal healthcare programs; 
 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which protects the privacy and security of personal health information; and 
 State laws which prohibit kickbacks, self-referrals and false claims, and are generally applicable to commercial and state payors. 
 In the ordinary course of their business, our tenants may be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam suits, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former employees or patients. In addition to the False Claims Act, there may be civil litigation between private parties which seek damages for violations of federal and state laws. These types of actions may result in monetary penalties, punitive sanctions, damage assessments, imprisonment, increased governmental oversight, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Investigation by a federal or state governmental body for violation of fraud and abuse laws, imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants, and civil litigation could jeopardize that tenant s ability to operate or to make rent payments to us. 
 Healthcare Licensure and Certification. Some of our medical properties and our tenants may require a license, multiple licenses, a certificate of need CON ), or other certification to operate. Failure to obtain a license, CON, other certification, or loss of a required license, CON, or some other certification would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by

the tenant. This event could adversely affect our tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate physical plant expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of healthcare-related facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. State CON laws are not uniform throughout the U.S. and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of state CON laws on our facilities or the operations of our tenants. 
 Real Estate Ownership-Related Regulations 
 Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. For example: 
 Costs of Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the ADA ), all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with present requirements of the ADA, none of our properties have been audited and we have only conducted investigations of a limited number of our properties to determine compliance. We may incur additional costs in connection with compliance with the ADA. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. We may incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other legislation. 
 Costs of Government Environmental Regulation and Private Litigation. Environmental laws and regulations hold us liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which may be on our properties. These laws could impose liability on us without regard to whether we caused the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may cause substantial costs and the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs. Various laws also impose liability on persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and such persons oftentimes must incur the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. As the owner and operator of our properties, we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. 
 Use of Hazardous Substances by Some of Our Tenants. Some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Our leases require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. We are unaware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. 
 Other Federal, State and Local Regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we may incur governmental fines or private damage awards. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. We believe, based in part on engineering reports which are generally obtained by us at the time we acquire the properties, that all of our properties comply in all material respects with current regulations. However, if we were required to make significant expenditures under applicable regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 333 employees, of which less than 1 are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Our commitment to our employees continues to be a high priority for us. In addition to base salary, our annual compensation and benefit plans includes short-term incentive bonuses, long-term incentive stock plans, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, tuition assistance, employee assistance programs, among other benefits. We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of all of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional precautionary measures to adjust our business operations and to address the needs of our employees. In addition to our ongoing sponsorship of various health and wellness initiatives to aid in the overall well-being of our employees, we have provided hazard pay, deployed comprehensive personal protective equipment, and have implemented many new protocols both in our tenant buildings and regional office locations based on the Center for Disease Control and other government mandated or recommended guidelines.

We support employee development through numerous company-sponsored training programs and professional development opportunities. Our employees regularly participate in various industry-specific training programs and conferences, and are encouraged to seek out relevant certifications or accreditations that provide additional expertise in real estate and other relevant sector-specific subjects. In addition, we provide internal cross-functional training opportunities in order that our employees may familiarize themselves with multiple aspects of our business. 
 TAX MATTERS 
 We filed an election with our 2007 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). We believe we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for all tax years starting in 2007 and we intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, we are generally not subject to federal and certain state income tax on net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. We expect to continue to make distributions sufficient to avoid income tax. 
 While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, through our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, corporate level income tax would apply to our taxable income at the current corporate tax rates. As a result, the amount available for distributions to stockholders would be reduced and we would no longer be required to make distributions. Failure to qualify as a REIT could also adversely affect our ability to make investments and raise capital. 
 Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

 the U.S. federal income tax treatment of cash we might receive from cash settlement of our forward sale agreements may jeopardize our qualification as a REIT; and 
 in case of our bankruptcy or insolvency we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of our common stock. 
 Risk Factors 
 This section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and the price of our common stock. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face. Our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 We are dependent on investments in the healthcare property sector, making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries. 
 We concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry. A downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries. Specifically, a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants to make lease payments to us as well as our ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our ability to make future acquisitions may be impeded, or the cost of these acquisitions may be increased, due to a variety of factors, including competition for the acquisition of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. 
 At any given time, we may be pursuing property acquisitions or have properties subject to letters of intent, but we cannot assure you that we will acquire any such properties because the letters of intent are non-binding and potential transaction opportunities are subject to a variety of factors, including: (i) the willingness of the current property owner to proceed with a potential transaction with us; (ii) our completion of due diligence that is satisfactory to us and our receipt of internal approvals; (iii) the negotiation and execution of mutually acceptable binding purchase agreements; and (iv) the satisfaction of closing conditions, including our receipt of third-party consents and approvals. We also compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for the acquisition of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare properties. The competition for the acquisition of healthcare properties may significantly increase the prices we must pay for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry or other real estate related assets we seek to acquire. This competition may also effectively limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or the number of properties that we are able to acquire, and may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms. The potential sellers of our acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive purchasers because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more to acquire the properties, may have pre-existing relationships or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger healthcare REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages over us that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Moreover, our competitors generally may be able to accept more risk with respect to their acquisitions than we can prudently manage or are willing to accept. In addition, the number of our competitors and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase, which could result in increased demand for these properties and, therefore, increased prices to acquire them. Because of an increased interest in single-property acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices for the purchase of single properties in comparison with the purchase of multi-property portfolios. If we pay higher prices for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry, or otherwise incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential transactions that we are subsequently unable or elect not to complete, our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.

 We may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with hospitals, healthcare systems and developers, which may impede our ability to identify and complete acquisitions directly from hospitals, healthcare systems and developers, and may otherwise adversely affect our growth, business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 The success of our business depends to a large extent on our past, current and future relationships with hospitals, healthcare systems and developers, including our ability to acquire properties directly from hospitals, healthcare systems and developers. We invest a significant amount of time to develop and maintain these relationships, and these relationships have helped us secure acquisition opportunities. Facilities that are acquired directly from hospitals, healthcare systems and developers are typically more attractive to us as a purchaser because of the absence of a formal competitive marketing process, which could lead to higher prices. If any of our relationships with hospitals, healthcare systems and developers deteriorates, or if a conflict of interest or a non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged and we may not be able to secure attractive acquisition opportunities directly from hospitals, healthcare systems and developers in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to locate and acquire facilities at attractive prices. 
 Our results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and our ability to dispose of our investments are subject to general economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate and credit markets. 
 Our business is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, as well as the commercial real estate and credit markets. For example, a financial disruption or credit crisis could negatively impact the value of commercial real estate assets, contributing to a general slowdown in our industry. A slow economic recovery could cause a reduction in the overall volume of transactions, number of sales and leasing activities of the type that we previously experienced. We are unable to predict future changes in national, regional or local economic, demographic or real estate market conditions. 
 Adverse economic conditions in the commercial real estate and credit markets may result in: 
 defaults by tenants at our properties due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity or operational failures; 
 increases in vacancy rates due to tenant defaults, the expiration or termination of tenant leases, and reduced demand for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry; 
 increases in tenant inducements, tenant improvement expenditures, rent concessions or reduced rental rates, especially to maintain or increase occupancy at our properties; 
 reduced values of our properties, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of our assets at attractive prices or obtain debt financing secured by our properties on satisfactory terms, as well as reducing the availability of unsecured loans; 
 the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits being reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, the dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments and other factors; 
 one or more lenders under our credit facilities refusing to fund their financing commitments to us and, in such event, we are unable to replace the financing commitments of any such lender or lenders on favorable terms, or at all; 
 a recession or rise in interest rates, which could make it more difficult for us to lease our properties or dispose of our properties or make alternative interest-bearing and other investments more attractive, thereby lowering the relative value of our existing real estate investments; 
 one or more counterparties to our interest rate swaps default on their obligations to us, thereby increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments; 
 increases in the supply of competing properties or decreases in the demand for our properties, which may impact our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rents at our properties or to dispose of our investments; and 
 increased insurance premiums, real estate taxes or energy costs or other expenses, which may reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders or, to the extent such increases are passed through to our tenants, may lead to tenant defaults, tenant turnover, or make it difficult for us to increase rents to tenants on lease turnover which may limit our ability to increase our returns. 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected to the extent an economic slowdown or downturn is prolonged or becomes more severe.

 Our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control, which may affect our ability to seize strategic opportunities, satisfy debt obligations and make distributions to our stockholders. 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, on an annual basis, at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financings, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may need to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs, meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, in the time period we desire, or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on a number of factors, including: general market conditions; the market s perception of our growth potential; our current debt levels; our current and expected future earnings; our cash flow and cash distributions; and the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our principal and interest obligations to our lenders or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our Board members, and certain of our key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of one or more of these individuals, our operating results could suffer. 
 Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions is dependent upon the performance of our Board of Directors, our executive officers and our other employees. Our Board of Directors establishes important policies, governance objectives and strategic goals, and our management team serves a critical role in the identification and acquisition of investments, the determination and finalization of our financing arrangements, the asset management of our investments, and the operation of our day-to-day activities. Our stockholders will have no opportunity to evaluate the terms of transactions or other economic or financial data concerning our investments that are not described in this Annual Report or other periodic filings with the SEC. We rely primarily on the management ability of our executive officers and the governance by the members of our Board of Directors, each of whom would be difficult to replace. We do not have any key-person life insurance on our executive officers. Although we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these employment agreements contain various termination and resignation rights. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of these executives, without satisfactory replacements, our operating results could suffer. In addition, if any member of our Board of Directors were to resign, we would lose the benefit of such director s governance expertise and experience, and familiarity with us and the sector within which we operate. As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to achieve our investment objectives or to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 We rely on information technology in our operations; any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, and tenant and lease data. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Pandemics and other health concerns, including the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures intended to prevent their spread, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and those caused by possible new strains or mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as both future widespread and localized outbreaks of infectious diseases and other health concerns, and the measures taken to prevent the spread or lessen the impact, could cause a material disruption to our industry or deteriorate the economy as a whole. The impacts of such events could be severe and far-reaching, and may impact our operations in several ways. Such operational impacts include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) tenants could experience deteriorating financial conditions and be unable or unwilling to pay rent on time and in full; (ii) we may have to restructure tenants' obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us; (iii) inquiries and tours at our properties could decrease; (iv) move-ins and new tenanting efforts, and re-letting efforts could slow or stop altogether; (v) move-outs and potential early termination of leases thereunder could increase; (vi) operating expenses, including the costs of certain essential 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 services or supplies, including payments to third-party contractors, service providers, and employees essential to ensure continuity in our building operations may increase; and (vii) costs of development, including expenditures for materials utilized in construction and labor essential to complete existing developments in progress may increase substantively. 
 Further, disruption in the real estate markets may restrict our ability to deploy capital for new investments, or limit our ability to make new investments on terms that are favorable to us. 
 Additionally, these types of events could cause severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide which could stretch to bank lending, capital and other financial markets. If these markets are affected, future access to capital and other sources of funding could be constrained which could adversely affect the availability and terms of our future borrowings, our ability to refinance existing debt, our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility, and our ability to raise equity financing on terms that are favorable to us. 
 Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure 
 We may structure acquisitions of property in exchange for limited partnership units of our operating partnership on terms that could limit our liquidity or our flexibility. 
 We may continue to acquire properties by issuing limited partnership units of our operating partnership, HTALP, in exchange for a property owner contributing property to us. If we continue to enter into such transactions in order to induce the contributors of such properties to accept units of our operating partnership rather than cash in exchange for their properties, it may be necessary for us to provide additional incentives. For instance, our operating partnership s limited partnership agreement provides that any holder of units may exchange limited partnership units on a one-for-one basis for, at our option, cash equal to the value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock. We may, however, enter into additional contractual arrangements with contributors of property under which we would agree to repurchase a contributor s units for shares of our common stock or cash, at the option of the contributor, at set times. If the contributor required us to repurchase units for cash pursuant to such a provision, it would limit our liquidity and, thus, our ability to use cash to make other investments, satisfy other obligations or make distributions to stockholders. Moreover, if we were required to repurchase units for cash at a time when we did not have sufficient cash to fund the repurchase, we might be required to sell one or more of our properties to raise funds to satisfy this obligation. Furthermore, we might agree that if distributions the contributor received as a limited partner in our operating partnership did not provide the contributor with an established return level, then upon redemption of the contributor s units we would pay the contributor an additional amount necessary to achieve that return. Such a provision could further negatively impact our liquidity and flexibility. Finally, in order to allow a contributor of a property to defer taxable gain on the contribution of property to our operating partnership, we might agree not to sell a contributed property for a defined period of time or until the contributor exchanged the contributor s units for cash or shares. Such an agreement would prevent us from selling those properties, even if market conditions would allow such a sale to be favorable to us. 
 Our Board of Directors may change our investment objectives and major strategies and take other actions without seeking stockholder approval. 
 Our Board of Directors determines our investment objectives and major strategies, including our strategies regarding investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these and other strategies without a vote of the stockholders. Under our charter and Maryland law, our stockholders will have a right to vote only on the following matters: 
 the election or removal of directors; 
 our dissolution; 
 certain mergers, consolidations, conversions, statutory share exchanges and sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all of our assets; and 
 amendments of our charter, except that our Board of Directors may amend our charter without stockholder approval to change our name or the name or other designation or the par value of any class or series of our stock and the aggregate par value of our stock, increase or decrease the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of our shares of any class or series that we have the authority to issue or effect certain reverse stock splits. 
 As a result, our stockholders will not have a right to approve most actions taken by our Board of Directors. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law could delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL applicable to us may have the effect of inhibiting or deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of delaying or preventing a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including: 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 provisions under Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL that permit our Board of Directors, without our stockholders approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses; 
 business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations, asset transfers and equity security issuances or reclassifications between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter may impose supermajority voting requirements unless certain minimum price conditions are satisfied; and 
 control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of HTA (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 
 Pursuant to a resolution adopted by our Board of Directors, we are prohibited from classifying the Board under Subtitle 8 unless stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors approve a proposal to repeal such resolution by the affirmative of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. In the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL, our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution providing that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from this statute, provided that such business combination is first approved by our Board. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we have opted out of these provisions pursuant to a provision in our bylaws. We may, however, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL. We may also choose to adopt other takeover defenses in the future. Any such actions could deter a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders. 
 Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate and Other Real Estate Related Assets 
 We are dependent on the financial stability of our tenants. 
 Lease payment defaults by our tenants would cause us to lose the revenue associated with such leases. Although 60 of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants (or their parent companies) that have a credit rating, a tenants credit rating (or its parents credit rating) is no guarantee of a tenant s ability to perform its lease obligations and a parent company may choose not to satisfy the obligations of a subsidiary that fails to perform its obligations. If the property is subject to a mortgage, a default by a significant tenant on its lease payments to us may result in a foreclosure on the property if we are unable to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments. In the event of a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and we may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property, and we may not be able to re-lease the property for the rent previously received, if at all. Lease terminations and expirations could also reduce the value of our properties. 
 We face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants. 
 We are exposed to the risk that our tenants could become bankrupt or insolvent. This risk would be magnified to the extent that a tenant leased space from us in multiple facilities. The bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. For example, a debtor-tenant may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. In such a case, our claim against the debtor-tenant for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This statutory cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the lease, and it is quite likely that any claim we might have against the tenant for unpaid rent would not be paid in full. In addition, a debtor-tenant may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. If such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to our rights and remedies as a landlord, would generally be more limited.

 Our tenant base may not remain stable or could become more concentrated which could harm our operating results and financial condition. 
 Our tenant base may not remain stable or could become more concentrated among particular physicians and physician groups with varying practices and other medical service providers in the future. Subject to the terms of the applicable leases, our tenants could decide to leave our properties for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, financial stress or changes in the tenant s ownership or management. Our tenants service the healthcare industry and our tenant mix could become even more concentrated if a preponderance of our tenants practice in a particular medical field or are reliant upon a particular healthcare system. If any of our tenants become financially unstable, our operating results and prospects could suffer, particularly if our tenants become more concentrated. 
 Our MOBs, developments, redevelopments, and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry and our tenants may be subject to competition. 
 Our MOBs, developments, redevelopments, and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry often face competition from nearby hospitals, developers, and other MOBs that provide comparable services. Some of those competing facilities are owned by governmental agencies and supported by tax revenues, while others are owned by nonprofit corporations and may be supported to a large extent by endowments and charitable contributions. These types of financial support are not available to buildings we own or develop. 
 Similarly, our tenants face competition from other medical practices in nearby hospitals and other medical facilities. Further, referral sources, including physicians and managed care organizations, may change their lists of hospitals or physicians to which they refer patients. Competition and loss of referrals could adversely affect our tenants ability to make rental payments, which could adversely affect our rental revenues. Any reduction in rental revenues resulting from the inability of our MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry and our tenants to compete successfully may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 The hospitals on whose campuses our MOBs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our MOBs and our other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. 
 Our MOB operations and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry depend on the viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our MOBs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcare-related users. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. If a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our MOBs is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related users. Because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our MOBs, their inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could adversely affect our MOB operations and have an adverse effect on us. 
 The unique nature of certain of our properties, including our senior healthcare properties, may make it difficult to lease or transfer our property or find replacement tenants, which could require us to spend considerable capital to adapt the property to an alternative use or otherwise negatively affect our performance. 
 Some of the properties we own or may seek to acquire are specialized medical facilities or otherwise designed or built for a particular tenant of a specific type of use known as a single use facility. For example, senior healthcare facilities present unique challenges with respect to leasing and transfer. Skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily modified to accommodate non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and oftentimes operator-specific. As a result, these property types may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants or other healthcare tenants with unique needs without significant expenditures or renovations. A new or replacement tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that tenant s particular operations.

Table of Contents 

 If we or our tenants terminate or do not renew the leases for our properties or our tenants lose their regulatory authority to operate such properties or default on their lease obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to locate, or may incur additional costs to locate, suitable replacement tenants to lease the properties for their specialized uses. Alternatively, we may be required to spend substantial amounts to modify a property for a new tenant, or for multiple tenants with varying infrastructure requirements, before we are able to re-lease the space or we could otherwise incur re-leasing costs. Furthermore, because transfers of healthcare facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of properties, there may be significant delays in transferring operations of senior healthcare facilities to successor operators. Any loss of revenues or additional capital expenditures required as a result may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather. 
 We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. For example, many of our properties are located along the east coast of the U.S. and in Texas. To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties, tenant disruption or displacement, delays in construction, resulting in increased construction costs, or in our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, by increasing the cost of energy, maintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. 
 
 Although Congress has not yet enacted comprehensive federal legislation to address climate change, numerous states and municipalities have adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. Changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties (for example, to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to severe weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income. There can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business. 
 Uninsured losses relating to real estate and lender requirements to obtain insurance may reduce stockholder returns. 
 There are types of losses relating to real estate, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, for which we do not intend to obtain insurance unless we are required to do so by mortgage lenders. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss. In addition, other than any reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for uninsured losses, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in less cash to be distributed to our stockholders. In cases where we are required by mortgage lenders to obtain casualty loss insurance for catastrophic events or terrorism, such insurance may not be available, or may not be available at a reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. Additionally, if we obtain such insurance, the costs associated with owning a property would increase and could have an adverse effect on the net income from the property and, thus, the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 We may fail to successfully operate acquired properties. 
 Our ability to successfully operate any properties is subject to the following risks: 
 we may acquire properties that are not initially accretive to our results upon acquisition and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations; 
 we may spend more than amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties; 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; 
 market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 we may acquire properties subject to liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse to third-parties, with respect to unknown liabilities for the clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants or other persons dealing with former owners of the properties, liabilities, claims, and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisitions, claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties, and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisitions. 
 If we are unable to successfully operate acquired properties, our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock, cash flow and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if our revenue does not increase, which could cause our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 Factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time, the need periodically to repair, renovate and re-let space, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. If our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The expenses of owning and operating MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, if our revenue declines, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Certain costs associated with real estate investments may not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. If one or more of our properties is mortgaged and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments, the lender could foreclose on the mortgage and take possession of the properties, resulting in a further reduction in our net income. 
 Increases in property taxes could adversely affect our cash flow. 
 Our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Some of our leases generally provide that the property taxes or increases therein are charged to the tenants as an expense related to the real properties that they occupy, while other leases provide that we are generally responsible for such taxes. We are also generally responsible for real property taxes related to any vacant space. In any case, as the owner of the properties, we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities. If real property taxes increase, our tenants may be unable to make the required tax payments, ultimately requiring us to pay the taxes even if the tenant is obligated to do so under the terms of the lease. If we fail to pay any such taxes, the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale. 
 Our ownership of certain MOB properties and other facilities are subject to ground leases or other similar agreements which limit our uses of these properties and may restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer such properties. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we held interests in certain MOB properties and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located and we may acquire additional properties in the future that are subject to ground leases or other similar agreements. As of December 31, 2020, these properties represented 38 of our total GLA. Many of our ground leases and other similar agreements limit our uses of these properties and may restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer such properties without the ground landlord s consent, which may impair their value. 
 Our real estate development, redevelopment and construction platform is subject to risks that could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 A component of our current growth strategy is, when appropriate, to pursue accretive development and redevelopment projects. However, there are inherent risks associated with these development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 the development costs of a project may exceed budgeted amounts, causing the project to be unprofitable or to incur a loss; 
 we may encounter delays as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, material shortages, and regulatory requirements; 
 the time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be longer than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity; 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions as well as the aforementioned budget overages; 
 we may be unable to obtain favorable financing terms to fund our development projects; 
 financing arrangements may require certain milestones, covenants, and other contractual terms that may be violated if the performance of our development and redevelopment projects differs from our projected income; 
 demand from prospective tenants may be reduced due to competition from other developers; and 
 tenants who pre-lease a portion of our development projects may fail to occupy the property upon development completion. 
 Uncertain market conditions relating to the future disposition of properties or other real estate related assets could cause us to sell our properties or real estate assets on unfavorable terms or at a loss in the future. 
 We intend to hold our various real estate investments until such time as we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Board of Directors may exercise their discretion as to whether and when to sell a property and we will have no obligation to sell properties at any particular time. Our Board of Directors may also choose to effect a liquidity event in which we liquidate our investments in other real estate related assets. We generally intend to hold properties for an extended period of time and our mortgage investments until maturity, and we cannot predict with certainty the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future. Because of the uncertainty of market conditions that may affect the future disposition of our properties, we may not be able to sell our properties at a profit in the future or at all, and we may incur prepayment penalties in the event we sell a property subject to a mortgage earlier than we otherwise had planned. Additionally, if we liquidate our mortgage investments prior to their maturity, we may be forced to sell those investments on unfavorable terms or at a loss. For instance, if we are required to liquidate mortgage loans at a time when prevailing interest rates are higher than the interest rates of such mortgage loans, we would likely sell such loans at a discount to their stated principal values. Any inability to sell a property or liquidation of a mortgage investment prior to maturity could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation, the market price of our common stock and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 The mortgage or other real estate-related loans in which we have in the past, and may in the future, invest may be impacted by unfavorable real estate market conditions and delays in liquidation, which could decrease their value. 
 If we make additional investments in notes secured by real estate or other collateral, we will be at risk of loss on those investments, including losses as a result of borrower defaults on mortgage loans. These losses may be caused by many conditions beyond our control, including economic conditions affecting real estate values, tenant defaults and lease expirations, interest rate levels and the other economic and liability risks associated with real estate as described elsewhere under this heading. Furthermore, if there are borrower defaults under our mortgage loan investments, we may not be able to foreclose on, or obtain a suitable remedy with respect to, such investments. Specifically, we may not be able to repossess and sell the properties under our mortgage loans quickly, which could reduce the value of our investment. For example, an action to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loan is regulated by state statutes and rules and is subject to many of the delays and expenses of lawsuits if the defendant raises defenses or counterclaims. In the event of a borrower default, these restrictions, among other things, may impede our ability to foreclose on or sell the mortgaged property or to obtain proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts due to us on the mortgage loan. Additionally, if we acquire property by foreclosure following a borrower default under our mortgage loan investments, we will have the economic and liability risks as the owner described above. Thus, we do not know whether the values of the property securing any of our investments in real estate related assets will remain at the levels existing on the dates we initially make the related investment. If the values of the underlying properties decline, our risk will increase and the value of our interests may decrease. 
 Lease rates under our long-term leases may be lower than fair market lease rates over time. 
 We have entered into and may in the future enter into long-term leases with tenants at certain of our properties. Certain of our long-term leases provide for rent to increase over time. However, if we do not accurately judge the potential for future increases in market rental rates, we may set the terms of these long-term leases at levels such that even after contractual rental increases, the rent under our long-term leases is less than then-current market rental rates. Further, we may have no ability to terminate those leases or to adjust the rent to then-prevailing market rates. As a result, our income and distributions could be lower than if we did not enter into long-term leases. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Rents associated with new leases for properties in our portfolio may be less than expiring rents (lease roll-down) on existing leases, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 Our operating results depend upon our ability to maintain and increase rental rates at our properties while also maintaining or increasing occupancy. The rental rates for expiring leases may be higher than starting rental rates for new leases and we may also be required to offer greater rental concessions than we have historically. The rental rate spread between expiring leases and new leases may vary both from property to property and among different leased spaces within a single property. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rental rates across our portfolio, our business, financial condition and results of operation, the market price of our common stock and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses. 
 Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain U.S. federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further renovations of the properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and/or an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or other related legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other related legislation, our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry 
 New laws or regulations affecting the heavily regulated healthcare industry, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us. 
 The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. Changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our tenants to make lease payments to us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Many of our medical properties and our tenants may require a license or multiple licenses or a CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license or a CON or loss of a required license or a CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the tenant. These events could adversely affect our tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition of new beds or services, or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction of facilities that serve the healthcare industry, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. State CON laws are not uniform throughout the U.S. and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of state CON laws on our facilities or the operations of our tenants. 
 In limited circumstances, loss of state licensure or certification or closure of a facility could ultimately result in the loss of authority to operate the facility and require a new CON authorization to re-institute operations. As a result, a portion of the value of the facility may be reduced, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Comprehensive healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions to stockholders. 
 In March 2010, then President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (the ACA ). The ACA, along with other healthcare reform efforts, has resulted in comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. through a phased approach, which began in 2010 and concluded in 2018. It remains difficult to predict the impact of these laws on us due to their complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, and the gradual implementation of the laws over a multi-year period. During the 2016 Presidential and Congressional campaigns, Republicans promised they would seek the repeal of the ACA. On January 20, 2017, then newly-sworn-in President Trump issued an executive order aimed at seeking the prompt repeal of the ACA, and directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. In addition, there have been and continue to be numerous Congressional attempts to amend and repeal the law. While no full repeal bills have passed both chambers of Congress, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the tax penalty associated with a key provision of the ACA known as the individual mandate beginning January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a Texas federal district court judge, in the case of Texas v. Azar, declared the ACA unconstitutional, reasoning that the individual mandate tax penalty was essential to and not severable from the remainder of the ACA. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA s individual mandate was unconstitutional but sent the case back to the 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 District Court for further analysis of whether the entire ACA is also rendered unconstitutional. In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President, and in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. As a result of these electoral developments, we believe it is unlikely that continued legislative efforts will be pursued to repeal the ACA. Instead, we believe it is possible that legislation will be pursued in order to enhance or reform the ACA. At this time, we are unable to state with certainty what the impact of any potential legislation may have on our business. Both we and our tenants may be adversely affected by new laws, or any modification and/or replacement of existing law. 
 Reductions in reimbursement from third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us. 
 Sources of revenue for our tenants may include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements and self-insured employers, among others. Changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could impact the revenue of our tenants. 
 The healthcare industry also faces various challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure on healthcare providers to control or reduce costs. A focus on controlling costs could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of some or all of our tenants. The financial impact on our tenants could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Government budget deficits could lead to a reduction in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, which could adversely affect the financial condition of our tenants. 
 Adverse U.S. economic conditions have negatively affected state budgets, which may put pressure on states to decrease reimbursement rates with the goal of decreasing state expenditures under state Medicaid programs. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in state Medicaid programs due to unemployment, declines in family incomes and eligibility expansions required by the recently enacted healthcare reform law. These potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost-cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement rates under both the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs. Potential reductions in reimbursements under these programs could negatively impact the ability of our tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Some tenants at our MOBs and our other facilities that serve the healthcare industry are subject to fraud and abuse laws, the violation of which by a tenant may jeopardize the tenant s ability to make rent payments to us. 
 As described in the Item 1 - Business, there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are in a position to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of their business, our tenants may be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies as well as whistleblower suits under the False Claims Act from private individuals. An investigation by a federal or state governmental agency for violation of fraud and abuse laws, a whistleblower suit, or the imposition of criminal/civil penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize that tenant s ability to operate or to make rent payments. In turn, this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Risks Related to Debt Financing 
 We have and intend to incur indebtedness, which may increase our business risks, could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of our Company. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had total debt outstanding of 3.0 billion. We intend to continue to finance a portion of the purchase price of our investments in real estate and other real estate related assets by borrowing funds. In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge some or all of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties or for working capital. We may also borrow funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our annual ordinary taxable income to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have historically maintained a low leveraged balance sheet and intend to continue to maintain this structure over the long term. However, our total leverage may fluctuate on a short term basis as we execute our business strategy. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 High debt levels will cause us to incur higher interest charges, which would result in higher debt service payments and could be accompanied by restrictive covenants. If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on that property, then the amount available for distributions to our stockholders may be reduced. In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions. In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of the Company. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties will be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we will recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but we would not receive any cash proceeds related thereto. We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to our affiliated entities that own our properties. When we give a guaranty on behalf of an affiliated entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by our affiliated entity. If any mortgage contains cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default by us on a single property could affect multiple properties. If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default by us, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. 
 We expect current and future borrowings under our unsecured term loans, which are hedged, and our unsecured revolving credit facility to be based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices with support lasting through 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or hedge transactions extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. 
 Covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach could adversely affect our operations. 
 The terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants. These provisions include, among other things: a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness; limitations on mergers; investments; acquisitions; redemptions of capital stock; transactions with affiliates; and maintenance of specified financial ratios. Our continued ability to incur debt and operate our business is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults by us under applicable debt instruments, even if payment obligations are satisfied. Financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants in our debt instruments, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market price of our securities, including our common stock. 
 Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and, in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive for us to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences for us under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.

 Risks Related to Joint Ventures 
 The terms of joint venture agreements or other joint ownership arrangements into which we have entered and may enter could impair our cash flow, our operating flexibility and our results of operations. 
 In connection with the purchase of real estate, we have entered and may continue to enter into joint ventures with third parties. We may also purchase or develop properties in co-ownership arrangements with the sellers of the properties, developers or other persons. Our joint venture partners may also have rights to take actions over which we have no control and may take actions contrary to our interests. Joint ownership of an investment in real estate may involve risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate, including the following: 
 a venture partner may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals, including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in a joint venture or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the venture; 
 a venture partner might become bankrupt and such proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; 
 a venture partner s actions might have the result of subjecting the property to liabilities in excess of those contemplated; and 
 a venture partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives, including our policy with respect to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. 
 Under certain joint venture arrangements, neither venture partner may have the power to control the venture and, thus, an impasse could occur, which might adversely affect the joint venture and decrease potential returns to our stockholders. If we have a right of first refusal or buy/sell right to buy-out a venture partner, we may be unable to finance such a buy-out or we may be forced to exercise those rights at a time when it would not otherwise be in our best interest to do so. If our interest is subject to a buy/sell right in favor of us, we may not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources to allow us to purchase an interest of a venture partner subject to the buy/sell right, in which case we may be forced to sell our interest when we would otherwise prefer to retain our interest. In addition, we may not be able to sell our interest in a joint venture on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if we desire to exit the venture for any reason, particularly if our interest is subject to a right of first refusal in favor of our venture partner. 
 Federal Income Tax Risks 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes would subject us to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, which would substantially reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2007 and we believe that our current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements to be taxed as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet various requirements set forth in the Code concerning, among other things, the ownership of our outstanding common stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our stockholders. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so as to qualify as a REIT. At any time, new laws, interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws relating to, or the federal income tax consequences of, qualification as a REIT. It is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election, which it may do without stockholder approval. 
 If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. We could also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes. Losing our qualification as a REIT would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders due to the additional tax liability and we would no longer be required to make distributions. To the extent that distributions had been made in anticipation of our qualifying as a REIT, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable corporate income tax. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification as a REIT. 
 As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would substantially reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 To continue to qualify as a REIT and to avoid the payment of U.S. federal income and excise taxes, we may be forced to borrow funds, use proceeds from the issuance of securities or sell assets to pay distributions, which may result in our distributing amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. 
 To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs, we normally will be required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of: (a) 85 of our ordinary income; (b) 95 of our capital gain net income; and (c) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. These requirements could cause us to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, or we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These requirements could additionally cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on acquisitions of properties and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, use proceeds from the issuance of securities or sell assets in order to distribute enough of our taxable income to maintain our qualification as a REIT and to avoid the payment of federal income and excise taxes. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 To preserve our qualification as a REIT, our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of HTA or other transaction that may be benefit our stockholders. 
 To assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT, among other purposes, our charter contains a limitation on ownership that prohibits any individual, entity or group, unless exempted prospectively or retroactively by our Board of Directors, from directly acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 9.8 of the value of HTA s then outstanding capital stock (which includes common stock and any preferred stock HTA may issue) or more than 9.8 of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of HTA s then outstanding common stock. 
 Any attempted transfer of HTA s stock which, if effective, would result in HTA s stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be null and void. Any attempted transfer of HTA s stock which, if effective, would result in violation of the ownership limits discussed above or in HTA being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT, will cause the number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries and the proposed transferee will not acquire any rights in the shares. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 The price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for you to sell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. 
 The price of our common stock on the NYSE constantly changes and has been subject to significant price fluctuations. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include: 
 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; 
 changes in our earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry, although no assurance can be given that any research reports about us will be published; 
 future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our existing or future stockholders; 
 increases in market interest rates, which may lead purchasers of our stock to demand a higher yield; 
 changes in market valuations of similar companies; 
 adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future; 
 additions or departures of key personnel; 
 actions by institutional stockholders; 
 speculation in the press or investment community; and 
 general market and economic conditions. 
 In addition, the stock market in general may experience extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 Future offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock, or equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 In the future, we may issue debt or equity securities, including medium term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred or common stock. Debt securities or shares of preferred stock will generally be entitled to receive dividends, both current and in connection with any liquidation or sale, prior to the holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors may issue such securities without stockholder approval and under Maryland law may amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of capital stock or the number of authorized shares of capital stock of any class or series without stockholder approval. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or equity securities to existing common stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, offerings of our common stock or other equity securities may dilute the percentage ownership interest of our existing stockholders. To the extent we issue additional equity interests, our stockholders percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted. Depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings and the value of our real properties and other real estate related assets, our stockholders may also experience dilution in both the book value and fair market value of their shares. As a result, future offerings of debt or equity securities, or the perception that such offerings may occur, may reduce the market price of our common stock and/or the dividends that we pay with respect to our common stock. 
 Our dividends to stockholders may change, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 All dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our actual and projected financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and funds from operations, maintenance of our REIT qualification, applicable law and such other matters as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make dividends in the future or may need to fund such dividends from external sources, as to which no assurances can be given. In addition, we may choose to retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, and these retained funds, although increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock. Our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. 
 One of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock will be the dividend distribution rate on our common stock (as a percentage of the price of our common stock) relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates rise, prospective purchasers of common stock may expect a higher dividend distribution rate. Higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds being available for dividends and, in fact, would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease our funds available for dividends. We therefore may not be able, or we may not choose, to provide a higher dividend distribution rate. As a result, prospective purchasers may decide to purchase other securities rather than our common stock, which would reduce the demand for, and result in a decline in the market price of, our common stock. 
 If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock or the healthcare-related real estate sector, the price of our common stock could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock will rely in part upon the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We have no control over these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company, we could lose attention in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 Risks Related to Forward Sale Agreements 
 Settlement provisions contained in a forward sale agreement could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations. 
 If we enter into one or more forward sale agreements, the relevant forward purchaser will have the right to accelerate that particular forward sale agreement (with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under that particular forward sale agreement that the relevant forward purchaser determines is affected by such event) and require us to settle on a date specified by the relevant forward purchaser if: 
 the relevant forward purchaser is unable to, or would incur a materially increased cost to, establish, maintain or unwind its hedge position with respect to that particular forward sale agreement; 
 the relevant forward purchaser determines that it is unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts, to continue to borrow an amount of common stock equal to the amount of common stock underlying that particular forward sale agreement or that, with respect to borrowing such amount of common stock, it would incur a cost that is greater than the initial stock borrow cost specified in that particular forward sale agreement, subject to a prior notice requirement;

Table of Contents 

 a termination event occurs as a result of us declaring a dividend or distribution on our common stock with a cash value in excess of a specified amount per calendar quarter, or with an ex-dividend date prior to the anticipated ex-dividend date for such cash dividend; 
 an extraordinary event (as such term is defined in that particular forward sale agreement and which includes certain mergers and tender offers and the delisting of our common stock) occurs or our Board of Directors votes to approve or there is a public announcement of, in either case, any action that, if consummated, would constitute such an extraordinary event; or 
 certain other events of default, termination events or other specified events occur, including, among other things, any material misrepresentation made by us in connection with entering into that particular forward sale agreement, or a nationalization, a bankruptcy termination event or a change in law (as such terms are defined in that particular forward sale agreement). 
 A forward purchaser s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be made irrespective of our need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver common stock under the physical settlement provisions of that particular forward sale agreement or, if we so elect and the forward purchaser so permits our election, net share settlement provisions of that particular forward sale agreement irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. 
 We expect that settlement of any forward sale agreement will generally occur no later than the date specified in the particular forward sale agreement, which will be no later than twelve months following the trade date of that forward sale agreement. However, any forward sale agreement may be settled earlier than that specified date in whole or in part at our option. We expect that each forward sale agreement will be physically settled by delivery of our common stock unless we elect to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sale agreement. Upon physical settlement or, if we so elect, net share settlement of a particular forward sale agreement, delivery of shares of our common stock in connection with such physical settlement or, to the extent we are obligated to deliver common stock, net share settlement, will result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. If we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of our common stock underlying a particular forward sale agreement, we expect that the relevant forward purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) will purchase a number of common stock necessary to satisfy its or its affiliate s obligation to return the common stock borrowed from third parties in connection with sales of common stock under that forward sale agreement, adjusted in the case of net share settlement by any shares deliverable by or to us under the forward sale agreement. In addition, the purchase of common stock in connection with the relevant forward purchaser or its affiliate unwinding its hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase over such time (or prevent a decrease over such time), thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to the relevant forward purchaser (or decreasing the amount of cash that the relevant forward purchaser would owe us) upon a cash settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement or increasing the number of common stock we would deliver to the relevant forward purchaser (or decreasing the number of common stock that the relevant forward purchaser would deliver to us) upon net share settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement. 
 The forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on our common stock during the term of the particular forward sale agreement. If the specified daily rate is less than the spread on any day, the interest factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price. If the market value of our common stock, determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant forward sale agreement, during the relevant valuation period under the particular forward sale agreement is above the applicable forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would pay the relevant forward purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference or, in the case of net share settlement, we would deliver to the relevant forward purchaser a number of common stock having a value, determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant forward sale agreement, equal to the difference. Thus, we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement of a particular forward sale agreement. If the market value of our common stock, determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant forward sale agreement, during the relevant valuation period under that particular forward sale agreement is below the applicable forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would be paid the difference in cash by the relevant forward purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement or, in the case of net share settlement, we would receive from the relevant forward purchaser a number of common stock having a value equal to the difference.

 The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements. 
 In the event that we elect to settle any forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price, we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the relevant forward purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), generally, no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares, including pursuant to a securities futures contract, as defined in the Code by reference to the Exchange Act. Although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our common stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a securities futures contract, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain. In the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In that case, we may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of our REIT status. Even if the relief provisions apply, we will be subject to a 100 tax on the greater of (i) the excess of 75 of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such income attributable to sources that qualify under the 75 test or (ii) the excess of 95 of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such gross income attributable to sources that qualify under the 95 test as multiplied in either case by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, we could lose our REIT status under the Code. 
 In case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreements will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of our common stock. 
 If we file for or consent to a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors rights, or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our winding-up or liquidation, and we consent to such a petition, any forward sale agreements that are then in effect will automatically terminate. If any such forward sale agreement so terminates under these circumstances, we would not be obligated to deliver to the relevant forward purchaser any of our common stock not previously delivered, and the relevant forward purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the applicable forward sale price per share in respect of any of our common stock not previously settled under the applicable forward sale agreement. Therefore, to the extent that there are any of our common stock with respect to which any forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, we would not receive the relevant forward sale price per share in respect of those common stock.

Item 2. Properties 
 Since inception, we have invested 7.5 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets that serve the healthcare industry through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of approximately 25.4 million square feet of GLA, with a leased rate of 89.8 (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced). Approximately 67 of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. Our portfolio is diversified geographically across 32 states, with no state having more than 20 of the total GLA as of December 31, 2020. All but two of our properties are 100 owned. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned fee simple interests in properties representing 62 of our total GLA. We hold long-term leasehold interests in the remaining properties in our portfolio, representing 38 of our total GLA. As of December 31, 2020, these leasehold interests had an average remaining term of 46.8 years, excluding available extension options. 
 The following information generally applies to our properties: 
 we believe all of our properties are adequately covered by insurance and are suitable for their intended purposes; 
 our properties are located in markets where we are subject to competition in attracting new tenants and retaining current tenants; and 
 depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings, up to 39 years, and over the shorter of the lease term or useful lives of the tenant improvements.

 Executive Summary 
 We are the largest publicly-traded REIT focused on MOBs in the U.S. as measured by the GLA of our MOBs. We conduct substantially all of our operations through HTALP. We invest in MOBs that we believe will serve the future of healthcare delivery and MOBs that are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations. We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow. In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing, building services and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions and developments of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage. Additionally, from time to time we consider, on an opportunistic basis, significant portfolio acquisitions that we believe fit our core business and could enhance our existing portfolio. 
 Since 2006, we have invested 7.5 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets consisting of approximately 25.4 million square feet of GLA throughout the U.S. Approximately 67 of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. Our portfolio is diversified geographically across 32 states, with no state having more than 20 of our total GLA as of December 31, 2020. We are concentrated in 20 to 25 key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in ten of our top 20 key markets and approximately 94 of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Hartford/New Haven being our largest markets by investment.

 Key Market Focused Strategy and Investments 
 We believe we have been one of the most active investors in the medical office sector over the last decade. This has enabled us to create a high quality portfolio focused on MOBs serving the future of healthcare with scale and significance in 20 to 25 key markets. 
 Our investment strategy includes alignment with key healthcare systems, hospitals, and leading academic medical universities. We are the largest owner of on-campus or adjacent MOBs in the country, with approximately 17.0 million square feet of GLA, or 67 of our portfolio, located in these locations. The remaining 33 of our portfolio is located in core community outpatient locations where healthcare is increasingly being delivered. 
 Over the last several years, our investments have been focused in our 20 to 25 key markets which we believe will outperform the broader U.S. from an economic and demographic perspective. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 94 of our portfolio s GLA is located in the top 75 MSAs. Our key markets represent top MSAs with strong growth metrics in jobs, household income and population, as well as low unemployment and mature healthcare infrastructures. Many of our key markets are also supported by strong university systems. 
 Our key market focus has enabled us to establish scale and effectively utilize our asset management and leasing platform to deliver consistent same store growth and additional yield on investments, and also cost effective service to tenants. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in ten of our top 20 key markets and approximately 0.5 million square feet of GLA in 17 of our top 20 key markets. We expect to establish this scale across 20 to 25 key markets as our portfolio expands. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, HTA closed on approximately 191.7 million of investments totaling approximately 600,000 square feet of GLA, with expected year-one contractual MOB yields of approximately 6.0 . These properties were approximately 94 leased as of closing, and are located within HTA's key markets. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the disposition of one MOB located in Kansas City for an aggregate gross sales price of 16.8 million, representing approximately 69,000 square feet of GLA, and generating net gains of approximately 7.6 million. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold part of our interest in undeveloped land in Miami, Florida for a gross sales price of 7.6 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately 2.0 million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the initial development started by HTA. This 127,000 SF Class A MOB development in Raleigh, North Carolina is currently 77 leased. HTA continued to develop three new on-campus MOBs located in the key markets of Miami, Florida; Bakersfield, California; and Dallas, Texas. In total, HTA has development projects in process of approximately 110 million, totaling approximately 244,000 square feet of GLA, and that are expected to be more than 79 pre-leased upon completion. Additionally, during 2020, HTA continued to redevelop two MOBs located in Los Angeles, California with estimated costs of approximately 20 million and totaling approximately 105,000 square feet of GLA. 
 Internal Growth through Proactive In-House Property Management and Leasing 
 We believe we have the largest full-service operating platform in the medical office sector that consists of our in-house property management and leasing functions which allows us to better manage and service our existing portfolio. In each of these markets, we have established a strong in-house asset management and leasing platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities, and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities. Our full-service operating platform has also enabled us to focus on generating cost efficiencies as we gain scale across individual markets and regions. 
 As of December 31, 2020, our in-house asset management and leasing platform operated approximately 24.6 million square feet of GLA, or 97 of our total portfolio, a significant increase from 8.8 million square feet, or 70 , of GLA managed in-house in 2012. 
 As of December 31, 2020, our leased rate (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) was 89.8 by GLA, and our occupancy rate was 89.1 by GLA. 
 We entered into new and renewal leases on approximately 3.9 million square feet of GLA, or 15.2 of the GLA of our total portfolio, during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was 87 , which included approximately 3.8 million square feet of GLA of expiring leases, which we believe is indicative of our commitment to maintaining buildings in desirable locations and fostering strong tenant relationships. Tenant retention is defined as the sum of the total leased GLA of tenants that renewed a lease during the period over the total GLA of leases that renewed or expired during the period.

 Financial Strategy and Balance Sheet Flexibility 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had total leverage, measured by debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, of 32.3 . Total liquidity was 1.4 billion, inclusive of 1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility, 277.5 million of forward equity agreements, and cash and cash equivalents of 115.4 million as of December 31, 2020. 
 As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 7.2 years. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid down approximately 114.1 million of outstanding secured mortgage loans, resulting in our elimination of any secured borrowings. Although not anticipated, we may finance transactions with secured borrowings or acquire buildings and assume debt if required or economically beneficial. 
 In September 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to purchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock from time to time prior to the expiration thereof on September 23, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining amount of common stock available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan was 300.0 million. 
 In November 2019, we refreshed our at the market ("ATM") offering program of common stock for an additional aggregate sales amount of up to 750.0 million. This program remains active as of December 31, 2020. Upon expiration, it is our intention to refresh the existing ATM program or establish a new ATM offering program. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock under our ATM program for net proceeds of approximately 50.0 million, adjusted for costs to borrow equating to a net price to us of 29.86 per share of common stock. Additionally, we have four outstanding forward sale arrangements pursuant to forward equity agreements, with anticipated net proceeds of 277.5 million, and with an average share price of 29.46, subject to adjustments as provided in the forward equity agreements. All four of these forward sale arrangements mature in accordance with their applicable contract terms by the middle of 2021, however, the agreements provide for mechanisms to extend settlement upon mutual agreement by us and the counterparty/distribution agent. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting principles, including making estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical as they may require more complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For further information on significant accounting policies that impact us, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities in which we own a majority interest with the ability control operations. We consolidate variable interest entities VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, our form or ownership interest, our representation on the entity s governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Rental revenue is our primary source of revenue. At the inception of a new lease we assess the terms and conditions to determine proper classification. If the estimates utilized by us in our assessment were different, then our lease classification for 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 accounting purposes may have been different, which could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. We recognize rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the revenue recognition process is based on a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For more detailed information on Topic 606, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15. 
 Leases 
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, codified as ASC 842 - Leases (Topic 842). This new standard superseded ASC Topic 840 and states that companies will be required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand the nature of the entity s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. 
 As a lessor, we lease space in our MOBs primarily to medical enterprises. The assets underlying these leases consist of buildings and associated land which are included as real estate investments on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All of our leases for which we are the lessor are classified as operating leases under Topic 842. 
 Leases, for which we are the lessee, are classified as separate components on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Operating leases are included as right-of-use ROU assets - operating leases, net, with a corresponding lease liability - operating leases. Financing leases are included in receivables and other assets, net with a corresponding lease liability in security deposits, prepaid rent and other liabilities. A lease liability is recognized for our obligation related to the lease and an ROU asset represents our right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. For more detailed information on Topic 842, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15. 
 Investments in Real Estate 
 With the adoption of ASU 2017-01 in January 2017, the majority of our investments in real estate investments have been accounted for as asset acquisitions and we record the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land and buildings and improvements. Additionally, the purchase price includes acquisition related expenses, above or below market leases, above or below market leasehold interests, in place leases, tenant relationships, above or below market debt assumed, interest rate swaps assumed and any contingent consideration recorded when the contingency is resolved. The determination of the fair value requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. 
 The fair value of the land and buildings and improvements is based upon our determination of the value of the property as if it were to be replaced or as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by market participants. Factors considered by us include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. 
 The value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. The factors considered include estimated lease-up periods, market rent and other market conditions. 
 We analyze the acquired leases to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leases is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. 
 We analyze the acquired leasehold interests to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leasehold interests is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. 
 We record debt or interest rate swaps assumed at fair value. The amount of above or below market debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage. The value of interest rate swaps is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows, taking into account interest rate curves and the period to maturity. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 We are required to make certain estimates in order to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business investment. Our assumptions directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation and amortization lives. In addition, the amortization and depreciation of these assets and liabilities are recorded in different line items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
 Recoverability of Real Estate Investments 
 Real estate investments are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset over the remaining expected holding period. We would recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount is not recoverable to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. The fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analyses. In performing the analysis we utilize a variety of methodologies, including undiscounted cash flow models for certain properties that meet quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds. Our methodology contemplates in-place cash flows from existing tenants, with certain assumptions for future anticipated occupancy levels, lease-up and absorption periods after known or estimated vacating tenants, inflationary adjustments for rents and operating expenses, market lease assumptions based on in-place rents and comparative properties' rates, ordinary tenant concessions, such as free rent, and planned tenant improvement and maintenance or other capital expenditures, as well as other initial direct costs, such as leasing commissions paid to third-parties. We also utilize capitalization rates to arrive at a final value of our property, less estimated selling costs. Further, we also will consider executed sales agreements or management s best estimate of market comparables in arriving at our total undiscounted cash flows. 
 Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements. 
 Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 
 The economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for new strains of SARS-CoV-2 or entirely new types of viruses and/or global propagation of communicable disease continue to present risks to the Company and the future results of our operations. Should current and planned measures, including further development and delivery of vaccines and other measures intended to reduce or eliminate the spread of COVID-19, past and/or proposed economic stimulus, and other laws, acts and orders proposed or enacted by federal, state and local agencies or foreign governments, ultimately not be successful or limited in their efficacy, our business and the broader real estate industry may experience significant adverse consequences. These consequences include loss of revenues, increased expenses, difficulty in maintaining an active workforce, and constraints on our ability to secure capital or financing, among other factors. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors for a comprehensive summary of these and other risks associated with pandemics and other health concerns. 
 We are not aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and the risk factors previously listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the investment, management and operation of our properties. 
 
 Rental Income 
 The amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that will become available from tenant vacancies or unscheduled lease terminations at the then applicable rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. 
 
 Investment Activity 
 During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of 191.7 million, 560.5 million and 17.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had dispositions with an aggregate gross sales price of 24.3 million, 4.9 million and 308.6 million, respectively. The amount of any future acquisitions or dispositions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.

 Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 New leases 7.6 7.3 Renewal leases 5.3 7.2 
 Rental Expenses 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, rental expenses attributable to our properties were 226.9 million and 211.5 million, respectively. The increase in rental expenses is primarily due to 15.2 million of additional rental expenses associated with our 2019 and 2020 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 general and administrative expenses were 43.0 million and 41.4 million, respectively. These increases were primarily due to inflationary salary adjustments and normal annual vendor increases. General and administrative expenses include such costs as salaries, corporate overhead and professional fees, among other items. 
 Transaction Expenses 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, transaction expenses were 1.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to decreased acquisition activity in 2020 as compared to 2019. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, depreciation and amortization expense was 303.8 million and 290.4 million, respectively. These increases were associated with our 2019 and 2020 investments, partially offset by buildings we sold during 2019 and 2020. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates as compared to 2019 and the payoff of secured mortgage loans.

 To achieve our objectives, we borrow at both fixed and variable rates. From time to time, we also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 Gain (loss) on Sale of Real Estate 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, we realized a net gain of 9.6 million from the disposition of one MOB located in Kansas as well as the sale of part of our interest in undeveloped land in Miami, Florida. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we realized a net loss on the sale of real estate of 0.2 million from the disposition of four MOBs located in South Carolina and New Mexico. See Note 4 - Dispositions and Impairment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for more detail on the dispositions. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we realized a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of 27.7 million and 21.6 million, respectively, related to make-whole provisions in the redemption of senior unsecured notes. 
 Net Income 
 Net income increased 22.7 million to 53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily the result of continued new investment activity, growth in operations and improved operating efficiencies. 
 NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI 
 NOI increased 31.5 million to 512.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to 28.0 million of additional NOI from our 2019 and 2020 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Same-Property Cash NOI increased 7.2 million, or 1.6 , to 457.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 449.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were primarily the result of contractual rent escalations and improved operating efficiencies offset by a slight decrease in average occupancy. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 FFO and Normalized FFO 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the current standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to investments in real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Since FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, among other items, it provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders. 
 We also compute Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO: (i) transaction expenses; (ii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (iii) noncontrolling income or loss from OP Units included in diluted shares (only applicable to the Company); and (iv) other normalizing adjustments, which include items that are unusual and infrequent in nature. Our methodology for calculating Normalized FFO may be different from the methods utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 We present FFO and Normalized FFO because we consider them important supplemental measures of our operating performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen based on market conditions, many industry investors have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance, nor are they indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. FFO and Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. 
 In addition, the amounts included in the calculation of FFO and Normalized FFO are generally the same for HTALP and HTA, except for net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders, noncontrolling income or loss from OP Units included in diluted shares (only applicable to the Company) and the weighted average shares of our common stock or HTALP OP Units outstanding.

 NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI 
 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before: (i) general and administrative expenses; (ii) transaction expenses; (iii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) impairment; (v) interest expense; (vi) gain or loss on sales of real estate; (vii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (viii) income or loss from unconsolidated joint venture; and (ix) other income or expense. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of our properties. Additionally, we believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. 
 Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NO I: (i) straight-line rent adjustments; (ii) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests and other GAAP adjustments; (iii) notes receivable interest inc ome; and (iv) other normalizing adjustments. Contractual base rent, contractual rent increases, contractual rent concessions and changes in occupancy or lease rates upon commencement and expiration of leases are a primary driver of our revenue performance. We believe that Cash NOI, which removes the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, provides another measurement of the operating performance of our operating assets. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. 
 To facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, we calculate comparable amounts for a subset of our owned and operational properties referred to as Same-Property . Same-Property Cash NOI excludes (i) properties which have not been owned and operated by us during the entire span of all periods presented and disposed properties, (ii) our share of unconsolidated joint ventures, (iii) development, redevelopment and land parcels, (iv) properties intended for disposition in the near term which have (a) been approved by the Board of Directors, (b) is actively marketed for sale, and (c) an offer has been received at prices we would transact and the sales process is ongoing, and (v) certain non-routine items. Same-Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.

 (3) Same-Property includes 399 buildings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of cash include: (i) cash flow from operations; (ii) borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility; (iii) net proceeds from the issuances of debt and equity securities; and (iv) proceeds from our dispositions. During the next 12 months our primary uses of cash are expected to include: (a) the funding of acquisitions of MOBs, development properties and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry; (b) capital expenditures; (c) the payment of operating expenses; (d) debt service payments, including principal payments; and (e) the payment of dividends to our stockholders. We anticipate cash flow from operations, restricted cash and reserve accounts and our unsecured revolving credit facility, if needed, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders. Investments and maturing indebtedness may require funds from the issuance of debt and/or equity securities or proceeds from sales of real estate. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of 1.4 billion, including 1.0 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, 277.5 million of forward equity agreements, and 115.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
 In addition, we had unencumbered assets with a gross book value of 7.9 billion. The unencumbered properties may be used as collateral to secure additional financings in future periods or refinance our current debt as it becomes due. Our ability to raise funds from future debt and equity issuances is dependent on our investment grade credit ratings, general economic and market conditions and our operating performance.

 When we acquire a property, we prepare a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that our expenditures for capital improvements for 2021 will range from 85 million to 95 million depending on leasing activity. Although we cannot provide assurance that we will not exceed these estimated expenditure levels, our liquidity of 1.4 billion allows us the flexibility to fund such capital expenditures. 
 If we experience lower occupancy levels, reduced rental rates, reduced revenues as a result of asset sales, or increased capital expenditures and leasing costs compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewal leases, the effect would be a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities. If such a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities is realized, we may have a cash flow deficit in subsequent periods. Our estimate of net cash available is based on various assumptions which are difficult to predict, including the levels of our leasing activity and related leasing costs. Any changes in these assumptions could impact our financial results and our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs 
 Cash Flows 
 The following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, Current Year Change Prior Year Change 2020 2019 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash - beginning of year 37,616 133,530 118,560 (95,914) 14,970 Net cash provided by operating activities 387,962 340,394 337,396 47,568 2,998 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (319,260) (667,289) 176,309 348,029 (843,598) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 12,447 230,981 (498,735) (218,534) 729,716 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash - end of year 118,765 37,616 133,530 81,149 (95,914) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2020 primarily due to the impact of our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, contractual rent increases and improved operating efficiencies. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to increase as a result of the above items and continued leasing activity in our existing portfolio. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the investment in real estate of 185.3 million, capital expenditures of 74.7 million and development costs of 77.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of 22.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities primarily related to investments in real estate of 553.3 million, capital expenditures of 91.5 million and development costs of 28.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of 4.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from the sale of real estate of 305.1 million, which was partially offset by capital expenditures of 77.9 million and development of costs of 34.3 million. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from unsecured senior notes of 793.6 million and net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of 50.0 million, offset by payments on our unsecured senior notes of 300.0 million, dividends paid to holders of our common stock of 275.8 million, payments on our secured mortgage loans of 114.1 million, net payments under our revolving credit facility of 100.0 million, and the repurchase and cancellation of common stock of 5.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from unsecured senior notes of 906.9 million, net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of 323.4 million, and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 100.0 million which was partially offset by payments on our unsecured senior notes of 700.0 million, dividends paid to holders of our common stock of 256.1 million, payments on our secured mortgage loans of 97.4 million, and repurchase and cancellation of our common stock of 12.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities primarily related to dividends paid to holders of our common stock of 252.7 million, payments on our secured mortgage loans of 241.0 million, and the repurchases of our common stock of 70.3 million, which was partially offset by net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of 72.8 million. 
 Dividends 
 The amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders is determined by our Board of Directors, in their sole discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual dividend distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have paid monthly or quarterly dividends since February 2007, and if our investments produce sufficient cash flow, we expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders. Because our cash available for dividend distributions in any 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 year may be less than 90 of our taxable income for the year, we may obtain the necessary funds through borrowings, issuing new securities or selling assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy our dividend distribution requirement. Our organizational documents do not establish a limit on dividends that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. The dividend we pay to our stockholders is equal to the distributions received from HTALP in accordance with the terms of the HTALP partnership agreement. It is our intention to continue to pay dividends. However, our Board of Directors may reduce our dividend rate and we cannot guarantee the timing and amount of dividends that we may pay in the future, if any. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid cash dividends of 275.8 million on our common stock. In January 2021, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of 70.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
 Financing 
 We have historically maintained a low leveraged balance sheet and intend to continue to maintain this structure in the long term. However, our total leverage may fluctuate on a short-term basis as we execute our business strategy. As of December 31, 2020, our leverage ratio, measured by debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, was 32.3 . 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had debt outstanding of 3.0 billion and the weighted average interest rate therein was 2.89 per annum, inclusive of the impact of our cash flow hedges. The following is a summary of our unsecured and secured debt. See Note 8 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a further discussion of our debt. 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
 As of December 31, 2020, the full 1.0 billion was available on our 1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in June 2022. 
 Unsecured Term Loans 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 500.0 million of unsecured term loans outstanding, comprised of 300.0 million under our Unsecured Credit Agreement maturing in 2023, and 200.0 million under our unsecured term loan maturing in 2024. 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.55 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding, comprised of 600.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2026, 500.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2027, 650.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2030, and 800.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2031. 
 Fixed Rate Mortgages 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made payments on our fixed rate mortgages of 114.1 million and as of December 31, 2020, we had no fixed rate mortgages outstanding. 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 
 Debt Service Requirements 
 We are required by the terms of our applicable loan agreements to meet certain financial covenants, such as minimum net worth and liquidity, and reporting requirements, among others. As of December 31, 2020, we believe that we were in compliance with all such covenants and we are not aware of any covenants that it is reasonably likely that we would not be able to meet in accordance with our loan agreements.

Forward rates do not contemplate the transition of LIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate or other rate to be used in the calculation of interest amounts. Any differences between LIBOR and alternative rates are not deemed to be material. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than operating lease arrangements consisting primarily of ground leases which as of December 31, 2020 were not carried on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Inflation 
 We are exposed to inflation risk as income from future long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that protect us from the impact of normal inflation. These provisions include rent escalations, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of our leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to cover inflation. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we believe the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk. 
 We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt. Interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps. To the extent we enter into such derivative financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. It is our policy to enter into these transactions with what we believe are high quality counterparties, including those with whom we have a lending relationship. We believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non-performance is remote. We manage the market risk associated with interest rate swaps or caps by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 The table below presents, as of December 31, 2020, information about HTA's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied

 As of December 31, 2020, we had 3.1 billion of gross fixed and variable rate debt with interest rates ranging from 1.14 to 3.75 per annum and a weighted average interest rate of 2.69 per annum, excluding the impact of cash flow hedges. We had 2.6 billion (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.98 per annum and 500.0 million (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.23 per annum as of December 31, 2020, excluding the impact of cash flow hedges. 
 In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future properties is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Recoverability of Real Estate and Real Estate Related Assets - Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company s real estate investments are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset over the remaining expected holding period. The Company's undiscounted future cash flows analysis and the assessment of expected remaining holding period requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future occupancy levels, rental rates, and capitalization rates. 
 Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the real estate assets identified for further analysis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no impairment loss has been recognized on real estate assets. 
 Given the Company s evaluation of possible indicators of impairment of real estate assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future occupancy levels, rental rates, and capitalization rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's undiscounted future cash flows analysis and assessment of expected remaining holding period required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 64 

Table of Contents 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of real estate assets for possible indicators of impairment included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s analysis for impairment indicators, including the identification of impairment indicator properties and the valuation methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions used by management to determine fair value measurements. 
 We audited management s impairment indicator analysis by: 
 Evaluating management's process for identifying impairment indicators and whether management appropriately considered the examples of impairment indicators provided within the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment . 
 Conducting independent market analysis to determine if there were additional indicators of impairment not identified by management. 
 Conducting inquiries of property management, leasing, asset management, and other departments outside of the accounting department to determine if there might be additional indicators of impairment not identified by management. 
 Performing site visits for select properties to assess the presence of any physical nonfinancial indications of impairment that may exist but were not identified by management. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated management s fair value estimates for various properties that exhibited indicators of impairment by: 
 Evaluating whether the valuation method used was in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . 
 Evaluating the undiscounted future cash flows analysis, including estimates of future occupancy levels, rental rates, and capitalization rates, in addition to the assessment of expected remaining holding period for each real estate asset with possible impairment indicators by (1) evaluating the source information and assumptions used by management and (2) testing the mathematical accuracy of the undiscounted future cash flows analysis. 
 Investments in Real Estate - Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had acquired investments in real estate with an aggregate purchase price of 191.7 million. The Company accounted for these acquisitions as asset acquisitions. Accordingly, the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated, based on relative fair value, to land, buildings and improvements, in-place leases, above or below market leases, and other intangible assets. The method for determining relative fair value varied depending on the type of asset or liability and involved management making significant estimates related to assumptions such as future cash flows, discount rates, and costs during the expected lease-up periods. 
 Given the relative fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates related to assumptions such as future cash flows, discount rates, and costs during hypothetical lease-up periods, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for investments in real estate included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase price allocation, including management s controls over the identification of real estate assets, and the valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology, (2) current market data, (3) cost to replace certain assets, and (4) assumptions used in the discounted cash flows, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing our estimates to those used by management. 
 We assessed the reasonableness of management s projections of rental revenue by comparing the assumptions used in the projections to external market sources, in-place lease agreements, historical data, and results from other areas of the audit.

 For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had acquired investments in real estate with an aggregate purchase price of 191.7 million. The Company accounted for these acquisitions as asset acquisitions. Accordingly, the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated, based on relative fair value, to land, buildings and improvements, in-place leases, above or below market leases, and other intangible assets. The method for determining relative fair value varied depending on the type of asset or liability and involved management making significant estimates related to assumptions such as future cash flows, discount rates, and costs during the expected lease-up periods. 
 Given the relative fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates related to assumptions such as future cash flows, discount rates, and costs during hypothetical lease-up periods, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for investments in real estate included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase price allocation, including management s controls over the identification of real estate assets, and the valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology, (2) current market data, (3) cost to replace certain assets, and (4) assumptions used in the discounted cash flows, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing our estimates to those used by management. 
 We assessed the reasonableness of management s projections of rental revenue by comparing the assumptions used in the projections to external market sources, in-place lease agreements, historical data, and results from other areas of the audit.

 states within the U.S., and we lease space to tenants primarily consisting of health systems, research and academic institutions, and various sized physician practices. We generate substantially all of our revenues from rents and rental-related activities, such as property and facilities management and other incidental revenues related to the operation of real estate. 
 Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow. In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing, building services and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions and developments of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage. Additionally, from time to time we consider, on an opportunistic basis, significant portfolio acquisitions that we believe fit our core business and we expect to enhance our existing portfolio. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the virus continued to spread throughout the United States and other countries across the world, Federal, state and local governments took various actions including the issuance of "stay-at-home" orders, social distancing guidelines and ordering the temporary closure of non-essential businesses to limit the spread of COVID-19. While many businesses have reopened and vaccinations are being distributed to limited groups of the general population based on need, the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for new strains of SARS-CoV-2 or entirely new types of viruses and/or global propagation of communicable disease continue to present risks to the Company and the future results of our operations. Should current and planned measures, including further development and delivery of vaccines and other measures intended to reduce or eliminate the spread of COVID-19, past and/or proposed economic stimulus, and other laws, acts and orders proposed or enacted by these various governmental agencies ultimately not be successful or limited in their efficacy, our business and the broader real estate industry may experience significant adverse consequences. These consequences include loss of revenues, increased expenses, difficulty in maintaining an active workforce, and constraints on our ability to secure capital or financing, among other factors.

 VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or where equity investors, as a group, lack one of the following: (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance; (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity; and (iii) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity. We consolidate our investment in VIEs when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is one that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. The HTALP operating partnership and our other joint venture arrangements are VIEs because the limited partners in those partnerships, although entitled to vote on certain matters, do not possess kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. Additionally, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of our VIEs. Accordingly, we consolidate our interests in the HTALP operating partnership and in our other joint venture arrangements. However, because we hold what is deemed a majority voting interest in the HTALP operating partnership and our other joint venture arrangements, it qualifies for the exemption from providing certain disclosure requirements associated with investments in VIEs. We will evaluate on an ongoing basis the need to consolidate entities based on the standards set forth in GAAP as described above.

 of rent with a payback period from three to once the deferral period has ended. Deferrals do not have an impact on cash flows over the lease term, rather, payments are made in different periods while the cash flows for the entirety of the lease term are the same. However, we have continued to recognize revenue and straight line revenue for amounts subject to deferral agreements in accordance with Topic 842. In total, we have approved deferral plans that total approximately million, of which approximately million have been repaid through December 31, 2020. 
 The second category is early renewals, where the Company renewed lease arrangements prior to their contractual expirations, providing concession at the commencement of the lease in exchange for additional term, on average approximately three years. This category is treated as a modification under Topic 842, with the existing balance of cumulative difference between rental income and payment amounts (existing straight line rent receivable) being recast over the new term, factoring in any changes attributable to the new lease arrangement and for which we performed a lease by lease analysis. Cash flows are impacted over the long term as customary free rent, at an average of three months in conjunction with these agreements, and is offset by substantively more term and/or increased rental rates. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company has entered into minimal new deferral arrangements or early renewal leases with substantive amounts of free rent or other forms of concession at the onset of the lease.

 Level 2 - Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments Debt 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, tenant and other receivables, restricted cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels. We will record any such transfers at the end of the reporting period in which a change of event occurs that results in a transfer. Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our cash flow hedges fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with these instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our cash flow hedge positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to their overall valuation. As a result, we have determined that our cash flow hedge valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For further discussion of the assumptions considered, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

 Additionally, we have outstanding forward sale arrangements pursuant to forward equity agreements, with anticipated net proceeds of million, with an average share price of , subject to adjustments as provided in the forward equity agreements. All of the arrangements mature by the middle of 2021. 
 To account for the forward equity agreement, we considered the accounting guidance governing financial instruments and derivatives and concluded that our forward equity agreement was not a liability as it did not embody obligations to repurchase our shares of common stock nor did it embody obligations to issue a variable number of shares for which the monetary value was predominately fixed, varying with something other than the fair value of the shares, or varying inversely in relation to our shares. We also evaluated whether the agreement met the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception to be accounted for as an equity instrument and concluded that the agreement can be classified as an equity contract based on the following assessment: (i) the agreement did not exercise contingencies were based on observable markets or indices besides those related

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately and , respectively, weighted-average incremental shares of our common stock were excluded from the computation of our weighted-average shares - diluted, as the impact was anti-dilutive. 
 We include unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. The resulting classes are our common stock and restricted stock. Our forward equity agreement is not considered a participating security and, therefore, is not included in the computation of earnings per share using the two-class method. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, all of our earnings were distributed and the calculated earnings per share amount would be the same for all classes.

In addition, the board of directors of HTA (the board of directors may amend the Charter from time to time, with the approval of a majority of the entire board of directors and without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that HTA has authority to issue. 
 Under Maryland law, HTA s stockholders are generally not personally liable for HTA s debts and obligations solely as a result of their status as stockholders.

 All shares of HTA s common stock (the common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and voting. Subject to the Charter restrictions on the transfer and ownership of HTA s stock and the preferential rights of holders of any other class or series of HTA s stock, distributions may be made to the holders of the common stock if, as and when authorized by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Shares of common stock generally have no preemptive, preferential exchange, conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws, by contract or by the restrictions in the Charter. Holders of shares of common stock have no appraisal rights unless the board of directors determines that appraisal rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of stock, to one or more transactions occurring after the date of such 

determination in connection with which stockholders would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights.

Except as may be provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of common stock will possess exclusive voting power. Holders of all classes of common stock will vote together as a single class. 
 Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot amend its charter, consolidate or merge with, or convert to, another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or dissolve unless the action is advised by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. As permitted by Maryland law, the Charter provides that any of these actions may be approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. In addition, all other matters to be voted on by stockholders, other than a contested election of directors (in which case directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election of directors present in person or by proxy at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present) and amendment of the Bylaws by stockholders (which requires approval by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter), must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by stockholders, voting together as a single class, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, subject to any voting rights granted to holders of any then outstanding preferred stock. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of HTA s directors. 
 Power to Reclassify Unissued Shares of Stock 
 The Charter authorizes the board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock into other classes or series of shares of stock, so long as the aggregate number of all shares of all classes or series of stock that the board of directors has authority to issue does not exceed the total number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock as provided in the Charter. Prior to the issuance of shares of each class or series, the board of directors is required by Maryland law and by the Charter to set, subject to the Charter restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares of stock, the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption for each class or series. Therefore, the board of directors 
 2 

could authorize the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for HTA s shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of HTA s stockholders. No shares of preferred stock are presently outstanding, and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 
 Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares of Common Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Common and Preferred Stock 
 We believe that the power of the board of directors to amend the Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series, to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock and thereafter to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. The additional classes or series, as well as the shares of common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by HTA s stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or market system on which HTA s securities may be listed or traded. Therefore, the board of directors could authorize HTA to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for HTA s shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of HTA s stockholders. 
 Preferred Stock 
 The Charter authorizes the board of directors to designate and issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, and to establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of each class or series of preferred stock so issued. Because the board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of each class or series of preferred stock, it may afford the holders of any class or series of preferred stock preferences, powers and rights senior to the rights of holders of common stock. If HTA ever created and issued preferred stock with a distribution preference over common stock, payment of any distribution preferences of outstanding preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of distributions on the common stock. Further, holders of preferred stock are normally entitled to receive a liquidation preference in the event HTA liquidates, dissolves or winds up before any payment is made to the common stockholders, likely reducing the amount common stockholders would otherwise receive upon such an occurrence. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of HTA s securities, or the removal of incumbent management. The board of directors has no present plans to issue any preferred stock, but may do so at any time in the future without stockholder approval. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Shares 
 3 

In order for us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT ), not more than 50 of HTA s outstanding shares may be owned by any five or fewer individuals during the last half of any taxable year. In addition, the outstanding shares must be owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. We may prohibit certain acquisitions and transfers of shares so as to ensure our continued qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). However, we cannot assure you that this prohibition will be effective. 
 The Charter contains a limitation on ownership that prohibits any individual, entity or group from directly or indirectly acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 9.8 of the value of HTA s then aggregate outstanding shares of stock of any class or series (which includes common stock and any preferred stock HTA may issue) or more than 9.8 of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of HTA s then outstanding common stock. 
 Any attempted transfer of HTA s stock which, if effective, would result in HTA s stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be null and void. Any attempted transfer of HTA s stock which, if effective, would result in violation of the ownership limits discussed above or in HTA being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT will cause the number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries, and the proposed transferee will not acquire any rights in the shares. The automatic transfer will be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the transfer. We will designate a trustee of the share trust that will not be affiliated with us. We will also name one or more charitable organizations as a beneficiary of the share trust. Shares-in-trust will remain issued and outstanding shares and will be entitled to the same rights and privileges as all other shares of the same class or series. The trustee will receive all distributions on the shares-in-trust and will hold such distributions in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. The trustee will vote all shares-in-trust during the period they are held in trust and, subject to Maryland law, will have the authority to rescind as void any vote cast by the proposed transferee prior to our discovery that the shares have been transferred to the share trust and to recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. 
 The trustee of the trust will be empowered to sell the shares-in-trust to a qualified person selected by the trustee and to distribute to the applicable prohibited owner an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sales proceeds received by the trust for such shares-in-trust or (2) (A) if the prohibited owner was a transferee for value, the price paid by the prohibited owner for such shares-in-trust or (B) if the prohibited owner was not a transferee or was a transferee but did not give value for the shares-in-trust, the market price on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in trust. In addition, all shares-in-trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that created such shares-in-trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price of such shares at the time of such devise or gift) and (2) the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer. The trustee or we may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions that have been paid to the prohibited owner and are 
 4 

owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any amount received by the trustee in excess of the amount to be paid to the prohibited owner will be distributed to the beneficiary of the trust. 
 Any person who acquires shares in violation of the foregoing restrictions or who would have owned shares that resulted in a transfer to any such trust is required to give immediate written notice to us of such event. Any person who proposes or attempts such a transaction must give us at least 15 days prior written notice. Such person shall provide to us such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such transfer on our qualification as a REIT. 
 The foregoing restrictions continue to apply until the board of directors determines it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to, or to continue to, qualify as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for REIT qualification. 
 The board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the limitation on ownership of more than 9.8 of the value of HTA s then aggregate outstanding shares of stock of any class or series (which includes common stock and any preferred stock HTA may issue) or more than 9.8 of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of HTA s then outstanding common stock. However, the board of directors may not exempt any person whose ownership of HTA s outstanding stock would result in HTA being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. In order to be considered by the board of directors for exemption, a person also must not own, directly or indirectly, an interest in any of our tenants (or a tenant of any entity which we own or control) that would cause us to own, directly or indirectly, more than a 9.9 interest in the tenant. The person seeking an exemption must represent to the satisfaction of the board of directors that it will not violate these two restrictions. The person also must agree that any violation or attempted violation of these restrictions will result in the automatic transfer of the shares of stock causing the violation to the share trust. 
 Any stockholder of record who owns more than 5.0 (or such lower level as required by the Code and the regulations thereunder) of the outstanding shares during any taxable year will be asked to deliver a statement or affidavit setting forth the name and address of such record owner, the number of shares beneficially owned by such stockholder, a description of the manner in which such shares are held and such additional information regarding the beneficial ownership of the shares as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such actual or beneficial ownership on our qualification as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limits. In addition, any person who is a beneficial owner or constructive owner of shares of our stock and any person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding shares of our stock for a beneficial owner or constructive owner must, on request, disclose to us in writing such information as we may request in order to determine our status as a REIT or to comply, or determine our compliance, with the requirements of any taxing or governmental authority. 
 Number of Directors Vacancies 
 The Charter provides that the number of directors will be six, which number may be increased or decreased in accordance with the Bylaws, provided that the total number of directors will not be 
 5 

fewer than three, nor more than 15. The Bylaws provide that a majority of HTA s entire board of directors may at any time increase or decrease the number of directors, provided that the total number of directors will not be fewer than the minimum number required by the MGCL or the Charter, nor more than 15. Currently there are eight directors serving on the board of directors. 
 The Charter and Bylaws provide that, except as may be provided by the board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of stock, any and all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any individual elected to fill such vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Charter provides that independent directors will nominate replacements for vacancies among the independent directors positions. 
 Annual Elections 
 Each of HTA s directors is elected by HTA s stockholders to serve for a one-year term and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. Directors in uncontested elections are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a duly called meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, and directors in contested elections are elected by a plurality of all votes cast. 
 Removal of Directors 
 The Charter provides that, subject to the rights, if any, of holders of any class or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be removed by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. 
 Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders 
 The Charter and Bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by the board of directors, the independent directors, the chairman of the board of directors or HTA s president or chief executive officer and must be called by HTA s secretary to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting (subject to the stockholders compliance with certain procedures set forth in the Bylaws). 
 Action by Stockholders 
 According to the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a meeting of stockholders duly called at which a quorum is present shall be required to elect a director in uncontested elections, and a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter which may properly come before a meeting, unless more than a majority of votes cast is 
 6 

required by the MGCL, the Charter or the Bylaws. These provisions, combined with the requirements of the Bylaws regarding advance notice of nominations and other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders discussed below and the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders discussed above, may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal. Common stockholders may take action without a meeting only if a unanimous consent setting forth the action is given in writing or by electronic transmission by each common stockholder entitled to vote on the matter. 
 Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and Stockholder Proposals 
 The Bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by stockholders may be made only (i) pursuant to our notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice by such stockholder as provided for in the Bylaws and at the time of the annual meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and who has complied with the advance notice procedures and provided the information required by the Bylaws. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in the notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors at a special meeting may be made only (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) provided that the special meeting has been called in accordance with the Bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice by such stockholder as provided for in the Bylaws and at the time of the special meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice provisions and provided the information required by the Bylaws. 
 The purpose of requiring stockholders to give HTA advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford the board of directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such nominees or business. Although the Bylaws do not give the board of directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to HTA and its stockholders. 
 Approval of Extraordinary Corporate Actions, Amendment of Charter 
 Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot amend its charter, consolidate or merge with, or convert to, another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or dissolve unless the action is declared advisable by the board of directors and 
 7 

approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. As permitted by Maryland law, the Charter provides that any of these actions may be approved by the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. 
 
 Proxy Access 
 The Bylaws include provisions permitting, subject to certain eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements, qualifying stockholders, or a qualifying group of no more than 20 stockholders, who have maintained continuous ownership of at least three percent of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock for at least three years to require us to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders a number of director nominees not to exceed the greater of two nominees or 20 percent of the number of directors up for election. 
 Amendment of Bylaws 
 The board of directors has the power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of the Bylaws and to make new Bylaws. In addition, stockholders may alter or repeal any provision of the Bylaws and adopt new Bylaws, in each case to the extent permitted by and consistent with the Charter, the Bylaws and applicable law, with the approval of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. 
 No Stockholder Rights Plan 
 HTA has no stockholder rights plan. In the future, HTA does not intend to adopt a stockholder rights plan unless HTA s stockholders approve in advance the adoption of a plan or, if adopted by the board of directors, HTA submits the stockholder rights plan to HTA s stockholders for a ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or the plan will terminate. 
 Business Combinations 
 Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (defined as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation), or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, in either case after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of stock, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in 
 8 

advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. The board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance with any terms and conditions determined by it. 
 Any such business combination entered into after the five-year prohibition must be recommended by the board of directors of such corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected, unless, among other conditions, the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. 
 These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between HTA and any other person or entity from the business combination provisions of the MGCL, provided that such business combination is first approved by the board of directors. 
 As a result, any person may be able to enter into business combinations with HTA that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders without compliance by HTA with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. If this resolution is repealed, or the board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of HTA and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 The MGCL provides that holders of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved at a special meeting by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock of a corporation in respect of which any of the following persons is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of the corporation in the election of directors (i) a person who makes or proposes to make a control share acquisition, (ii) an officer of the corporation or (iii) an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power (i) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share 
 9 

acquisition means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses), may compel the board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or, if a meeting of stockholders is held at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved, as of the date of the meeting. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition. 
 The control share acquisition statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transactions or to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. 
 The Bylaws exempt any and all acquisitions of shares of HTA s stock from the control share acquisition statute. According to the Bylaws, this exemption may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided in any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent share acquisition. 
 Certain Elective Provisions of Maryland Law 
 Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and at least three independent directors who are not officers or employees of the corporation or affiliated with an acquiring person, to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any of (i) a classified board, (ii) a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director, (iii) a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors, (iv) a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred, or (v) a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to Subtitle 8, HTA has elected that, except as may be provided by the board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of stock, any and all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors 
 10 

do not constitute a quorum, and any individual elected to fill such vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. Through provisions in the Charter and Bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, HTA requires, unless called by the board of directors, HTA s independent directors, the chairman of the board of directors or HTA s president or chief executive officer, the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders to call a special meeting to act on such matter. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the board of directors, HTA is prohibited from classifying the board under Subtitle 8 unless stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors approve a proposal to repeal such resolution by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. However, the board of directors could elect to provide for any of the remaining provisions. 
 Anti-Takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Charter and Bylaws 
 The provisions of the MGCL, the Charter and the Bylaws described above could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of HTA that might involve a premium price for holders of the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of HTA s stockholders. Likewise, if the board of directors were to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL or certain of the provisions of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL or if the provision in the Bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were amended or rescinded, these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects. 
 Interested Director and Officer Transactions 
 Pursuant to the MGCL, a contract or other transaction between HTA and a director or between HTA and any other corporation or other entity in which any of HTA s directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or interest, the presence of such director at the meeting at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the director s vote in favor thereof, if 
 the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors, and the board of directors or such committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum 
 the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to HTA s stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote, excluding votes cast by the interested director or corporation or other entity or 
 the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to HTA. 
 11 

Purchase and Lease of Assets . The Charter provides that HTA may purchase or lease assets from an officer or director or affiliate thereof upon a finding by a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction that such transaction is fair and reasonable to HTA and at a price no greater than the cost of the asset to such officer, director or affiliate thereof or, if the price to HTA is in excess of such cost, that substantial justification for such excess exists and such excess is reasonable. In no event shall the purchase price of any property to HTA exceed its current appraised value. In addition, the Charter provides that an officer, director or affiliate thereof may purchase or lease assets from HTA only upon a finding by a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction that such transaction is fair and reasonable to HTA and at a price no less than its current appraised value. 
 Other Transactions . The Charter also provides that we will not engage in any other transaction with an officer, director or affiliate thereof unless a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in such transaction approve such transaction as fair and reasonable to HTA and on terms and conditions not less favorable to HTA than those available from unaffiliated third parties. The Charter prohibits HTA from making loans to an officer, director or affiliate thereof except certain mortgages or loans to HTA s wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, HTA s officers and directors and any affiliates thereof may not make loans to HTA, or to joint ventures in which HTA is a co-venturer, unless approved by a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in such transaction as fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to HTA than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 
 Related Party Transactions Policy . HTA s related party transactions policy is included as part of HTA s code of ethics. Under HTA s code of ethics, all transactions involving directors, officers and employees involving a conflict of interest must be approved by a majority of the board of directors (including a majority of the disinterested independent directors) as fair and reasonable to HTA and on terms not less favorable to HTA than those available from third parties, even if less than a quorum. Where appropriate in the judgment of the disinterested directors, the board of directors may obtain a fairness opinion or engage independent counsel to represent the interests of non-affiliated security holders, although the board of directors will have no obligation to do so. 
 Indemnification and Limitation of Directors and Officers Liability 
 Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. The Charter contains a provision that eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. 
 The Charter and Bylaws provide that, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, HTA is obligated to indemnify any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while a director or officer of HTA and at our request, serves or has served 
 12 

another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner, member, manager or trustee, from and against any claim or liability to which that individual may become subject or which that individual may incur by reason of his or her service in any such capacity and to pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification. 
 The Charter and Bylaws also permit HTA to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of HTA in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent of our company or a predecessor of our company. 
 The MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the Charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that 
 the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty 
 the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or 
 in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. 
 However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. A court may order indemnification if it determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification, even though the director or officer did not meet the prescribed standard of conduct or was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. However, indemnification for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation, or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, is limited to expenses. 
 In addition, the MGCL permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation s receipt of 
 a written affirmation by the director or officer of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and 
 13 

a written undertaking by the director or officer or on the director s or officer s behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct. 
 Insofar as the foregoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, officers or persons controlling HTA for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), HTA has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
 HTA has entered into indemnification agreements with each of HTA s directors and executive officers whereby HTA indemnifies such directors and executive officers against all expenses and liabilities, and agrees to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding if such director or executive officer is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, subject to limited exceptions. These indemnification agreements also provide that upon an application for indemnity by a director or executive officer to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, such court may order HTA to indemnify such director or executive officer. 
 REIT Qualification 
 The Charter provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate HTA s REIT election, without approval of HTA s stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in HTA s best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT.
